  <p>
   In addition to its influenza research, Sanofi Pasteur has about 20 vaccines in its R&amp;D pipeline, including improvements to its existing vaccines, as well as new  vaccines for some forms of cancer, dengue fever, HIV, and rabies. About a dozen are in development or have been submitted for approval. In 2013 the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application for the licensing of its four-strain influenza vaccine Fluzone Quadrivalent. The following year, similar approval was given to the Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent vaccine.
