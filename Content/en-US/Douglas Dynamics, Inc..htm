   "Let it snow, Let it snow, Let it snow!" It's a song made to order for Douglas Dynamics. The company makes snowplows and sand-and-salt spreading equipment for light trucks. One of the biggest manufacturers in its industry, the company sells its lineup under brand names Western, Fisher, Snowex, Turfex, Sweepex, and Blizzard via equipment distributors. It also supplies related parts and accessories. End customers are mainly snowplowers in the business of removing snow and ice for municipalities and commercial and private owners in the Midwest, East, and Northeast US, as well as throughout Canada. Douglas traces its roots back to the 1970s.

  <p>
   Douglas has manufacturing facilities in Milwaukee; Rockland, Maine; and Madison Heights, Michigan. Most of its distributors are located throughout the snow belt regions in North America (primarily the Midwest, East and Northeast regions of the US as well as all provinces of Canada) and also cater to many parts of Europe and China.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a distributor network primarily to professional snowplowers who are contracted to remove snow and ice from commercial, municipal, and residential areas. Douglas spent $4.5 million, $4.3 million, and $3 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, on advertising expenses.

  <p>
   Douglas experienced unprecedented growth for 2015, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $400 million and profits reaching $44 million, another company milestone. In addition, its cash flow from operations jumped 5% in 2015. The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by a 37% surge in equipment sales and an additional $96 million in sales from a previous acquisition.

  <p>
   Douglas has cultivated sales by gradually expanding its distribution relationships and by purchasing related businesses. In 2014 it acquired Henderson Products, a North American manufacturer of customized, turnkey snow and ice control equipment for heavy-duty trucks focused on government departments, for $95 million. The purchase strengthened its market position in snow and ice control across all truck segments and created new opportunities for growth in attractive adjacent markets. It also contributed to Douglas' milestone revenue totals for 2015.
