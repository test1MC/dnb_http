  <p>
   Cox Enterprises formed the group to save costs and leverage sales, research, and digital functions across its newspaper, television, and radio businesses. An example of such efforts includes using reporters interchangeably and employing collaboration across all media platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Cox Media was accepted into the Google AdWords Premier SMB Partner (PSP) Program. The partnership furthers Cox Media's ability to provide digital marketing solutions for its local and regional advertising clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy includes focusing on larger markets, cross-media collaboration, and heightened impact in fewer markets.
