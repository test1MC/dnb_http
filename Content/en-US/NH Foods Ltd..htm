   NH Foods (formerly Nippon Meat Packers) is one of Japan's top beef-, pork-, and chicken-processing firms. Its meat business includes all stages of production, from raising the animals and making their feed to processing the meat and delivering it to customers. NH Foods sells processed hams, sausages, and deli meats under a variety of brand names including SCHAU ESSEN, Mori-no-Kaori, and Winny. Its fresh meat business includes chicken and other poultry, beef, and pork. The company owns some 130 farms, nearly 95 plants, about 400 sales and logistics facilities, and four R&amp;D labs. It operates in about a dozen countries, although Japan is its largest market.

   meat business go down in flames due to scandal didn't steer NMP to the high road. In 2002 NMP executives admitted to fraudulently mislabeling foreign meat to receive government subsidies for domestic meat.

  <p>
   As that scandal quieted, NMP acquired Hoko Fishing, a seafood and frozen food processor. However, in 2003 scandal erupted again when one of NMP's beef subsidiaries was found guilty of fraudulent rating.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan banned all imports of US beef in following the discovery of one cow with BSE. The ban drove up prices on beef, while an outbreak of avian flu in Asia drove up the price of poultry, causing NMP's profits to increase nicely during 2004.
