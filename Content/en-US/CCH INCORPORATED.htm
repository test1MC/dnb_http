   The Corporation Trust Company was formed in 1892 and began providing state-required legal representation to such early customers as U.S. Steel, AT&amp;T, and Prudential. When the Tariff Act of 1913 was introduced, the company began publishing the Income Tax Reporter, providing information on this first federal income tax law, including the law's text, related administrative decisions, and other documents. The company began publications covering the new Federal Trade Commission and Federal Reserve Board in 1914, and subscriptions to the Reporter grew as tax laws were amended in 1916 and 1917.
  </p>
  <p>
   William Kix Miller had started publishing import/export and income tax guides as Commerce Clearing House (CCH) in Chicago in 1892, and banker Oakleigh Thorne bought into CCH in 1907. Both Corporation Trust and Commerce Clearing House grew in the 1920s, reporting on the myriad new state, local, corporate, and inheritance tax laws. In 1927 the two companies merged as Commerce Clearing House, based in Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCH began buying independent state tax publications and utility and industrial indices and digests. In 1933 KixMiller sold his interest, and in the 1930s the company started new publications covering New Deal regulations and agencies. In 1945 CCH created a Canadian subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1950s the company published the Corporation Law Guide and the New York Stock Exchange Guide. CCH went public in 1961. In 1965 CCH bought a Mexican tax and business law publisher and Facts on File (both sold in 1993) and formed Computax. CCH bought more companies in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Washington Service Bureau (1979), a software operation (1980), and Trademark Research Corporation (1983). CCH became so well versed in tax law that its largest customer was the US Internal Revenue Service. In 1986 the company moved its headquarters from Chicago to Riverwoods, Illinois. CCH acquired four companies involved in tax processing in 1988 and 1989 and two microcomputer software companies in 1990. CCH ACCESS, an electronic research system, was introduced in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Oakleigh Thorne, the patriarch's great-great-grandson, took on the responsibility of revitalizing the company. He cut 1,200 jobs and started the transition from mainframe computers to PCs. The company bought software developer Optima Technologies in 1991 (sold 1993) and launched Standard Federal Tax Reporter on CD-ROM in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 CCH bought most of the tax services of Matthew Bender &amp; Co. and sold National Quotation Bureau (securities information). Also in 1993 the company introduced HR Assistant human resource software to enable human resources professionals to make policy decisions in compliance with labor law.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deciding to forego short-term profits for long-term goals, CCH restructured internally in 1993 and 1994, indicating a change in hierarchy by streamlining senior management (dropping the job titles of most senior managers). The company also consolidated printing operations, moving all printing to a Florida location, and cut jobs. In 1994 the company introduced Tax Assistant software, which provides research, analysis, and compliance tools for tax preparers.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCH introduced an online service for small businesses, called CCH Business Owner's Toolkit, in 1995. The following year, the company was bought by Wolters Kluwer, one of Europe's largest legal and tax publishers. "A very friendly, very big fish" is the way Wolters Kluwer chairman Cor Brakel described CCH after the Dutch publisher landed the company for $1.9 billion. The Thorne family's 57% stake went to the fishing Dutchmen, and Oakleigh Thorne was replaced as CEO by Hugh Yarrington.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yarrington moved up the ranks in Wolters Kluwer in 1998 and was replaced at CCH by Rebecca Hensley in 1999. She grew the company through a number of smaller acquisitions including Banker Systems and PACS Software (both in 1999), and several product lines from BNA (2002). Hensley resigned and Mike Sabbatis became the next CEO in 2002.
