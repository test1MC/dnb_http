   The accent at this Boeing subsidiary is decidedly British.
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   , the world's largest aerospace company, does business in the UK -- where it spends more than $1 billion annually on the country's aerospace industry -- through subsidiaries such as Boeing United Kingdom Limited, tasked with overseeing Boeing's UK activities. Included among those operations is Boeing Defence UK, which serves the UK Ministry of Defence and the US military by providing support for the Apache and Chinook helicopters, C-17 aircraft, and other technologies. Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the UK provides finance, leasing, and service for commercial aircraft from its operational headquarters near London's Heathrow Airport.

   Boeing Defence UK was established in 2007. A major unit of that operation, Boeing UK Rotorcraft Support, was then created in 2009. Boeing uses a performance-based logistics (PBL) program, Apache Integrated Operational Support (AIOS), to provide service for the British Army's some 70 Apache helicopters. For the British Army's some 40 Chinook helicopters, Boeing provides a similar service, Chinook Through Life Customer Support, a program that commits to a set level of readiness instead of awaiting ad-hoc orders for parts or services when needed.

   About 25% of the 787 Dreamliner, powered by the
   <company id="112424">
    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   Trent 1000 engine, is made in the UK. The Dreamliner is constructed with a large amount of plastics, which make it more fuel efficient (saving 20% over comparably sized aircraft).
  </p>

   In 2001 Boeing UK helped found the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Center (AMRC), which provides many other industrial companies besides with Boeing with services that include technology trials, laboratory research, and apprentice training.
