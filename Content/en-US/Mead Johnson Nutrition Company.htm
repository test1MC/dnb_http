   Mead Johnson Nutrition helps babies grow up healthy. The company specializes in developing and manufacturing nutritional products for infants and children. It distributes its 70-plus products to more than 50 countries. Mead Johnson's Enfamil line of infant formulas is its most visible consumer brand. Other products in its portfolio include Sustagen and Lactum -- two fortified beverages for children -- and Nutramigen, a nutritional supplement for children with dairy allergies. Besides babies, the company markets nutritional supplements for use by pregnant and breastfeeding moms. Mead Johnson also produces specialty nutritional products for premature infants and infants with metabolic and digestive disorders.

  <p>
   Mead Johnson operates its business through three segments: Asia (50% of sales in 2015), North America/Europe (31%), and Latin America (19%). The company's key product lines are infant formula and children's nutrition, representing 59% and 39% of sales, respectively. Its Enfa brands, which span both lines, accounts for about 80% of revenue.

  <p>
   The company maintains manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe, and North America, but also uses third-party manufacturers for some of its supplies. Mead Johnson conducts its research and development activities from facilities in Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore, Brazil, Thailand, China, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nearly three-fourths of the company's sales come from outside of the US.

   The company markets its products to health care professionals and parents regionally in North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, complying with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in its advertising. It spends its ad dollars on TV, print, and other consumer media, with an increasing focus on social and other direct media. Where permissible by regulation, Mead Johnson promotes its products through product trial and education to health care workers and consumers. The company's products are sold to wholesalers and retailers worldwide. Primary customers for Mead Johnson include global retailer

    Wal-Mart Stores

   (12% of sales in 2015) and supply chain logistics company

  <p>
   Revenue had been on the rise since 2012 but fell 8% to $4.1 billion in 2015. This was largely due to a 10% decline in Asia and a 13% decline in Latin America. In China, growing demand for products which are purchased through digital channels (of which Mead Johnson has lower representation) contributed to the decline in Asia. Lower sales prices driven by lower dairy costs as well as adverse foreign exchange rates hurt earnings in China, Thailand, and Malaysia. In Latin America, sales were hurt by the weakening of the Mexican peso, Venezuelan bolivar, and Brazilian real. Government restrictions in Venezuela, related to the release of US dollars, also impacted sales volume there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income had also been rising, but in 2015 it fell 9% to $653 million. This was largely due to the lower revenue, as well as an increase in provisions for income taxes. Cash flow from operations rose 15% to $910 million due to changes in assets and other factors.

  <p>
   Mead Johnson is focused on growing its core business by building brand loyalty and by developing new products. In 2015 it spent 3% of its revenue on R&amp;D activities; it also began expanding an Indiana facility to boost production. Because the markets for its products in North American and Western Europe are fairly mature (and birth rates in those regions are flat or falling), the company generally finds its fastest growth in Asia and Latin America. It also plans to expand into regions such as Eastern Europe, South America, and other regions where the markets are still emerging.
  </p>
  <p>
   To these ends, Mead Johnson has a joint venture with Argentinean dairy producer SanCor. Mead Johnson owns 90% of the venture, which produces and sells infant and child nutrition products in Argentina and other countries in the Southern Cone region of South America. In 2014, it built a new manufacturing and technology center in Singapore to serve the growing Asia region. It also completed the construction of its first spray dryer in Singapore.

   The company has long been seen as an attractive acquisition target, as companies look to expand operations in China (despite a contraction of its sales in that market due to increased competition). In 2017

   , the maker of such items as Lysol cleaner and Mucinex cold medicine, agreed to buy Mead Johnson for $16.6 billion. Reckitt plans to boost the formula maker's brand and performance in China and other emerging markets.

   Mead Johnson was a unit of
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   (BMS) before going public in 2009 through a $720 million IPO. BMS gradually reduced its ownership, then sold off the remainder of its shares in 2009 to focus on its biopharmaceutical operations. Mead Johnson used the IPO proceeds, in part, to pay off unspecified financial obligations to BMS.
