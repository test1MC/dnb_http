        <p>
   Linden Capital Partners bought SeraCare in 2012. Going private has allowed the company to reward patient shareholders who stuck with it through tough times. While the majority of the company's sales are in the US, with the backing of private equity, the company plans to boost its sales in other markets

   SeraCare serves several customer types, including blood banks, hospitals, research laboratories, and diagnostic test kit manufacturers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sells its products in the US through its own direct sales force and uses a network of distributors to peddle its products abroad. SeraCare aims to grow its international sales by adding sales and distribution teams and by seeking additional CE markings on more products. CE marking on a product in the EU is similar to FDA approval in the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   SeraCare's product growth strategy hinges upon introducing new products to high value market segments. It develops products in-house, acquires them through product-licensing agreements, or purchases them outright through traditional acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is focused specifically on expanding its business in the fields of molecular diagnostics, vaccine development, and cellular assays. In 2010, for example, SeraCare introduced half a dozen new products, including two differentiated, cryopreserved human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) products that serve as tools in life science research and drug development. Additionally, the company began marketing a number of new products in its ACCURUN portfolio of controls, such as controls to monitor and validate molecular diagnostic test performance for diagnosis of
   <em>
    Chlamydia trachomatis
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Neisseria gonorrhoeae (
   </em>
   which are the bacteria responsible for causing chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively). It also added to its viral research reagents with assays for detecting and differentiating influenza viruses with the launch of ACCUTYPE H1N1 to perform on FDA-issued devices that detect the H1N1 influenza virus as well as other assays that detect H1N1 viral RNA.
