   Sanderson Farms has steadily scratched its way up the pecking order. As the third-largest poultry processor in the US, it produces, processes, sells, and distributes fresh, chill-pack, and frozen chicken (whole and cut-up) under the Sanderson Farms label. In addition to buying chicks from some 210 breeders, the company contracts with about 900 independent chicken farmers, who raise the breeder flocks for Sanderson. Its prepared-foods business processes, sells, and distributes partially cooked or marinated chicken. Customers are food retailers, distributors, and restaurants and foodservice operators. The company processed more than 507 million chickens in 2016.
  </p>

  <p>
   By product, Sanderson Farms generates over 50% of its revenue from fresh bulk pack chicken sales. Chill packs bring in 35% of sales, and frozen chicken products 5%. It has ten hatcheries, eight feed mills, and eleven processing plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates its business through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Production Division) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Processing Division). Its production unit, which produces chickens to the broiler stage, operates in Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. The processing unit, which focuses on processing, selling, and distributing chickens, boasts facilities in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanderson Farms has two poultry operations North Carolina. Its Kinston facility processes an estimated 1.25 million birds per week for the retail chill-pack market, and has a big bird deboning processing facility and hatchery, equipped for 9.7 million pounds of dressed chicken per week. Its second North Carolina poultry complex in St. Pauls has the capacity to process 1.25 million chickens per week.
  </p>
  <p>
   All in, Sanderson Farms processes annually over 507 million chickens to produce 3.8 billion dressed pounds. Its prepared chicken product line consists of about 70 institutional and consumer packaged partially cooked or marinated chicken items that are sold nationally and regionally primarily to distributors and foodservice operators.

  <p>
   Based in Mississippi, Sanderson Farms distributes its chicken products nationwide, as well as in Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Mexico, and the Caribbean. It generates upwards of 90% of its gross sales in the US, while its largest export markets are Mexico, China, and Russia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sanderson Farms markets its chicken products to national and regional supermarket chains, local grocers, and distributors located primarily in the Southeastern, Southwestern, Northeastern, and Western US. The company sells and distributes its products through sales personnel located at its corporate offices in Mississippi and through service representatives at each of its processing complexes and via independent food brokers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanderson Farms' sales to its ten largest customers represents around 55% of its total net sales, reflecting a fairly concentrated customer base. Sales to its single largest customer account for over 15% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep its brand in front of customers, Sanderson Farms advertising spend is increasing. A recent campaign was created to counter accusations of irresponsible antibiotic usage. It markets through television, radio and newspaper advertising, and point of purchase material.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sponsors a PGA Tour golf championship, the Sanderson Farms Championship, held every year in Mississippi. The winner walks away with a $4.2 million prize fund.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended October), sales were flat at $2.8 billion. A 7.2% decrease in the average price per pound of chicken mostly offset a 9.2% increase in the gross weight of poultry sold. Chicken prices were negatively impacted by domestic oversupply, as the 2015 Chinese import ban on US chicken left producers with a poultry surplus. A fall in US food service demand was also a contributing factor to price deflation. The increase in pounds of chicken sold was due to a combination of a 2.3% increase in average bird weight, and a 6.5% increase in numbers of chicken sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income declined for a second consecutive year, to $189.0 million, due to a 2.1% rise in the cost of sales. Cash from operating activities fell by 2% to $292.8 million, mostly due to lower market prices for poultry products and cash needed to fund inventory increases, set against a decrease in cash paid for income taxes.

  <p>
   While many chicken processors serve the small bird markets (comprising primarily fast-food purveyors), Sanderson Farms targets the retail and big bird deboning markets, which service the grocery and foodservice sectors. Therefore, the average weight of Sanderson's birds is often more than that of its competitors and its total production in pounds is greater, as well. The company reiterated in 2015 that the big bird deboning market has been the most profitable market for its company over most of the past decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep boosting its production capacity, which are key to growing sales, Sanderson Farms regularly adds to its collection of processing facilities. In 2017, for example, a new processing plant and waste water treatment facility (costing $139 million) went live in St. Pauls, North Carolina. The new site has the capacity to produce 1.25 million chickens per week. In 2015, a poultry complex came online in Palestine, Texas. It also produces 1.25 million chickens per week.
  </p>
  <p>
   Food safety is a growing concern throughout the food supply chain. As one of the few chicken processors building new plants, Sanderson has the opportunity to build in more sanitary handling methods and processes from the ground up.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, an increasingly vocal campaign to reduce the usage of antibiotics in chicken production saw a number of Sanderson Farms' competitors, including
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11187">
    Pilgrim's Pride
   </company>
   , pledge to cut down on usage. Sanderson Farms has responded by producing an advertising campaign specifically to defend its side on the issue.

  <p>
   Sanderson Farms began in 1947 when Dewey Sanderson started a Mississippi farm supply business to sell seed, feed, fertilizer, and other supplies. His sons Dewey Jr. and Joe Frank Sanderson joined the company in 1951, when it became Sanderson Brothers. It began breeding poultry and was incorporated four years later as Sanderson Brothers Farms. The company became vertically integrated with its 1961 purchase of broiler processor Miss Goldy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the company expanded, constructing new plants in Mississippi and acquiring facilities in Louisiana. Sanderson Farms expanded into the processed and prepared foods business with the 1986 acquisition of National Prepared Foods. It went public the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 1987 to 1992 the company expanded existing facilities, constructed new sites, and added shifts at processing facilities. Joe Jr. was named president and CEO in 1989. In 1993 Sanderson Farms built its second complete poultry-processing complex.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanderson Farms completed a $68 million poultry complex in 1997 in Texas' Brazos and Robertson Counties (eking out only a small profit as a result of the expense). Co-founder Joe died in 1998, and his son took the additional role of chairman. Dewey Jr. died in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Russian embargo on US poultry hit the Sanderson Farms' export business hard during 2002.
