   Does your cargo need a lift? Breeze-Eastern makes electric and hydraulic rescue hoist systems for helicopters, as well as cargo winches and tie-downs, hook systems, and weapons handling systems. Its external helicopter cargo hook systems range in capacity from 1,500 pounds to 36,000 pounds. The company's weapons-handling systems include hoists for missiles, and gearboxes for specialty weapons applications. It also offers overhaul/repair and engineering sales services. Breeze-Eastern caters mainly to the US government in addition to major aerospace manufacturers and airlines. In 2016 Breeze-Eastern was acquired by

        <p>

        <p>
   Breeze-Eastern's total sales in 2012 marked a new high ($84.9 million), increasing by more than 8% from 2011. However, total sales dropped 6% to nearly $80 million in 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   The decrease in 2013 was driven by lower product sales due to lower new equipment and spare parts volumes for hoists and winches and weapons handling. Service sales also fell due to lower demand for engineering weapons handling services.
  </p>
        <p>
   Earnings, which has wavered over the years, jumped 8% from $3.8 million in 2012 to nearly $4.1 million in 2013 as a result of lower operating expenses and engineering costs.

        <p>
   Breeze-Eastern estimates that it holds over 50% of the global market in rescue hoists and cargo hook systems. Although Breeze-Eastern intends to expand its position by focusing on its aerospace and defense-rich roster of customers as well as its established geographic markets, swings in global economic and geo-political conditions impact its performance.
