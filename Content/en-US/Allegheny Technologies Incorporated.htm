   Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI) is on a roll when it comes to producing metals. The company manufactures stainless and specialty steels, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium alloys, tungsten materials, and such exotic alloys as niobium and zirconium. The company's flat-rolled products (sheet, strip, and plate) accounted for 47% of its sales in 2015. Its high-performance metals unit produces metal bar, coil, foil, ingot, plate, rod, and wire. ATI's largest markets include the aerospace, chemical process, and oil and gas industries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ATI has plants and offices in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Internationally, the company leases and owns facilities in China (through a joint venture), France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and the UK. US sales accounted for 58% of total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ATI makes high-performance metal, flat-rolled, and engineered products. The company's High Performance Materials &amp; Components segment has titanium sponge production, melting operations, and production facilities that include processing and finishing operations all in the US. High Performance Materials &amp; Components accounted 53% of the company's total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also has US melting and finishing facilities for stainless steel and other flat-rolled specialty metals. The Flat Rolled Products segment (47%) produces converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium-based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and precision rolled Strip products, as well as grain-oriented electrical steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 about 55% by volume of its stainless sheet products were sold to independent service centers, which have slitting, cutting or other processing facilities, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's major markets are aerospace and defense, oil and gas/chemical process industry, electrical energy, medical, automotive, construction and mining, electronics, food equipment, and appliance, machine, and cutting tools. Outside of the US, the company's sales, marketing, and distribution efforts are supported by international marketing and distribution offices -- ATI Europe, ATI Europe Distribution, and ATI Asia -- or by independent representatives at various locations throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace &amp; Defense contributed 41% of ATI's 2015 revenues; oil and gas/chemical and hydrocarbon processing industry (14%); and electrical energy (10%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net revenues decreased by 12% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flat Rolled Products revenue declined due to lower sales across nearly all major end markets, due to both lower selling prices attributable to falling raw material surcharges included in transaction prices, and lower shipment volumes in many end markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   ATI's net loss increased by 14,436% mainly due to lower net revenues, noncash charges for goodwill and asset impairments, restructuring, inventory and other items and restructuring charges (long-lived asset impairment charges, facility idling costs, and employee severance charges).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company's operating cash inflow increased by 135% due to changes in working capital as a result of changes in accounts receivable and retirement benefits.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is focused on improving the market position by making strategic investments. That year ATI extended its long-term supply agreements for mill products and closed-die forgings with a major jet engine OEM. The new agreements enhance and solidify long-term strategic relationship and recognize integrated capabilities from raw materials (titanium sponge) through mill products to machined forgings for the most innovative next-generation jet engines, as well as for legacy engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company anticipates strong sales in the aerospace, oil and gas, and chemical processing markets. Those predictions are contingent on the fortunes of customers such as
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , who were scheduled to ramp up production of products such as the 787 Dreamliner and A380 jumbo jet. The company also anticipates record capital spending on deepwater oil and gas exploration and new technology to develop shale reserves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued its strategic focus on key high-value specialty products, including titanium and titanium alloys, precision castings and forgings, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys, zirconium and related alloys, and grain-oriented electrical steel.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Dynamic Flowform Corp. (renamed ATI Flowform Products), in a deal that added precision flowforming process technologies to ATI's capabilities to produce specialty materials parts and components. Flowforming produces thin-walled components in net or near-net shapes across multiple alloys systems, including nickel-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium alloys, zirconium alloys, and specialty and stainless alloys. Major markets for flowforming products are aerospace and defense, and oil and gas/chemical process industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also bought Oregon-based Hanard Machine, Inc., which conducts precision machining on parts and components made from titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, aluminum, specialty steel, and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Hanard's major markets are aerospace and defense, and oil and gas/chemical process industry. The business became ATI Cast Products, Salem Operations, part of ATI's titanium investment casting business, also located in Oregon.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ATI was formed from the 1996 merger of Teledyne and stainless steel producer Allegheny Ludlum.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allegheny Ludlum Steel began in 1938 when Allegheny Steel Company (founded in Pennsylvania in 1898) and Ludlum Steel Company (founded in New Jersey in 1854) merged. Allegheny Steel veteran W. F. Detwiler became Allegheny Ludlum Steel's first chairman. During WWII the company developed heat-resisting alloys for aircraft turbine engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war the focus was on stainless steel and flat-rolled silicon electrical steel used to make electrical transformers. In 1956 the company doubled its capacity for making specialty alloys and installed the industry's first semi-automated system for working hot steel. It expanded outside the US by opening a plant in Belgium in the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company adopted the name Allegheny Ludlum Industries in 1970 and, after diversifying, sold its specialty steel division in a management-led buyout that formed Allegheny Ludlum Steel (1980). In 1986 it became Allegheny Ludlum Corp. It went public in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henry Singleton and George Kozmetsky, former Litton Industries executives, invested $225,000 each in 1960 to found Teledyne to make electronic aircraft components. First year sales of $4.5 million grew to nearly $90 million by 1964. Kozmetsky left the firm in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Singleton, Teledyne bought more than 100 successful manufacturing and technology firms in defense-related areas such as engines, unmanned aircraft, specialty metals, and computers. Teledyne also moved into offshore oil-drilling equipment, insurance and finance, and the Water Pik line of oral-care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teledyne spun off its Argonaut Insurance unit in 1986 and left the insurance business entirely with its 1990 spinoff of Unitrin. Its defense businesses were caught in a 1989 fraud probe, and the company paid $4.4 million in restitution. In 1991 Teledyne consolidated its 130 operations into 21 companies. It paid a $13 million fine in 1995 on charges of knowingly selling zirconium to a Chilean arms manufacturer for use in cluster bombs sold to Iraq.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite Teledyne's rebuff of holding company WHX's 1994 takeover offer, in 1996 WHX came back with a new proposal that led to the $3.2 billion merger of Teledyne and Allegheny Ludlum in 1997. Also in 1997 CEO William Rutledge was succeeded by former Allegheny Ludlum CEO Richard Simmons. Allegheny and Bethlehem Steel entered into a bidding war for steelmaker Lukens. Bethlehem won but in 1998 granted exclusive access to or sold most of Lukens' stainless-steel operations to Allegheny. The company also bought UK-based Sheffield Forgemasters Group's aerospace division and titanium producer Oregon Metallurgical.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allegheny restructured to focus on specialty metals in 1999, changing its name to Allegheny Technologies. The company sold Ryan Aeronautical (aerial drones) to Northrop Grumman, its mining equipment business to Astec Industries, and its lift-truck-making business to Terex. It spun off its consumer oral-hygiene business as Water Pik Technologies and its remaining aerospace businesses as Teledyne Technologies. Lockheed Martin executive Thomas Corcoran became president and CEO in 1999 but abruptly resigned in late 2000. That same year the company bought Baker Hughes' tungsten carbide products unit. VC Robert Bozzone served as chairman and CEO until insider James Murdy was named CEO in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to cut costs, in 2001 Allegheny Technologies closed a plant in Pennsylvania, made workforce cuts, and sold its North American titanium distribution operations to management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company had another round of workforce cuts (around 275 employees), mostly in its flat-rolled products unit. The following year Allegheny Technologies formed a joint venture with Russian-based VSMPO AVISMA to make a range of commercially pure titanium products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patrick Hassey, a retired Alcoa EVP, took over as CEO in 2003 and became charirman as well the next year. He retired in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allegheny Technologies purchased J&amp;L Specialty Steel, one of its competitors, for an undisclosed price in 2004. Other buys that year included two plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio from
   <company id="103869">
    Arcelor
   </company>
   . Still it initiated cost-cutting efforts aimed at saving $200 million a year, announcing in 2004 cuts of more than 950 jobs at Allegheny Ludlum. The plants acquired from Arcelor lost more than 300 of their workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   To offset rapidly rising costs in raw materials, energy, health care, and transportation, the company increased prices on several of its metal grades. Those price increases helped ATI achieve record sales in 2006 and 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its specialty products portfolio, ATI acquired the Research and Compaction Metals divisions of
   <company id="110342">
    Crucible Materials
   </company>
   in 2009 for about $40 million. The company won the rights to the division at auction; Crucible entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier in 2009. ATI combined the units to form a new subsidiary called ATI Powder Metals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a strategic 2011 move to bolster its engineered product offerings, ATI acquired high-end manufacturer
   <company id="56399">
    Ladish
   </company>
   for some $897.6 million. Wisconsin-based Ladish produces advanced metal components for the jet engine, aerospace, and industrial markets. The acquisitions made ATI a fully integrated supplier, from raw material (for titanium) and melt through highly engineered technically complex parts, creating a more stable and sustainable supply chain for aerospace, defense and industrial markets. As a result, as a part of ATI, in 2012 Ladish reported its best revenue year ever.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 ATI signed a long-term sourcing agreement with
   <company id="57976">
    GE Aviation
   </company>
   for the supply of Rene 65 Alloy, a future-generation alloy, to create a cost-effective disc-quality product for use in jet engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2013 ATI sold its tungsten materials business to Kennametal for $605 million. This sale strengthened ATI's focus on core strategic businesses and emphasizes the technical, commercial and operating synergies between the High Performance Materials &amp; Components and Flat-Rolled Products businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company extended its long-term titanium products supply agreement with Boeing in a deal that covers value-added titanium mill products and provides opportunity for greater use of ATI's next-generation and advanced titanium alloys in both long product and flat-rolled product forms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 ATI restructured its Engineered Products segment as a result of selling of its tungsten materials business, and integrating the previously standalone specialty steel forgings business into ATI Ladish's forgings operations. In addition, to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs, ATI integrated its precision titanium and specialty alloy flat-rolled finishing business into ATI Allegheny Ludlum's specialty plate business. As a result, the specialty steel forgings business is included in ATI's High Performance Metals segment and the precision titanium and specialty alloy flat-rolled finishing business are in ATI's Flat-Rolled Products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   A newly constructed hot-rolling and processing facility for its Flat-Rolled business was completed in 2013 at its existing Brackenridge, Pennsylvania site.
