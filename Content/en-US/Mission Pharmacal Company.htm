   Mission Pharmacal's purpose, objective, and undertaking, if you will, is to make you feel better. The company makes prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) remedies for infection, kidney stones, and arthritis, as well as nutritional supplements. Mission's products include kidney stone preventer Urocit-K, dermatitis ointment Texacort, bacterial infection fighter Tindamax, and CitraNatal prescription prenatal vitamins. The company also offers third-party OTC, nutritional, and prescription manufacturing, packaging, and inventory management to pharmaceutical companies. Mission is owned and run by the founding Walsdorf family.

   The company's corporate headquarters are located in Boerne, Texas (northwest of San Antonio). Mission researches and develops new products at its facility in Boerne; it also provides its outsourcing services from its headquarters location. In addition to its Texas facilities, Mission also operates a research and development facility in the state of Washington and a commercial office in the Northeast corridor where there is a high concentration of companies in the pharmaceutical industry.

   The firm operates nationwide and distributes some products overseas through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies in markets it sees as desirable.

  <p>
   Mission's Alamo Pharma Services unit operates its women's health, urology, pediatrics, and dermatology sales teams; it operates directly and through outsourcing partnerships. The BioComp Pharma subsidiary is working to commercialize prescription generic drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though it conducts direct marketing operations in the US market, some international sales efforts are conducted through partners and distributors. Mission has a partnership agreement with

    Paladin Labs
   </company>
   granting the Canadian pharmaceutical company distribution rights to Urocit-K in that country, as well as a number of African countries. Mission has similar marketing agreements in Australia, Asia, Europe, and South America.

  <p>
   Along with growing its product lines through acquisitions and licensing, the company conducts extensive research. Mission's research is focused on the areas of women's health, urology, dermatology, and pediatrics. Mission considers its women's health offerings to be a key part of its product roster. To enhance internal R&amp;D programs, the company works to add to its portfolio through partnerships, licensing agreements, and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Mission introduced a portfolio of products for the long-term care applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Retrophin entered into a license agreement with Mission for US marketing rights to Thiola (tiopronin). In 2014 Mission and Europa Sports Products of Charlotte, North Carolina signed a deal for Europa to distribute Mission's COMPETE energy bites to fitness centers and select other retail outlets across the US.

  <p>
   In 2012 Mission Pharmacal launched Alamo Pharma Services as a wholly-owned subsidiary to operate its direct sales teams and offer third-party sales services to other drugmakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company acquired the prescription barrier cream Eletone Cream from Ferndale Healthcare. The product strengthened Mission's pediatric product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mission was founded in 1946 by the Walsdorf family. The family still owns and operates the business.
