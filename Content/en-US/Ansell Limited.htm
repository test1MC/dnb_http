   It's not a stretch to say that Ansell has got you covered -- in latex. The company is a leading manufacturer of industrial and medical gloves, condoms (brands include SKYN, Jissbon, LifeStyles, and Blowtex), and other latex products. Formerly a sprawling conglomerate, Ansell divested its non-core units to focus on four global business units: medical solutions, industrial solutions, specialty markets (aka new verticals), and sexual wellness. Leading markets for Ansell's gloves include semiconductor, electronics, construction, and health care industries, food manufacturing and food service industries, and military markets. Ansell's medical glove brands include Encore, Gammex, Medi-Grip, Micro-Touch, and Sandel.

  <p>
   Ansell Limited's history begins with a veterinarian, a tricycle, and a bumpy road. In 1887 John Boyd Dunlop, a veterinarian in Belfast, Northern Ireland, gave his son a tricycle for his birthday. When his son complained about the jolting ride on rough country roads, Dunlop came up with an air-filled tire. Dunlop sold the rights to his tire to a pair of businessmen who founded the Pneumatic Tyre Company in 1889. By 1892 it had expanded into continental Europe and North America, and the next year it created a branch office of Dunlop UK to make bike tires in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1899 as Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company of Australia. In 1903 it moved into a new, growing market: automobile tires. The company, which was incorporated as Dunlop Rubber Company of Australia in 1920, merged with Sydney-based Perdriau Rubber Company in 1929.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dunlop concentrated on rubber-based products until the 1960s, when it began to diversify by adding clothing, textiles, and footwear. In 1969 it acquired glove maker Ansell Rubber. During the 1970s Dunlop expanded outside Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1980 the company had acquired its archrival, tire maker Olympic Consolidated Industries. Founded in 1922, Olympic began producing auto tires in 1934. The acquisition also netted Olympic's cable business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Led by John Gough, Dunlop continued to expand during the 1980s. In 1985 it acquired the North American operations of UK-based battery maker Chloride. Dunlop entered its South Pacific Tyres joint venture with Goodyear in 1986 to sell tires in Australia and New Zealand. That year it changed its name to Pacific Dunlop Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Pacific Dunlop expanded its battery operations when it bought a stake in GNB Holdings, maker of Champion batteries. It moved into the health care business in 1988 with the acquisition of Nucleus (now Cochlear) and its US pacemaker unit Telectronics, a group of high-technology medical product makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Food was added to the company's business mix with the 1991 acquisition of Australia's Petersville Sleigh. The purchase of meat products maker Plumrose in 1993 expanded those operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Telectronics recalled three models of pacemaker parts in 1994 after failures led to the deaths of several patients, and a year later the FDA suspended US manufacturing of the parts. Pacific Dunlop took losses related to the Telectronics problems totaling $241.5 million that year. It also began disposing of businesses, selling most of its food operations, part of its industrial products unit, and a footwear company. The firm spun off its Cochlear hearing device business in 1995 and sold Telectronics in 1996. Gough retired as chairman in 1997 in the midst of another pacemaker lawsuit filed against the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with harsh competition in the non-energized US battery market, Pacific Dunlop agreed in 1998 to unload its GNB operations to metal recycler Quexco for a cut-rate $783 million, but the deal fell apart the next year. The company did manage to unload its cable business in 1999, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a fundamental restructuring, Pacific Dunlop divested two major businesses in 2000: Its distribution business in New Zealand and Australia (sold to the Hagemeyer Group for $343 million); and GNB Technologies, a maker of auto and industrial batteries (sold to US-based battery giant Exide for $333 million). The company also acquired the worldwide medical glove business of

    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   that year, a purchase that made Ansell the global market leader in that field.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company sold its Pacific Brands consumer goods unit (for about $730 million) to a private group led by CVC Asia Pacific. Pacific Dunlop changed its name to Ansell Limited in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10668">
    The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company
   </company>
   purchased Ansell's investment in South Pacific Tyres in early 2006, marking the company's complete exit from all things automotive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company bolstered its occupational line of products after acquiring Hawkeye Glove, a move that gave it access to the US military market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Ansell appointed Magnus Nicolin, a former executive of

   , as CEO to replace the resigning Doug Tough.
