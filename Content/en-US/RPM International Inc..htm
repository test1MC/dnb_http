  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through three reportable segments: Industrial, Consumer, and Specialty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial (51% of total revenues in fiscal 2016) comprises three separate operating segments: Tremco Group, tremco illbruck Group. and Performance Coatings Group. RPM's industrial products includes maintenance and protection products for roofing and waterproofing systems, flooring, corrosion control and other specialty applications.

  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer (34%) is made up of three operating segments - Rust-Oleum Group, DAP Group and SPG-Consumer Group. For the do-it-yourself consumer market, RPM offers rust-preventatives and paints (
   <company id="140049">
    Rust-Oleum

  <p>
   Industrial product lines are sold directly to contractors, distributors, and end-users, including industrial manufacturing plants, public institutions, and other commercial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer products are sold throughout North America primarily to mass merchants, home improvement centers, hardware stores, paint stores, craft shops, cosmetic companies and to other smaller customers through distributors. Retailers like

    Home Depot

   ,
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40005">
    Ace Hardware

   represent the bulk of the consumer segment's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ten large consumer segment customers accounted for 23% of fiscal 2016 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   RPM spent, $49.7 million on advertising costs in fiscal 2016, (up from $40.8 million in 2015, and $49.6 million in 2014).

  <p>
   The company has seen rising revenues over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 RPM's net revenues increased by 5% to $4.8 billion due to higher revenues from the Specialty and Consumer segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty revenues increased by 60% due to acquisition growth of 60.4% (including the reconsolidated Specialty Products Holding Corp.  businesses and a few other small product line acquisitions). Consumer sales increased by 2% due to organic sales growth of 3.3%, related to new product introductions and strategic product placements. Segment results also benefited from the continued strength of the US housing market and major retail customers seeing strong sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 RPM's net income increased by 48% to $354.7 million due to higher net revenues and a lower provision for income taxes, driven by a decrease in the effective tax rate resulting from a deferred income tax charge of $106.2 million for the estimated tax cost associated with unremitted foreign earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company's operating cash inflow increased by 44% to $474.7 million.

  <p>
   The company, backed by a strong cash and liquidity position, pursues acquisitions while also investing internally. To grow organically, it pursues internal initiatives such as new products, new distribution, and geographic expansion. Although its pursuit of acquisitions is aggressive, RPM prides itself on a longstanding practice of having its acquisitions operate independently under existing management and keeping the acquired name brands intact. The company continues to expand its global footprint, particularly in established European economies and emerging, high-growth markets such as Latin America, India, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs and to refocus on faster-growing brands within the consumer operating segment, in 2015 RPM began a restructuring plan to cut a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. That year RPM reconsolidated subsidiaries SPHC and Bondex International after they reemerged from a 2010 bankruptcy. In 2016, the company combined the former RPM2 industrial operating segment and the SPHC operating segment into a single group, RPM Specialty Products Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, it spent $61.5 million, $56.7 million and $54.6 million, on research and development activities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired Duram Industries Pty Limited, an Australian-based manufacturer of commercial waterproofing products and Applied Polymerics, Inc. &amp; Marketing Associates, Inc. (API/MAI), a specialist civil engineering and construction organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year RPM also bought Specialty Polymer Coatings, Inc. (SPC), a Canadian manufacturer of high-performance coatings for the global oil and gas pipeline market with annual net sales of $26 million. It will operate as a free-standing business within the RPM Performance Coatings Group and report through the Carboline Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company completed six acquisitions. Four of the current-year acquisitions report through its industrial reportable segment, which includes a waterproofing products manufacturer in Brazil; a manufacturer of powder construction products based in Phoenix, Arizona; a manufacturer of firestopping products for the construction industry based in London, UK; and a maker of high performance wood finishes based in Manchester, UK. The other two acquisitions report through the consumer reportable segment, including a producer of specialty cleaners based in Cumming, Georgia and a producer of aerosol paints based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enhancing its portfolio, in 2014 the company's Rust-Oleum unit acquired Georgia-based Krud Kutter, a producer of cleaners and removers for residential, commercial and industrial environments. Krud Kutter specializes in problem solving cleaners and removers, which are water-based, bio-degradable, non-toxic and VOC compliant, while offering superior performance characteristics. The deal allows Rust-Oleum to expand its current presence in specialty cleaners and further penetrate a fragmented market segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Rust-Oleum also bought Minnesota-based Citadel Restoration and Repair, Inc., a producer and marketer of premium concrete and wood deck floor coatings for both the professional contractor and DIY markets.

   Frank Sullivan founded Republic Powdered Metals in 1947 to make an industrial aluminum paint. The company went public in 1963, and three years later it bought Reardon Co. (household coatings), the first of more than 50 acquisitions. After his father's death in 1971, Thomas Sullivan took over and reorganized RPM as a holding company.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1979 RPM, though successful, was taken to task by its board for lack of formal planning. In 1985 it bought Sun Oil's Carboline coating and tank-lining subsidiary. This purchase forced RPM to lay off employees for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
   RPM bought Rust-Oleum in 1994. In its largest acquisition at that time, the company bought roofing-product expert
   <company id="113543">
    Tremco
   </company>
   in 1996 for $236 million. The purchase amassed debt, and to compensate, RPM sold its Craft House hobby activity subsidiary and Swiggle Insulating Glass in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company resumed acquisitions and overseas expansion in 1998 by purchasing Flecto (wood finish), the UK's Nullifire (fireproof coatings), and Germany's Alteco Technik (floors); it also established joint ventures in Russia and China. In 1999 RPM paid $290 million for UK-based Wassall's DAP adhesives division. Softer sales in the Americas and Asia, plus increased distribution expenses that fiscal year, prompted the company to begin restructuring its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   RPM sold its Alox metalworking additive business to
   <company id="10921">
    Lubrizol
   </company>
   in 2000. The next year the company finished its restructuring -- which had resulted in 17 plant closures and a 10% workforce reduction -- and set its sights on reducing debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas C. Sullivan's son -- and grandson of the company's founder -- Frank Sullivan took the chief executive reins in 2002; Thomas Sullivan remained with the company as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went through a spate of acquisitions in the middle of the decade. Its flooring services division has acquired National Building Facilities Services and
   <company id="10710">
    Harsco
   </company>
   's fiberglass-reinforced plastics business, and its corrosion control division has acquired AD Fire Protection Systems. Tremco has acquired German sealant manufacturer Illbruck Sealant Systems. In early 2007 Rust-Oleum acquired the UK's Tor Coatings in an effort to grow the unit's European coatings operations. Later that year the company sold its auto restoration products subsidiary, Bondo, to
   <company id="11003">
    3M
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 two RPM subsidiaries, Bondex International and its holding company, Specialty Products Holding Corp., filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in a move to resolve asbestos claims against Bondex. The process allowed the companies to establish a trust fund and a court order directing all present and future claims to the fund for compensation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also went on an international shopping trip in 2010. RPM acquired Hummervoll Industribelegg AS, a Norway-based supplier and installer of industrial flooring systems; UK-based Pipeline &amp; Drainage Systems, a supplier of curb, bridge, and channel drainage products; and Turkish company Park Dis Ticaret AS, a provider of sealant, tapes, and membranes.
  </p>
  <p>
   RPM subsidiary Euclid Chemical acquired PSI Packaging in 2011. PSI is a producer of micro- and macro-fibers for the ready-mixed and pre-cast concrete market. The PSI deal will expand both Euclid and RPM's manufacturing and sales capacity for concrete reinforcement fibers, particularly in the international market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company expanded further internationally when its Performance Coatings Group acquired API, an Italian flooring and deck coatings company. The buy also complemented RPM's Flowcrete and Stonhard commercial flooring businesses. That year the company's Performance Coatings Group acquired Spanish company Grupo P&amp;V, a top European supplier of fire protection and insulation products. Grupo P&amp;V manufactures, sells, and installs expanded perlite and vermiculite used in passive fire protection, soundproofing, and heat insulation. The acquisition fits in with RPM's Carboline product line and expands the company's fire protection market in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company purchased nail care enamel and related products maker Kirker Enterprises for an undisclosed amount. Kirker became part of the consumer segment. Earlier in the year RPM's Rust-Oleum Group acquired Australia-based HiChem Paint Technologies, which makes automotive aftermarket coatings and specialty coatings for both industrial applications and home use.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also acquired Brazilian building materials and construction products company Viapol for an undisclosed amount. Viapol has brand-leading products in Brazil, including its rolled asphalt roofing materials, waterproofing products, concrete admixtures, and retail paints and varnishes. The buy broadens RPM's global footprint by moving the company into the Brazilian market, South America's largest economy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 RPM's Performance Coatings Group acquired Expanko, a producer of FritzTile brand terrazzo tile (as well as cork, rubber and rubber/cork floor tiles) for the education, healthcare, hospitality, and sports/entertainment markets.
