   As part of the company's long term growth strategy, in 2013 International Fibres acquired Exelto NV, a Belgium-based polypropylene staple fiber producer. It plans to use its position as the technical leader in polypropylene fiber production to build on Exelto's highly efficient fiber production lines. The deal also enables Exelto to enhance its product portfolio by accessing the R&amp;D and strong market positioning of International Fibres.
