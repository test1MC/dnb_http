   TPC Group's products are key building blocks in the manufacture of performance and specialty chemicals. The company is a leading producer of butadiene, butene-1, and other value-added products derived and processed from petrochemical raw materials, such as C4 hydrocarbons. Butadiene is primarily used to make synthetic rubber for tires for the automotive industry and butene-1 is used to produce plastic bags and lubricant additives. Other products are geared at the fuel and surfactant markets. TPC Group is also a provider of infrastructure and logistics services to customers in the Gulf Coast region. The company was acquired and taken private by investment firms

   and SK Capital in late 2012.

  <p>
   As a result of the deal, valued at approximately $850 million including net debt, TPC Group was delisted and is now a privately held company. First Reserve, a global investment firm focused on the energy industry, and SK Capital, a private equity firm focused on specialty materials and chemicals, plan to support TPC's next phase of development.

   It owns and operates three principal processing facilities, all in Texas: Baytown, Houston, and Port Neches. TPC Group also operates a product terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

   Operations
  </p>
  <p>
   The company produces value-added products derived from niche petrochemical raw materials such as C4 hydrocarbons. Its end products help to make tires, carpets, gasoline additives, and many other essential items. The Houston and Port Neches facilities process crude C4 hydrocarbon into butadiene and related products and are serviced by rail, truck, barge, and ocean-going vessels. The Baytown facility primarily produces nonene and tetramer, which are used as intermediates in the production of plasticizers, detergents, antioxidants, and lube oil additives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Lake Charles facility has the capacity to offload butadiene from barges. Its Port Neches facility can produce up to 900 million pounds of butadiene per year, which is shipped primarily by pipeline, and also by barge, to many of the largest butadiene consumers in the U.S. Its Houston facility's combined production is more than 1.5 billion pounds per year.

  <p>
   A key part of TPC Group's strategy is to boost output of some of its more in-demand products. It announced in 2013 an effort to expand production capacity of polyisobutylene (PIB), which is used in lubricants and fuel additives and for conventional applications like adhesives, caulks, coatings, and sealants. The need for capacity growth is being driven by changes in technical standards for lubricating oils that favor PIBs.
  </p>
  <p>
   TPC Group is also refurbishing its Houston plant to expand butadiene production by making it from butane, a component of natural gas that has increased in supply as a result of production from shale rock formations. In the butadiene market, TPC Group competes against the likes of

    Equistar Chemicals
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="56162">
    ExxonMobil Chemical
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="104713">
    Shell Chemicals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   TPC Group has a sharp focus on the specific markets where it maintains a competitive advantage and which are too narrow to be attractive to larger petrochemical producers. It supports its leading market share in C4 Processing and Performance Products segments by its large scale of operations, strong infrastructure, proprietary technology, and a business model in which it does not compete with its suppliers and customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to expand production capacity to meet market demand and customer needs, in 2013 TPC Group embarked on an expansion effort to both debottleneck existing capacity and build additional capacity to meet the current and future needs of its customers. Capacity has increased more than 15% since 2012 and additional debottlenecking was underway in 2014.

  <p>
   The company sells its products into a wide range of performance, specialty and intermediate segments, including synthetic rubber, fuels, lubricant additives, plastics and surfactants. TPG Group's Houston and Port Neches facilities are strategically located near most of the major petrochemical consumers in Texas and Louisiana. All three locations provide convenient access to other Gulf Coast petrochemicals producers and are connected to several customers and raw materials suppliers through an extensive pipeline network.

  <p>
   As a reflection of its focus on downstream products, the company changed its name from Texas Petrochemicals to the TPC Group in 2010.
