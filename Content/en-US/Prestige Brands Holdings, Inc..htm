   Prestige Brands is a lifesaver in the business of resuscitating offloaded consumer brands. The company acquires, develops, and markets over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and household cleaning products. Its portfolio includes Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Comet, Compound W, Doctor's Nightguard, Little Remedies, PediaCare, Murine, Monistat, New Skin, and many other big-name brands. Prestige Brands contracts out manufacturing of its products, which are sold through mass merchandisers and retail stores primarily in North America. The company was formed in 1996 to acquire and revitalize leading but neglected consumer brands divested by major consumer companies, such as
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Prestige operates through three segments: North American OTC Healthcare, International OTC Healthcare, and Household Cleaning. Its around 30 core OTC brands, which contribute some 90% of revenue, include names that have stocked medicine cabinets for generations - Luden, Efferdent, Beano, Debrox, PediaCare, Chloraseptic, Compound W, and Dramamine. Household cleaning brands Chore Boy, Comet, and Spic and Span have similar name recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead of maintaining its own manufacturing facilities, Prestige Brands contracts out product-making, using third-party manufacturers and warehouse distribution partners to simplify its organizational structure.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Nearly all of Prestige Brands' sales come from North America (the US is the firm's largest single market, bringing in nearly 90% of sales), but the company is working to increase international sales by licensing some brands to large multinational companies in desirable international markets. It has one such agreement for Comet in Eastern Europe. It also sells Clear Eyes, Chloraseptic, and Murine internationally. Prestige Brands, which in 2016 generated 8% of sales outside North America, has already designed and developed product packaging for specific international markets and is focused now on growing its distribution network to help increase its international penetration.

  <p>
   Prestige Brands generates revenue by leveraging several distribution channels to get its products on store shelves and in consumers' hands. Mass merchandisers, drug stores, and grocery stores account for the largest percentages of sales, at some 30%, 20%, and 20% of total revenue, respectively. Other growing but smaller channels that Prestige Brands relies on include dollar stores and club stores.

  <p>
   With the exception of 2014, when the company reported a 3% drop in revenue, Prestige Brands has seen growing revenues for the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended March), sales rose 13% to $806.3 million, primarily due to 16% growth in the North American OTC Healthcare segment. That growth was driven by the recent acquisitions of the Insight (2014) and DenTek (2016) brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has also been on the rise. In fiscal 2016 it rose 28% to $99.9 million thanks to the higher revenue and lower operating expenses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy lies in acquiring new brands and developing effective marketing programs for its existing products. Acquisitions are key to keeping its products portfolio fresh and it is constantly on the lookout for new additions to keep itself competitive. Its goal is to have 85% of its earnings from "invest for growth" brands and the remainder from "manage for cash" brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Prestige Brands is evaluating a product for acquisition, it takes a number of factors into consideration, including the period of time the product has been in existence, the product's market position (typically about three-quarters of the company's sales come from brands with a #1 or #2 market position), its recent and projected sales growth, and its potential for product extensions. Prestige Brands looks to acquire products that can be remarketed with additional enhancements. It uses a similar technique when marketing existing products, introducing enhancements and line extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Prestige Brands sold three non-core, but established, brands (New Skin, Fiber Choice, and PediaCare) to Moberg Pharma for $40 million. The deal fell in line with its strategy of maintaining a portfolio of primarily newer brands; the company plans to use funds from the deal to pay down debt. In a similar move later that year, the company sold the Dermoplast brand to Moberg Pharma for $47.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the company's highest-valued brands are Monistat, DenTek, Clear Eyes, and Chloroseptic. On the other hand, such brands as Pediacare and Beano have slipped due to growing competition (but Prestige remains committed to their recovery).

  <p>
   Prestige Brands acquired specialty oral care products distributor DenTek for $225 million in early 2016. Later that year it agreed to buy
   <company id="129808">
    C.B. Fleet
   </company>
   , which makes OTC enemas and laxatives as well as Summers Eve feminine products, for $825 million.

  <p>
   Prestige Brands was pieced together in 1996 from the parts of defunct manufacturer Medtech Labs (shampoos, nail care products), The Spic &amp; Span Company, and Prestige Brands International (Comet cleaners and Clear Eyes eye drops).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Prestige Brands completed its largest asset acquisition to date, spending $660 million to gain a portfolio of 17 North American OTC brands from
   <company id="139393">
    GlaxoSmith Kline
   </company>
   (GSK). The purchases added brands that included leading pain relief (BC, Goody's, and Ecotrin), gastrointestinal (Beano, Fiber Choice, Gaviscon, Phazyme, and Tagamet), sleep aid (Sominex), ear wax remover (Debrox), and oral rinse (Gly-Oxide) brands. Also in 2012, the company received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from Mexican health products firm
   <company id="162203">
    Genomma Lab Internacional
   </company>
   . The Prestige Brands board of directors rejected the proposal as inadequate and not in the best interest of the firm.
