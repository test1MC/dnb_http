   Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber is a real wheeler dealer. The company is the fifth-largest tire manufacturer in North America (behind the likes of
   <company id="41861">
    Bridgestone

   ,

    Michelin

   ). It makes and sells replacement tires mainly for passenger cars and light trucks, but also for medium truck, motorcycles, race cars, commercial, and off-road vehicles for North American and international markets. Cooper operates eight manufacturing facilities and over 20 distribution centers worldwide. Unlike some of its rivals, Cooper does not typically sell to automotive OEMs; instead it markets its tires to customers including independent tire dealers, wholesale distributors, and regional and national tire chains.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cooper operates nearly 10 manufacturing facilities and roughly 20 distribution centers in 10 countries. The US accounts for nearly 85% of its total revenue, while China generates 4%.

  <p>
   The company's products are sold through independent tire dealers, wholesale distributors, regional and national retail tire chains, and large retail chains that sell tires as well as other automotive products. In North America the company also sells through three company-owned retail stores. It sells a limited number of tires to original equipment manufacturers.

  <p>
   Cooper's revenues fell 13% from $3.42 billion in 2014 to $2.97 billion in 2015. Its profits have remained flat, hovering around the $213 million mark for 2014 and 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue fall for 2015 was fueled by a 60% dip in International Tire segment, which fueled a massive 80% drop in sales from China. This was chiefly the result of the selling of its Cooper Chengshan Tires joint venture in 2014.

  <p>
   Cooper has a strategy of expanding globally through joint ventures and partially owned subsidiaries. These acquisitions and alliances in lower-cost countries, such as China, Serbia, and Mexico, help offset rising raw material costs. Its international tire segment caters primarily to the replacement markets in the UK, continental Europe, and Scandinavia. This segment is composed of two main joint venture manufacturing facilities in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   UK operations continue to focus on serving European niche demand for high-performance, racing, and motorcycle tires. The company is also steadily increasing its production capabilities and presence in the Asia/Pacific region. It had two joint ventures in China -- Cooper Chengshan Tires (CCT) and Cooper Kenda Tire -- which make tires for passenger vehicles and medium trucks. However, in 2014 it sold its 65% ownership in CCT to Chengshan Group Company Ltd. for approximately $262 million. As part of the sale, CCT continues to produce Cooper-branded products, including Roadmaster tires, through mid-2018.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cooper Tire is also building a presence in Mexico, where it has a majority stake in Corporaci√≥n de Occidente, and full ownership of Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. de Mexico. Though located on opposite sides of the world, China and Mexico share something in common -- they are both part of Cooper Tire's strategy to establish manufacturing facilities in lower-cost regions.

  <p>
   After experiencing a massive 80% drop in sales from China in 2015, Cooper has made a deal to entrench its market position further in the country. In 2016 the company acquired a 65% of interest in China-based Qingdao Ge Rui Da Rubber Co., Ltd (GRT) for approximately $93 million. It plans for GRT to be its truck and bus radial tire producer for Cooper, Asia, and other markets and sell Roadmaster brand tires for North America.

  <p>
   John Schaefer and Claude Hart (brothers-in-law) bought M and M Manufacturing of Akron, Ohio, in 1914. M and M made tire patches, cement, and repair kits. In 1915 the two bought The Giant Tire &amp; Rubber Company (tire rebuilding). Two years later they moved their business to Findlay, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ira Cooper joined Giant's board in 1917 and soon thereafter formed his own company, The Cooper Corporation, which began making tires in 1920. The industry began consolidating in the 1920s, and in 1930 Cooper and Giant merged with Falls Rubber Company (a small tire maker), and Master Tire &amp; Rubber Company was born. Cooper died in 1941, but the company went on to supply the war effort with tires, pontoons, life jackets, and tank decoys. After WWII the company changed its name to Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company.
