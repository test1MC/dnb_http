   The first order of business of ABI (UK) is making manufactured second homes, known in the UK as holiday homes. It offers more than a dozen models with two or three bedrooms, with options including electric fireplaces and kitchen appliances. Prices range from about £16,500 to nearly £60,000 ($25,500 to $92,000).

   ABI (UK) in 2015 continued to emphasize its quality product and customer-oriented business model, with a "focus that has always been on quietly putting more into its holiday homes, rather than on big marketing campaigns and singing its own praises."
  </p>
  <p>
   The company helps potential buyers consider all of the factors involved before making a holiday home purchase, such as choosing the right holiday park, the size of the pitch, the direction the windows need to face, the cost of utilities, and a home price that's within the shopper's budget.
  </p>
  <p>
   Accordingly, ABI (UK) offers homes from its affordable entry-level Summer Breeze home listed at just under £16,500 to the luxury and quality-built Westwood home model with a starting price just above £56,700. Shoppers may spend more on upgrades to add extra features that suit their tastes and land plot conditions.
