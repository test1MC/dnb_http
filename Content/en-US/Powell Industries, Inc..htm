   Powell Industries gets a charge out of making equipment and computer systems that monitor and control the flow of electricity in industrial, commercial, and government facilities. Products include switchgears (units that manage the flow of electricity to motors, transformers, and other equipment); bus ducts (insulated power conductors housed in a metal enclosure); process control systems for instrumentation, computer control, and communications; and data management systems. Powell sells to oil and gas producers and pipelines, refineries, utilities, paper mills, petrochemical plants, and transportation companies, among other customers.

   Powell's business operates through two business segments: Electrical Power Products and Process Control Systems. Electrical Power Products accounts for about 95% of the company's revenue and includes equipment and systems for the distribution and control of electrical energy. Process Control Systems makes instrumentation, computer controls, communications, and data management systems to control and manage processes.

  <p>
   After posting record-breaking revenues of $717 million in 2012, Powell saw its revenues fall 6% to $674 million in 2013. This was due to a decline in revenue from its Electrical Power Products business as a result of the completion of certain complex domestic and international petrochemical and oil and gas construction projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits climbed 42% from nearly $30 million in 2012 to $42 million for 2013, the highest total in the last 10 years. The rise in profits was attributed to a gain on a settlement of a lawsuit the company had filed. The company's margins were also helped by a decline in provision for income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Powell posted continuous declines in operating cash flow from 2009 to 2012. Its cash from operations recovered in 2013, increasing by $98 million. The rise was due to the increased net income as well as a spike in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and the collection of contracts receivable.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company sold its subsidiary, Transdyn, to Kapsch TrafficCom, a global provider of electronic toll collection (ETC) systems, for $16 million. The transaction allowed Powell to focus on its core electrical power products businesses.
