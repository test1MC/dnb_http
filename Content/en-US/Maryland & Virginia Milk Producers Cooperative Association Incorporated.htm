   Milk is "Mar-VA-lous" for the members of the Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association. Known as Maryland &amp; Virginia, the co-op processes and sells milk for nearly 1,500 member/farmers with dairy herds in the southeastern US and mid-Atlantic region. Maryland &amp; Virginia produces fluid milk, ice cream, and cultured dairy products for retail sale under the Marva Maid, Maola, and Valley Milk brands. Its butter, condensed milk, and milk-powder products are sold primarily to food manufacturers. As a co-op, it also offers agricultural supplies to its members. Maryland &amp; Virginia operates three fluid-milk processing plants, a manufacturing plant, and an equipment-supply warehouse.

  <p>
   The co-op gets its milk from member farmers in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Its fluid processing plants are located in Newport News, Virginia; Landover, Maryland; and New Bern, North Carolina. It has manufacturing facilities in Laurel, Maryland, and Strasburg, Virginia, and a warehouse in Frederick, Maryland.

  <p>
   Maryland &amp; Virginia operates three fluid processing plants, a single manufacturing plant, and a farm supply equipment division. It also owns a majority stake in Valley Milk LLC. The co-op transports more than 300 tanker truckloads of milk daily to nearly 30 different plants. Member farms range in size from fewer than 100 cows to more than 2,000. Combined, Maryland &amp; Virginia members produce three billion pounds of milk annually.

  <p>
   The co-op's revenue decreased by 5% to $1.3 billion in 2012 versus $1.4 billion in 2011, due to a decline in milk, dairy, and other products as well as sales of equipment and supplies, partially offset by an increase in sales of its members' and nonmembers' raw milk. Despite the decline in sales, the Maryland &amp; Virginia reported a profit of $5.5 million in 2012, versus a loss of $2.8 million the prior year. Like other milk producers, Maryland &amp; Virginia has been contending with sluggish milk sales due to decreasing milk consumption beginning in the 1970s.
