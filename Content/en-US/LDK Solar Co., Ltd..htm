   LDK knows the sun is always shining somewhere. Operating through subsidiaries, the company turns polysilicon into monocrystalline and multicrystalline solar wafers, which are used to produce solar cells and solar modules that convert sunlight into energy. It also provides wafer processing services to solar cell makers and sells polysilicon scrap. LDK uses virgin polysilicon and recycled material in its production process. With a capacity of 2 GW annually, it is the world's largest producer of solar wafers. Major customers include

    Hanwha Q-Cells
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58192">
    Hyundai
   </company>
   . It earns more than 75% of its sales from Asia, primarily China. Chairman and CEO Xiaofeng Peng, who founded the company in 2005, owns 45% of LDK Solar.

   In 2007 allegations by a former financial controller surfaced about inconsistencies between LDK's ledger reporting and published financial statements. Polysilicon inventory figures, impacting silicon wafer production quality and LDK's financial results, were at issue. The news sparked a hotbed of lawsuits by investors who bought LDK's American depositary receipts during the company's IPO, and sent the company's stock into a sharp tailspin. LDK denied the allegations and by late 2007 it was able to report that the investigation found "no material errors" in silicon inventory quantities; the former controller failed to account for all of the warehouses in which the company had stored its silicon feedstock. The SEC concluded its inquiry without any enforcement action against LDK.
