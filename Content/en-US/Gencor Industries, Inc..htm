   Gencor Industries is a US manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials, synthetic fuels, and environmental control equipment. Subsidiary Bituma designs and manufactures hot-mix asphalt batch plants used in the production of asphalt paving materials. Subsidiary General Combustion engineers combustion systems, namely large burners that can transform almost any fuel into energy or burn multiple fuels simultaneously, and fluid heat transfer systems under the Hy-Way and Beverley brands. With two manufacturing facilities in the US, it sells products through its own sales force and independent dealers and agents located throughout the world.

  <p>
   Gencor is stationed in Orlando, Florida, and has two manufacturing facilities in Iowa and Florida. It serves North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. All of its revenue comes from the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   Gencor's operations are comprised of Hetherington and Berner (H&amp;B), Hy-Way Heat, Bituma Corporation, Thermotech Systems, and General Combustion.
  </p>
  <p>
   H&amp;B is a manufacturer of asphalt batch mixing plants, while Hy-Way produces thermal fluid process equipment and targets the industrial and asphalt markets. Bituma builds hot mix storage silo systems, and Thermotech Systems offers a portable patented thermal absorption process used for processing contaminated soil. General Combustion specializes in advanced combustion technology.

  <p>
   Gencor's products are sold through sales representatives and independent dealers and agents located throughout the world. It primarily targets the highway construction industry.

  <p>
   After experiencing two straight years of growth, Gencor saw its revenues decrease 23% from $63 million in 2012 to $49 million in 2013. Its profits, however, surged by 50% from $4.5 million to $6.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2013 was the result of the completion of a large asphalt plant delivered in 2012 and continued weak domestic road construction activity. In addition, its Canadian sales declined as various Canadian government's infrastructure spend programs neared completion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The surge in profits was fueled by continued improvements in production, lower purchasing costs, reduced product engineering and development expenses, and tight controls on selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   In response to lower demand for its products and services, Gencor is focused on conserving cash, and streamlining its operations and cost structure. These actions included adjustments to its workforce, reduced purchases of raw materials, and reductions in selling, general, and administrative expenses. In addition, it reviews its internal processes to identify inefficiencies and cost reduction opportunities.

  <p>
   The company started out making combustion systems for paving contractors in the 1940s. It incorporated in Florida in 1960 as Mechtron Corporation. In 1969 it merged with Ohio-based General Combustion and Genco Manufacturing. E. J. "Mike" Elliott, chairman of General Combustion, was named president of the combined company, rechristened Mechtron International, in 1970. In 1987 it adopted its present name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s Gencor began beefing up its process machinery business, moving into thermal fluid heaters, industrial incinerators, and asphalt-making systems. Asphalt machinery accounted for 70% of sales, but the business suffered from cyclical swings. To smooth the ups and downs, in 1996 Gencor bought Ingersoll-Rand's food equipment division, a maker of pelleting, grinding, flaking, and filtration machines. The buy catapulted Gencor into a leading position in the food processing machinery field. In 1997 it made a series of acquisitions in South America, including Brazilian citrus processing equipment maker Gumaco.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company bought ACP Holdings, PLC (an asphalt production business with operations in the UK and Australia). It also acquired a 45% interest in Carbontronics and made machinery that company is using to produce synthetic fuel from coal waste. The firm suffered some serious setbacks that year: Bad weather damaged much of Brazil's orange crop, hurting results of Gencor's Gumaco subsidiary. The Asian financial crisis also slugged its Gencor ACP unit. Gencor ACP's chairman and CFO were both terminated after irregularities in accounting practices were discovered.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gencor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2000 and emerged from Chapter 11 at the end of 2001. The company sold its food processing machinery business for $52 million in 2001.
