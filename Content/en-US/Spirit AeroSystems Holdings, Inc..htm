   Spirit AeroSystems Holdings makes commercial and military airplane components, such as fuselages, propulsion systems, wings, and underwing parts. It designs and builds aerostructures for every
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   aircraft currently in production and provides components to Boeing's chief rival
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   . Spirit AeroSystems claims to be the largest supplier of wing parts for Airbus' A320 aircraft and produces the majority of aerostructures for Boeing's 737. Spirit AeroSystems maintains operations in the US, the UK, and Asia; however, the US is its largest market.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Spirit AeroSystems' operations are divided among three segments. Fuselage Systems is its most lucrative, generating almost 50% of total sales each year. Propulsion Systems and Wing Systems each earn nearly 25% of sales. The Fuselage Systems segment develops, produces and markets forward, mid and rear fuselage sections and systems, primarily to aircraft makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Propulsion Systems segment develops, produces and markets struts/pylons, nacelles (including thrust reversers) and related engine structural components primarily to aircraft or engine OEMs. The Wing Systems segment develops, produces and markets wings and wing components (including flight control surfaces) and other miscellaneous structural parts primarily to aircraft OEMs.

  <p>
   The company has its headquarters in Wichita, Kansas and other operations in France, Malaysia, Ireland, and the UK. The US accounts for 86% of its total sales, while the UK generates almost 10%.

   About 84% of Spirit AeroSystems' revenues comes from
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   , while
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   accounts for 11%. This customer concentration risk gets offset by the fact that it's the only source for most of its products, and its contracts give it supplier rights for the life of the aircraft program for most models. (Spirit AeroSystems began as an internal supplier for Boeing aircraft.) Other customers include
   <company id="40194">
    Gulfstream
   </company>
   and
   <company id="99064">
    Sikorsky
   </company>
   , the US government, and major defense contractors.

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $6.8 billion in 2014, Spirit AeroSystems saw its revenues fall 2% to $6.6 billion in 2015. However, its profits more than doubled from $359 million in 2014 to $789 million in 2015, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue drop for 2015 was attributed to the divestiture of the Gulfstream G280 and G650 wing work packages, lower net revenues recognized on its B787 program, and lower net revenues on its A320 program primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower global customer support and services activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The massive surge in profits for 2015 was due to an absence of a loss on divestiture of programs which it incurred in 2014 as a result of the loss on the divestiture of Gulfstream programs. In 2015 Spirit AeroSystems' operating cash flows skyrocketed by 257% to $1.3 billion due to increased customer receipts of deferred revenue and advance payments, net tax refunds, and the absence of a $160 million cash transfer made in 2014 related to the divestiture of its Gulfstream programs.

  <p>
   The company's strategic plan includes improving performance and productivity, reducing costs, leveraging its investments in support of future aircraft rate increases, and continuing its progress on the Airbus A350 airliner. It is reducing cost through cost saving initiatives and improving operational efficiency through centralization of functions, and is investing in new technology to bring the most advanced techniques, manufacturing, and automation to Spirit AeroSystems' customers.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 2005 when Boeing spun off its Wichita Division and Oklahoma operations as a new entity, Spirit AeroSystems.
