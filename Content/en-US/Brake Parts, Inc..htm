   Brake Parts Inc. (BPI) has built a business pulling out all of the stops. The company, doing business under the Raybestos brand, manufactures aftermarket motor vehicle brake systems and parts. It makes and markets a variety of products, such as brake pads and shoes, rotors, drums, calipers, wheel cylinders, master cylinders, and hardware. BPI operated as part of
   <company id="155601">
    Cypress Group
   </company>
   -owned Affinia Under Vehicle Group -- which included AIMCO (brake parts), Spicer (chassis and steering components), and Wix (air, fuel, and oil filters) -- until it was spun off in late 2012. BPI was acquired in March 2013 by an investment group led by private equity firm Torque Capital Group.

        <p>
   The New York private equity firm, which is looking to boost BPI's sales, joined other investors to purchase BPI in 2013 for its strong management team and leading market position in North America's break parts aftermarket. Torque Capital typically invests in small and lower-middle market manufacturing businesses.

        <p>
   To streamline its operations and cut costs, BPI has worked in recent years to restructure its manufacturing operations and has been shifting production to low-cost countries. It's also investing in new equipment for its manufacturing plants and improving its processes for more efficient production.

   Brake Parts spotlights its brand's high performance by maintaining a heavy presence in the motorsports market. The company's sponsorship of the Raybestos Rookie of the Year attracts positive publicity seen by racecar enthusiasts. More importantly, racing events open up a competitive moment to demonstrate the durability and reliability of the company's lineup to aftermarket suppliers and repair services. Reportedly about 80% of Brake Parts' promotions are aimed at auto service techs.
