   This daily news might not always be fit to print, but it at least keeps New Yorkers entertained. Daily News, L.P. publishes New York City's
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   , the big city tabloid that goes toe-to-toe with the
   <em>
    New York Post
   </em>
   (owned by Rupert Murdoch's
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   ) by penning over-the-top headlines and sensational stories. The paper, founded in 1919, is distributed primarily in the Five Boroughs and boasts a circulation of more than 550,000. It also distributes news and features online through its website. The
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   is owned by real estate magnate Mortimer Zuckerman, who also owns news magazine
   <em><company id="47282">
     U.S. News &amp; World Report
    </company></em>
   .

   Survival in the newspaper business is tough enough, but operating the crowded New York media market takes that battle to a whole new level. In addition to the
   <em>
    Post
   </em>
   , The
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   fights for readers with widely read
   <company id="12184"><em>
     New York Times
    </em></company>
   and
   <company id="116127"><em>
     Wall Street Journal
    </em></company>
   (also owned by News Corporation), as well as slew of borough-specific and foreign language papers. The newspaper also contends with New York-centric gossip websites such as those run by
   <company id="148341">
    Gawker Media
   </company>
   .

   In response to declining readership and advertising revenue, the
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   has been working to expanding its use of the Internet to distribute content and gain new readers. Cutting costs has also been a major focus of the company: The
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   joined a consortium of papers in New York and New Jersey to share content early in 2009. The group, which includes
   <em>
    The Star-Ledger
   </em>
   (owned by
   <company id="40006">
    Advance Publications
   </company>
   ) and
   <em>
    The Record
   </em>
   (
   <company id="44177">
    North Jersey Media Group
   </company>
   ), hopes the effort will allow the papers to cover the region's news with fewer reporters.
   <em>
    Daily News
   </em>
   also outsourced its foreign news reporting to Boston-based news syndication startup
   <company id="160771">
    Global News Enterprises
   </company>
   (GlobalPost).
