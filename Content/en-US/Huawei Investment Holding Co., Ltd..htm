  <p>
   Huawei's strategy for growth begins with its technologies. It is developing new generations of products throughout its large stable of telecom equipment, from smartphones to mobile broad band to cloud computing. The company calls this its pipe strategy, which endeavors to pump products for Internet, Communications, and Telecommunications (ICT) through the pipeline from R&amp;D to sales and marketing to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   While many of the company's products come from its 16 R&amp;D centers around the world, Huawei works closely with partners and customers to develop products and services in what is calls an open ecosystem. In its cloud business, for example, Huawei works with some 500 partners.

   </company>
   agreed to buy out Huawei's 49% stake in their joint venture, Huawei-3Com (renamed
   <company id="146780">
    H3C Technologies
   </company>
   ), for $882 million; the deal closed early the following year. Later in 2007, however, Huawei announced plans to purchase a stake in 3Com concurrent with that company's acquisition by
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   . The deal stalled in 2008 when 3Com withdrew its application to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). 3Com was unable to satisfy national security concerns raised by the US government over Huawei's investment.
