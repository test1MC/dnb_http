   For Applied Micro Circuits, X marks the spot for its chips. The company's lines of chips bearing the "X" are aimed at data centers, scientific and high-performance computing, and enterprise applications. The X-Gene and X-Weave families of chips, based on the ARM architecture, provide computing power and high-speed connectivity for telecommunications applications while operating on a low-level of energy. The company outsources manufacturing to
   <company id="43493">
    TSMC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55908">
    UMC
   </company>
   . Its top customers include
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   (26% of sales) and
   <company id="104909">
    Wintec
   </company>
   (20%). Applied Micro gets 57% of its sales from outside the US.

  <p>
   Applied Micro's revenue is a 60-40 split between it's connectivity products (60%) and its computing products (40%).

   Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Applied Micro also has a US research center in Andover, Massachusetts as well as research facilities in Ottawa, Canada; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; and Pune and Bangalore, India.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US is the company's biggest single national market with 43%, followed by Japan, 14%, and Hong Kong, 13%. Other sales are scattered throughout Europe and Asia.

  <p>
   Most of Applied Micro's sales (54%) are through distributors with Avnet and Wintec, together accounting for 46% of revenue.

  <p>
   In 2015 (ended March), Applied Micro's revenue tumbled 24% to $165 million from $216.15 million in 2014. Computing revenue dropped 39% with the continuing decline in sales of its chips based on the PowerPC architecture. Connectivity revenues slipped 8% because of fewer orders from telecommunications service providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The question when it comes to Applied Micro's bottom line is not will the company lose money but how much it will lose. In 2015, the loss was $52 million, nearly 10 times the loss of $5.6 million posted in 2014. Besides the lower revenue, the company had higher operating expenses and income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not as much cash flowed out of the company in 2015, however. Cash outflow from operations was $27 million compared to outflow of $43.5 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Applied Micro has invested heavily in developing its X-Gene chips, based on the lower-power ARM architecture. The company positions the chips for use in data centers where they can provide high-performance while using less power, an important consideration for power hungry data centers. Applied Micro is balancing the transition from the PowerPC architecture, which is falling out of favor with customers, to the new chip design. The transition has been in the works for several years and included Applied Micro's acquisition of Veloce in 2012. Veloce brought much of the technology on which Applied Micro's newer products are based.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied Micro's connectivity products are used to connect systems inside data centers as well as by telecom providers for their networks. Applied Micro is seeking to catch the wave of telecom investment as providers build out metro Ethernet and optical transport network (OTN) infrastructure. These new deployments are increasingly based on OTN with highly integrated framing, mapping, and multiplexing functions.

  <p>
   The company has collaborated with several companies to demonstrate its chips. With
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , Applied Micro has worked on the CloudLab facility at the
   <company id="130436">
    University of Utah
   </company>
   , a project that allows researchers and other users to build cloud-based applications for a range of workloads.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied Micro is working with
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   to develop high-speed cable connectivity for data center networks.
