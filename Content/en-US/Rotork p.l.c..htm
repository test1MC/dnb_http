   Valves are usually a simple component -- if you're running bath water, but what if you need to control a valve that's under a few thousand feet of ocean water, or inside a nuclear plant? Rotork specializes in providing valve actuators for precise industrial applications like these. The company's electric, pneumatic, and hydraulic actuators play key roles in offshore oil rigs, pipelines, water and wastewater treatment plants, power plants, mines, food and beverage plants, and shipboard systems. Rotork also makes the control systems (actuators and gearboxes) used to activate its products and a wide range of electronic instruments.

   In 1945 Rotork was a small engineering firm with interests in valve motorization. Then it was acquired by Frenchay Products Group, headed by brothers David and Jeremy Fry. Jeremy formed Rotork Engineering Company Ltd. as a separate company. It turned out its first valve in 1952 and grew quickly, thanks to the growth of the oil industry in Europe, the Middle East, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rotork introduced two major innovations in 1960: O-ring sealing, which isolated the internal mechanism from the outside environment, and its self-resetting Synchroset switch mechanism. The company went public in 1968, and Jeremy Fry retired in 1974. (He died in 2005.)
  </p>

   In 1985 the company bought an instrumentation company so that it could offer control-room interface systems for its valves. It launched Pakscan control products in 1986.

   Rotork replaced its A line of actuators -- which had been its main product since the 1960s -- with the IQ model in 1992. The new series featured electronic switches and had about 140 moving parts (versus 320 for the older models). Production of the IQ series doubled by 1997. Acquisitions in 1998 included Alecto Valve Actuators (the Netherlands) and Exeeco Ltd. The next year the company bought Valvekits Group Limited (gearboxes), Italy-based Fluid System S.r.l. (hydraulic and pneumatic actuators) and its M.P.M. Holding unit, along with Rotork Japan Co. Ltd.

   To aid in the expansion of its gearbox and fluid power businesses, the company formed Rotork Gears and Rotork Fluid Systems in 2000. Early in 2004 Rotor acquired Australian company Deanquip Valve Automation.

   In 2009 the company scooped up Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Flow-Quip Controls. The deal fell on the heels of acquiring Remote Control Sweden the year before.
