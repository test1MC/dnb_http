   Crane &amp; Co.'s early claim to fame was Paul Revere engraving banknotes on its paper during the American Revolution. The company is best known for making US currency paper and fine cotton papers for business and personalized stationery, such as wedding invitations and thank you notes. Its nonwovens division makes paper-like materials under brand names Craneglas and Cranemat that are used in products ranging from automobiles to satellites. Crane &amp; Co. operates manufacturing operations in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and internationally in Sweden. The company is owned and managed by the eighth generation of the Crane family. Private equity firm
   <company id="160696">
    Goldberg Lindsay &amp; Co.
   </company>
   also holds a minority stake.

   Based in Dalton, Massachusetts, Crane &amp; Co. boasts production facilities in the US in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and abroad in Sweden.

  <p>
   Some 70% of the energy used to make paper in the Dalton plant comes from municipal waste. In addition, the waste fibers from their papermaking processes are not sent to landfills, but are compost with municipal leaf and yard waste to create topsoil for land reclamation projects.

   On the consumer side of business, Crane &amp; Co. offers products that include address books, desk accessories, journals, and pens, in addition to its business and personalized stationery paper. It sells directly on its website and through both US and international retail stores and fine paperies. It also sells currency papers to the US government.

   The company is one of the few makers of 100% cotton paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currency paper accounts for more than half of its business. Since first being awarded a patent in 1844 for banknote paper with embedded silk threads to foil counterfeiters, Crane &amp; Co. has been developing currency paper with more advanced deterrents, such as watermarks, planchettes, security fibers and threads, special additives, and fluorescent and phosphorescent materials.

  <p>
   As the longtime primary supplier to the
   <company id="126992">
    US Treasury
   </company>
   , Crane &amp; Co. continues to invest in security features, such as anti-counterfeiting technology. It uses micro-optic security strip technology to enhance its paper money. Such investments prove to be crucial as Crane &amp; Co. attempts to hold on to its top supplier spot when the US government takes competing bids for currency material; so far, however, Crane &amp; Co. remains the sole provider of currency paper for the

   . The

  </p>
  <p>
   Crane &amp; Co.'s move beyond the domestic market into Sweden allows it to supply banknotes, passports, and ID cards to customers in Europe. It is also looking to drum up business in nations like China and India, which serve a secondary benefit of having abundant (and often cheaper) supplies of cotton.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company touts its eco-friendliness, making papers from waste fiber generated by cotton ginning mills and excess cotton garment trimmings normally sent to landfills. Its currency paper is made from recovered tree-free fibers, such as cotton and flax. In 2010 Crane &amp; Co. established a partnership with
   <company id="11180">
    Covanta
   </company>
   subsidiary Covanta Pittsfield. As the two companies are located adjacent to each other, Crane &amp; Co. harnesses Covanta's steam to power its manufacturing processes and to heat its facilities. For its part, Covanta uses Crane &amp; Co.'s stored waste fibers to generate clean, renewable energy.

  <p>
   Looking to add another popular name to its brands portfolio, Crane &amp; Co. acquired Hallmark Cards company William Arthur, based in west Kennebunk, Maine. The move provides another pillar to add to the Crane &amp; Co. and Vera Wang brand names and elevates the stationery company in its market. In mid-2013, Crane &amp; Co. consolidated William Arthur into its North Adams, Massachusetts, facility and integrated sales, customer service, and marketing.

   Crane &amp; Co. is majority owned and managed by the eighth generation of the Crane family with Goldberg Lindsay &amp; Co., a private equity firm, holding a minority share.
  </p>
  <p>
   Crane &amp; Co. was founded in 1801 by Zenas Crane, whose father sold paper in 1775 for the American Colonies' first paper money. The Crane Museum of Papermaking, housed in the Rag Room of Crane's 1844 Old Stone Mill, traces the history of American papermaking from Revolutionary times to present.
