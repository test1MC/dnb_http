   Ford Motor began a manufacturing revolution with mass production assembly lines in the early 20th century, but today it is one of the world's largest automakers. The carmaker's staple of brands and models includes the Ford Mustang, the F-Series pickup, Focus, Lincoln, Fiesta, and Taurus. In addition, finance unit
   <company id="54602">
    Ford Motor Credit
   </company>
   is one of the US's leading auto finance companies and accounted for 6% of Ford's sales in 2015. Ford owns a small stake in
   <company id="41860">
    Mazda
   </company>
   and operates more than 65 plants worldwide. The company generated 68% of its sales from North America in 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ford global reach is vast, and it generates 62% of its total sales from the US. Other sizable markets include Canada (6% of sales), the UK (8%), and Germany (5%).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ford's two business sectors are Automotive (94% of net sales) and Financial Services (6%). In 2015 Automotive sold approximately 6.6 million vehicles at wholesale throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ford manages its global operations through joint ventures. It has partnered with companies in China, Germany, Taiwan, Turkey, and Vietnam, among others. Ford Otosan, Ford's joint venture with Turkey-based
   <company id="41406">
    Ko√ß Holding

   , supplies the Ford Transit Connect and distributes Ford cars in Turkey.

  <p>
   Ford's vehicles, parts, and accessories are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America. Most of the dealerships are independently owned. In 2015 Ford had a network of more than 11,970 dealerships worldwide.

  <p>
   Ford's 2015 revenues decreased by 2%, its highest total in the past eight years. The growth for 2015 was fueled by a 4% uptick in Automotive sales and an 8% spike in Financial Services. Sales from the US also increased 13%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Ford's net income more than doubled from $3.2 billion in 2014 to $7.4 billion in 2015. This was attributed to the spike in sales coupled with gains made on changes in investment affiliates and the extinguishment of debt compared to losses in the previous year. Ford's operating cash flow in 2015 also increased 11%, mainly due to favorable changes in deferred income tax.

  <p>
   Reflecting a growing global auto market, Ford launched 16 new vehicles globally in 2015 and is planning to launch 12 global products in fiscal 2016, including the new F-Series Super Duty, Ford GT, and Lincoln Continental. It will add more electrified products for Ford and Lincoln, including the new Focus Electric. Through 2020, it has plans to invest $4.5 billion in electrified vehicle solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like many other car makers, the company is also looking to emerging economies for growth, particularly Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where cars sales are forecast to grow more rapidly than in mature markets. Ford is building new plants in India, Thailand, and especially China to meet more demand in the region.

  <p>
   Henry Ford started the Ford Motor Company in 1903 in Dearborn, Michigan. In 1908 Ford introduced the Model T, produced on a moving assembly line that revolutionized both carmaking and manufacturing. By 1920 some 60% of all vehicles on the road were Fords.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Ford omitted its usual dividend in 1916, stockholders sued. Ford responded by buying back all of its outstanding shares in 1919 and didn't allow outside ownership again until 1956.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ford bought Lincoln Motor Company in 1922 and discontinued the Model T in 1927. Its replacement, the Model A, came in 1932. With Henry Ford's health failing, his son Edsel became president that year. Despite the debut of the Mercury (1938), market share slipped behind
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   . After Edsel's death in 1943, his son, Henry II, took over and decentralized Ford, following the GM model. Henry Ford died in 1947 at the age of 83. In 1950 the carmaker recaptured second place. Ford rolled out the infamous Edsel line in 1958 and launched the Mustang in 1964.

   Ford acquired
   <company id="43299">
    Hertz
   </company>
   in 1994 and two years later bought #3 rental agency
   <company id="42221">
    Budget Rent a Car
   </company>
   (sold 1997). Also in 1996 it sold a 19% stake in finance unit
   <company id="47942">
    Associates First Capital
   </company>
   in an IPO and increased its stake in
   <company id="41860">
    Mazda
   </company>
   to one-third. The next year Ford sold its heavy-duty truck unit to
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler
   </company>
   's Freightliner subsidiary (since renamed
   <company id="54362">
    Daimler Trucks North America
   </company>
   ) for about $200 million and spun off 19% of Hertz in an IPO. Also in 1997 it launched automotive systems supplier
   <company id="57867">
    Visteon
   </company>
   (formerly Ford Automotive Products Operations) at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decades later, in order to focus on its struggling automotive operations, Ford sold its Hertz car rental business in 2005 to a private equity group made up of
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   , and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity for $5.6 billion and the assumption of nearly $10 billion of Hertz debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2009 the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   approved $5.9 billion in low-interest loans to Ford for converting its US plants to making cleaner, more efficient engines, transmissions, and vehicles. As a result, Ford reported it would spend $550 million to convert its Michigan Assembly Plant, where Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs were produced, into a modern facility for making its next-generation Focus small car. The new Focus rolled off the assembly line in 2010, with an all-electric version of the Focus to follow in 2011. Ford consolidated operations from its Wayne Assembly Plant as part of the project, and worked with the
   <company id="56122">
    UAW
   </company>
   on more flexible work rules for the Michigan Assembly Plant. In addition, Ford converted its Cuautitlan Assembly Plant in Mexico from SUV production to assembly of small cars, commencing in 2011. The Mexican plant began building the new Fiesta subcompact in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the automotive industry reeling from the Great Recession, companies made decisions to streamline their operations for survival. In mid-2010 Ford sold all of Volvo Car Corporation to Geely Automotive, a subsidiary of China-based Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. Volvo's headquarters and manufacturing operations remain in Sweden and Belgium, with Stefan Jacoby (former CEO of
   <company id="43979">
    Volkswagen Group of America
   </company>
   ) serving as president and CEO of Volvo Cars. At the onset of 2011, Ford's Mercury model production was discontinued.
