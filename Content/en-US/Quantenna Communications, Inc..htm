   Use Wi-Fi at home? Then you might be in range of Quantenna Communications' wireless chips. The company designs and sells Wi-Fi chips for home networking applications such as home gateways, repeaters, and set-top boxes. To make sure the right signals get to the right devices, it builds into its chips the technologies of Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO), Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO), and transmit beamforming (which improves directional accuracy). Most of the company's sales are to Asian manufacturers and many of its chips end up in devices from
   <company id="61619">
    Technicolor
   </company>
   and
   <company id="16536">
    ARRIS Group
   </company>
   . Quantenna spends more than a third of its revenue on R&amp;D. Founded in 2006, the company went public in 2016.

  <p>
   Quantenna did not have specific plans for the $107 million it raised with its IPO, but it did achieve a comfortable level of financial flexibility. It indicated the proceeds would, at some point, be use for working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. It could also use some of the some money to acquire companies or technologies. The company's stock trades under the symbol 'QTNA.
  </p>

  <p>
   Quantenna gets about 90% of its revenue from the sale of its Wi-Fi chips and another 7% comes from licensing its designs. In 2015, a non-recurring arrangement supplied a small percentage of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company outsources manufacturing to chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC). Quantenna also uses third parties for assembly and testing. It says the arrangement provides access to the best available process technology and reduces its capital requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also offers a cloud-based Wi-Fi analytics and monitoring platform for diagnosing and fixing network.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in Fremont, California, Quantenna has offices for design and sales support in Australia, China, Russia, and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than four-fifths of the company's revenue is generated in Asia; about 54% comes from China and 12% from Taiwan. Tunisia accounts for 7% and the US, 3%. The rest comes from the other countries in which Quantenna has customers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Quantenna has its own sales force that works directly with customers. The company also sells to third-party distributors who resell to OEMs and ODMs. Its Wi-Fi products are integrated into OEMs' gateways, set-top boxes, repeaters, and routers, which are sold primarily to service providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   About half of the company's revenue in 2015 came from five customers. Technicolor accounted for 15% of revenue and Pace (acquired by ARRIS Technologies in 2016) accounted for 14%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Quantenna's revenue increased 25% and its net loss dropped by half in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue hit $83.8 million in 2015, rising from $66.9 million in 2014. Comparing the first nine months of 2015 and 2016, revenue rose 57% to $91.6 million in 2016 from $58.4 million in 2015. The company reported higher sales volumes on flat average selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quantenna's net loss was $7 million in 2015, down from $13.6 million in 2014. The company's net loss through the first nine months of 2016 was $1.9 million. The company reduced its losses in 2015 and in 2016 as sales grew at a faster rate than expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported negative cash flow in 2014 and 2015, but was cash flow positive through nine months of 2016.

  <p>
   Quantenna's MO is R&amp;D. The company devotes much of its resources in money and personnel to developing and designing new Wi-Fi chips. The company spent about 36% of revenue on R&amp;D in 2015, compared to $31.2 million (45% of revenue) in 2014. By contrast, it spent about $6.6 million on sales and marketing in 2015, up from $5.9 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   That R&amp;D investment has helped the company ship more than 80 million chips that are used in some 60 products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quantenna is working to move other Wi-Fi areas as well as develop products that go beyond Wi-Fi. It is developing products for retail OEMs for home and small and medium business applications as well as enterprise-level applications. The company also has its eye on consumer electronics, including wireless streaming of audio and video, wireless TVs, and wireless speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The consolidation going in the chip industry could have an impact on Quantenna. For example, Freescale, a collaborator and customer, was bought by
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   , which, in turn, is being acquired by
   <company id="11436">
    Qualcomm
   </company>
   , a Quantenna competitor.
