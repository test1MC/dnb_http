  <p>
   Paul Johnston was the president of Glen Alden Corp. until its 1972 merger with Rapid-American Corp. That year Johnston bought Glen Alden's textile operations and established Johnston Industries. During the next decade the company diversified into steel fabrication and oil and gas exploration (both divested). In 1983 it went public, and in 1984 auto parts specialist G/I Export Corp. bought the company. The next year it was renamed Johnston Industries, Inc. (JII). The auto parts business was later phased out.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its early years JII made fabrics for work clothes. It soon diversified into industrial, home-furnishing, and fashion items. In 1995 it bought its UK partner's stake in a joint venture renamed Johnston Industries Composite Reinforcements. The company bought the publicly traded portion of subsidiary Jupiter National the next year. The acquisitions and problems associated with aged facilities depressed 1996 earnings and caused a loss in 1997. In response, JII brought in KPMG Peat Marwick (now KPMG LLP) veteran Clark Ogle. He streamlined operations and closed facilities, cutting debt in half. Ogle became CEO in 1998. David Chandler, chairman since 1981 and owner of 44% of the company, died that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 JII was bought with cash by Atlanta investment firm CGW Southeast Partners IV LLP, making it a privately held company. It created JI Fabrics, into which its greige and finished fabrics divisions were consolidated. In 2001, CEO Ogle was replaced by Gene Cone, previously president of the company's Fabrics division. Facing tough market conditions that year, the company consolidated operations, resulting in the closure of its Columbus Mill facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   On January 31, 2003, Johnston Industries filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Georgia. Johnston Textiles, Inc., was formed in November 2003 and on December 5, 2003, purchased a majority of the assets of Johnston Industries' JI Fabrics Division. The new company was formed by Meriturn Partners and management of the new company.
