   Penton Media hopes to regain its foothold as a trade magazine publishing powerhouse. The business-to-business information provider produces more than 110 magazines and associated websites, and about 60 industry events. It covers nearly 20 markets, such as Commercial Aviation, Food, and Electronics, with titles including
   <em>
    Air Transport World, Electronic Design,
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Broadcast Engineering.
   </em>
   Penton also provides custom media and marketing services and rich data products (how-to manuals, valuation guides, business lists, and technical information). The company was founded by John Penton in 1892. Today it is owned by private equity firm MidOcean Partners and U.S. Equity Partners II, an affiliate of Wasserstein &amp; Co.

        <p>
   Penton Media operates about 20 offices in 15 US states and has international offices in Canada and China.

        <p>
   Following its emergence from bankruptcy, the company's next major order of business was the formation of the Penton Restaurant Group, which includes print, online, events, and research assets. Penton launched the Group after acquiring
   <em>
    Nation's Restaurant News
   </em>
   from business-to-business publisher
   <company id="107257">
    Lebhar-Friedman
   </company>
   . Also included in the Group are Penton titles
   <em>
    Restaurant Hospitality
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Food Management
   </em>
   . The purchase of
   <em>
    Nation's Restaurant News
   </em>
   and the formation of the Restaurant Group lets Penton reach more restaurant operators in the US than any other trade publisher.

   Penton has been focusing on its digital operations and branching into the marketing services arena in order to keep up with the crowded business-to-business playing field. The emphasis on digital media comes after Penton suffered from a shift in readers away from print media. Along with the rest of the media world, Penton experienced a decline in advertising spending as a result of the troubled economy.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a move signaling the company's strategic push into the fast-growing field of business-to-business sustainability services, in 2012 Penton Media invested in a strategic alliance with Chicago-based GreenPoint Partners to develop and commercialize "Green Per Square Foot (PSF)", a web-based "energy efficiency marketplace. Also that year Penton Media launched WealthManagement.com, a new digital resource for financial and estate planning professionals.

        <p>
   In 2012 Penton Media acquired Farm Progress from Fairfax Media Limited of Sydney, Australia for $79.9 million. The deal significantly expanded its agriculture sector footprint in North America and directly supports a key Penton strategy of increasing investment in existing sectors that offer strong long-term growth potential.

        <p>
   Also in 2012 the company acquired Highline LP of the UK. Highline is a business and commercial aviation company that provides global data and sales support. Back in fiscal 2011 Penton expanded its online marketing capabilities with the acquisition of EyeTraffic.

        <p>
   Penton Media's roots are grounded in
   <i>
    Foundry,
   </i>
   a trade magazine published by Detroit iron molder John Penton in 1892. By 1901 Penton headed the Iron and Steel Press Company and published a second journal,
   <i>
    The Iron Trade Review.
   </i>
   Adopting the name Penton Publishing by 1922, the company continued expanding its trade publications and ventured into media auditing in the 1930s. Penton also participated in the development of the U.S. Census Bureau's Standard Industrial Classification system in the 1930s and 1940s.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company established its Penton Press printing operation in 1968 (sold in 1999). Pittway acquired Penton eight years later and merged it with Industrial Publishing Company to form Penton/IPC. The 1980s saw Penton/IPC expand its string of publications, and its 1994 acquisition of Feather Fine brought the company into direct mail. Former Miller Freeman president Thomas Kemp was named Penton's CEO in 1996. The following year it entered the trade show business with purchases of A/E/C SYSTEMS International, Industrial Shows of America, and UK-based Independent Exhibitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was rechristened Penton Media in 1998 and spun off from Pittway. It soon purchased Donohue Meehan Publishing (trade publications) and broadened its Internet interests with the $274 million purchase of
   <company id="42499">
    Mecklermedia.
   </company>
   In 1999 the company acquired New Hope Communications, a natural products media group (now New Hope Natural Media). The next year Penton divested its direct mail operations and announced the development of B2Bshowplace.com, an online trade show network (closed in 2001). Later in 2000, Penton Media acquired trade show producer Streaming Media for $65 million. The firm also bought Professional Trade Shows, adding another 50 shows for plant engineering and maintenance industries to its roster.
  </p>
        <p>
   A slowdown in the economy during 2000 led to less advertising spending and a drop in circulation for some of Penton's technology and Internet titles. The company responded in 2001 with staff cuts (250 overall, a 14% reduction) and halting publication of seven magazines to save on costs. In 2003 Penton sold its Professional Trade Shows division (which produces regional industrial trade shows) to
   <company id="121037">
    Cygnus Business Media
   </company>
   for less than $5 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Penton Media purchased four business-to-business magazines from
   <company id="134424">
    Wilson Publications
   </company>
   in 2004. Thomas Kemp, chairman and CEO, left the company in mid-2004. David Nussbaum, an EVP of the company, replaced him as CEO. Penton Media exited the European market in 2004 and intends to expand in Asia and the US. The company acquired DVGM &amp; Associates (DBA Microsoft Developer-to-Developer) for about $1.4 million, as well as Kosher World Conference &amp; Expo from Shows International for about $0.4 million in 2005.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was acquired in early 2007 by Prism Business Media, which then merged their operations. Nussbaum left the company following the merger and was replaced by Prism Business Media head John French. In 2008 information executive Sharon Rowlands replaced French. The company filed for Chapter 11 in 2010; the newly reogranized Penton exited bankruptcy about a month later with its debt reduced by some $270 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Later in 2010 the company acquired
   <em>
    Nation's Restaurant News
   </em>
   from business-to-business publisher
   <company id="107257">
    Lebhar-Friedman
   </company>
   and formed Penton Restaurant Group. The following year the company launched Penton Marketing Services.
