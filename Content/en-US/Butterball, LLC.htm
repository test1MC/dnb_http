   At the Thanksgiving table, many consumers also give thanks to Butterball.

Butterball boasts the world's largest turkey-processing plant located in Mount Olive, North Carolina. The poultry processor also operates breeder, growing, and research farms; diagnostic labs; feed mills; and hatcheries. Through its purchase of

   Butterball has been putting down roots and streamlining its plant locations in recent years. The iconic turkey producer moved its corporate offices outside Raleigh, North Carolina, to be closer to its top production facility. Butterball also sold its Longmont operations, which produced turkey hot dogs, to Mexico's

    Sigma Alimentos
   </company>
   . Butterball also decided to shutter its Colorado plant at the end of 2011, citing high feed costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet a rise in consumer demand for turkey burgers, Butterball in 2012 expanded its burger line and new tray pack and roll stock roast lines at its Carthage, Missouri, facility. The move helped to streamline operations.

   The company works hard to maintain a diverse products portfolio. Some newer products include Butterball Ground Turkey in a chub package and Premium Turkey Franks. Frequently rolling out new items -- such as its cooked turkey breasts, turkey sausages, ground turkey, and fresh tray pack, bone-in and boneless turkey -- is part of the firm's commitment to giving traction to its brand name.

   Butterball in 2013 acquired Illinois-based
   <company id="118883">
    Gusto Packing Co.
   </company>
   to provide the company with an additional 325 million pounds of processed capacity, thanks to Gusto's 260,000-sq.-ft. production plant. Known for its six basic product lines, Gusto gives Butterball added traction in expanding geographically for greater account penetration. Buying Gusto also gave Butterball a leg up in pork processing.
