   ON Semi's revenue increased 10.5% in 2015 to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion in 2014. For the second straight year the image sensor group drove revenue gain, adding $411 million to the company's revenue, a 134% growth rate. The other segments were flat or had lower sales in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher revenue and lower spending on restructuring left ON Semi with a 9% profit increase in 2015. The number hit $206 million, up from $189 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations slowed to $470 million in 2015 from $481 million in 2014 because of a change in working capital.

    Strategy
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   ON Semi wants to make its biggest market, automotive electronics, even bigger. The company's automotive products do jobs throughout vehicles including reducing emissions, improving fuel economy and safety, enhancing lighting, and controlling brakes and other systems. To move faster in a fast growing automotive market, ON Semi paid $400 million to buy Aptina Imaging, a provider of CMOS image sensors for automotive and industrial markets. Image sensors are increasingly used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. The acquisition helped drive image sensor sales 134% higher in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, On Semi introduced next generation products in two of its lines. In imaging, it added the Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) / Auto Focus (AF) driver to its portfolio. It brings a still camera and video to smart phones, tablets, notebooks, and wearables. Also in 2016 the company launched a new series of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), which use its proprietary Ultra Field Stop trench technology.

   <b>
    Mergers and Acquisitions
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   ON Semi concluded its purchase of Fairchild Semiconductor in September 2016. The $2.4 billion acquisition will help ON Semi diversify with Fairchild's products for power conversion, industrial, and automotive markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The $8 million acquisition of AXSEM in 2015 added a range of low-power radio frequency (RF) chips for wireless connectivity to support advanced functionality in the Internet of Things (IoT).
  </p>
  <p>
   In another move to strengthen its image sensor business, ON Semi acquired Truesense Imaging, a provider of image sensor devices for machine vision, surveillance, traffic monitoring, medical and scientific imaging, and photography. The $95 million cash deal expands ON Semi's technology portfolio and adds more than 200 new customers.

   ON Semiconductor and
   <company id="114089">
    Freescale
   </company>
   were both spun off from
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola
   </company>
   in 1999, with ON Semi making analog, standard, advanced logic chips, as well as discrete small signal and power components. Investment firm
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   owned 91% of ON Semi and Motorola held the rest. The next year ON Semi went public, raising more than $500 million in its IPO. Also that year it bought Cherry Semiconductor for about $250 million, which expanded it into multiphase controllers, drivers, and automotive/industrial power management components. In 2005 and 2006 it opened engineering centers in South Korea and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 ON Semi acquired
   <company id="106505">
    AMIS Holdings
   </company>
   , the parent company of AMI Semiconductor, for around $613 million in stock. The merger bolstered ON Semi's portfolio of analog and power management chips. Previous shareholders of ON Semi owned approximately 74% of the combined company. Also that year the company acquired
   <company id="16031">
    Catalyst Semiconductor
   </company>
   for about $115 million in stock. The purchase added analog and mixed-signal devices to its product portfolio, along with EEPROMs and flash memory devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 ON Semiconductor acquired
   <company id="12876">
    California Micro Devices
   </company>
   for $108 million in cash. Cal Micro made semiconductor protection devices for telecommunications and electronics markets applications, and its products enhanced ON Semiconductor's protection and lighting product portfolio. Also that year it bought Sound Design Technologies (SDT) for about $22 million in cash. The Canadian firm designs ultra-low-power semiconductors for hearing aids and audio processing applications. SDT became part of ON Semi's Medical Division in Ontario, Canada.
