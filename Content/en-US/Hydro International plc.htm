   There may be a lot of water under the bridge, but Hydro International knows how to control it. The group specializes in technologies that can control stormwater and also treat wastewater. Wastewater, its largest division, makes fine grit removal products such as Grit King and Hydro-Sludge Screen. The products from its Stormwater division, including Hydro Filterra and Downstream Defender, remove dissolved and floating pollutants from water flows, as well as manage the quantity and flow of stormwater. It also offers rainwater harvesting systems. Hydro manufactures in Ireland, the UK, and the US, and distributes its equipment worldwide. The company was acquired by Hannover Investors in 2016 for Â£29 million.
