   Making the earth's soil produce more crops is the long term mission of Terra Nitrogen, which manufactures nitrogen fertilizer products. The company operates a plant in Oklahoma that produces ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solutions. Farmers use the company's products to improve both the quantity and the quality of crops. It sells its products to parent company, agrochemical giant
   <company id="40088">
    CF Industries
   </company>
   , which in turn sells nitrogen products wholesale to dealers, distributors, and national farm retail chain outlets, primarily in the central and Southern Plains and Corn Belt regions of the US. CF Industries has indirect ownership of Terra Nitrogen's general partner and controls the company.

   Terra Nitrogen's primary asset is a nitrogen manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. The Verdigris site has two ammonia plants, two nitric acid plants and two UAN plants. The Oklahoma facility has access to an abundant supply of natural gas through the
   <company id="11107">
    ONEOK
   </company>
   (Panhandle) intrastate gas pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, the company produced about 1.1 million tons of ammonia, and 2 million tons of UAN, and sold about 2.3 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It conducts its operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   <company id="40088">
    CF Industries
   </company>
   , is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP. Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. has full control of TNCLP's business affairs.

  <p>
   Terra Nitrogen's revenues decreased by 6% in 2013 due to lower production as a result of a planned plant turnaround that was completed during the third quarter of 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by 10% 2013 due to lower revenues and higher costs. The average cost of goods sold per ton increased to $96 per ton in 2013 from $85 per ton in fiscal 2012. The increase was due to higher natural gas prices, a rise in maintenance costs resulting from increased maintenance activities, a jump in payroll costs (associated with a plant turnaround) and higher depreciation costs.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company broke ground on two additional on-site storage tanks with capacities of 30,000 tons of ammonia and 50,000 tons of UAN. These projects are expected to be completed in 2014.
