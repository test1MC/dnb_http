   As the #1 producer of warm fuzzies, Hallmark Cards is the Goliath of greeting cards. The company's cards are sold under brand names Hallmark, Shoebox, and Ambassador and can be found in more than 30,000 US retail stores. (About 2,200 stores bear the Hallmark Gold Crown name; the majority of these stores are independently owned.) Hallmark also offers electronic greeting cards, gifts, and flowers through its website. In addition to greeting cards, the company owns crayon manufacturer
   <company id="104516">
    Crayola
   </company>
   (formerly Binney &amp; Smith), about 90% of cable broadcaster
   <company id="99854">
    Crown Media
   </company>
   , and Kansas City's Crown Center real estate development firm. Members of the founding Hall family own two-thirds of Hallmark.

   Hallmark Business Connections is a unit that targets businesses with products such as incentives, greeting cards, and gifts for employees and customers. The Hallmark brand can also be found on television through a licensing agreement with Crown Media, which operates cable's Hallmark Channel. Hallmark-branded programming includes
   <em>
    Hallmark Hall of Fame
   </em>
   original movies, a concept that debuted in 1951 during the era of fully-sponsored TV programming.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other Hallmark subsidiaries include DaySpring Cards (Christian greeting cards and gifts), Hallmark Baby (online children's wear), Halls LLC (operates the Halls on Grand department store in Kansas City), and Feeln (film production and streaming video service).

  <p>

   The company announced a strategic alliance with
   <company id="138418">
    Shutterfly
   </company>
   to feature its customizable cards on Shutterfly's website. Hallmark made the deal to enhance its brand presence in the growing personalized greetings category.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Hallmark recorded revenues of about $3.8 billion, a 2% decrease from the previous year when the company brought in a little more than $3.9 billion. The company has faced several years of single digit declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cautious consumer spending led to a decline in revenue for the operating units which includes greetings, gift wrap, partyware and gifts. Crayola also posted lower numbers as it's building a theme park in Orlando, Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   Publicly traded Crown Media posted an 40% increase in total revenue for fiscal 2014 and Crown Center also delivered higher revenue.

   Product development has been key for its traditional card business. Hallmark has adapted to changes in technology by launching updated versions of its paper cards. The company has found success with products such as musical cards (Cards With Sound), cards with custom recorded messages (Recordable Cards With Music), and cards with animated scenes (Cards With Motion). In 2015 it signed a licensing deal with Mattel that will let it release Barbie and Hot Wheels branded cards, ornaments, and merchandise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hallmark also gains advertising revenues from TV distribution. In 2012 The Hallmark Channel acquired the sitcom
   <em>
    The Middle
   </em>
   , adding to its 2011 purchase of
   <em>
    Frasier
   </em>
   ; it made the purchases as part of its strategy to acquire and schedule popular series to compliment its block of comedy programming.
  </p>
  <p>
   Retail may yet make a comeback for the company. It has been testing a shop-in-shop concept at J.C. Penney stores. Hallmark has also been experimenting with a small boutique-style store where shoppers can design, create, and personalize cards and gifts. These HMK Stores are located in Missouri, Texas, and Colorado.

  <p>
   Eighteen-year-old Joyce Hall started selling picture postcards from two shoe boxes in his room at the Kansas City, Missouri, YMCA in 1910. His brother Rollie joined him the next year, and the two added greeting cards to their line in 1912. The brothers opened Hall Brothers, a store that sold postcards, gifts, books, and stationery, but it was destroyed in a 1915 fire. The Halls got a loan, bought an engraving company, and produced their first original cards in time for Christmas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1921 a third brother, William, joined the firm, which started stamping the backs of its cards with the phrase "A Hallmark Card." By 1922 Hall Brothers had salespeople in all 48 states. The firm began selling internationally in 1931.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hall Brothers patented the "Eye-Vision" display case for greeting cards in 1936 and sold it to retailers across the country. The company aired its first radio ad in 1938. The next year it introduced a friendship card, displaying a cart filled with purple pansies. The card became the company's best seller. During WWII Joyce Hall persuaded the government not to curtail paper supplies, arguing that his greeting cards were essential to the nation's morale.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened its first retail store in 1950. The following year marked the first production of
   <i>
    Hallmark Hall of Fame,
   </i>
   TV's longest-running dramatic series and winner of more Emmy awards than any other program. Hall Brothers changed its name to Hallmark Cards in 1954 and introduced its Ambassador line of cards five years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hallmark introduced paper party products and started putting
   <i>
    Peanuts
   </i>
   characters on cards in 1960. Donald Hall, Joyce Hall's son, was appointed CEO in 1966. Two years later Hallmark opened Crown Center, which surrounded company headquarters in Kansas City. Disaster struck in 1981 when two walkways collapsed at Crown Center's Hyatt Regency hotel, killing 114 and injuring 225.
  </p>
  <p>
   Joyce Hall died in 1982, and Donald Hall became both chairman and CEO. Hallmark acquired Crayola Crayon maker Binney &amp; Smith in 1984 (it became
   <company id="104516">
    Crayola
   </company>
   in 2007). It introduced Shoebox Greetings, a line of nontraditional cards, in 1986. In 1999 the company acquired portrait studio chain The Picture People (sold 2005) and Christian greeting card maker DaySpring Cards. It also acquired a stake in cable channel Odyssey, which was later renamed the Hallmark Channel (now operated by
   <company id="99854">
    Crown Media
   </company>
   ).
