   Waukesha-Pearce Industries (WPI) wants its customers to start their engines. Through its Engine Division, the company designs and packages engine-driven equipment, such as power generators, pumps, blowers, control panels, and switchgear. WPI also offers a slate of heavy construction and mining products, including earth movers and demolition equipment made by such OEMs as
   <company id="42389">
    Komatsu
   </company>
   and
   <company id="51601">
    Gradall Industries
   </company>
   , through its Construction Machinery Division. As part of its business, the company sells used equipment and leases heavy earth-moving equipment. Founded as Portable Rotary Rig Co. in 1924 by Louis M. Pearce, Sr., the company is owned and run by the Pearce family.

   From its headquarters in Houston, WPI serves customers through more than a dozen locations in Texas and another 15 across Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas, Alabama, Kansas, California, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company's training facility is located in Sugar Land, Texas, outside Houston.

   WPI's Engine Equipment lineup includes its own Enginator, used in field gas compression and power generation. Its Engine Division further supports WPI's performance by offering less economy-driven services, such as certified remanufactured engines and revamping.

   WPI's Construction Machinery arm benefits from a broad products portfolio paired with distributor affiliations. Such alliances include Bomag (compaction equipment), Allied/Rammer (demolition equipment),

   Crushing (wearparts), Sennebogen (material handling), and
   <company id="90939">

   (cranes). Like the Engine Equipment Division, this segment is able to mitigate a recession's impact on capital equipment sales by providing repair and onsite maintenance services along with a multi-million-dollar inventory of used and rental equipment and parts.
