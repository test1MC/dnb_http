   XGel may sound like something emitted from one of Professor Charles Xavier's
   <em>
    X-Men
   </em>
   students, but in reality it's BioProgress Technology's super power. The company manufactures XGel for the pharmaceutical industry as a replacement for gelatin in drug capsules. It's used as a carrier for flavorings, vitamins, minerals, and supplements. Products that use XGel include Menoflavon, a nutritional supplement for women; Androflavon, a nutritional supplement for men; and a line of vitamins under the brand Kudos. The underfunded company went into administration (bankruptcy) in 2013 and dissolved in mid-2014.

   BioProgress Technology, a specialty pharmaceutical and OTC product company uses its XGEL polymer technologies to develop and improve medicines and healthcare products.

   The company seeks capital funding to help expand it operations. In 2013 it received interest from a global pharmaceutical company for the intellectual property of a specific patented technology, but unfortunately the sale did not materialize. No further funding was forthcoming and as a result BioProgress Technology's directors placed the company into administration (bankruptcy). It is now actively marketing the company's assets.

  <p>
   The technology for XGel was owned by specialty pharmaceutical and healthcare company Meldex International Plc until the company went bankrupt in 2010. At the same time, management put together a new holding company, XGEL Limited, to acquire BioProgress Technology.
