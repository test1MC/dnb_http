   Anam Semiconductor's family tree took root in 1956 when South Korean entrepreneur Kim Hyang-soo started a business supplying labor for mechanical and electronic manufacturers. Kim's oldest son, Ju-Jin (James), began business studies in the US and was an economics professor at
   <company id="116204">
    Villanova University
   </company>
   by 1968 when he convinced his father to branch into electronics assembly. Anam Industrial was born, and two years later James Kim founded
   <company id="52869">
    Amkor Technology
   </company>
   (Amkor is short for "American-Korean") to serve as a US marketing arm for Anam.
  </p>
  <p>
   James Kim quickly put his economics background to work, devising creative tax breaks for Amkor. Anam Industrial went on to become Korea's first semiconductor maker, the core business of what would become an empire.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next two decades saw Anam grow from humble roots, diversifying into businesses ranging from wristwatches to big-screen televisions. By the early 1990s Anam's semiconductor business was thriving (it performed 50% of the world's semiconductor package assembly), but it was only one part of what had by then become the Anam Group, a family-run
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   (conglomerate). Encompassing a host of businesses, the Anam Group included Anam Electronics (computers, modems, and VCRs), Anam Telecom (digital wireless communications), and Anam Environmental Industry (industrial waste disposal). When his father retired in 1992, James Kim took over as head of the sprawling group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Korean economy took a dive in the late 1990s, and
   <i>
    chaebol
   </i>
   were hit hardest. Korean president Kim Dae Jung targeted the inbred conglomerates (long a mainstay of the Korean economy) in his sweeping fiscal reforms, and Anam Group was forced to enter a bankruptcy-like restructuring program. To raise capital, Anam Group sold off all other businesses to focus on chip operations, changing its name in 1998 to Anam Semiconductor. (Anam Group, which consolidated its businesses and entered a workout program similar to bankruptcy, no longer formally exists.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Anam Semiconductor sold its test and packaging operations to Amkor, effectively reducing the company to a single fabrication facility. Amkor upped its stake in Anam to about 40%. In 2000 Amkor executives took on duties at Anam. Anam and Amkor already shared a long history of cooperation; Amkor CEO James Kim had been chairman of both companies, and his father founded Anam Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a busy year in 2000 -- when many Anam employees worked through holidays to meet customer demand for wafers -- the company was hit hard in 2001 by the global meltdown in the chip industry; in some periods Anam's fab ran at only 25% of capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2002 Amkor sold part of its stake in Anam to Korean conglomerate Dongbu Group, making Dongbu Anam's leading shareholder. Dongbu Group merged Anam Semiconductor with its Dongbu Electronics subsidiary to form DongbuAnam Semiconductor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four years later, DongbuAnam Semiconductor changed its name to Dongbu Electronics. In 2007, Dongbu Electronics was merged with Dongbu Hannong Chemicals, and the company's name was changed again to Dongbu HiTek.
