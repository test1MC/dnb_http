Greenheck Fan operates plants in the US as well as Asia and Mexico, and it is supported by a distribution network in the US and a global sales force.

   Greenheck grows by expanding and opening new facilities. In 2013 it announced plans to invest $30 million to expand its operations in Shelby, North Carolina, and to establish a new manufacturing operation near its existing Kings Mountain facility. This new plant will accelerate growth of its centrifugal, vane axial, and industrial fan business.

   The company made an international move to expand in late 2013 with the establishment of Greenheck India Private Ltd, located in Bawal, India. The new location in India will serve customers in both the Indian and Middle Eastern markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Greenheck Fan threw its hat into the social media arena when it launched its new Toolbox App that allows engineers and contractors to make quick calculations. The app allows users to to input, measure, and calculate fan values. It also allows them to measure HVAC duct and is available on Apple and Android products.
