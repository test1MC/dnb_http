   In 2015 Berlin-based magazine building platform Styla raised a â‚¬2.5 million in seed round led by Redalpine and Pentland. The company, founded in 2012, offers an easy digital magazine layout for non-developers, using algorithms to design the pages, plus e-commerce capabilities. Styla already has clients like Grazia magazine's Graziashop.

   Since making a splash with Speedo's LZR Racer swimsuit at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Pentland has rapidly expanded the line made famous by swimmer Michael Phelps. Among the launches, the company unveiled three suits that, like the original, are made of ultra-lightweight and water-repelling fabrics. Games played by the US water polo team are also sponsored by Speedo. Pentland said interest and participation in swimming has grown because of the Game's pool competitions, enabling Speedo to win a serious following.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid Speedo's success, Pentland's business remains challenged by slowness in European consumer spending and higher markdowns in US sportswear. The group has turned to strengthen its brick-and-mortar retail stores, where many of its name brand products are sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   It holds more than a 55% stake in athletic clothing and footwear retailer

   and outdoor retail chains Blacks and Millets (owned by

   ), acquired by JD out of administration (bankruptcy in the US) in 2012.

  <p>
   Berko and Minnie Rubin started the company as Liverpool Shoe in 1932. Making mostly private-label shoes, it grew by acquiring other shoemakers and went public in 1964. Son Stephen took over five years later and, with its interests broadening, renamed the company Pentland Industries in 1971. Pentland started its first branded line of shoes and sportswear in 1978, and by 1980 it had acquired several shoemakers and started overseas production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pentland made its most notable acquisition in 1981 by purchasing 55% of athletic shoemaker
   <company id="11266">
    Reebok USA
   </company>
   for $77,500. Chairman of Reebok USA from 1981 to 1984, Stephen Rubin directed the company's efforts to sourcing in Asia and improving marketing. Sales rocketed to the point that when Pentland sold the last of its Reebok shares in 1991, they were worth over $450 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1980s Pentland began diversifying, buying interests in heating and air conditioning, real estate, and refrigeration. In 1990 it acquired a stake in Authentic Fitness, which held the North American license for Speedo. Pentland gained worldwide ownership of the Speedo brand in 1991. It bought PONY International from
   <company id="92632">
    adidas
   </company>
   that year and in 1993 purchased 80% of PONY USA, buying the rest in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1993 Pentland bought UK sporting goods brands Berghaus (outdoor apparel) and Ellesse (tennis and ski apparel), as well as a 75% stake in the Brasher Boot Company. Two years later it added Maine Woods (a US footwear maker) and became a worldwide footwear licensee of LaCoste. The company's non-core units were sold in 1996 and 1997 to focus on apparel and footwear.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a 1997 restructuring of its North American operations (which had been losing money since 1995), Pentland announced in 1998 it would close or sell its fashion footwear brands in the US, including Danexx, Maine Woods, and Franco Sarto. In 1999 the Rubin family's Robert Stephen Holdings bought the 38% of Pentland that it did not already own.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company introduced its Speedo Fastskin swimming suits that utilize sharkskin technology to minimize drag. The suits were worn by several gold-medal winning swimmers in the 2000 Olympics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Pentland became the worldwide exclusive licensee (excluding the US and Canada) for Ted Baker footwear. Also that year, the company purchased the remaining 25% of the Brasher Boot Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched its Lacoste and Ted Baker footwear brands in the US in 2004. The footwear lines, already being sold throughout Europe and Asia, are available at independent retail stores, such as Fred Segal, Henri Bendel, and Porter Stevens. A year later its US division acquired Atsco Footwear Inc., which manufactures licensed products Ellesse and KangaROOS.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Pentland bought the Medium and ONETrueSaxon brands as it focused on footwear and men's fashion. Other additions to the company's brand portfolio included Scotland-based Hunter Boot, known for its green Wellingtons, in 2006 and premium denim maker Radcliffe in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speedo celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pentland Group also made a splash at the 2008 Olympics with the introduction of Speedo's LZR Racer swimming suit, which was developed with NASA. The suit is made with ultra-lightweight water-repellent material and is designed to reduce drag and resistance in the water. By the conclusion of the Beijing Games, swimmers wearing the suit had broken 23 world records and won 47 out of 50 gold medals, including US swimmer Michael Phelps, who racked up eight gold medals to become the winningest Olympian in a single Games.
