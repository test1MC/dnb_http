   Cardionetics aims straight for the heart. The UK-based company tackles cardiovascular disease by focusing on the diagnostic, monitoring, and screening needs of heart patients and health care professionals. Cardionetics specializes in ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors and report viewer software that allows test reports from its monitors to be saved and downloaded. Its monitors and event recorders automatically detect and classify significant arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular ectopic beats, pauses and arrests, and wide-complex tachycardias (rapid heart rates). Cardionetics is a part of Surface Technology International's funding unit, STI Capital.

  <p>
   Cardionetics has discontinued sales of its C.Net2000+ monitor, replacing it with the lighter-weight C.Net5000 monitor. The company, however, still fully supports the C.Net2000+ in terms of warranty, servicing, and consumables (electrode pads and leads, batteries, and electrode and batteries packs), as well as upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before becoming a part of STI Capital, the privately funded company received support from the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry and the British Heart Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cardionetics  was founded in 1995.
