   Edmunds.com is devoted to all things auto-related. The company's namesake site offers tools that help viewers shop for and compare new and used cars, search for deals, read car reviews, find dealers, and get advice on topics that include how to buy a car, buying versus leasing, safety, financing, and insurance. It also publishes a What's Hot section for car news, photos, videos and forums. Its True Cost to Own pricing system provides ownership cost (taxes and fees, insurance, repairs, fuel costs, maintenance) for new and used vehicles. The Edmunds.com car shopping app for mobile devices includes the company's pricing, research, and inventory search tools.

  <p>
   Edmunds.com primarily earns revenues from advertising. The company also makes money from lead referrals it supplies to clients such as automakers, dealers, and providers of services such as insurance, financing, and extended warranties. The company receives a fee after car shoppers request price quotes from these clients.

  <p>
   Like many online companies, Edmunds.com spread across many names and domains but has recently brought former satellites, including InsideLine.com (online magazine for auto enthusiasts) and AutoObsever.com (industry commentary), back under the Edmunds.com umbrella.

  <p>
   In 2014 Edmunds.com and ADP Dealer Services business unit Cobalt formed a strategic partnership. The companies are working together to bring insights into consumer behavior and in-market advertising.
