   After posting record-setting revenue of $2.85 billion in 2014, WABCO saw its revenues dip by 8% to $2.6 billion in 2015. Its profits also fell 6% from $292 million to $275 million during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were fueled by a 12% decrease in Europe sales and a 9% decline in other international countries. It also experienced lower demand from the OEM (7%) and aftermarket (10%) segments.

   The company's advanced technology keeps up with the industry, as well as paves new roads for the design of control systems for safety and performance. There is a growing market for a higher electronics content supporting control systems in commercial vehicles. Both European and Asian governments have enacted government mandates for more safety systems, opening opportunities for WABCO to answer the demand. Some of WABCO's innovations include the first heavy-duty truck ABS, the first commercial vehicle automated manual transmission controls system, and the first electronic stability control system (ESC), to name a few.

   WABCO has achieved growth through the use of acquisitions. In 2016 WABCO acquired MICO Incorporated, a global market provider of hydraulic components, controls and brake systems for heavy-duty, off-highway vehicles in agriculture, construction, mining, and similar industries for a purchase price of $75 million. MICO is headquartered in North Mankato, Minnesota. The acquisition provided it with access to new growth opportunities in the off-highway industry.
