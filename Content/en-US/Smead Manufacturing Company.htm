   Smead Manufacturing has kept its customers' offices organized for more than a century. The company manufactures and distributes more than 2,000 paper filing products in the US that are sold in office supply stores nationwide (including
   <company id="14308">
    Office Depot
   </company>
   ) and authorized resellers (such as
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   ). Smead's product assortment includes folders (hanging, tabbed, and expandable), labels, fasteners, and binder and report covers, as well as open and secure shelving systems. The company was founded in 1906 by Charles Smead and later sold to the Hoffman family. Smead is owned and run by the third generation of the Hoffman family.
