   Audio Research has built a business being in tune with its customers. The company manufactures high-end vacuum tube audio equipment, including amplifiers, preamplifiers, and CD players. Its products are sold in Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada, including about 30 states in the US. Technicians at Audio Research can repair, refurbish, and restore any product ever manufactured by the company. Some of the older models of equipment have become collector's items. The company was founded in 1970 by president William Johnson, who began his career designing custom audio electronics in the 1950s.
