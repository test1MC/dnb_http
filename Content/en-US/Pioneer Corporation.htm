   Pioneer takes you on a journey of sight and sound. A top maker of consumer and commercial electronics, Pioneer sells car electronics (stereos, speakers, navigation systems) to retailers and automobile makers. The company also sells other audio and video equipment to consumers (DVD players, stereo systems) and business customers (factory automation systems). In addition, its US-based Discovision Associates (DVA) licenses optical disc technologies. Pioneer has about 35 manufacturing facilities worldwide. The company -- Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha in Japanese -- was the first to offer customers the laser disc, car CD players, and car navigation devices that use a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS).

   Pioneer has been selling non-core assets to focus on its automotive electronics business. To that end, it has agreed to sell its DJ equipment business to private equity giant
   <company id="40268">
    KKR &amp; Co
   </company>
   . for $550 million. Previously, it said it will sell its home audio-visual business to audio equipment maker

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focusing on car navigation systems, a category that has grown to become a major revenue and profit source for the company.

  <p>
   Nozomu Matsumoto, son of a Christian missionary, first heard high-fidelity speakers in 1932; nothing made in Japan compared in quality. In 1938 he founded Fukuin Shokai Denki Seisakusho (Gospel Electric Works) in Osaka to repair radios and speakers. It later began making these items. Matsumoto designed the company's trademark -- a tuning fork overlaying the symbol for the ohm (a unit for measuring electrical resistance) -- and chose the brand name Pioneer to reflect the company's spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm introduced turntables and amplifiers in 1955 and hi-fi receivers in 1958. By the 1960s Pioneer Electronic was Japan's #1 audio equipment maker. It introduced the world's first stereo with speakers separate from the control unit in 1962 and the world's first car stereo in 1963. Subsidiaries opened in the US and Europe in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Convinced that laser disc (LD) technology was the wave of the future, Pioneer started work on a LD video player in 1972. Pioneer was listed on the NYSE four years later. It partnered with Discovision Associates (DVA, a partnership between
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and Music Corporation of America) in 1977 to form Universal Pioneer Corporation (UPC). Home LD players appeared in the US in 1980 and in Japan in 1981. But consumers wanted machines that could record, not just play, and demand for LDs remained sluggish.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matsumoto's eldest son, Seiya, became president in 1982. Two years later Pioneer introduced the world's first car CD system; it also created a LD/CD player, perhaps hoping customers would react better to LD products if they were combined with other features. Pioneer branched into office automation, introducing the Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) optical memory disk in 1985. In 1989 it bought DVA, by then a leading optical-disk research firm with more than 1,400 patents. Also that year it formed Pioneer Trimble with US-based
   <company id="15261">
    Trimble Navigation
   </company>
   to develop a computerized car navigation system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pioneer sold record company joint venture Warner-Pioneer to partner Warner -- now
   <company id="11482">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   -- in 1989, but it took another stab at the US entertainment business the next year when it bought 10% of theatrical filmmaker Carolco Pictures (
   <i>
    Basic Instinct
   </i>
   ). But like many high-profile Japanese investments in the US, Carolco turned sour: It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1995, leading Pioneer to write off its investment.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales not meeting expectations, in 1996 Pioneer replaced Seiya as president with his in-law Kaneo Ito (former head of Pioneer's Europe sales network); Seiya became chairman and his brother Kanya was made vice chairman. The company reentered the entertainment business with the 1996 launch of Pioneer Music Group. In 1997 Pioneer restructured itself into three separate operating units: Home Entertainment, Mobile Entertainment, and Business Systems; it added a Display Products unit the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company opted for a simpler moniker, removing the word "electronic" from its name. Chairman Seiya died that year and was replaced by brother Kanya. With price wars and slow sales in its software business eroding profits, Pioneer announced in 1999 a three-year plan to cut more than 2,500 jobs. In 2000 Pioneer started making TV set-top boxes for digital cable. In 2001 Pioneer established two production subsidiaries in China to generate DVD pickups (the lens that converts the laser reflection into digital info), DVD-R/RW drives, and car electronics products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pioneer decided to exit the software and music business, opting to focus on hardware; in 2003 it sold subsidiaries Pioneer LDC and Pioneer Entertainment (USA) to Japanese advertising agency
   <company id="40829">
    Dentsu
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   At the beginning of 2005, the company restructured its operations into two divisions, home entertainment and mobile entertainment, abolishing its plasma display OEM business to concentrate on only manufacturing Pioneer-branded displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company failed to increase its stake in the consumer electronics market and faced losses estimated at $200 million for the 2006 fiscal year, president and CEO Kaneo Ito and chairman Kanya Matsumoto stepped down at the end of 2005. In January 2006, EVP Tamihiko Sudo replaced Ito as president of the company. Also in 2006 the company sold its 100% stake in Pioneer Digital Technologies, a software developer for cable TV set-top boxes in the US, in a management buyout valued at $6.4 million. Other discontinued businesses include Pioneer Precision Machinery Corp. and its subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its car stereo speaker business, Pioneer in 2007 acquired more than 30% of its 67%-owned subsidiary Tohoku Pioneer Corporation to bring its ownership to more than 97%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pioneer paired with
   <company id="41785">
    Sharp Corporation
   </company>
   in 2007. Hindered by development costs associated with new product rollouts, Pioneer and Sharp, best known as the maker of Aquos-brand LCD TVs, inked a deal that ultimately gave Sharp a stake of more than 14% in Pioneer. The deal enabled the two technology firms to create "next generation" products more nimbly and share each other's expertise. As part of the agreement, the companies initially developed DVD-related products, tapping into Sharp's blue-violet laser diodes and Pioneer's optical disk technology. They also joined to develop network-related items for home electronics and are expected to boost their display and audio-visual products businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Susumu Kotani replaced Sudo as president in 2008.
