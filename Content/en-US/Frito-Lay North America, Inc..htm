The company makes some of the best-known and top-selling savory snacks in the United States, including Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos, Lay's, Ruffles, SunChips, and Tostitos. On the sweet side, Frito-Lay also makes Grandma's cookies, Funyuns onion-flavored rings, Cracker Jack candy-coated popcorn, and Smartfood popcorn. It also makes a line of chips made with the fat substitute Olestra under the Light brand name. Owned by

   , Frito-Lay North America's operations span the US and Canada and account for more than 20% of the soda maker's sales. Frito-Lay's sales in Mexico are reported within PepsiCo's Latin America Foods segment.

   To foster customer engagement and hopefully boost potato chip sales, Frito-Lay in 2013 launched the "Do Us a Flavor" contest that invites people to come up with new potato chip flavors with some interesting results. The four finalists in 2014 include cappuccino-flavored Lay's, Cheddar Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese, Mango Salsa, and Wasabi Ginger. Winners receive $1 million and get to see their flavor sold nationally.

   Frito-Lay North America's (FLNA) sales have been steadily growing in recent years. The company sold about $14.5 billion worth of snacks in 2014, up from $14.1 billion in 2013 and $13.6 billion in 2012. The 3% rise in 2014's sales was driven by volume growth and effective net pricing. FLNA's variety packs and its Sabra joint-venture products continued to outperform, posting double-digit growth, while its trademark Doritos brand delivered mid-single-digit growth. Dips also contributed with low-single-digit growth, while SunChips suffered another year of double-digit declines. Overall, the company's sales accounted for 22% of
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo's
   </company>
   total revenue in 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   FLNA's operating profit grew by 5% in 2014, thanks to revenue growth andplanned cost reductions across several expense categories. Lower commodity costs, especially from cooking oil and corn, drove operating profit growth by 2 percentage points during the year.

   While Frito-Lay may have a stranglehold on the fragmented snack market in North America, the company still recognizes the need to innovate to keep its product lines fresh and in the minds of consumers. In 2015, for example, the company introduced two new convenience snacks, Rold Gold Pretzel Dippers (in Cookies &amp; Cream and Fudge Brownie flavors) and Rold Gold Pretzel Cracker Sandwiches (in Sharp Cheddar and Creamy Fudge flavors). In 2014, the company expanded its health-conscious product portfolio with two new "40% less fat versions" of its Lay's Kettle Cooked potato chips, in Sea Salt &amp; Vinegar and Jalapeno Cheddar flavors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Continuing concern about obesity has led the company to refine some of its snack foods and begin making healthier versions of them. It has embarked on a plan to reduce sodium, fats, and sugar in its products, as well as introduce more whole grain foods to its line-up. It now offers a line of 100-calorie-per-portion products repackaged as Mini Bites and a variety of real fruit and vegetable crisps called Flat Earth. Hoping to reduce the overall salt content of its products by 25%, it makes low-sodium versions of its top-selling brands, including Lay's and Ruffles potato chips, Tostitos tortilla chips, and Fritos corn chips. To maintain their flavor, the company works with seasoning partners to improve the taste of its current product and work up new tastes.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also looks for opportunities to partner with other snack makers. Frito-Lay collaborates with beef-jerky maker Jack Link's to sell a line of Matador meat snacks. Aimed at younger, busy adults, the product takes advantage of Jack Link's meat-product manufacturing know-how and Frito-Lay's expertise in distribution, sales, and merchandising.

        <p>
   Elmer Doolin spent a nickel in September 1932 that changed his life. While waiting for a sandwich in a San Antonio cafe, Doolin spotted a bag of corn chips for sale at the counter and bought it for five cents. Doolin became so enamored of the product, tiny morsels of fried corn dough, he sought out the maker of the corn chips, a homesick Mexican, and struck a deal. With $100 in borrowed money, he bought the recipe, 19 retail accounts, and a potato ricer. Thus was born the Frito, which Doolin sold from his Model T Ford. The company expanded and moved to Dallas in 1933.
  </p>
        <p>
   About that time, H. W. Lay was distributing potato chips from his car in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1938 Lay bought his supplier and changed its name to H.W. Lay and Company. The company was among the first snack companies to advertise on television, running a commercial featuring a cartoon character -- Oscar, the Happy Potato.
  </p>
        <p>
   Doolin in 1945 granted Lay the license to manufacture and distribute Fritos in the Southeast. The companies merged in 1961, creating a $135 million dollar company with a national distribution system for Fritos, Lay's, Ruffles, and Cheetos (introduced by Frito in 1948). Also in 1961 Frito-Lay bought Rold Gold Foods from American Cone and Pretzel.
  </p>
        <p>
   Four years later Frito-Lay merged with PepsiCo. In 1966 PepsiCo introduced Doritos. Sales soared, making it the company's #2 product, behind Lay's. Frito-Lay's popularity and profitability continued, even as a national crusade against junk food in the early 1970s warned of inadequate nutrition in salty snacks.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired the Grandma's cookies line in 1980, and in 1981 it introduced Tostitos. Sales began to slip in the late 1980s as regional competitors enjoyed a surge in popularity. Cola war veteran Roger Enrico was brought in from PepsiCo to turn things around. As chairman, he restyled the Fritos bag, hired celebrity pitchmen, and slashed prices. New products such as SunChips, Wavy Lay's, and Baked Tostitos contributed to the bottom line. By 1992 the company was back on top. (Enrico eventually became CEO of PepsiCo.)
  </p>
        <p>
   PepsiCo combined its various snack-food operations into a single unit called Frito-Lay in 1996. The company bought 104-year-old Cracker Jack from Borden Foods the next year, entering the sweet-snack market. It purchased some salty-snack businesses from
   <company id="90455">
    United Biscuits
   </company>
   in 1998, including its Australian Smith's brand, for $440 million. Other international transactions that year included forming a joint venture with Venezuelan rival Savoy Brands (maker of Pepitos and Cheese Trix) covering nine Latin and Central American countries. Frito-Lay also acquired Savoy's Argentina business.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 it introduced the WOW! line of chips made with Olestra, the fat substitute developed by snack rival and maker of Pringles,
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   . In 1999 the firm unveiled its first logo redesign in 20 years. Steven Reinemund, Frito-Lay's chairman and CEO since 1992, became president at PepsiCo that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   After PepsiCo bought
   <company id="11237">
    The Quaker Oats Company
   </company>
   in 2001, some of Quaker's snack food products, including its granola bars and rice snacks, were added to Frito-Lay's North American product line.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the company eliminated trans fats and hydrogenated oils from some of its most popular salty snacks, including Doritos, Tostitos, and Cheetos. That year it also introduced a line of snacks aimed at the Hispanic market (brand names include Santitas, Sabritones, and El Isleño Plantains). In 2003 Frito-Lay introduced Lay's Stax as a competitor to
   <company id="11211">
    P&amp;G
   </company>
   's Pringles.
  </p>
        <p>
   Due to negative publicity surrounding the gastrointestinal side-effects of ingesting Olestra and resultant slow sales of WOW!, Frito-Lay changed the name of the product to Light in 2004. The low-calorie snacks, however, are still cooked in Olestra. In a move to consolidate its manufacturing operations, in 2004 the company closed four Frito-Lay plants.
  </p>
        <p>
   Responding to consumers' dietary and obesity concerns, the company removed trans fats from all of its products by 2004. In a similar vein, it introduced veggie and fruit chips under the name Smart Spot and extended its multigrain SunChips line in 2006. It also acquired Stacy's Pita Chip Company that year. In order to reduce the saturated fats in its Lay's and Ruffles potato chips, Frito-Lay began cooking them in sunflower oil (instead of cottonseed oil) in 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   Albert Carey was named president and CEO of the company in 2006. Carey, a 25-year Pepsi veteran, replaced Irene Rosenfeld, also a long-time Pepsi employee, who left Frito-Lay's top spot to become president and CEO of
