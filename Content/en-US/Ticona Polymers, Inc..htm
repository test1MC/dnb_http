   You'll have to excuse Ticona Polymers if it gets a little wrapped up in its business. The company is a business unit of
   <company id="136265">
    Celanese Corporation
   </company>
   that makes the plastic that is used to package food and other consumer goods. Products include acetyl polymers, liquid crystal polymers, long fiber reinforced thermoplastics, and other thermoplastics. Its products are sold directly by the company in Europe and the Americas and through joint ventures throughout Asia. Those products are used by the automotive, electronics, communications, and medical technology industries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ticona has 10 factories worldwide. It operates production, compounding and research facilities in Brazil, China, Germany, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A part of its parent's Advanced Engineered Materials segment, the company makes high-performance engineering polymers for electronic, energy storage, fuel system, power train, and thermal management applications. Its products include Celanex thermoplastic polyester, Celstran continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastics, Fortron polyphenylene sulfide, GUR ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, Thermx polycyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate, and Vectra/ Zenite liquid crystal polymer.

  <p>
   Ticona's customers are not the automotive and electronics manufacturers themselves. Rather, the company sells to plastics molders and components suppliers who then sell directly to OEMs. Pricing isn't heavily reliant on raw materials costs, nor is it terribly cyclical.

  <p>
   Ticona's parent company (
   <company id="136265">
    Celanese Corporation
   </company>
   ) reported that Advanced Engineered Materials' revenues grew by 7% in 2013, primarily due to increased acetal copolymer (POM) and long-fiber reinforced thermoplastics volumes thanks to higher use by automakers in the Americas and Asia. Volumes in Asia also improved across all product lines due to growth in consumer and industrial applications. Higher pricing and product mix, mainly for medical applications, also help to lift revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Advanced Engineered Materials segment contributed about 21% of Celanese Corporation's revenues in 2013.

  <p>
   The company grows through organic expansion and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ticona's parent company is building new 50,000 tons per year POM manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia (through its Ibn Sina affiliate) which is expected to be operational in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Ticona partnered The Rodon Group to launch as number of products products, including the K'NEX building toy system made with Celcon POM.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Delo and Ticona jointly developed a product for microelectronics from special adhesives and vectra liquid crystal polymer.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Ticona also introduced a newly developed grade of Fortron (the first polyphenylene sulfide for use with 3D robotic manipulated blow molding for tubular components with extreme complex geometries).
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2008 Ticona announced its first wholly owned manufacturing plant in Asia with the opening of its Celestran plant in Nanjing, China. This was just the beginning of the company's push into manufacturing in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed in 1961 as a joint venture between Celanese Corporation and
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst AG
   </company>
   . Formerly known as Celanese Engineering Resins, the company changed its name to Ticona Polymers in 1998.
