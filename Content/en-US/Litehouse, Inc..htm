   The food firm has become a leader in refrigerated salad dressings, vegetable dips, sauces, instantly fresh herbs, blue cheese, caramel dips, fruit dips, and glazes. Banking on the growing popularity of Greek yogurt, Litehouse in late 2013 rolled out a new line of Greek style yogurt dressings under the OPA! by Litehouse name.

   It's also building a new facility in Southern Utah, investing more than $10 million. The effort supplements its existing manufacturing plants in Idaho and Michigan.

   Not known for making acquisitions, Litehouse has expanded in recent years through organic growth and through its purchase of Seattle's Green Garden Foods. Buying the maker of dressings, salsas, dips, mayonnaise, and more in 2010 has given Litehouse a deeper products portfolio. Like Litehouse, Green Garden also sells its products to grocery stores and food service providers and restaurants. The purchase has allowed Litehouse to expand its production capacity and product line.
