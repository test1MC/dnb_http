   Ditch Witch has cast a spell over the heavy equipment industry since 1949. The Charles Machine Works (CMW) manufactures and sells underground construction equipment and parts bearing the Ditch Witch brand name. Its signature orange lineup features trenchless machines, trenchers, mini-excavators, and plows, including tractors, backhoes, and saws, made at the company's 30-acre plant in Oklahoma. CMW also makes a slew of electronic tools: fault locators, beacons for ground directional assistance, and trailers. Equipment maintenance and repair services are also offered for its roster of construction and utility customers. The founding Malzahn family owns the company.

  <p>
   Based in Perry, Oklahoma, CMW sells its products throughout Canada, Mexico, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the US.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have fueled the company's market presence and product portfolio. In late 2012 CMW acquired
   <company id="120620">
    American Augers
   </company>
   -- once owned by
   <company id="12670">
    Astec Industries
   </company>
   -- for $55 million. The deal beefed up CMW's core operations as American Augers manufactures earth boring machines and horizontal directional drilling systems and offers fluid and mud pumps, cleaning systems, and product tooling and accessories.
