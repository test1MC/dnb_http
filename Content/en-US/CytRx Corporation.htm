   CytRx keeps an eye on the suspicious activities of cancers. The drug developer is researching and developing several drug candidates to treat conditions such as chronic and acute forms of leukemia, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, and soft-tissue sarcomas (malignant tumors). Its pipeline drugs include enhanced chemotherapy agents and proprietary cancer cell inhibiting drugs. The company has sold off all of its non-oncology assets to focus on its drugs in late stage clinical trials.

   The company's lead drug candidate is aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-26), its version of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. It is currently evaluating the drug in a global phase 2b clinical trial in small cell lung cancer, a phase 2 trial in HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, a phase 2 trial in patients with late-stage brain cancer, a phase 1b trial in combination with ifosfamide in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, and a phase 1b trial in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic solid tumors. It has begun a phase 3 global trial of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas whose tumors have progressed following chemotherapy. In 2014, the

   granted multiple Orphan Drug Designations for the drug in glioblastoma multiforme, small-cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. The following year, agency removed the partial clinical hold on the drug's clinical trials.

   CytRx has an agreement with KTB Tumorforschungs (KTB) for the license of patent rights held by KTB for the worldwide development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin.
