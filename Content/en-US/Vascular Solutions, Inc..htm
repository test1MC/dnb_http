   Vascular Solutions helps interventional cardiologists intervene into veins. The company develops, manufactures, and markets catheters used during treatment of vascular conditions. Its product line includes the Pronto extraction catheter, which removes arterial clots, and other tools used to get under the skin and into blood vessels. Its hemostat products include the D-Stat, a thrombin-infused bandage used to control bleeding following catheterization. It also makes the Vari-Lase, a laser system for treating varicose veins. Vascular Solutions markets the devices to interventional cardiologists and radiologists through its own sales team in the US; it uses independent distributors overseas.

   Revenue grew about 12% in 2013 as product sales increased across the board, led by a 22% increase in Hemostat Products. Net income moved up about 9% due to increased revenue and a decline in income tax expenses as the company exercised stock options. Cash from operations also moved up, slightly, as revenue rose.

  <p>
   Vascular Solutions' growth strategy is a mix of new product development and acquisitions to extend its product line. It develops new products and next-generation versions of its existing medical devices through its own research and development efforts, and by partnering with other medical device makers through marketing and licensing deals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it launched new catheter products and extended it thrombin products for the hemostat line the following year. Also in 2014 Vascular Solutions entered an R&amp;D agreement with the US Army to develop freeze-dried plasma for battlefield treatment of hemorrhages.
