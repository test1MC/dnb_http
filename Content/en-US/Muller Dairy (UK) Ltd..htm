   <em>
    Müller (
   </em>
   rhymes with "duller") is milking profits in the UK as a dairy processor. The company -- a UK subsidiary of German dairy giant Müller Group (owned by Theo Müller) -- is among the country's largest chilled yogurt manufacturers. Its range of yogurts, which run from plain to indulgent, are sold under brands Müller light, Müller Rice, Vitality, Amoré, Corner, and Little Stars. Müller Dairy also produces dairy-potted desserts and some dairy drinks. The company's customer base has increasingly reached into convenience stores, reflecting its strategy to market the lineup as a convenient, impulse-item.

  <p>
   Based Shropshire, Müller Dairy has production facilities in Minsterley and in Telford.

   Müller Dairy focused on growth through acquisitions and by boosting its organic operations.

  <p>
   In 2105 the company acquired the dairy operations of UK-based
   <company id="58580">
    Dairy Crest
   </company>
   for £80million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In early 2012 Müller acquired almost 94% of Glasgow-based milk and cheese producer
   <company id="60101">
    Robert Wiseman Dairies
   </company>
   . The £279.5 million (about $444.3 million) takeover bid for Robert Wiseman added seven dairies, reported to supply 30% of the fresh milk consumed daily in Britain. Despite farmers' concerns about Müller's larger buying heft, which could cut the price it pays for milk and further squeeze milk processors, Müller moved to buy up the rest of Wiseman's shares and de-list the milk company from the London Stock Exchange.

  <p>
   Müller Dairy established a presence in the UK in 1987.
