   "The few, the proud, the profitable" could be Genentech's motto. One of the world's oldest and most successful biotechs (in an industry full of money-losers), the firm has a number of blockbuster cancer therapies based on its antibody (protein) technologies. Its oncology portfolio contains Rituxan (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), Avastin (colorectal and lung cancers), Herceptin (breast cancer), Tarceva (lung cancer), Xeloda (metastatic colorectal cancer), and Zelboraf (inoperable melanoma). Other marketed drugs include age-related macular degeneration treatment Lucentis, human growth hormone Nutropin, cystic fibrosis drug Pulmozyme, and asthma drug Xolair. Genentech is wholly owned by Swiss pharma powerhouse
   <company id="41787">
    Roche

  <p>
   Roche's control of Genentech places the larger drugmaker in the fast lane of biopharmaceuticals. Roche depends on Genentech's creative and successful research organization to keep its drug pipeline full of promising new biotech drugs, thus relieving stress from patent-expiration pressures in its existing product lineup.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genentech's San Francisco office is now the primary administrative and marketing headquarters for Roche in the US and has taken over US sales efforts for Roche products including Tamiflu (influenza), Pegasys (hepatitis), CellCept (transplants), and Xeloda (colorectal cancer).
  </p>
  <p>
   As of mid-2015, the company had some 1,200 researchers and scientists and 125 postdocs. It also had 35 medicines on the market and nearly 20 more ADC's in its pipeline, which included its Alectinib, Anti-OX40 Mab, and antibody drug conjugate.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves as the US headquarters for its parent, Roche. Genentech has offices three offices in California along with single offices in Oregon and Kentucky.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are distributed through wholesalers including
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   . In international markets its products are primarily marketed through parent Roche's global sales force and distribution network.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Instead of acquisitions, Genentech has traditionally relied on internal efforts (often with research partners) to develop and commercialize new drugs, and this strategy has remained in place following the Roche takeover. More than half of its commercial product sales, as well as a majority of development projects, relate to oncology. The company's development-stage pharmaceuticals in clinical trials include personalized medicines for treating various cancers, including skin cancers and breast cancer, and such ailments as lupus, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Genentech has development partnerships with a number of firms including
   <company id="102726">
    Seattle Genetics
   </company>
   (cancers), NovImmune (autoimmune diseases), and Adimab (antibody studies).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company submitted a new drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment (in combination with Zelboraf) of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma. That year, the company also had its Esbriet treatment approved for use on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in the US. It also had its Avastin product approved in combination with chemotherapy for the women's treatment of platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer. Additionally in 2014, the company partnered with
   <company id="161980">
    NewLink Genetics Corporation
   </company>
   to discover and develop small-molecule IDO pathway inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, the company received FDA approval for another promising new personalized breast cancer drug, Perjeta, which is a combination drug used alongside Herceptin and traditional cancer drug docetaxel; it also launched is Erivedge drug for advanced cases of basal cell carcinoma.
  </p>
  <p>
   While its long-term success depends on its ability to develop novel compounds (especially as older drugs lose patent protection), Genentech is also seeking shorter-term success by boosting commercialization efforts for existing top sellers, including Avastin, Rituxan (known internationally as MabThera), and Lucentis. Part of the company's success comes from its efforts to expand the number of approved uses of its marketed drugs. For example, in 2012 Lucentis was approved for the additional indication of diabetic macular edema treatment

  <p>
   In 2014 Genentech agreed to pay up to $1.7 billion for fellow American biotech firm Seragon Pharmaceuticals. Seragon focuses on small-molecule drugs that treat a certain type of breast cancer; its lead candidate is in phase 1 clinical trials.

  <p>
   Roche, which previously owned a majority stake in Genentech, made the company a wholly owned subsidiary in 2009 when it purchased the 44% of Genentech that it did not already own for about $47 billion. Through its 33% stake in Roche,
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   is an indirect shareholder in Genentech. Novartis holds international licensing rights for Xolair and Lucentis (Genentech holds commercial rights in the US).
  </p>
  <p>
   Since taking full ownership of Genentech (previously a majority-owned subsidiary) in 2009, Roche has cut expenses by combining the two companies' global manufacturing and supply networks and by integrating the research, marketing, and administrative operations in the US, while at the same time working to maintain Genentech's innovative identity and culture.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Venture capitalist Robert Swanson and molecular biologist Herbert Boyer founded Genentech in 1976 to commercialize Boyer's patented gene-splicing techniques that could mass-produce genetically engineered substances. The company went public in 1980.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genentech's market debut (the first
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved biotech product) was a bioengineered form of human insulin in 1982.
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   bought the license and sold it as Humulin. Genentech sold off the product marketing rights for royalties to focus on its research efforts. The company next developed the human immune system protein alpha interferon and licensed it to US-based
   <company id="43933">
    Hoffmann-La Roche
   </company>
   , which sold the cancer treatment as Roferon-A.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first product to bear the Genentech name was human growth hormone Protropin, approved by the FDA in 1985. Genentech then released Activase in 1987. Its $180 million in sales was the best first year of any new drug at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swiss global pharma firm
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   (parent of Hoffman-La Roche) bought 60% of Genentech for $2.1 billion in 1990, including nearly $500 million to maintain the long-term research pipeline. In 1993 Genentech and
   <company id="10986">
    Merck
   </company>
   developed a compound to prevent activation of the RAS oncogene, a trigger for cancerous cells in the pancreas, colon, and lungs. Merck began human tests of anti-RAS drugs in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genentech began shipping human growth hormone Nutropin in early 1994. The next year CEO Kirk Rabb was ousted after trying to secure a $2 million personal loan from Roche. Rabb was replaced by scientist Arthur Levinson (seen as a sign of Roche's R&amp;D commitment). That year the companies signed a pact that gave Roche Genentech's Canadian and European operations, with a provision allowing Roche to buy the rest of the company by mid-1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   After spending $100 million in 10 years on AIDS-related research, Genentech in 1996 formed a new company to develop its sidetracked HIV vaccine. That year the FDA approved Activase as the first effective treatment for acute stroke. In 1997 lymphoma treatment Rituxan (developed with
   <company id="13209">
    IDEC Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ) became the first monoclonal antibody of its kind approved for cancer. The FDA approved breast cancer drug Herceptin in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year saw the demise of Neuleze, once thought to hold promise to treat diabetes-related nerve damage; the company took comfort in the accolades pouring in for Herceptin and the skyrocketing sales of Rituxan. Meanwhile, charges that Genentech marketed human growth hormone for non-approved uses led to a federal court fine of $50 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 co-founder Swanson died of cancer. Also that year Roche bought the shares of Genentech that it didn't own, then spun off 16% of the company and 26% more in 2000. Genentech issued a warning to physicians in 2000 after Herceptin was linked to several deaths; together with the FDA, it set about relabeling the drug. That year the FDA approved TNKase to treat heart attacks, and Genentech formed two collaborative agreements with ImmunoGen to develop cancer treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm won a patent dispute with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   in 2001 over how Genentech makes Herceptin and Rituxan. The next year, though, it lost a royalty dispute with the City of Hope research organization and was hit with $500 million in damages from the suit. (Genentech appealed, but the verdict was upheld in 2004; the fine was later reduced to $300 million by the California Supreme Court in 2008.) The firm declared victory in another battle to keep its revenues for itself:
   <company id="12972">
    Chiron
   </company>
   had sued Genentech over a patent for Herceptin and sought 30% of the drug's sales, but a California jury ruled in Genentech's favor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 colorectal cancer treatment Avastin was launched. Its R&amp;D efforts again met with success in mid-2006 when the company won FDA approval for Lucentis, a treatment for the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Also in 2006 Rituxan was approved as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though not normally an acquisitive company, in 2007 Genentech bought its Xolair development partner
   <company id="99900">
    Tanox
   </company>
   in a deal worth nearly a billion dollars. The acquisition made Xolair more profitable for Genentech two ways: by eliminating royalty payments to Tanox, and by gaining Tanox's share of the royalty and profit-sharing payments from the third Xolair development partner,
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Colorectal and lung cancer treatment Avastin was approved for breast cancer treatment in the US in 2008; however, the FDA revoked the approval in 2011. Avastin was approved for kidney and brain cancers in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Roche acquired the 44% of Genentech it didn't already own for some $47 billion to make Genentech a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition agreement came after a tedious bidding process: A $44 billion offer in late 2008 had been rejected by Genentech as undervalued. Roche issued a hostile tender offer of $42 billion early the following year, but after a tepid response from Genentech's shareholders, Roche eventually upped the offer to $47 billion, which Genentech accepted. The takeover placed the larger drugmaker into the fast lane of biopharmaceuticals by giving it full access to Genentech's marketed products and R&amp;D pipeline. Prior to the transaction, Genentech made up about a quarter Roche's annual sales, and Roche was a joint participant in many of Genentech's development projects and marketing efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson was replaced by Roche executive Pascal Soriot shortly after the transaction's closure in March 2009. In early 2010, however, Genentech veteran Ian Clark took over as CEO of the company when Soriot was promoted to the helm of the entire global Roche pharmaceutical division. As the integration efforts progressed, Genentech's primary San Francisco location replaced
   <company id="43933">
    Hoffman-La Roche
   </company>
   's Nutley, New Jersey, office as Roche's US headquarters; the plant in Nutley was closed in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company voluntarily yanked psoriasis treatment Raptiva, which was co-developed with
   <company id="15185">
    XOMA
   </company>
   and marketed internationally with
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   , from the US market in 2009 after the drug was linked to a fatal brain disorder (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML). The move came a month after European Union regulators recommended its withdrawal in that market. Canada has also halted sales of Raptiva.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Rituxan was approved as a treatment for leukemia, and the company received FDA approval to market Actemra, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment co-developed with another Roche-controlled entity,
