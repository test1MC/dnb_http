   Kadant wants to hear the ka-ching of profits being made from its papermaking equipment. The company's papermaking machinery and components, which Kadant develops and manufactures, can be found in most of the world's pulp and paper mills. Its papermaking products include stock preparation (including pulping, screening, cleaning, and de-inking), doctoring (cleaning of paper rolls), fluid handling (mainly drying), and water management (water cleaning, draining, and filtering) systems. It also recycles papermaking byproducts into biodegradable fiber-based granules for oil and grease absorption and other uses. Kadant has operations in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

  <p>
   Kadant has 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia and services 150 countries around the globe. During 2013 approximately 63% of its sales were to customers outside the US, principally in Europe and China.

  <p>
   The company's papermaking equipment is sold to pulp and paper manufacturers worldwide, while its byproduct granules are geared at agricultural and home and garden customers. A majority of its sales are made to customers in Europe and China. China, with its growing economy, is where Kadant has historically generated significant revenues. Already it operates manufacturing facilities in the lower-cost country, and it expects to manufacture and source even more of its equipment and components there in the future.

  <p>
   Revenues climbed 4% from $332 million in 2012 to nearly $345 million in 2013, its highest total in six years. The revenue growth for 2013 was fueled by an increase in its papermaking systems segment generated from acquisitions and an increase of $4 million from favorable currency translation effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits dropped 26% from $32 million in 2012 to $23 million in 2013 due to higher income taxes paid and the absence of a tax credit benefit that was present in 2012. The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the last five years. In 2013 cash flow increased by $11 million to $40 million due to a rise in customer deposits on stock-preparation contracts and an increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments.

  <p>
   Kadant's strategic growth initiatives involves increasing its penetration into emerging markets, expanding its parts and consumables revenue, leveraging its low-cost manufacturing operations, and acquiring well-positioned companies that offer differentiated products to process industries.  The company completed three acquisitions in 2013, including its former Brazilian licensee Companhia Brasileira de Tecnologia Industrial, Noss Group out of Sweden, and Canada-based Carmanah Design and Manufacturing. These acquisitions resulted in the expansion of its presence in emerging markets and enhanced its aftermarket parts operations.
