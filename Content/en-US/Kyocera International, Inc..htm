   Although Kyocera International serves North America for a larger global group, the division has, itself, operations outside of the region. Subsidiary

   (formerly Kyocera Mita America) has locations not only in Canada and Mexico, but also Brazil; Kyocera Solar has subsidiaries in Brazil and Australia; and Kyocera TYCOM has subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong, in addition to its Costa Mesa, California headquarters and Canadian location.

   Parent Kyocera Corporation only reports sales for the US, lumping the rest of North America into an "others" segment. Both geographic segments saw declining sales for fiscal 2012 (ended March). The US fell by a quarter of its 2011 fiscal revenue to less than Â¥170 billion (about $2 billion), while the others segment dropped 10%.

   In 2013 the company introduced its new Consumer Products Division, a new business unit combining the strengths of the Application Products Division of Kyocera Tycom Corporation (KTC) and Kyocera Industrial Ceramics Corporation (KICC). The new division will try to facilitate the expansion of Kyocera's North American ceramic cutlery and kitchenware business. The combined enterprise will streamline operations.
