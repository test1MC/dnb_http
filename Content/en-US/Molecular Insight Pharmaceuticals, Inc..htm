   Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals (MIP) is working to make cancer invisible. The development-stage company is focused on making molecular imaging and radiotherapeutic products that help diagnose and treat various diseases by combining radiation therapy with biochemical and molecular science. MIP is focused on oncology and has diagnostic and radiotherapeutic candidates under development to detect and treat prostate cancer. The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2011. It was acquired by pharmaceuticals firm
   <company id="52485">
    Progenics
   </company>
   in early 2013.

  <p>
   MIP has two types of candidates: molecular imaging radiopharmaceuticals, or radioactive drugs that enable visualization of a disease's biological processes, and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, or radioactive drugs that deliver radiation therapy directly to cancerous tumor cells (while avoiding healthy tissue cells).
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of the company's development programs have been conducted through licensing and partnership agreements with other pharmaceutical firms. For instance, in 2009 MIP formed a collaborative agreement with
   <company id="103385">
    BioMedica
   </company>
   to develop radiotherapeutics for select international markets; however, that partnership was terminated in 2011.

   The company, suffering under a heavy debt load, filed for bankruptcy in late 2010. After an alternate bankruptcy plan was approved by the courts, the company was then able to restructure and emerge from bankruptcy in mid-2011, at the same time reducing its debt by some $162 million. It also delisted its publicly traded shares and received an infusion of $40 million in fresh capital from its bondholders, which will help it resume its growth strategies in the molecular medicine industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   MIP first ran into trouble paying down its debt obligations in 2008, and as a result began to implement cost-reduction measures late that year. It reduced its workforce by about 40% in 2009, and laid off another 10% of its employees in 2010. The company was finally forced to file for bankruptcy after its bondholders rejected a prior restructuring plan.
