   Direction des Constructions Navales Services (DCNS) takes its direction from the government of France. The state-controlled shipbuilder makes warships for leading navies of the world -- and traces its history back some 400 years. Its products include aircraft carriers, frigates, attack and nuclear submarines, and a range of weapons systems and simulators. It also offers services in design, shore-based support services, and decommissioning, and the company is branching out into civilian nuclear reactors for power generation. DCNS serves more than 50 navies around the world. Key customers include the navies of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the US.

  <p>
   DCNS generated €3.36 billion in revenue for 2013 (compared with €2.93 billion in 2012) as work progressed on industrial programs for France (FREMM frigates, Barracuda submarines, and through-life support for French Navy's front-line ships) and international customers (notably Brazil, India, Malaysia and Morocco). The growth was also driven by progress made on the construction of two BPC-type projection and command vessels for Russia.

  <p>
   DCNS is focusing on developing advanced technology for its products and has expanded its focus into civil nuclear engineering and marine renewable energy. The company is also focused on doubling its turnover between now and 2020. To meet this goal, it has extended its military ship proposals with the design of new products (smaller-tonnage surface ships and submarines) and services (design, construction, modernization, maintenance and operation of industrial and port facilities, training of crews).

  <p>
   In 2013 DCNS acquired a majority stake (60%) in and took over the control of Irish tidal energy start-up OpenHydro. The acquisition strengthened the company's expertise and presence in the tidal energy market.

  <p>
   The shipbuilder traces its history back to 1631 when Cardinal Richelieu set up the first shipyards for the French Navy. Since then, it has spun off from the French Ministry of Defense. In 2003 it became a stand-alone company, still with the legal status of a state-owned commercial enterprise. The transformation removed administrative constraints in purchasing and human resources and enabled the company to set up alliances with other corporations.
