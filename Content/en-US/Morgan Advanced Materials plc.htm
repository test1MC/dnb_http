   Morgan Advanced Materials' materials are the basis of the myriad components used in aerospace, satellite communications and power generation equipment, as well as medical instruments, trains and fire protection systems, and even, body armor. It makes insulating fibers, electrical carbon transfer systems, seals and bearings, ceramic cores, sensors, containers for metals processing, and high-technology composites. It also develops specialist materials and make many application-specific products to customer requirements.Morgan targets technically complex applications in energy, defense, and medical markets. The company traces its historical roots back to 1855.

  <p>
   Morgan operates through 85 manufacturing sites across more than 30 countries. It serves customers in more than 100 countries. North America accounts for 40% of the company's net sales. Other major markets include Europe (34%) and Asia and Rest of the World (26%).

  <p>
   The company has experienced revenue declines the last several years, with revenues dipping 6% from 2014 to 2015. This was due to declines in both the European and industrial product markets. Its profits, however, skyrocketed by over 300% during that same time period due to a decrease in restructuring costs and an absence of the impairment of intangible assets. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   Morgan is focused on growing in three main areas: materials science capability and technology, application engineering capability, and customer and end-market focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also restructuring and selling under-performing units in order to get its balance sheet in order. In 2015 it sold its thermal ceramics business in Wissembourg, France. The business manufactured low-temperature fiber boards used mainly in the building industry.

  <p>
   In 1855 William Vaughan Morgan bought Halse &amp; Sons, a London-based merchant and druggist business and renamed it Morgan and Rees. William's brothers Edward, Octavius, Septimus, Thomas, and Walter (who later would become Lord Mayor of London) soon joined the firm. Among the wares the company sold were crucibles (vessels used to melt metals or chemical compounds). William Morgan was so impressed by an American crucible, made by a new process, that in 1856 he bought the manufacturing rights and a London factory. He began to make and sell crucibles.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1857 the company had changed its name to the Plumbago Crucible Company and was manufacturing a wide range of crucibles. Plumbago, another term for graphite, was used to extend the life of crucibles. After winning a gold medal at the 1868 Paris Exhibition, the company's crucibles made inroads into Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia. In the late 1870s, the company changed its name to The Morgan Crucible Company. The company went public in 1890.
