   It's not "rocket science", it's molecular diagnostics. Roka Bioscience provides molecular technology used to detect foodborne pathogens. Its main product is its Atlas Detection Assays and Atlas automated instrument, which caters to customers in the North American food safety testing market and helps customers reduce labor costs and alleviate operating errors. The company offers molecular tests for Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Roka Bioscience was founded in 2009 through the acquisition of certain industrial application market assets belonging to

  <p>
   The company's strategy is centered around the commercialization of its Atlas Detection Assays for foodborne pathogens in North America. It is also focused on driving its innovation in foodborne pathogen testing beyond its current portfolio of assays and expanding beyond foodborne pathogen tests. To achieve this, Roka Bioscience is looking to extend its reach into global markets through a market-specific, hybrid model of direct sales and strategic partnerships with established food safety companies.
