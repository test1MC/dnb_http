   BSD Medical has developed equipment to provide hyperthermia treatment, specifically for treating cancer (including melanoma, breast cancer, brain cancer, and cervical cancer). Its systems are used in tandem with chemotherapy and radiation therapy or as a stand-alone treatment. BSD Medical was the first to develop an approvable hyperthermia system, which uses focused radio frequencies and microwaves to heat cancer cells until they die. The company's devices are designed to target superficial tumors, as well as tumors located deep within a patient's body. Its products are sold to clinics, hospitals, and other cancer-treatment institutions through its sales force and external distributors.
