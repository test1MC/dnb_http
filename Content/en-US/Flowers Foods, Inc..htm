   As a leading US baker, the company's products are available to consumers through traditional supermarkets and their in-store deli/bakeries, food service distributors, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, wholesalers, casual dining and quick-serve restaurants, schools, hospitals, dollar stores, and vending machines.

   The company markets its products through electronic and in-store coupons, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), digital media (including e-newsletters to consumers), websites (our brand sites and third-party sites), event and sports marketing, on-package promotional offers and sweepstakes, and print advertising.

  <p>
   Flowers Foods' net revenues increased by 1% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increase in branded retail sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The branded retail sales increased thanks to the DKB (Dave's Killer Bread) acquisition contribution and volume increases driven by the re-introduction of the brands which the company acquired as part of the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets and in expansion markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flowers Foods' net income increased by 8% due to higher net revenues and the absence of a pension plan settlement loss in the current year, which was in the previous year as part of its pension risk mitigation plan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, the company's operating cash inflow increased by 3%.

  <p>
   Georgia native William Flowers and his brother Joseph opened the Flowers Ice Cream Co. in the winter resort town of Thomasville, Georgia, in 1914 to serve wealthy visitors from the North. Seeing that there was no bakery in the town (the nearest bakery was more than 200 miles away), the brothers opened Flowers Baking Co. in 1919. During the 1920s William took charge of the bakery, while Joseph continued to run the ice-cream operation. In 1928 Flowers moved into the production of sweet rolls and cakes. As its reputation for high-quality baked goods spread, the firm established a regional network of customers. William died in 1934, and his 20-year-old son, Bill, took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amidst the difficult Depression years, Bill led the company in its first acquisition, a bakery in Florida. Flowers operated its bakeries around the clock during WWII to supply military bases in the Southeast. Bill's brother Langdon joined the firm after the war and helped take the company on a major expansion drive in the 1950s and 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flowers acquired additional southeastern bakers in the mid-1960s and bought the Atlanta Baking Co. in 1967. The next year the company changed its name to Flowers Industries and went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company introduced several new products under its Nature's Own brand, further strengthening its market-leading position. Overall, in 2012 the company spend $1.9 million in product development costs for new products and product enhancements.
  </p>
  <p>
   To that end, in late 2012 Flowers Foods acquired the Sara Lee and Earthgrains assets in California and Oklahoma City, respectively, from a unit of Grupo Bimbo in an effort to reach 75% of the US population through its DSD system by 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flowers Foods extended the DSD reach of the Tastykake and Nature's Own brands through its purchase of Maine-based Lepage Bakeries for $370 million in mid-2012. Lepage Bakeries comprises three bakeries with production capacity to bolster Flowers Foods' presence in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Lepage Bakeries' selection of breads, buns, and rolls also complements Flowers Foods' range of regional brands by adding the Country Kitchen and Barowsky's labels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it began producing bread at a new facility in Nevada and it expanded Nature's Own and Wonder bread production at its Pennsylvania bakery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flowers Foods in 2013 purchased the licenses to the Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands in California from a subsidiary of
   <company id="95052">
    Grupo Bimbo
   </company>
   . It also bought the Wonder, Nature's Pride, Merita, Home Pride, and Butternut bread brands, as well as 20 bakeries, and nearly 40 depots, from liquidating Hostess Brands for $360 million. The purchase furthered the bread maker's long-term growth strategy to supply more of the US population with fresh breads, buns, and rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it spent $360 million for five bread brands, 20 bakeries, and about 40 depots from Hostess Brands, which was liquidating.
