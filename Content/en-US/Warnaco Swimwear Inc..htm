  <p>
   The McCrea family launched the Speedo brand in Australia in 1928, and by the 1950s Speedo swimwear had become popular with Olympic athletes. In 1961 New York-based Warnaco won the contract as Speedo's North American distributor and licensee. In 1990 Warnaco spun off the Speedo division (which included White Stag skiwear) to Linda Wachner (Warnaco's CEO), division management, and the Pentland Group for $85 million. Initially named Speedo/Activewear, the company went public two years later as Authentic Fitness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Authentic Fitness originally sold only to sporting goods stores and swimwear dealers. In 1992 it crossed into new retail channels, introducing lines in Wal-Mart stores and opening its first store in Los Angeles. (By 1995 it operated about 50 stores.) The next year the company began making workout wear and purchased the Catalina and Cole brands from Taren Holdings. It also signed a worldwide licensing agreement that year to make Anne Cole swimwear.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warnaco tried to re-acquire Authentic Fitness in 1994, but the deal fell through. The company lost about $40 million in fiscal 1996 as a result of discontinuing its money-losing skiwear and outlet businesses. In 1998 Authentic Fitness signed a licensing deal to produce Ralph Lauren swimwear for women and girls. The company in 1999 bought a 70% stake in Ubertech Texas, which develops machinery for applying designs on apparel. Warnaco finally succeeded in buying Authentic Fitness in 1999. The company also launched a Web site to sell its Speedo products that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Warnaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; with Authentic Fitness' former chief, Linda Wachner, no longer at Warnaco's helm, the company re-emerged in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The swimwear group exited its private-label and designer swimwear businesses in late 2007, and thereby sold its OP brand for $54 million to Iconix Group and three of its swimwear lines (Anne Cole, Cole of California, and Catalina) to In Mocean Group for $26 million.
