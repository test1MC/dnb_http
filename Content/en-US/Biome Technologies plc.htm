   Natural plastics and a side of optical fiber furnaces mean big business for Biome Technologies. The company operates two units: RF Technologies makes and distributes graphite, zirconia, shaping, and soft and specialty glass furnaces. Engineering marvels, the furnaces, which run at a blistering 2200 degrees C, can produce enough fiber annually to circle the world more than 20 times. Another unit, Biome Bioplastics, produces plastics products (dubbed bioplastics) derived from natural, biodegradable materials. Product applications range from flexible films to compression-molded containers.

  <p>
   In 2013 Biome's overall revenue decreased by 65% due to less revenue from both its Biome Bioplastics and RF Technologies divisions. Biome Bioplastics' revenue nosedived 71% due to the company's refocus away from lower-margin, single-use plastic bag markets. RF Technologies revenues fell by 57% in 2013 as turbulence in the Chinese fibre optic market continued, coupled with a drop in furnace orders in both China and also India due to weaker demand.

  <p>
   In addition, in 2013 Biome suffered a net loss of Â£2.5 million in 2013, which was a decrease of 63% from the previous year. The loss was due to the termination of a lease agreement on two of its unused buildings in Southampton.

  <p>
   In order to grow its business, the company's Biome Bioplastics division is focused on the commercialization and development of bioplastics in a discrete number of product/application areas. RF Technology is focused on reducing its dependence upon the optic fibre furnace market due to the negative effects on being impacted by the apparent excess capacity in the Chinese fibre-optic market.
