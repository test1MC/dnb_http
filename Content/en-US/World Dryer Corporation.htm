   For an all-around enjoyable restroom experience, count on the folks at World Dryer. The company manufactures the eponymous and ubiquitous electric hand dryers, including AirMax and Airforce branded "turbo dryers," as well as baby changing stations and two types of restroom hair dryers. World Dryer promotes its dryers as both more sanitary and friendlier to the environment than paper towels. Its core markets are foodservice and health care facilities, and schools. The company was formerly part of the Specialty Equipment Companies, which was acquired by
   <company id="11559">
    UTC
   </company>
   , and merged with the
   <company id="17082">
    Commercial Refrigeration
   </company>
   division of UTC's
   <company id="99063">
    Carrier
   </company>
   subsidiary in 2000. In 2007 NewCastle Partners, LLC took World Dryer private.
