   While many companies want to improve the proverbial mousetrap, Logitech International is more concerned with making a better mouse. The company is a leading maker of mice and other devices used with PCs and tablets, including joysticks, trackballs, digital pens, and keyboards. Its LifeSize subsidiary offers videoconferencing equipment that includes phones, webcams, microphones, and headsets. While Logitech does sell products directly to manufacturers -- including most of the world's largest PC makers -- the vast majority of its peripherals are sold to consumers through a global retail network.

  <p>
   Customers located in the US account for about a third of sales. Logitech gets only a small amount of revenues from customers in Switzerland, its home country. The company has high-volume manufacturing operations in China that handle roughly half of its production; the company outsources the rest.

   Logitech's Ultimate Ears division develops in-ear monitors used by on-stage musicians and engineers. It also targets the consumer market with in-ear devices designed for use with portable music players. Logitech additionally provides Internet-based videoconferencing services through its video communications software unit, SightSpeed. The company also makes devices for popular third-party products like

   's iPod, and gaming systems from
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   . In addition, Logitech offers a line of universal remotes used to control multiple electronic devices.

   Logitech is targeting growth in video conferencing, unified communications, audio products, and peripherals for mobile products. Product development efforts for tablets and other mobile devices resulted in the Logitech Keyboard Case for the iPad 2 and wireless portable speakers. The company also believes that its LifeSize family of videoconferencing products will enjoy more growth. Geographically, Logitech is looking to expand its presence in emerging retail markets such as India, Latin America, and Russia, in addition to China.

   Italian Pierluigi Zappacosta and Swede Daniel Borel met while studying computer engineering at
   <company id="40442">
    Stanford University
   </company>
   in the 1970s. The two wanted to bring the entrepreneurial spirit of California's Silicon Valley to Europe and start a high-tech company. At the time, though, there was little venture capital in Europe, and no European bank would lend them enough money.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Zappacosta and Borel obtained the rights to sell a Swiss-designed mouse in the US and, with Swiss backers, started Logitech in California and Switzerland. The co-founders originally intended Logitech to be a software company in the mold of
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   , but this vision changed quickly as the importance of the mouse and other peripherals became apparent. The company improved its manufacturing process and soon developed a cordless mouse.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   was Logitech's first big client, quickly followed by others, including
   <company id="41826">
    Olivetti
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   . Logitech made its first foray into the US retail market in 1986, with limited success. Since its brand was not recognized and the company had a small advertising budget, it bypassed the regular retail route and offered its mouse at a discount through specialty computer magazines. Consumers, and later dealers and distributors, took notice; Logitech was soon supplying mice to
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   . With a new Taiwan manufacturing plant on line and increased capacity, it reached an agreement in 1988 to supply
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   . That year Logitech went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Logitech formed a joint venture in China that involved funding from China National Aerotechnology Import and Export Corporation and the International Resources Technology Association of Hong Kong. That year the company also purchased 51% of Gazelle Graphics Systems, developer of single-board digitizers and cordless digitizing pens (Gazelle had developed the first trackball for Apple's PowerBook laptops). Logitech purchased the rest of Gazelle in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Logitech announced a new design for its stationary desktop mouse for Macintosh (TrackMan) in 1993. The next year Logitech eliminated 500 jobs. At that time Zappacosta announced that the company would shift its focus from mice to input devices such as cameras and scanners.
  </p>
  <p>
   With stiff competition and pricing pressures eroding profits, Logitech struggled through 1995, closing factories and consolidating plants. After taking a $20 million restructuring charge, Logitech returned to profitability in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Logitech sold its scanner business in late 1997 to Storm Technology (which later went bankrupt). In 1998 Guerrino De Luca, a former executive at Apple and Claris, joined the company as president and CEO, replacing Borel, who remained chairman. (Zappacosta stepped down as vice chairman.) That year also saw Logitech buy the digital camera business of Connectix.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999, the 30th anniversary of the mouse's invention, Logitech sold its 200 millionth digital rodent. Also that year it spun off SpotLife, which allows users to share video content through its Web site. In 2000 Logitech announced an agreement with
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   (now part of Hewlett-Packard) to bundle its QuickCam cameras with Compaq Presario PCs, and one with Motorola to develop cordless PC peripherals based on the Bluetooth wireless protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company bought audio device and peripherals provider
   <company id="50100">
    Labtec
   </company>
   in a deal valued at about $125 million. The next year the company posted its best-ever profits for fiscal 2002, and it repurchased the shares of SpotLife it had spun off in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Logitech acquired universal remote control maker Intrigue Technologies for approximately $29 million in cash in 2004. That same year, the company, which has long produced LED-based optical mice, introduced a laser-based design.
