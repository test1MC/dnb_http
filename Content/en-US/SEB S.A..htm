   This company makes small appliances with international reputations. Known for its portfolio of small appliances covering some 25 brand names (Krups, All-Clad, Moulinex, Rowenta, Tefal, and T-fal), SEB makes cookware (non-stick bakeware, pressure cookers), small home appliances (toasters, coffee makers, vacuums), and personal care items (hair dryers, scales, electric razors). A global leader in small appliance manufacturing, it sells its products in over 150 countries. Regional brands include Arno and Panex (South America), Calor and Seb (France and Belgium), AirBake and Mirro (North America), and Supor and Maharaja (Asia). SEB was founded in 1857 by Antoine Lescure, whose descendants still control the firm.

  <p>
   SEB sells globally, with 36% of revenue coming from Western Europe (including France, the company's biggest single market at 16%). The Asia-Pacific region generates some 30% of revenue, North America 13%, Central Europe and Russia 13%, and South America 8%.
  </p>

  <p>
   SEB sells its products through distributors, its own stores (including the Home &amp; Cook banner), and online. In France it sells cookware inside Darty's consumer electronics stores. Indeed, the global cookware and home appliances maker operates its own retail stores under the Tefal Shops banner in Turkey, Supor Lifestores in China, and Tiendas de Hogar in Colombia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes 36% of revenue through traditional channels, 23% through hypermarkets, 19% specialists, and 22% other.

  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue climbed 12% in 2015 on prior year to €4.8 billion, due to strong organic sales growth, which was a result of higher product volumes. In France, strong demand helped sales rise for small electrical appliances, particularly vacuum cleaners and electrical cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 21% to €206 million, in line with the increase in net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities increased 39% to €376 million, due also to the increase in net income but also changes in trade receivables and inventories.

  <p>
   SEB pursues a strategy of diversification, both geographically and from a product standpoint, by manufacturing both small appliances and cookware and selling to numerous global markets. It is also opening its own stores in areas where mass merchants and traditional retail networks, such as department stores, are either under-represented or not present at all. To that end, SEB is opening shops in growth markets including China, Colombia, and Turkey. In 2015, it acquired OBH Nordica, a major operator in the Scandinavian markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   To grow in Asia, SEB acquired China's Zhejiang Supor Cookware, a maker of rice cookers, electrical kitchen appliances, and cookware. The acquisition gave SEB access to the vast Chinese market -- where the Supor brand is well known - and a platform for expansion in other countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Supor acquisition in China is typical of SEB's international development strategy of expanding its global footprint through acquisitions. Both emerging and developed countries are on SEB's list for growth. Poland's fast-growing consumer segment is one such example; Colombia is another.

  <p>
   In 2015, SEB acquired OBH Nordica, a small domestic appliance manufacturer in Scandinavia. The acquisition should significantly strengthen its position in the market and implement synergies between both entities.

  <p>
   Antoine Lescure formed his namesake firm in 1857 in Burgundy, France, to make metalware, including buckets and watering cans. The company expanded its product lines to include kitchen utensils and zinc tubs. Lescure's descendants renamed the firm Société d'Emboutissage de Bourgogne (Burgundy Metalware Company) in 1925.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began making pressure cookers in 1953, and in 1967 it entered the electrical appliance market with the introduction of an electric fryer. The next year the company acquired Tefal, a manufacturer specializing in nonstick cookware founded by Marc Gregoire in 1956. (Tefal is known as the world's first maker of nonstick frying pans). In 1972 the company bought Calor, known for its irons, hair dryers, and electric heaters. The next year the company was reorganized as a group structure (Groupe SEB) under a lead holding company (SEB SA). SEB went public in 1975, with the Lescure family retaining a controlling stake. A year later the company moved its headquarters to Ecully Cedex, France.
  </p>
  <p>
   SEB expanded its geographic presence in 1988 when it bought Rowenta, a manufacturer of irons, coffee makers, toasters, and vacuum cleaners with factories in Germany and France. The next year the company opened a facility in Mexico to serve North America. Jacques Gairard was named CEO in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s SEB opened offices in Eastern and Central Europe, China, and India. It began a joint venture to make irons in China in 1996. The company bought a 44% stake in Arno, Brazil's leader in electrical household appliances, in 1997 (increasing its stake to 98% in 1998). SEB bought Volmo, a small electrical appliance maker in Colombia and Venezuela, in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sluggish sales, especially in Russia and Brazil, SEB began cutting its workforce in 1998. It also withdrew from businesses, including air conditioning and water treatment products, in which it wasn't the market leader. The company began outsourcing production of espresso machines and heaters in 1999. In 2000 SEB introduced a new line of Rowenta-brand bathroom scales and steam generators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 SEB strengthened its global positioning with the acquisition of Krups-Moulinex, a transaction that was appealed by SEB's competitors and finally cleared by the French government in 2004.
