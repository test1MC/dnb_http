   Volcano creates its own sound and light show to get your heart's blood flowing. The firm develops, manufactures, and sells medical imaging devices for cardiovascular care and other specialties. Its products include intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) consoles and imaging catheters that provide information about the condition of arteries as well as plaque and lesions. Its functional management (FM) consoles and single-use pressure and flow guidewires measure characteristics of blood around plaque in arteries. The company sells its products worldwide.

    Royal Philips
   </company>
   acquired Volcano in a $1.2 billion transaction in 2015.

  <p>
   The Royal Philips acquisition came at a time when Volcano has been struggling financially. The deal allowed for the combination of Volcano's imaging catheters and Philips' interventional imaging lines. Upon completion of the transaction, Volcano became part of Philips' new image-guided therapy business group.

   The US accounts for about half of the company's sales, and Japan brings in about 30%; other markets include Europe and South Africa, where Volcano employs direct sales employees. The company uses independent distributors to sell its products in the Middle East, the rest of Asia, and other regions. With more than 6,800 consoles installed at facilities worldwide, Volcano is working to expand its distribution network in emerging markets. In recent years sales in Japan have seen significant growth, thanks in part to its contractual relationship with

   </company>
   , which distributes Volcano's IVUS products there. Volcano gets more than 80% of its medical segment revenues from sales of its single-use disposable catheters and guidewires used with its IVUS and FM systems.

   Increased demand and contributions from an acquisition lead to a 3% bump in revenue, from $382 million to $394 million, for 2013. Net income, however, went from $8 million to a $34.5 million loss due to restructuring charges Volcano changed its manufacturing process. Cash flow, which has fluctuated in recent years, dropped by $14 million, from $50 million to $36 million, due to the net loss.

   The company makes continuous improvements on its products (especially its top-selling IVUS systems), hoping to improve the diagnosis of heart conditions and take advantage of the growing trend of using minimally invasive surgical treatment procedures. As part of a development program that aimed to allow the company's products to network with interventional devices made by other manufacturers, Volcano has developed an IVUS console (s5i) customized for use in cardiac catheterization laboratories in hospital surgery suites. In 2013 it launched new products in Europe and Japan and filed for approval in the US.

   Along with in-house research and development, Volcano grows through acquisitions. It made purchases in each of the last three years including in 2014 when it paid $116.5 million for AtheroMed, which makes a medical device to treat peripheral artery disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   With it industrial segment, mainly subsidiary Axsun, bringing in only 2% of revenue, the company decided in 2014 to discontinue operations and wind down the unit by the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amidst sagging profits and restructuring efforts, the company has implemented a series of layoffs over the past few years. Volcano employed nearly 700 workers in 2010; by 2014 the workforce was cut to less than 100 employees.
