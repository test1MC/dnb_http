   Duct tape is great, but when the job calls for higher-tech stuff, Chase has it. The company has made and sold Chase &amp; Sons branded protective tape and coatings, including conducting and insulating products for cable and wire makers for more than 50 years. Chase processes almost any flexible material produced on a roll -- films to fabrics. It makes laminates, sealants, and coatings for pipeline, construction, electronics, as well as printing markets. Chase pipe coating tapes, Tapecoat and Royston, are sold to oil companies and gas utilities. The company also offers expansion/control joint systems and asphalt additives for roads, bridges, and stadiums. US customers represent about 84% of revenues.

   Chase operates through two segments, Industrial Materials and Construction Materials. Industrial Materials, almost 75% of revenue, provides products that are added to another company's products. The company's stalwart Chase &amp; Sons trademark is included in this segment. Major product families in the segment include insulating and conducting materials, moisture protective coatings, laminated durable papers, and flexible composites and laminates.

   Construction Materials (25%) are sold in final form for use in the transportation and architectural, as well as construction, markets. This segment's products include protective pipe coating tapes, a polymer additive for waterproofing, waterproofing sealants, and expansion joints.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are included in Chase's strategy for growth. In 2014 Chase acquired the remaining 50% it didn't already own in NEPTCO, which supplies engineered materials for producing copper cable and electronic packaging products. The acquisition broadened the menu of products offered by Chase and created synergies between the markets targeted by Chase and Neptco.

  <p>
   Brothers Edward and Francis Chase founded Chase &amp; Sons in 1946 to make rubberized power cable tape fabric. Under Francis' long tenure as president and CEO, the company expanded into related markets. Purchases included Columbia Technical Corporation (electrical insulating varnish and laminates, 1971) and Royston Laboratories (corrosion-resistant pipeline coating, 1972). The company, which by 1973 was called Columbia Chase (shortened to Chase in 1988), won a contract in 1975 to protect seams on the Alaska pipeline. Chase stumbled financially in the late 1980s after diversifying into non-petroleum energy markets. In 1988 Francis retired.
