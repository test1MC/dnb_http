   Many biotech companies focus on human health but ImmuCell has udder pursuits. The company develops products to help livestock farmers maintain the health of their herds. Its animal-health products include First Defense, which prevents diarrhea in calves; MASTiK, which diagnoses bovine mammary gland inflammation; and Wipe Out Dairy Wipes, moist towelettes used to disinfect the teat area of cows prior to milking. ImmuCell makes a product for preventing disease in humans -- Isolate (formerly called Crypto-Scan), a test for
   <em>
    cryptosporidium
   </em>
   in water. When present in municipal drinking water supplies, c
   <em>
    ryptosporidium
   </em>
   can cause diarrheal disease in humans.

   Preferring to concentrate on its animal products, ImmuCell sold its half of AgriCell, a joint venture with dairy cooperative
   <company id="54347">
    Agri-Mark
   </company>
   , that makes lactoferrin, a purified bovine milk protein used in such products as cheese, baby formula, and cosmetics in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, the company purchased all license obligations relating to Mast Out, a Nisin-based treatment for mastitis in lactating dairy cows, from
   <company id="16560">
    Nutrition 21
   </company>
   . Shortly thereafter ImmuCell signed a deal with
   <company id="105061">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   for to make improvements to and manufacture Mast Out. In 2007 Pfizer terminated the deal; however, ImmuCell decided to work on Mast Out on its own. Although the company will incur product-development costs, it believes the sales potential of Mast Out justifies the cost and effort.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="154003">
    Animal Health International
   </company>
   is the company's largest customer, accounting for 21% of ImmuCell's 2008 sales.
