  <p>
   Schiff Nutrition is focused on supporting sales of its strongest product brands, as well as on the development and enhanced marketing of new, innovative products in areas of high consumer demand. The company is directing some of its efforts to developing dietary supplements and nutritional products for the aging baby boomer population. For instance it has launched two enhanced product versions: Move Free Ultra (joint care) and MegaRed Extra Strength (fish oil supplements).
  </p>
  <p>
   Schiff Nutrition is focusing on its branded offerings partly due to increased competition in the private-label business, which is subject to bidding processes that can become highly competitive. The company is also finding that its customers' private-label offerings are cutting into sales of its own branded products. Indeed, in some categories private-label products are leading the market.

  <p>
   Canadian-born Joe Weider was the proverbial 98-lb. weakling in the 1930s. Then he began pumping up by working out. In 1939 he began publishing what he had learned about weight lifting and nutrition in his
   <i>
    Your Physique
   </i>
   newsletter. Response was so positive that he began offering mail-order equipment. His empire grew quickly and, to boost interest in the sport, he created the Mr. Olympia contest and in 1969 introduced Austrian star Arnold Schwarzenegger to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1980 the company, known as Weider Health &amp; Fitness, expanded its nutritional operations into vitamins and herbs. In 1989 the firm broke its operations into subsidiaries: nutrition, publishing, and equipment. In 1995 it acquired two nutrition bar companies, and two years later the nutrition unit went public as Weider Nutrition International.
  </p>
  <p>
   With plans to bulk up in Canada and Western Europe, in 1998 the company acquired Haleko, a maker of sportswear and Europe's largest manufacturer of sports nutrition products. Former Nabisco Ltd. CEO Bruce Wood was named president and CEO in 1999. Also that year Weider Nutrition International began trimming down its product lines from 2,000. In 2000 the company agreed to pay a $400,000 fine to the Federal Trade Commission for making advertising claims without scientific evidence for two weight loss products, PhenCal and PhenCal 106. Weider sold its powders manufacturing operations in 2001, opting to outsource production of its powders.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce long-term debt, the company sold its American Body Building and Science Foods brands to Optimum Nutrition in 2002. In 2003 Weider sold its Venice Beach men's sportswear unit to Hucke, a German apparel company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Weider sold Weider-branded assets (domestic and international) from its Active Nutrition unit to its majority stockholder, Weider Health and Fitness. The price was $14 million. Also in 2005 the company underwent a corporate name change from Weider Nutrition International to Schiff Nutrition International.
