   Buying a terminal instead of a PC could be a Wyse move. Wyse Technology is a leading supplier of thin-client computer network terminals. The company's streamlined devices access software from central servers, eliminating the need for more expensive PCs that store applications locally. It sells through distributors and systems integrators, as well as to manufacturers that sell Wyse terminals under their own brands. It also distributes device management software and offers support services. The company targets the financial services, health care, retail, and transportation industries. Wyse is owned by venture capital investor Garnett &amp; Helfrich. The company was acquired by

   in 2012.

   Over the past couple of years, Dell has been building a more robust selection of cloud computing products and services through acquisitions. With the purchase of Wyse, it expanded its thin-client hardware and desktop virtualization software offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating in a market dominated by entrenched PCs makers, Wyse touts greater reliability and security and lower energy consumption and costs as the competitive advantages of thin clients. The company's product strategy has dovetailed with the growing trend toward cloud computing, which exploits the cost and scale advantages of outsourcing the hosting of business software and data. Wyse has responded by adopting product branding that emphasizes this. Its Cloud Client line of thin client devices feature models tailored for its own ThinOS software platform, as well as Windows and Linux. The company's PocketCloud application enables secure remote access to thin client devices, PCs, and enterprise network servers via mobile devices.

   Wyse Technology is a melting pot story. Hong Kong-born Bernard Tse met his future wife, Taiwan-born Grace, at the
   <company id="40489">
    University of Illinois
   </company>
   . They moved to San Jose, California, where they teamed with Larry Lummis, Jim Shaw, and Chuck Comiso; got a stake from Altos Computer (an early entrant into desktop computers, eventually bought by Acer); and started the company in 1981. Manufacturing terminals in Taiwan, they undersold giants like
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   . Wyse soon became the US's #1 terminal seller, going public in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wyse's fortunes fell when it entered the fiercely competitive PC market during the 1980s. After losses and layoffs, Channel International, a consortium that included the Taiwanese government, acquired Wyse in 1990 for about $270 million. Under new management, led by former
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   SVP Morris Chang, Wyse refocused on monitors and terminals. By 1992 the company had turned around, and two years later it left the PC manufacturing business. The Taipei government's aggressive move to globalize Taiwanese industry fit well with Wyse's distribution channels in the US and elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wyse expanded beyond simple terminals in late 1995 when it unveiled Winterm, designed to work like a PC when used with a Windows NT-based server. In 1997 Wyse touted a Java-based terminal, but test marketing showed little user interest. Two years later Wyse again went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Wyse acquired Netier, a developer of thin-client software that links networks with handheld computers, cell phones, and other devices. Wyse introduced the first thin client based on Microsoft's XP operating system in 2001. Wyse went private in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Garnett &amp; Helfrich Capital bought a controlling interest in Wyse in 2005.
