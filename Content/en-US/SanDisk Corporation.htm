   SanDisk is a top producer of data storage products based on flash memory, which retains data even when power is interrupted. Its products -- which are sold to four primary end-markets (mobile, consumer electronics, computing, and enterprise and hyperscale data centers) -- include removable and embedded memory cards used in digital cameras, mobile phones, digital audio/video players, GPS devices, tablets, and other electronic gear, as well as USB flash drives and solid-state drives (SSDs). It also licenses technologies from its portfolio of some 5,800 US and international patents. SanDisk serves consumers and enterprises worldwide, with most of its sales coming from outside the US. In mid-2016 it was bought by
   <company id="12460">
    Western Digital
   </company>
   , the leading maker of disk drives, in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $19 billion.

  <p>
   SanDisk outsources all of its controller component manufacturing and much of its assembly and test operations to foundries (contract semiconductor manufacturers). Its flash memory wafers primarily come from manufacturing joint ventures with Toshiba, which produce finished wafers in Japan that are sold to SanDisk and Toshiba. SanDisk also has in-house assembly and test operations in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's commercial channel brought in about two-thirds of its revenue in 2016 (ended January) while retail sales accounted for the remaining third.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has locations across the Americas, the Asia/Pacific region, and Europe. Some 60% of its 2016 sales came from the Asia/Pacific region, including 24% from China. The US accounted for 20%, and the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region, 15%.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are distributed primarily by retailers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Its retail channel includes electronics stores, office superstores, and mass merchandisers, among other locations. SanDisk sells products directly to OEMs for use in mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other computer devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's top 10 customers and licensees represent more than 45% of sales;
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   is its largest single customer, accounting for nearly 14% of 2016 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   SanDisk slashed its advertising spending to $13 million in 2016 from $28 million in 2015.

  <p>
   The company's revenues dropped to $5.5 billion in 2016 (ended January) from $6.6 billion in 2015. Sales were lower in commercial and consumer markets. The only geographic region to show an appreciable increase was Hong Kong, where sales rose 11% in 2016 from 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   SanDisk's profit fell to $388 million in 2016 from $1 billion in 2015. Acquisition-related costs and lower revenue combined to drive down net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company reported cash provided by operating activities of $1 billion, down from $1.7 billion the previous year .

  <p>
   While SanDisk has been the riding the wave of rising popularity for flash memory, it also had to watch out for the wave of consolidation that has cresting in memory and semiconductor companies. The company joined the consolidation wave with its agreement to be bought by Western Digital. The deal combines the leading hard disk drive (HDD) maker (Western Digital) and a  leading flash maker (SanDisk). Memory users are increasingly turning to flash for applications such as data centers, but there's still a sizable market for HDDs. The deal should enable the company to approach the market from a position of strength, but competition is intense as HDD companies fight for market share and the flash battle is just beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even with the acquisition, SanDisk's strategy for growth is focused on increasing overall revenue by lowering the cost of the NAND flash memory that powers its technology and by working with other companies to develop new NAND applications and products. To cushion itself against possible limits to the development of NAND, SanDisk also invests in alternative technologies including bit-cost scalable 3-dimensional NAND (BiCS) and 3-dimensional resistive RAM (3D ReRAM).
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2014 SanDisk partnered with GigaSpaces Technologies, a provider of in-memory computing and cloud orchestration technologies to deliver a new product that enables customers to obtain the full performance, scalability and cost benefits of flash storage. In the same year company also partnered with
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   , a leading global technology distributor under which Arrow will offer a wide variety of SanDisk commercial flash storage products to its more than 100,000 customers worldwide. Also in 2014 SanDisk and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   agreed to work together in building and operating a chip plant that will convert to 3D NAND from 2D NAND.
  </p>
  <p>
   In new products, SanDisk released in 2015 an all-flash storage platform, called InfiniFlash storage system, that delivers large capacity, performance, and reliability to for big data and hyperscale workloads, while reducing data center complexity and costs.

  <p>
   In mid-2014 the company announced a major acquisition, offering $1.1 billion in cash for
   <company id="162223">
    Fusion-io
   </company>
   , a maker of flash memory products. The deal will help SanDisk accelerate efforts to create a flash-transformed data center for customers, while Fusion-io will benefit from SanDisk's vertical integration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the acquisition SanDisk spun out the ioControl that had been a part of Fusion-io. The new entity will be known as NexGen Storage, the name it held before it was acquired by Fusion-io. Hybrid systems incorporating hard-disk drives are not part of SanDisk's strategic focus.

  <p>
   SanDisk was co-founded as SunDisk in 1988 by Eli Harari, an expert on nonvolatile memory technology. SunDisk's first product, based on a four-megabit flash chip, was developed with AT&amp;T Bell Labs and released in 1991. In 1992 the company formed a development partnership with disk drive maker
   <company id="14678">
    Seagate Technology
   </company>
   ; as part of the pact, Seagate acquired 25% of SunDisk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because SunDisk was being confused with
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   , in 1995 the company changed its name to SanDisk. It went public that year and introduced the industry's smallest Type II (a PC card slot size designation) flash storage card -- the CompactFlash. Sales increased by nearly 80% in 1995, SanDisk's first profitable year. The next year SanDisk and Matsushita (now
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   ) developed double-density flash, a breakthrough technology that doubled the capacity of flash storage products.
