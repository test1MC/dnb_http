   The guys at Marlow Foods (dba Quorn Foods) will sell you a fungus-based protein seasoned to taste like chicken or any other meat. Marlow Foods has given the world Quorn, a meat substitute that is made from a mycoprotein similar to mushrooms (not the usual suspects of soy or grain). Its frozen offerings include nuggets, patties, cutlets, entrees, and "Quorn dogs." A meat-free sausage is also sold under the Cauldron brand. The company, which operates two facilities in the UK, is a popular meat substitute in both Europe and the US, where it is sold by natural foods retailers and mass-market grocers. Marlow Foods is a portfolio company of

   In 2015 the company announced a Â£40 million investment in its production facilities at Billingham. The spend will include investing in new product creation and research and development, with a number of launches planned for later in 2015. Marlow Foods was also recognized by
   <company id="133975">
    The Carbon Trust

   for its ongoing work to reduce its carbon footprint.

   Formerly owned by
   <company id="117846">
    Premier Foods
   </company>
   , Marlow Foods was acquired by
   <company id="135669">
    Exponent Private Equity
   </company>
   for $328 million in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Exponent's ownership, Marlow Foods looked to build its meat-free customer base beyond Europe to North America. The private equity company funded new product development and a packaging do-over coupled with widening distribution and increasing advertising. The meat-alternative maker's product launches included its first all-vegan product, an egg-free vegan burger available in the US.

   While the initial discovery and development of mycoprotein began in the 1960s, Quorn in its myriad forms was nurtured in the labs of pharmaceutical maker
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   in 1985. Marlow Foods was created a year later to market the new products in the UK. Quorn made the leap to Europe in 1992, but didn't hit the US until 2002. By 2003 AstraZeneca deemed Quorn non-core to its operations and sold Marlow Foods to
   <company id="135319">
    Montagu Private Equity
   </company>
   for $115 million. Montagu supported its growth, but appointed
   <company id="61537">
    Rothschild
   </company>
   to auction the business off in 2005. Premier Foods purchased Marlow Foods for $312 million in 2007 (close to what it sold it for in 2011).
