   subsidiary since 1986, Jennie-O processes more than 1 billion pounds of turkey annually for the production of fresh, frozen, refrigerated, and deli products. Answering the convenience-food call, it also offers heat-and-serve turkey entrees under the SO EASY brand name. Jennie-O also offers a full line of food service products. The company's more than 1,500 different turkey products are available throughout the US, as well as in about 25 other countries. The company was formed in 2001 as a result of the merger of Jennie-O Foods and The Turkey Store Company.

   Jennie-O-Turkey Store (JOTS) reported net sales of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013 (ended October), an increase of 3% versus the prior year. (JOTS contributes about 18% of parent

   's annual sales.) Value-added products, including fresh turkey chubs, turkey breakfast sausage, and turkey bacon, outperformed fresh turkey and packed products. Net income declined by 7% year-over-year, to $222 million. Significantly higher grain costs and lower commodity turkey meat prices depressed profits in fiscal 2013. However, the company saw a significant pick up in sales and profits in the fourth quarter of the year, giving it reason to be optimistic about fiscal 2014.

   Hormel is looking forward to more favorable grain and turkey commodity costs in fiscal 2014 (ends October), and, as a result, improvement in both sales and earnings at JOTS. A new ad campaign -- entitled "Make the Switch" -- is expected to drive strong sales of lean ground turkey in fiscal 2014. The company plans to increase production modestly to support JOTS's value-added product needs.

   To drive sales among health-conscious consumers, the company has a high-profile tie up with the popular TV shows including The Biggest Loser, whose contestants tout the benefits of Jennie-O's lean protein turkey products in commercials, and Recipe Rehab.
