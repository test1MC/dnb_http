   , but FMC = chemicals, and lots of them. Once a multi-industry company with assets in areas as diverse as oil field equipment and food machinery, FMC Corporation now focuses on industrial, specialty, and agricultural chemicals. The company's industrial chemicals include hydrogen peroxide, and phosphorus chemicals. The rest of its sales come from agricultural products (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) and specialty chemicals (food and pharmaceutical additives). FMC is trying to find the right business equation to increase its operational efficiency and global coverage.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   FMC earns most of its revenues from Latin America (30% of 2015 revenues) and North America (28%). It also has operations in Asia/Pacific (23%), and Europe/the Middle East/Africa (19%). The company operates 32 manufacturing facilities and mines in 19 countries. Its major research and development facilities are in Ewing, New Jersey and in Shanghai, China.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company operates in three segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions, FMC Health and Nutrition, and FMC Lithium.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC Agricultural Solutions segment (69% of FMC's 2015 revenues) develops, markets, and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals - insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control.
  </p>
        <p>
   The FMC Health and Nutrition segment (24%) focuses on food, pharmaceutical ingredients, nutraceuticals, personal care and similar markets. Its food ingredients are used to enhance texture, color, structure and physical stability. The pharmaceutical additives are used for binding, encapsulation, and disintegrant applications.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC Health and Nutrition is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), carrageenan, alginates, natural colorants, pectin and omega-3, all naturally derived ingredients that have high value-added applications in the production of food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and other specialty consumer products. MCC, processed from specialty grades of renewable hardwood and softwood pulp, provides binding and disintegrant properties for dry tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many food products. Carrageenan and alginates, both processed from natural seaweed, are used in a wide variety of food, pharmaceutical and oral care applications. Natural colorants are utilized in specialty products used in the food, beverage, personal care, nutrition and pharmaceutical markets. Pectin, derived from natural citrus fruit peels, is utilized as a hydrocolloid texturant and stabilizer. Omega-3 is sourced from fish oils and utilized in other pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.
  </p>
        <p>
   The FMC Lithium segment (7%) makes a wide range of both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries. Lithium is an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications, including smart phones, tablets, laptop computers, military devices and aerospace and other next-generation energy storage technologies. Lithium is also critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The Agricultural Products segment sells its products through national, regional, and local distributors, as well as joint venture distributors. It accesses key Western European markets through a partly-owned Belgian-based pesticide distribution company, Belchim Crop Protection N.V. FMC also has joint venture arrangements with
   <company id="123904">
    Nufarm Limited
   </company>
   in three countries in Eastern Europe. In North America, the company accesses the market through several major national and regional distributors including a company-owned sales and marketing organization in Canada.
  </p>
        <p>
   In Latin America (which includes the large agricultural market of Brazil) FMC sells directly to large growers through its own sales and marketing organization, and through independent distributors. It has access a majority of the European markets through its own sales and marketing teams. The company accesses key Asian markets either through local independent distributors or its own sales and marketing units.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2015 FMC's net revenues dropped by 19% to $3.3 billion due to the discontinued operations of FMC Alkali Chemicals division.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income was $489 million (up 59% on 2014) due to income from discontinued operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 cash from operating activities was $357.7 million, a decrease of $731 million compared to 2014 as a result of changes in accounts payable, income taxes, and a change in other operating assets and liabilities.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's strategic plan, Vision 2015, focuses on several areas, including strengthening the company's market positions through organic growth and selective acquisitions; increasing its presence in emerging markets; shifting to a more centralized organization to leverage the size and scope of the company; and proactively managing its portfolio, assessing each unit's performance and taking action quickly when conditions warrant.
  </p>
        <p>
   The markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring in Japan, China, and South Korea, driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries.
  </p>
        <p>
   The food and pharmaceutical additives product groups are the areas of choice where FMC is planning for growth. Product development has been concentrated on specialty chemicals product areas such as energy storage (lithium products for batteries), natural food ingredients, and agricultural products (home and garden pesticides).
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC Agricultural Solutions' organic growth plan focuses on market and product innovations while strengthening market access. The company has restructured its Agricultural Solutions operations in Brazil to position FMC to better address current market conditions in that vast market. FMC Health and Nutrition's organic focus is primarily on new products and new applications for existing products. FMC Minerals' focus is on achieving lowest unit cost production of natural commodities.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014 the company opened its Asia Innovation Center in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in the Pudong area of Shanghai, China as the company's hub for research and development, technical innovation, operational support and executive management in the Asia Pacific region.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year FMC and Actagro, LLC entered into a Technical Development and Distribution agreement for FMC to be the exclusive marketer and distributor of Actagro Organic Acid based soil and plant health nutritional products in the Asia-Pacific region. FMC will add Actagro technology solutions to its already considerable portfolio in the region.
  </p>
        <p>
   To raise cash to pay down debt, in 2015 FMC sold its Alkali Chemicals (soda ash) business to
   <company id="162829">
    Tronox
   </company>
   for $1.6 billion. In 2014 it sold it peroxygens business to affiliates of One Equity Partners (the private investment arm of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Cohj) for $200 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC is also pursuing innovation and collaboration initiatives to boost its research and development activities. In 2015 the company spent $143.7 million on research and development.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>FMC acquired part of DuPont's crop protection business and sold its health and nutrition business to DuPont in a deal announced in March 2017. Overall, FMC will spend about $1.6 billion on the exchange because of the relative values of the assets. DuPont made the deal in order to gain approval from European regulators for its acquisition of Dow Chemical. Assets that FMC will acquire from DuPont are the global chewing pest insecticide portfolio, global cereal broadleaf herbicides, and much of the global crop protection research and development capabilities.  FMC expects the business to generate about $1.5 billion in revenue in 2017. The health and nutrition business going to DuPont develops and sells food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and personal care goods. The transaction should close in the 2017 third quarter.</p>
        <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired Denmark-based Cheminova A/S, a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="176613">
    Auriga Industries A/S
   </company>
   . Cheminova is a multinational crop protection company. Its direct market access in Europe complements FMC's strong position in Latin America. Its technology allows FMC to expand in existing crop segments and provide accelerated access to additional crops, such as cereals. It also strengthens FMC's offerings to existing customers, especially in sugarcane, soybeans, and cotton.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   After retiring to California, inventor John Bean developed a pump to deliver a continuous spray of insecticide in 1884. This invention led to the Bean Spray Pump Company in 1904. In 1928 Bean Spray Pump went public and bought Anderson-Barngrover (food-growing and -processing equipment). The company became Food Machinery Corporation the next year. It bought Peerless Pump (agricultural and industrial pumps) in 1933.
  </p>
        <p>
   During WWII the company began making military equipment. It entered the agricultural chemical field when it bought Niagara Sprayer &amp; Chemical (1943). After the war it added Westvaco Chemical (1948) and changed its name to Food Machinery &amp; Chemical.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Bean family ran the company until 1956, when John Bean's grandson, John Crummey, retired as chairman. The company extended its product line, buying Oil Center Tool (wellhead equipment, 1957), Sunland Industries (fertilizer and insecticides, 1959), and Barrett Equipment (automotive brake equipment, 1961).
  </p>
        <p>
   In light of its growing diversification, the company changed its name to FMC Corporation in 1961. Major purchases in the 1960s included American Viscose (rayon and cellophane, 1963) and Link-Belt (equipment for power transmission and for bulk-material handling, 1967).
  </p>
        <p>
   To be centrally located, FMC moved its headquarters from San Jose to Chicago in 1972. Through the 1970s and early 1980s, the company sold several slow-growing businesses, including its pump and fiber divisions (1976), semiconductor division (1979), industrial packaging division (1980), Niagara Seed Operation (1980), and Power Transmission Group (1981).
  </p>
        <p>
   It moved into other markets just as quickly. These included a Nevada gold mine (through a 1979 joint venture with Freeport Minerals), Bradley armored personnel carriers (through an early-1980s contract with the US Army), and lithium (by acquiring Lithium Corp. of America, 1985). In a 1986 antitakeover move, FMC gave employees a larger stake in the company.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC bought Ciba-Geigy's flame-retardant and water-treatment businesses in 1992 and combined its defense operations with Harsco as United Defense. FMC's 1994 acquisitions included Abex's Jetway Systems Division (aircraft support systems) and
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   's Automated Vehicle Systems group. FMC formed a joint venture with
   <company id="56878">
    Nippon Sheet Glass
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56930">
    Sumitomo Corporation
   </company>
   in 1995 to mine for soda ash.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC made a deal with
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   in 1996 to commercialize new herbicides. The company debuted its composite (nonmetallic) prototype armored vehicle in 1997. In the long shadow of reduced defense budgets, FMC and Harsco sold their stagnant defense operation for $850 million to
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   investment firm.
  </p>
        <p>
   The sale of its defense division didn't protect FMC from a $310 million damage award in a whistleblower suit against the company in 1998. A federal jury found that FMC had misled the Army about the safety of the Bradley armored infantry vehicle. The court later lowered the penalty to about $90 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 the company agreed to combine its phosphorus operations with Solutia to form a joint venture called Astaris. That year FMC sold its process-additives unit to
   <company id="10674">
    Great Lakes Chemical
   </company>
   (now called
   <company id="139261">
    Chemtura
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC bought Northfield Freezing Systems (food processing) in 2000. The following year the company split into separate chemical and machinery companies by spinning off its machinery business as
   <company id="103275">
    FMC Technologies
   </company>
   ; FMC Corporation then moved its headquarters from Chicago to Philadelphia. In early 2002 FMC sold its sodium cyanide business to Cyanco Company, a joint venture between
   <company id="106501">
    Degussa Corporation
   </company>
   and Winnemucca Chemicals (a subsidiary of
   <company id="45976">
    Nevada Chemicals
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 FMC and Solutia sold Astaris (now called
   <company id="61208">
    ICL Performance Products
   </company>
   ) to
   <company id="107109">
    Israel Chemicals Limited
   </company>
   for $255 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Chairman and CEO William Walter stepped down as chief executive in 2010 and was replaced by Pierre Brondeau, who was also named to the Board of Directors. Brondeau had been the long-time CEO of
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
   </company>
   before its acquisition by
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   , for which he worked briefly.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 FMC closed its phosphates factory in Huelva, Spain, due to increasing environmental constraints and the facility's poor financial performance. A Spanish court prohibited FMC from storing phosphogypsum on a site adjacent to the production facility, leaving it few viable alternatives. The company's decision resulted in a $110 million restructuring charge in 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   That same year, the company acquired two new herbicides, pyroxasulfone and fluthiacet-methyl herbicide, in a joint deal with Kumiai Chemical Industry and Ihara Chemical Industry companies. Both herbicides are effective on glyphosate-resistant weeds. FMC will market the herbicides globally. In 2009 the company acquired the CB Professional Products line of insecticides from Waterbury Companies. FMC also bought a line of fungicides from Italian company Isagro.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC also acquired two fungicide products from
   <company id="106053">
    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   in 2011. It picked up Rovral iprodione and Sportak prochloraz fungicides for agricultural use outside of Europe. The fungicides, used primarily in the tree, fruit, and vegetable markets, will broaden FMC's product portfolio.
  </p>
        <p>
   FMC also acquired the European persulfates business of RheinPerChemie GmbH from Unionchimica SpA in 2011. Germany-based RheinPerChemie manufactured persulfates in Rheinfelden and had a sales office in Hamburg. The deal is expected to strengthen the global reach of  FMC's Peroxygens unit by boosting its market share for persulfates in Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   Broadening its portfolio of peroxygen-based products even more in 2011, FMC acquired Canada-based Adventus Intellectual Property, which develops specialty remediation technologies for soil and groundwater.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 FMC acquired UK-based Phytone, a leading European natural colors producer for the food and beverage, personal care, and nutrition markets. The acquisition fits into FMC's Vision 2015 growth strategy because it expects the natural colors market to reach more than $1 billion by 2015. It also purchased natural pectin maker Pectine Italia. The move corresponds with the natural foods plan and launched the company into the pectin market.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 FMC formed a joint venture with a consortium of Argentine companies to create Ruralco Soluciones SA, an agrochemical distribution company. FMC's partner includes affiliates of Argentine distributor Agropecuaria del Litoral. The venture allowed FMC to expand through access to Argentina's $1.7 billion crop protection market.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 FMC concluded a licensing agreement with Belchim Crop Protection for access to valifenalate, a fungicide which will be introduced into the Agricultural Solutions segment for use in mixtures in the Americas as well as select countries in Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 the Agricultural Products Group entered into a research and development collaboration agreement for several proprietary biological pesticides from Química Agronómica de México. The two companies will co-develop the new fungicides and insecticides for use globally.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year the company acquired exclusive rights to a patented, broad-spectrum crop protection product from
   <company id="106053">
    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   . FMC planned to develop and distribute the novel product for row crops in the US and Canada.
