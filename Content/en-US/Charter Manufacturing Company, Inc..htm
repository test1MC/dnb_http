   The company is looking to expand both geographically and in terms of product offerings. Growing its global footprint, in 2012 the company expanded its European operations with the purchase of a 57,000 sq.-ft. manufacturing plant in Burntwood, UK. The expansion strengthens Charter Automotive's position as a global supplier to OEM automotive and powertrain industries and helps it meet the growing demands of customers in Europe and elsewhere.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired Wells Manufacturing Company (owner of Dura-Bar and DuraBar Metal Services). The acquired assets (which added a fourth division to Charter Manufacturing's family of companies -- Charter Dura-Bar) focus on producing specialty iron bar and distributing bronze alloy products.

  <p>
   Facing tough market conditions, Charter Automotive closed part of its steelmaking operations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 2010. The company ceased making steel dipsticks and tubes for cars and trucks as part of a wider response to global market trends. The company, which kept its engine components operations elsewhere in Milwaukee active, sold the Heather Avenue plant idled by this move.

   Charter Manufacturing was established in 1936 and is owned by the family of founder Alfred Mellowes.
