   Encyclopædia Britannica thinks it knows everything, and it probably does. The company has responded to the digital age by putting all of its information online (Britannica.com), as well as on CD-ROM and DVD, and via mobile applications. In 2012 it ceased publishing the print version of its flagship 32-volume
   <em>
    Encyclopædia Britannica
   </em>
   (first published in 1768). Encyclopædia Britannica also publishes dictionaries online through its
   <company id="107577">
    Merriam-Webster
   </company>
   subsidiary, while its Britannica Digital Learning publishes education products. Swiss financier Jacob Safra (a nephew of the late banking king Edmond Safra) owns the company.

   Engraver Andrew Bell and printer and bookseller Colin Macfarquhar created the first edition of the
   <i>
    Encyclopædia Britannica
   </i>
   in Scotland, releasing the three-volume set in weekly installments between 1768 and 1771. Benjamin Franklin and John Locke were among early contributors. The second edition, completed in 1784, expanded to 10 volumes; the fourth (1809) contained 20. The ninth edition (1889) captured the scientific spirit of the age with articles by Thomas Henry Huxley and James Clerk Maxwell.

  <p>
   American businessmen Horace Hooper and Walter Jackson purchased the
   <i>
    Encyclopædia
   </i>
   in 1901 and established a presence in the US with the formation of Encyclopædia Britannica Company. It published the first
   <i>
    Britannica Book of the Year
   </i>
   in 1913.  Sears chairman Julius Rosenwald bought the company in 1929 and moved its headquarters to Chicago, attempting to market
   <i>
    Britannica
   </i>
   through Sears' retail operations, as well as with door-to-door sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   William Benton (of Benton &amp; Bowles Advertising) bought the business from Sears in 1941 and built a nationwide sales force with a hard-sell reputation. Britannica released its first foreign-language encyclopedia,
   <i>
    Enciclopedia Barsa,
   </i>
   in 1957 and acquired dictionary publisher G. &amp; C. Merriam in 1964. When Benton died in 1974, he bequeathed the operation to the not-for-profit William Benton Foundation, the sole beneficiary of which was the

    University of Chicago
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Britannica later bought out rival Compton's Encyclopedia in the mid-1970s. The 1989 CD-ROM release of
   <i>
    Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia
   </i>
   was a first for the industry, but Britannica sold Compton's NewMedia division to Chicago's Tribune Company in 1993 just before the CD-ROM market exploded. The company also promised not to release a competing multimedia version of Encyclopaedia Britannica for two years. Not realizing that the electronic revolution was upon them and reluctant to change its established and profitable door-to-door sales techniques, the conservative company fell behind challengers who offered CD-ROMs including
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   and its
   <i>
    Funk &amp; Wagnalls
   </i>
   product (later relaunched as
   <i>
    Encarta
   </i>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   With book sales dwindling and heavy competition, Britannica cut its prices and ceased its door-to-door marketing in 1996 after Safra led the purchase of the company. It agreed to sell both its CD-ROM and print encyclopedias in retail stores in 1997 and lured publisher Paul Hoffman away from
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   's successful
   <i>
    Discover
   </i>
   magazine. Britannica Internet Guide (BIG), a free Internet search engine, launched that year. Britannica added guest columns and other features to BIG in 1998 and renamed it eBlast (it changed the site's name again to Britannica the following year).
  </p>
  <p>
   Encyclopædia Britannica Holdings (Safra's umbrella firm for the publisher) launched a sister firm, Britannica.com, in 1999 to oversee the company's electronic and Internet products and services. CEO Don Yannias resigned his post with the print company and took the reins of the new digital firm, allowing Hoffman to take over as the publisher's president. Britannica.com struggled along with the rest of the Internet industry in 2000, laying off almost 25% of its staff.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Yannias left the company entirely and was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, an executive from an Israeli educational technology firm. Later that year the company integrated Britannica.com back into the encyclopedia unit of Encyclopædia Britannica, a move that involved severely downsizing the Web staff. Yeshua departed the company in 2003 and was replaced by Britannica executive Jorge Cauz.
  </p>
  <p>
   A new, revised printing of
   <em>
    Encyclopædia Britannica
   </em>
   was issued in 2005. Focusing on digital enhancements, in 2008 it made its encyclopedia content available in an iPhone app, and in 2009 it converted its 60-volume
   <em>
    Great Books of the Western World
   </em>
   set to an e-book format. Its final print version was its 2010 edition. The company converted to a digital-only business model in 2012.
