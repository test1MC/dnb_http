  <p>
   Mitsubishi Steel's revenues climbed 6% in 2015 compared to 2014. Its net income also jumped 5% during that same time period due to the spike in revenues coupled with dividends income and decreased deferred income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2015 was fueled by increased sales from its Special Steel Bars, Machinery, and Formed and Fabricated Products segments. The increases were attributed to the overall recovery in demand within the construction machinery, industrial machinery, and machine tool industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The segments in 2015 were also helped by increased sales of special steels, precision castings, and special alloy powders in addition to a rise in power generation and related products.
