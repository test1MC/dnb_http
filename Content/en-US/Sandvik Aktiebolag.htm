  <p>
   Sandvik has historically used acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2014 it acquired Varel International Energy Services, a supplier of drilling gear such as drill bits and products used for well construction. The $740 million deal enhanced Sandvik's growth in the oil and gas sector and strengthened its position in serving the mining and construction industries.

  <p>
   Sandvik's origins go back to 1862, when a steelworks called Hogbo Stal &amp; Jernwerks was founded by Goran Fredrik Goransson in Sandviken, Sweden. Its products in the 1860s included steam hammers and rock drills. Hogbo Stal &amp; Jernwerks' primary financial backer, Johan Holm, had money problems that left him and the company financially ruined; the company went bankrupt in 1866. Hogbo Stal &amp; Jernwerks was reorganized and renamed Sandvikens Jernwerks AB, and Anders Henrik Goransson, the founder's son, took over as the new manager.

   By the 1890s the company's steel products included cold-rolled steel rod and strip, and seamless tubing. It also made manufactured products such as saws, boiler tubes for steamships and railway engines, and wire for umbrellas. Sandvikens Jernwerks was listed on the Stockholm stock exchange in 1901.
