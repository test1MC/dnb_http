   -Kaneka Corporation is part of the solution, but contributes maybe a little to the problem as well. The diversified company's products include anti-hypertensive intermediates, but also margarine and shortening. Its largest individual segment makes makes food products. But its chemicals units include both basic chemicals and plastic resins (caustic soda and sealants). Other units manufacture magnet wire, optical films, synthetic fibers, electronics, and pharmaceutical intermediates. Kaneka was among the first Japanese chemical companies to expand overseas when it launched a Belgian subsidiary in 1970 and still draws more a third of its sales from outside the country.
