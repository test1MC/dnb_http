   Charisma Brands, LLC caters to collectors -- especially the ones who collect porcelain dolls that bear Marie Osmond's name and sometimes her face. The Marie Osmond Collection includes collectible dolls, figurines, and storybooks. The firm also sells the Kewpie, Artista, and Lulla-My-Baby dolls. Charisma Brands markets its products through catalogs, direct mail, television shopping shows, and its Web site. The company also promotes Maria Osmond appearances, and offers repairs through its "doll hospital".

  <p>
   Louis and Tamara Knickerbocker started out in cosmetics by founding International Beauty Supply in 1985 and LaVie Cosmetics in 1987 with comedienne Phyllis Diller and her plastic surgeon, Michael Elam. In 1989 the Knickerbockers co-founded yet another company, MLF Enterprises, to sell replicas of Farah Fawcett's jewelry. The following year Louis formed Knickerbocker Creations to develop products and garner the celebrity endorsements to market them. In 1993 International Beauty Supply was renamed The L.L. Knickerbocker Co. It went public in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year it bought the Krasner Group, a costume jewelry manufacturer that markets its products on QVC. Knickerbocker also bought Grant King International and S.L.S. Trading Co., both Thailand-based jewelers. It acquired 40% of Pure Energy Corp. that year. (It currently owns about 32% of the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Knickerbocker formed a joint venture with Arkenol Holdings to sell alternative fuels made from biomass solids and to build biorefineries in China. It also opened a jewelry showroom in Thailand and built a silver plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decreasing sales led to losses of $4 million in 1997 and $28 million in 1998. In 1998 it cut about 25% of its US workforce and discontinued some of its products. Also in 1998 Knickerbocker introduced a line of dolls endorsed by diet guru Richard Simmons. Three Asian creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against Knickerbocker in August 1999. In October the company divested its line of Georgetown collectible dolls as part of an effort to decrease its low-margin mail order and catalog business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2000 the company filed its Chapter 11 reorganization plan in federal bankruptcy court, but was forced to withdraw the plan later in the year. That year the company also discontinued its lines of Annette Funicello and Richard Simmons brand items. In mid-2001 Knickerbocker announced plans to put itself up for sale. In September US Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the company's assets, which were bought by Marie Osmond's husband Brian Blosil; they renamed the company Marian, LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2004 Marian, LLC changed its name to Charisma Brands, LLC, and Blosil sold his majority stake in the company to colleagues at Charisma Brands.
