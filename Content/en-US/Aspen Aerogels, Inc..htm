   Aspen Aerogels' insulation products -- which look like thin, flexible blankets -- represent a new breed of thermal insulation. Its two product lines, Cryogel and Pyrogel, are used by industrial companies to keep pipes and storage tanks at certain temperatures and protect equipment from water and fire damage.

   . Its Spaceloft brand insulation, develop with BASF's Construction Chemicals division, is used by the building and construction market to insulate walls and roofs. Aspen held an IPO in mid-2014.

  <p>
   In mid-2014 Aspen launched and IPO and raised nearly $84 million. It intends to use $30 million of the net proceeds to fund the additional expenditures necessary for the design and development of a new product line. About $20 million will go towards debt, and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which will include the funding of a new plant.

   The need for a new type of thermal insulation came about from demand for more energy efficient products in the industrial and construction industries. Aspen's products are five times more protective than traditional insulation, and its light weight and compact design makes it simple to ship and install. Besides its products, the company also conducts government-funded research and development related to aerogel technology for agencies such as the

   Aspen has enjoyed explosive revenue growth over the years. From 2011 to 2013 its revenues almost doubled from $46 million to $86 million. Over the last few years, Aspen has experienced growth in sales of its aerogel products in the refinery and petrochemical sectors throughout North America, South America, and Asia.

  <p>
   Despite the impressive revenue growth, Aspen has yet to achieve profitability: it suffered a net loss of nearly $48 million in 2013. (Aerogels are expensive to manufacture, and costs are typically high each year.)

   Aspen is focused on increasing its product lines and manufacturing capacity to meet growing demand for its products. It has plans to launch a second manufacturing facility in Europe or Asia.
