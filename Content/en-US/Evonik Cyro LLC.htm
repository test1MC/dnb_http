  <p>
   An innovative company, in 2013 Evonik Cyro introduced Acrylic LED Whites, a new line of acrylic molding and extrusion compounds specifically designed for backlit LED lighting applications. Growing is capacity, that year it brought a polymer additives plant on stream in Jayhawk, Kansas, and raised the capacity of precipitated silica production at its Chester plant by 20,000 metric tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company launched ACRYLITE Hi-Gloss, a co-extruded acrylic sheet with two homogenous layers that prevents cavities. That year, Evonik Cyro teamed up with marine cover fabric manufacturer CY4EZ to develop ACRYLIT Heatstop Resist with UV filtering OP3, a customized specialty acrylic for boat windows that blocks 98% of UV light and limits heat penetration.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company streamlined its North American operations in 2009, cutting back its manufacturing and laying off some 56 workers, mostly at its Sanford, Maine facility. Another 30 workers lost their jobs in 2010, as the cell cast production line was completely shut down. The move was prompted by falling demand in the auto, building, and retail display sectors. The plant continues to manufacture acrylic sheet and molding compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Formerly known as Cyro Industries, the company was founded in 1976.
