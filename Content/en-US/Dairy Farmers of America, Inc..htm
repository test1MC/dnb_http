   The members of Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) are partners in cream. DFA is one of the world's largest dairy cooperatives, with nearly 15,000 member/farmers in 48 states. About 3 million cows belonging to member/farmers produce 64 billion pounds of milk a year (roughly 30% of milk production in the US), which DFA markets. Along with fresh and shelf-stable fluid milk, the co-op produces cheese, butter, dried milk powder, and other dairy products for industrial, wholesale, and retail customers. It also offers contract manufacturing services. The co-op owns more than 30 manufacturing plants nationwide. DFA, whose profits are shared based on member contribution, is a major supplier to dairy giant

   .

  <p>
   DFA owns 33 manufacturing plants nationwide. The facilities are focused on several functions and product categories, including consumer cheese and butter, consumer fluid, ingredient cheese and protein, and contract manufacturing.

  <p>
   The national milk cooperative is based in Kansas City, Missouri and divides the US into seven areas (Central, Mideast, Mountain, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Western) to ensure grassroots representation.

  <p>
   DFA reported net sales of $17.9 billion in 2014, a 28% increase compared with 2013's $12.8 billion in sales. The uptick in sales primarily resulted from higher milk prices in the US. The cooperative's adjusted net income was $61.3 million and it returned a total of $43.1 million to members in 2014.

  <p>
   Although DFA's primary business is to market its members' milk, the cooperative has invested heavily in facilities and joint ventures to process its fluid milk into value-added products and high-end dairy-based ingredients to expand its product portfolio and protect members from price swings for fluid milk. To that end, it makes and markets cheese, butter, nonfat milk powders, and other dairy ingredients under household name brands, including Borden, Breakstone's, and Keller's, as well as private label products through contract manufacture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the co-op opened a 33,000-square-foot ingredient processing plant in Cass City, Michigan. The $40 million plant will serve a region where milk production is outpacing local plant capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, DFA opened a new cold process milk separation plant in Linwood, New York, to produce cream and skim milk for regional customers. It also opened a plant in Fallon, Nevada that produces powdered milk for global customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The co-op expects to continue to benefit from its diverse activities coupled with higher average commodity prices for dairy products. The marketing of raw milk accounted for approximately 74% of sales. Sales have been bolstered by the acquisition of Berkshire Dairy and Food Products, a producer of dairy ingredients, and DFA's investment in Castro Cheese Company, which makes and markets queso fresco, panea, and queso quesadilla under the La Vaquita brand. Control of the brand launched DFA into the increasingly popular Hispanic cheese market. DFA's efforts to shore up earnings and mitigate a volatile commodity market have included trimming certain investments.

  <p>
   In January 2014, DFA acquired family-owned Oakhurst Dairy, which sources milk from 70 farmers in Maine and has processing and bottling facilities in Portland, Maine. Oakhurst, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of DFA and continues to operate independently, distributes milk throughout northern New England and eastern Massachusetts. Oakhurst's annual sales are estimated to be $110 million. In April 2014, DFA purchased
   <company id="54775">
    Dairylea Cooperative
   </company>
   based in East Syracuse, New York with some 1,200 members. The two cooperatives have worked together since DFA was formed in 1998, coordinating milk assembly, transportation and marketing, as well as joint management of Farm Services and membership operations in the Northeast.
  </p>
  <p>
   DFA acquired Frederick, Maryland-based Dairy Maid Dairy, a family-owned processor of milk, juice, and fruit drinks, in September 2013. The purchase was consistent with DFA's strategy to increase its commercial footprint and expand ownership in the fluid and fresh dairy category. Dairy Maid's customers include major grocery chains, schools, prisons, and military bases.

  <p>
   Mid-America Dairymen (Mid-Am), the largest of the cooperatives that merged to form Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), was born in 1968. At that time, several Midwestern dairy co-ops banded together to attack common economic problems, such as reduced government subsidies, price drops resulting from a rising milk surplus, dealer consolidation, and improvements in production, processing, and packaging. The merging organizations -- representing 15,000 dairy farmers -- were Producers Creamery Company (Springfield, Missouri), Sanitary Milk Producers (St. Louis), Square Deal Milk Producers (Highland, Illinois), Mid-Am (Kansas City, Missouri), and Producers Creamery Company of Chillicothe (north central Missouri).
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1970s Mid-Am struggled with internal restructuring. Most dairy farmers and co-ops were hit hard by the energy crisis and the government's decision to allow increased dairy imports in 1973, the same year the
   <company id="150279">
    US Justice Department
   </company>
   filed an antitrust suit against Mid-Am. (A judge cleared the co-op 12 years later.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1974 Mid-Am lost almost $8 million on revenues of $625 million, chalked up to record-high feed prices, a weakened economy, a milk surplus, and a massive inventory loss. Co-op veteran Gary Hanman was named CEO that year. Over the next two years, Mid-Am cut costs, sold corporate frills, downsized management, and began marketing more of its own products under the Mid-America Farms label, thus reducing dependency on commodity sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mid-Am expanded its research and development efforts throughout the 1980s. The co-op opened its services to farmers in California and New Mexico in 1993, and a series of mergers in 1994 and 1995 nearly doubled its size. In 1997 it purchased some of Borden's dairy operations, including rights to the valuable Elsie the Cow and Borden's trademarks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wary of falling milk prices, Mid-Am merged with Western Dairymen Cooperative, Milk Marketing, and the Southern Region of Associated Milk Producers at the end of 1997 to form DFA. Hanman moved into the seat of CEO at the new co-op. DFA began a series of joint ventures with the #1 US dairy processor, Suiza Foods (now
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   DFA added California Gold (more than 330 farmers, 1998) and Independent Cooperative Milk Producers Association (730 dairy farmer members in Michigan and parts of Ohio and Indiana, 1999). In another joint venture with
   <company id="93319">
    Suiza
   </company>
   , in early 2000 DFA sold its 50% stake in the US's #3 fluid milk processor, Southern Foods, in exchange for 34% of a new company named Suiza Dairy Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   After mollifying the government's antitrust fears, DFA acquired the butter operations of
   <company id="59011">
    Sodiaal
   </company>
   North America in 2000. It then molded all its butter businesses into a new entity,
   <company id="112629">
    Keller's Creamery
   </company>
   . However, another acquisition did not fare as well. The same year, DFA acquired controlling interest in Southern Belle Dairy only to have the merger challenged three years later by the
   <company id="150279">
    Department of Justice
   </company>
   . Arguing that the merger formed a monopoly in school milk sales in several states, the Department of Justice filed suit which a federal judge later dismissed.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2001 the cooperative went in with
   <company id="40272">
    Land O'Lakes
   </company>
   50/50 to purchase a cheese plant from
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   . Later in the year as Suiza Foods acquired Dean Foods (and took on its name), DFA sold back its stake in Suiza Dairy Group to the new
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   . DFA then teamed up with a group of dairy investors to form a new 50/50 joint venture,
   <company id="104464">
    National Dairy Holdings
   </company>
   , which received 11 processing plants from Dean Foods as part of the exchange for Suiza Dairy.
