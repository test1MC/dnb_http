   Getty Images doesn't have a photographic memory, but with its accumulation of images it's something of a memory for photography.

Its offerings news, sports, and entertainment content, plus rare and contemporary archival imagery under brands iStock and Thinkstock. It also offers photo services for corporate clients.

Getty Images was founded 1995 by Mark Getty (chairman) and Jonathan Klein (CEO).

   Getty has moved from selling a small number of images to a small number of customers to selling many images to more customers - at prices. At the same time, the company has gone from individual sales of rights to use images for a certain time to develop more subscriptions that allow unlimited use. Getty also allows free use of embeddable images through its partnership with Embed.ly. That provides users - from developers, online publishers, and individuals - access to millions of embeddable images. The company also has benefited from the number of publishers who have outsourced photography to a degree to Getty and its cadre of active photographers and deep archives.

   In 2014 Getty Images partnered with Pantone and Tumblr to launch Stories and Trends. The company also partnered with Embed.ly which provides tens of thousands of developers, online publishers and individual users with access to millions of embeddable images directly within the Embed.ly ecosystem. Getty also partnered with Storify by LiveFyre, a social network service that enables the creation of stories or timelines using content sourced online and via social media.
