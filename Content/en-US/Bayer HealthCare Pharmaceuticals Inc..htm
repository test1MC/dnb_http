   <company id="91276">
    Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   (formerly Bayer Schering Pharma) division, which is based in Germany. In addition to being a leading provider of women's health products including birth control and hormone therapies (YAZ and Mirena), Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals sells specialty therapeutics in areas including diagnostic imaging, hematology, neurology, and cancer. It makes products that target serious chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Betaseron) and general health ailments such as infections (Avelox).

   Pharmaceuticals is the largest segment within the Bayer HealthCare segment, accounting for two-thirds of annual revenues. Out of pharmaceuticals sold worldwide, the North American market makes up about a quarter. In the US, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceutical's leading products include Kogenate for hemophilia, imaging agent Ultravist, and cancer treatment Nexavar. Two top selling products, Betaseron and YAZ, are facing increased competition from generic drugmakers, which have started to make off-patent versions of the drugs in the US market. (In addition, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   required Bayer to add blood clot warning risks to the YAZ and Yasmin products in 2012; the firm is facing some related litigation as well.)

   To combat reduced sales levels of certain products caused by patent losses, the firm conducts research programs with the hopes of developing new blockbusters across its core therapy areas (diagnostic imaging, general medicine, hematology, neurology, oncology, and women's health).

   Some of the company's R&amp;D programs work to extend the approved uses for existing drugs. For instance, it has been seeking to expand the use of its kidney and liver cancer drug Nexavar to treat other kinds of cancer, including types of breast and lung cancer, with partner

   . It also has a partnership with

   to develop a new multiple sclerosis drug.
