   If you're absolutely fabless, this company is for you. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the first and largest dedicated silicon foundry (contract semiconductor manufacturer) in the world, with nine plants in Asia and one in the US. Logic semiconductors make up about 75% of sales, while mixed-signal products are most of the rest. Largely a wafer fabricator, TSMC makes chips for semiconductor and systems companies who don't have their own manufacturing facilities (accounting for about 85% of sales). Those companies include

   ,
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55671">
    NVIDIA
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   . Remaining sales come from integrated device manufacturers, including
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   . The company gets about 69% of its sales from customers in the US.

  <p>
   While wafer manufacturing makes up about 90% of sales, TSMC's remaining sales come mainly from fabricating masks -- a kind of silkscreen used to expose silicon wafers to a certain light pattern -- and it also provides services such as design, probing, and testing and assembly. Constituting its largest-selling product, logic semiconductors, are standard logic devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, graphic chips, and chip sets. The bulk of its remaining business, mixed-signal semiconductors, is used in systems for data storage and program instructions, such as SRAM, DRAM, and flash memory.

  <p>
   The company's revenue and net income enjoyed robust year-over-year growth. Revenue increased more than 20% in 2014 from 2013 on increased demand for computer and memory devices from customers -- wafer shipments were 18% higher. Its net income jumped more than 30%, bolstered by the revenue increase. Cash flow from operations also had a healthy gain, up 21% in 2014 from 2013.

   TSMC continues to increase the capacity and improve the efficiency of its wafer fabrication processes, but it is also seeking long-term growth opportunities outside the traditional foundry business model.
  </p>
  <p>
   But as semiconductor fabrication plants (factories) become more expensive to build, more chip companies are concentrating on design and contracting manufacturing to TSMC and rivals like
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics Corp
   </company>
   .
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   still makes its own chips and companies such as
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   make most of their own. But as a leading contractor TSMC must keep pace with the changing technologies for making chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, about 9% of revenue came from the company's newer 20-nanometer wafers, which are more complex and carry a higher price. The older, more established 28-nanometer wafer were 33% of revenue in 2014, up from 30% in 2013. The company is working on smaller sizes, including a 7-nanometer wafer. In 2015 TSMC development for the 7-nanometer technology is to focus on selection of transistor architecture, baseline manufacturing process setup for both transistors and interconnects, and reliability evaluations.
  </p>
  <p>
   TSMC hit the off switch on its LED lighting business in early 2015 when it sold TSMC Solid State Lighting to Epistar, the largest manufacturer of LED epitaxial wafers and dies. The deal was structured so that no employee of TSMC SSL will lose employment.

   The big foundries -- including TSMC's Taiwanese archrival
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics Corporation
   </company>
   (UMC) -- played a major role in the growth of the worldwide fabless semiconductor industry in the 21st century. Foundries aim to save clients the costs and time associated with building expensive wafer fabrication plants (fabs) of their own. Their services are especially vital for fabless companies whose entire business model is predicated on outsourcing all manufacturing.

   Morris Chang learned early to adapt to rapid change. The future founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) lived in six cities before age 18, as his family fled the ravages of the Sino-Japanese War and WWII in China. Chang immigrated to the US to attend
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40442">
    Stanford
   </company>
   , where he ultimately earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 25 years at
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   (TI), Chang worked his way up from the ranks of technical management into the executive suite. In 1983 he resigned from TI to become CEO of
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   , but in 1985 the Taiwanese government recruited him to head its Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). He remained chairman of ITRI from 1988 to 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Working from his position at ITRI, Chang became chairman of contract electronics manufacturer
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics Corporation
   </company>
   (UMC) in 1987. Also that year he founded TSMC as the world's first dedicated contract semiconductor manufacturer -- the first silicon foundry. Chang's pioneering role in the foundry industry has earned him many accolades, including the first-ever Robert N. Noyce Medal of the
   <company id="119641">
    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   </company>
   and the first-ever Exemplary Leadership award (subsequently named in his honor) of the Fabless Semiconductor Association (now the Global Semiconductor Alliance). Known for his analytical mind, Chang was once ranked among the top 1,000 players of contract bridge in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   TSMC became profitable within 15 months of its founding. Throughout the 1990s it continued to be among industry leaders both in production capacity and in deployment of cutting-edge technology.
