   Agri-Mark's central laboratory, which performs more than 335,000 component and quality tests on members' milk annually, is located in West Springfield, Massachusetts. It maintains a plant there, as well, that produces five principle products -- heavy sweet cream, condensed skim milk, skim milk, nonfat dry milk powder, and butter -- from milk sourced from farms in New England and New York.

   In Vermont, Agri-Mark makes its Cabot-brand cheese in Middlebury, producing 15,000-plus pounds of cheddar cheese each day. The facility, which has a 54,000-sq.-ft. cheddar aging warehouse onsite, also is responsible for making other dairy items such as cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, and specialty cheeses.
