   A taste for fresh squeezed orange juice continues to bear fruit. Orchard House Foods chairman David Long began the first business in the UK to commercialize a line of ready-to-eat fruit products. The company manufactures freshly squeezed fruit juices (orange juice being the most popular), fruit smoothies and drinks, and fruit patisserie. It also makes ready-to-eat fresh fruit salads. Orchard House operates six factories, supplying major UK food retailers and food-service customers. The company is part of

  <p>
   Orchard House Foods is positioned to benefit from the growing recognition, among consumers, doctors, government, and scientists, of the fundamental role diet plays in a number of common health complaints. The risk of developing diet-related diseases escalates with age, so the graying population in the UK and abroad is naturally expanding the company's market. In addition, rising healthcare costs are spurring consumers to pursue alternative ways of caring for themselves and helping to drive awareness and sales of fruit-based products.
  </p>
  <p>
   With this in mind, the company's new product development focuses on formulating and marketing products to make meeting the ideal of eating five fruits a day more convenient. Among its efforts, Orchard House Foods raised brand awareness by launching a promotion of smoothies with a custom I AM Fresh Try Me Free neck collar label.

  <p>
