   Water skiers enjoy the view of the back of a Malibu boat. A leading maker of high-performance powerboats under the Malibu and Axis brands, Malibu Boats designs, makes, and markets sport boats for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. The company's Malibu brand is priced from $40,000 to $175,000, while Axis brand boats are a bit more affordable, ranging in price from $45,000 to $95,000. Malibu's boats are manufactured in Tennessee and sold by more than 110 independent dealers throughout North America and some 58 locations in about 38 other countries.

  <p>
   The company reports its operations through the two segments of US and Australia. Each segment participates in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and sale of performance sport boats.

  <p>
   The company is based in Loudon, Tennessee, and has three manufacturing facilities in California, Tennessee, and Australia. The US is its largest market, accounting for more than 90% of sales.

   Malibu's products are sold through a dealer network, and it serves customers across the North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, Australian, and New Zealand markets.

  <p>
   Malibu generates revenue from the sale of its boats to its dealer network, and over the years it has experienced unprecedented growth. In fiscal 2016 (ended June), the company reported a record-setting $253 million in sales. It also generated $18 million in net income, another company milestone. In addition, its cash flow from operations surged from $13 million in 2015 to $36 million in 2016 mainly due to a one-time legal payment of $20 million it received for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth in 2016 was attributed to the company's newly acquired Australian business and a spike in its daily production rate over the prior year, bolstered by the strong demand for its new, larger models such as the M235 and 25 LSV. The growth was also attributed to year-over-year price increases, an increased mix of larger model sales (which carry a higher average selling price), and additional demand for optional features and trailers.

  <p>
   Malibu has a leading 30% share of the performance boat category, which is growing faster than the overall boat market. The company is looking to capitalize on the ongoing recovery in the powerboat market by developing new boat models and capturing additional market share from other boating categories, notably the sterndrive and trailer categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company believes that releasing new products and features multiple times during the year enhances its reputation and gives it a competitive advantage. During 2016, the company launched its all-new Malibu Wakesetter 25 LSV, the Wakesetter 20 VTX, and Axis A20 models. It previously unveiled the Malibu M235 in late 2015. Malibu in 2017 will release the Wakesetter 22 MXZ, the Wakesetter 24 MXZ, and the Wakesetter 21VLX.
  </p>
  <p>
   Malibu also intends to increase international sales by promoting its products in developed markets where it has a well-established dealer base, such as Western Europe, and by penetrating new and emerging markets where it expects rising consumer incomes to increase demand for recreational products, such as Asia and South America.
