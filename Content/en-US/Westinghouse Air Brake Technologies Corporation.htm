  <p>
   The company divides its operations into two primary groups: Freight and transit. Freight constituted as its largest segment in 2015 (62% of sales) and makes and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives. Its Transit group (38%) makes and services components for passenger transit vehicles such as subway cars and buses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its products are broken out into four categories. Specialty products and electronics generates 52% of sales, while brake products contribute 19%. Remanufacturing, overhaul, and build generates 18%, and other transit products account for around 6%.

   Wabtec has about 50 manufacturing plants, service centers, and sales offices in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the US. North America generates more than 60% of its total sales.

   Wabtec serves the freight and passenger rail, transit, marine, oil and gas, power generation, off-highway equipment, and industrial sectors. Its top five customers accounted for 22% of net sales: The BNSF Railway, General Electric Transportation,

  <p>
   Wabtec has achieved unprecedented revenue growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $3.31 billion in 2015. Its profits also reached $399 million in 2015, another company milestone, due to the additional revenue coupled with a dip in interest expenses. After seeing its operating cash flow skyrocket by more than 100% in 2014, the company saw its cash flow drop by 5% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was driven by a 19% surge in Freight segment sales. This segment was helped by increased specialty products and electronics sales due to higher demand for freight original equipment rail products, PTC electronics, and aftermarket rail products. This segment was also helped by additional revenue from acquisitions. These gains were partially offset by a 5% decreased in Transit segment sales.

  <p>
   Along with international expansion, the company is also focused on research and development funding to create new and improved products. It is also expanding its aftermarket sales (more than 60% of the company's total sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to South America, Wabtec has its eye on Australia, India, Russia, South Africa, and certain countries in Europe for expansion. With China also on its list of interest, Wabtec has established Hunan CSR Wabtec Railway Transportation Technology Co., Ltd -- a 50/50 joint venture with electrical control equipment manufacturer Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric. The two companies provide development, manufacturing, sales, and maintenance of rail track vehicle braking systems in that populous country.

  <p>
   One way the company has achieved historic growth over the years is through the use of acquisitions. In its largest deal to date, Wabtec in 2015 announced it was purchasing 51% of
   <company id="102528">
    Faiveley Transport
   </company>
   -- a maker of railroad equipment, including high-speed trains, locomotives, passenger cars, metro rail systems, light rail vehicles and trams, and freight cars -- in a deal worth $1.9 billion. France-based Faiveley generates $1.2 billion in annual revenues, the majority of which stem from the important growth region of Asia/Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strengthening the company's turnkey capabilities, in 2015 Wabtec acquired the Railroad Controls L.P., a leading provider of railway signal construction services, based in Benbrook, Texas, for $64 million. Also in 2015, Wabtec picked up Metalocaucho, a manufacturer of transit products, primarily rubber components for suspension and vibration control systems, for approximately $23 million.

  <p>
   The original Westinghouse Air Brake Company was one of 60 firms started by inventor extraordinaire George Westinghouse Jr., who first demonstrated his straight air brake in 1869. Before then, trains were stopped by workers in various cars turning brake wheels, a process that required stopping distances of up to a quarter-mile. American Standard (bathroom and kitchen fixtures, car braking systems -- now named
   <company id="40026">
    Trane Inc.
   </company>
   ) acquired the company during the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   WABCO was formed in 1990 when investors acquired the North American operations of American Standard's Railway Products Group (air brakes). Since its rebirth, WABCO expanded its worldwide presence with acquisitions such as Pulse (1995, event records and fuel-measuring devices), Australian firm Futuris Industrial Products (1996, rail brake shoes and disc brake pads), and Vapor (1996, railcar electronic door control systems). In 1997 WABCO added passenger transit air conditioning systems through its acquisitions of Stone Safety Service, Stone UK, and H.P. Srl, Italy's largest maker of door systems for passenger transit cars and buses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 WABCO went on a buying spree, acquiring UK-based RFS, a rail engineering and services firm, the transit coupler product line of Hadady Corporation, the assets of Lokring (pipe fittings), Comet Industries' service centers (air brake repair), and the railroad electronics unit of
   <company id="103693">
    Rockwell Collins
   </company>
   . The final bill totaled some $113 million. That year WABCO also formed two joint ventures -- WABCO/MPI de MÃ©xico and Greysham Railway Friction Products (low-friction brake shoes, India).
  </p>
  <p>
   WABCO laid off more than 185 workers in 1999, as it consolidated its acquisitions. It then announced it would merge with MotivePower Industries and take its name in a deal valued at $634 million. An earnings shortfall at MotivePower derailed that deal, and WABCO bought MotivePower for $475 million; the combined company changed its name to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies and began doing business as Wabtec.
