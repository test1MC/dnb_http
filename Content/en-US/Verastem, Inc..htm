   Verastem believes the truth behind recurrent tumors lies in cancer stem cells (CSCs), aggressive tumor cells that survive conventional treatment to cause recurrence. Those CSCs are the target of its biopharmaceutical R&amp;D efforts; the company is working to produce small molecule drugs that target the cells while conventional therapy targets the rest of the tumor. Verastem's work rests on a technology, licensed from
   <company id="40300">
    MIT's
   </company>
   <company id="129576">
    Whitehead Institute
   </company>
   , that allows it to create stable CSCs in the lab, something not possible in the past. Its leading drug candidate targets a type of breast cancer with a low survival rate. The company is also developing CSC diagnostics. Formed in 2010, Verastem completed an IPO in 2012.

  <p>
   Verastem filed to go public in late 2011 and completed its share offering early the next year. It is using its $55 million in IPO proceeds to complete development and testing of its lead candidate (along with other candidates and diagnostics), as well as on the development of additional treatments.

  <p>
   The company's three lead candidates include CSCs targeters VS-6063 and VS-4718 for lung, ovarian, and other cancers, and genetic pathway disruptor VS-5584 for solid tumors and lymphoma. Verastem licenses compounds and intellectual property for its candidates from

   ,
   <company id="14224">
    Poniard
   </company>
   , and S*Bio.

  <p>
   As is typical with biotech research firms, the company has yet to generate any revenues, has an accumulated deficit of $88 million, and anticipates continued losses as it spends heavily on R&amp;D.

  <p>
   Like most pharmaceutical companies, Verastem may also license drugs or treatments from other firms, collaborate with other researchers, or purchase additional candidates or technologies in its quest to commercialize existing products and fund continued testing and R&amp;D.

  <p>
   Verastem's founders are all successful biotech veterans as are its board members. Boston's venture capital firm Longwood Founders Fund held about 15% of Verastem pre-IPO; that stake was reduced to about 11% through the completed offering. Other investors include Bessemer Venture Partners and MPM Bioventures of Boston.
