   Cloverdale wants to cover Western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the US -- in paint. The paint and coatings manufacturer maintains some 60 retail stores and a network of more than 120 dealer outlets across a broad swath of North America. It not only wants to paint houses -- inside and out -- but bridges, buildings, factories, and boats. Cloverdale has expanded by acquiring US-based rival

   and the Canadian Guertin Coatings; both companies continue to operate as independent subsidiaries. It also acquired Canada-based Serif Coatings and Chemicals. Cloverdale Paint, which was founded in 1933, has four manufacturing facilities.
