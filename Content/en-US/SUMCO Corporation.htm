   SUMCO is a top supplier of silicon wafers used in the production of semiconductors. Products include epitaxial wafers, polished wafers, and silicon ingots. SUMCO, which has its primary offices and manufacturing plants in Japan, sells and distributes its products through affiliated companies in France, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. SUMCO was established in 1999 as a joint venture between

  <p>
   SUMCO reported financial information for 11 months (February through December) in 2013 and for the full year of 2014. That being said, revenue for 2014 was about 22% higher than in 2013. The company said there was strong demand for semiconductor products and it maintained a high rate of production for both 300 mm and small-diameter wafers. Net income rose a startling 2,000% in 2014 from 2013 because of cost reductions including a dramatic decrease in non-operating expenses.

  <p>
   SUMCO expects demand to increase in memory products including DRAM and NAND, along with application processors. Demand for the company's 300 mm silicon wafers was driven by growth from data centers and the sharp increase in telecommunications volume, including video streaming and data exchanges. The continued growth of smartphones also adds to demand. SUMCO is experiencing  a strong market for small-diameter wafers (smaller than 200 mm) from the increasing placement of semiconductors in power controls and vehicles.
