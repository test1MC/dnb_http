   Diving into a niche market, Marchon in May 2012 acquired Dragon Alliance, a leading goggle and eyewear brand in the action sports market catering to skiers, snowboarders, surfers, and moto rider. The purchase strengthened Marchon's presence in the youth lifestyle and action sports niches. Later in 2012 the company purchased the Swedish eyewear firm Scandinavian Eyewear, thereby broadening the distribution of its proprietary and licensed brands in the Nordic region. Scandinavian Eyewear's proprietary SKAGA brand is a leading eyewear brand in Scandinavia.
