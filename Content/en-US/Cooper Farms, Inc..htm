   Cooper Farms' poultry products fly far from the coop. The company raises turkeys (180 million pounds of live bird per year) on its Ohio farm and supplies pre-cooked (oven-roasted, smoked, and cured breasts and deli meats) and ready-to-cook turkey products to retail and foodservice customers in the US and Mexico. Cooper Farms also provides private-label packaging services for other food manufacturers. Additional items produced by the company include eggs (360 million a year), weaned pigs (125 million live pounds per year), poults (baby turkeys; 15 million per year), and animal feed (400,000 tons per year). The family-owned and operated firm makes feed for diary and beef cattle, as well as for swine.

   Vertically-integrated Cooper Farms operates two divisions: the Live Animal business oversees the care of its turkeys and pigs as they mature, and manufactures feed; the Food Processing division produces and packs cooked meats. It operates its business across four locations in agriculture-rich Northwest and West Central Ohio.
