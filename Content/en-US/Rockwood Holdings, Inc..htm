   Rockwood Holdings, which operates as Rockwood Specialties, manages a portfolio of world-class specialty chemicals and advanced materials businesses. Its specialty chemicals operations (which the company restructured in 2012) include lithium compounds, metal treatments, and performance additives such as wood preservation chemicals and iron oxide pigments. Other products include titanium dioxide, advanced ceramics, an performance additives. A leader in most of its niches, Rockwood serves the construction, paper, and water treatment industries. Sales to Germany outpace those to any other region, including the US. In 2015 the company was acquired by
   <company id="16955">
    Albemarle
   </company>
   for $5.6 billion.

        <p>
   Rockwood's revenues declined by 4% in 2012 due to currency exchange impacts and lower volumes, partially offset by higher selling prices. Performance Additives' revenues dropped by 7% largely due to lower coatings and construction volumes in Europe, a decline in North American oil and natural gas drilling volumes, and weaker coatings and inks volumes. Advanced Ceramics revenues dropped by 7% due to the negative impact of currency changes. Higher volumes of medical ceramics were offset, in part, by lower volumes in all other product lines. One bright spot was the 4% increase in the Lithium revenues as the result of higher selling prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reported net income of $383.5 million in 2012 (7% lower than 2011) due to a decrease in revenues and higher restructuring and other severance costs due to the write-down of machinery and equipment in connection with the closure of a lithium plant in the US, Specialty Chemicals segment reorganization charges,  and a loss in foreign exchange.

        <p>
   The company grows organically and through acquisitions. However, in recent years the company has reorganized its portfolio and sold some lines to pay down debt and secure better returns for shareholders.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Rockwood reorganized its Specialty Chemicals segment, splitting its primary subsidiary Chemetall GmbH (the flagship of its specialty chemicals segment) into two companies (surface treatments and lithium/special metals) to develop greater market share as independent entities.
  </p>
        <p>
   To raise cash and sharpen its focus, in 2014 the company sold its Titanium Dioxide Pigments unit and four other non-strategic businesses to
   <company id="136323">
    Huntsman
   </company>
   , for an enterprise value of $1.275 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Rockwood agreed to sell its CeramTec advanced ceramics business to private equity firm Cinven for about $1.98 billion. That year it also agreed to sell its Clay Based Additives business to
   <company id="91125">
    ALTANA Group
   </company>
   , a German based global specialty chemical company, for $635 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Rockwood sold its AlphaGary plastic compounding business to
   <company id="159570">
    Mexichem S.A.B.de C.V
   </company>
   . for $300 million in 2011. AlphaGary manufactures specialty plastic compounds for the wire and cable business as well as medical applications. Rockwood used the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2012 the company's joint venture with
   <company id="91016">
    Kemira Oyj
   </company>
   , Sachtleben, agreed to acquire the titanium dioxide production assets of Germany-based crenox, which was in insolvency and formerly owned by
   <company id="138596">
    Tronox
   </company>
   . The acquisition will add more than 100,000 metric tons of titanium dioxide production capacity per year to Sachtleben, to boost its capacity to about 340,000 tons annually and enhance its global position as one of the leading titanium dioxide producers. (In 2013 Rockwood agreed to buy Kemira Oyj's 39% stake in Sachtleben.)
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2012 Rockwood agreed to purchase Australian lithium producer Talison Lithium Limited for about C $724 million (US $723 million). The move will increase Rockwood's lithium production capacity and give it additional clients, e-specially in China where Talison is strong. Talison's lithium is used in batteries, aerospace materials, wind turbines, and glass and ceramics manufacturing.

        <p>
   The firm was created in 2000 when KKR bought several
   <company id="90243">
    Laporte
   </company>
   divisions; it got much larger by adding parts of
   <company id="91182">
    Dynamit Nobel
   </company>
   in 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   The businesses that Rockwood bought from Dynamit Nobel included the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigments, advanced ceramics for medical applications, and water treatment chemicals, as well as lubricants and sealants.
