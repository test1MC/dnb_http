   ImmunoCellular Therapeutics primarily targets glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which can hurt the brain just by trying to say or spell it. However, GBM is also regarded as the most aggressive brain cancer affecting humans. The development-stage company is also going after other cancers, such as those that attack the ovaries, pancreas, colon, and lungs. Its immunotherapy aims not only at normal tumor cells but also the stem cells where cancers grow and recur. ImmunoCellular has a partnership and licensing agreement with Los Angeles'

   to use the latter's technology in its research. The company was founded in 1987, took its current name in 2006, and went public in 2010.
