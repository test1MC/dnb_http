   . The century-old company specializes in passenger and freight elevators, escalators, autowalks, automatic doors, and access control systems. It also provides services, primarily maintenance and modernization, for a wide variety of buildings, airports, and public transportation terminals. Key customers include builders, building owners, facility managers, and developers. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region accounts for nearly half of the company's sales. KONE is supplying elevators for the world's tallest building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

  <p>
   In 1910 Finnish electric motor manufacturer Stromberg created a company to sell its refurbished motors, and KONE (Finnish for "machine") was born. Stromberg was licensed to sell Graham Brothers elevators (Sweden) in Finland, and in 1912 Stromberg shifted the elevator business to its KONE unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dominated by Russia for more than a century, Finland's manufacturers, including KONE, were pressed into supplying the Russians during WWI. However, when the war ended and the Bolshevik Revolution began, Finland seized its chance to declare independence.
  </p>
  <p>
   KONE broke its ties with Graham Brothers in 1918. Stromberg hit a rough patch in 1924, and board member Harold Herlin offered to buy KONE. His offer was accepted, and in 1927 he moved the company to a larger facility. By 1928 KONE had sold 1,000 elevators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herlin's son Heikki became president of the company in 1932 and took KONE into the cranes and hoists business. The company also began building its own electric motors and making conveyor belt systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   When WWII erupted Finland again shifted to military production, but this time in defense against Russian aggression. Heikki Herlin assumed the role of chairman upon his father's death in 1941. At the war's end, Finland had lost and was forced to pay war reparations to Russia until the late 1940s, crushing the profits of most Finnish industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s KONE emerged as a European leader in elevators, cranes, hoists, conveyor belts, and other material handling equipment. The company also added automatic doors and hydraulic lifts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its product diversification, KONE had pretty much tapped the Finnish market. In 1964 Heikki Herlin retired, leaving his son Pekka in charge. Unlike his father and grandfather, Pekka studied economics rather than engineering. He soon set a course for international expansion. KONE listed on the Helsinki stock exchange in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   KONE's first acquisition came with its 1968 purchase of Asea-Graham's elevator business (Sweden). The company then picked up other European elevator makers, giving it a foothold in Austria, France, Germany, Sweden, and other European countries. In 1975 KONE bought the European elevator business of Westinghouse Electric and doubled its revenue. It also began producing autowalks at this time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1980s brought more acquisitions. KONE added Navire Cargo Gear (1982) and International MacGregor (1983), which put it in the cargo-access business. By the mid-1980s KONE was one of the world's leading material handling equipment concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   A recession in the 1990s forced KONE to rethink its strategy. To continue to be profitable, KONE began to sell its non-core units, with its conveyor and bulk handling systems businesses going first, followed by cargo access equipment in 1993 (sold to Incentive Group, Sweden). KONE's wood handling operations were sold to
   <company id="110562">
    Andritz
   </company>
   in 1994, and its Crane operations were sold to Sweden's Industri Kapital (forming
   <company id="138465">
    KCI Konecranes
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 KONE boosted its share of the North American market by purchasing Montgomery Elevator Company. The following year KONE took control of Germany's O&amp;K Rolltreppen (escalators). KONE started a maintenance services group during the 1980s that turned out to be its cash cow throughout the 1990s. By 1998 KONE reached 400,000 service contracts. The company opened a plant in Kunshan, China, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   KONE bought Gustav Ad. Koch Maschinenfabrik KG (elevators, Germany) in 1999. In 2000 it picked up Cable Lift Installations, a London-based subsidiary of Spanish elevator maker Orona, and Chiltern Industrial Doors of the UK. It continued down the acquisition trail by acquiring Swiss elevator company Neuwerth &amp; Cie (2001) and the Germany-based elevator company, L. Hopmann Maschinenfabrik (2002).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 KONE reorganized into two separate companies. The first contained all of KONE's existing elevators and escalators operations, and continued under the KONE Corporation name. The second company consisted of the company's Cargotec division (loading and cargo moving services and products such as cranes, lift trucks, and terminal tractors), and was spun off as
   <company id="138515">
    Cargotec Corporation
   </company>
   in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 KONE reached an agreement with China-based Giant Elevator Co. Ltd. to form a joint venture called Giant Kone Elevator. KONE initially owned 40% of the JV, with options to raise its ownership level to more than 50% in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year KONE also announced an agreement with Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems (TELC) to establish a joint venture to make escalators in China; KONE owned 70% of the company, while TELC owned the remaining 30%. In addition, KONE announced it would supply the elevators for the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 the Helsinki police completed an investigation of insider trading by CEO Antti Herlin and corporate secretary Tapio Hakakari. The charges stemmed from trading activities in 2001 and 2002 of shares in Partek by Security Trading and KONE. At the time Security Trading was the main shareholder of KONE and was managed by Hakakari. Partek was acquired by KONE in 2002. In 2006 Finnish prosecutors declined to bring any criminal charges against the two KONE executives.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company acquired UAB Elektros Pavara ir Ko, an elevator company in Lithuania, and bought full ownership of OOO Lift RSU, an elevator service firm in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2009 the company picked up a number of independent elevator service companies: FairWay Elevator, a market leader in Philadelphia, and Excel Elevator, a Southern California leader in modernizing vertical transit systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year KONE went on to buy Virginia Elevator Company, positioning the company as one of the largest elevator and escalator operations in Virginia. Other US acquisitions included Reliant Elevator (Oregon), Mid-Tenn Elevator (Nashville), and Akamai Elevator (Hawaii), which are all established independent elevator service providers in their respective regional markets. And on a different continent, KONE added two Spanish elevator businesses: MARVI Elevator and ASBA Maintenimientos.
  </p>
  <p>
   KONE's rise in the industry, however, has attracted government scrutiny. The European Commission wrapped up a three-year investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices among leading elevator manufacturers in 2007, fining five companies including KONE. The vendors allegedly fixed prices, rigged bids, and arranged market shares among themselves for elevator projects in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, during 1995 to 2004. KONE was fined €142 million ($195 million) for its part in the alleged cartel. Separately, the Austrian competition authority fined KONE €22.5 million ($31 million) for alleged anti-competitive practices prior to 2004. In 2009 KONE saw a dent in its bottom line and repaid the fine (reported as an interest-bearing long-term loan) to the commissions.
