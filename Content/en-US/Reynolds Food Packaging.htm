  <p>
   Reynolds Packaging originated as a division of aluminum products company
   <company id="10068">
    Arconic
   </company>
   (formerly Alcoa).
  </p>
  <p>
   Reynolds Packaging was formed by the combination of Ivex Packaging and Reynolds Foodservice Packaging -- both Alcoa acquisitions. Alcoa bought Reynolds for its strength in foodservice packaging and its line of aluminum products. Reynolds also produces stock and custom items including foil, film, lids, and bags for the foodservice, supermarket, and food processor markets. Alcoa purchased Ivex Packaging for its strength as a specialty plastic packaging maker (plastic containers, microwavable packaging) for food processors and retail supermarkets. Alcoa combined the operations into one company in 2003 but sold it in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   (In 2008 Alcoa sold Reynolds Packaging and its other packaging and consumer businesses to Rank Group for $2.7 billion.)
