   The well-rounded Ball Corporation perpetually pitches packaging to companies producing food, beverage, and household goods. Food and beverage packaging includes steel cans and aluminum slugs. Ball's packaging revenue derives primarily from a relatively few beverage making customers owning brands spanning Argentina, Brazil, China, Europe, and North America.

   manufactures an array of aerospace systems, from satellites to tactical antennas, as well as providing systems engineering services. Ball Corporation operates through 70 locations around the world. It has recently grown by purchasing one of its rivals,

   , in mid-2016.

  <p>
   Ball Corporation operates more than 70 locations and joint ventures spanning Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. The US accounts for almost 60% of its net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ball divides its operations between four business segments. The largest, metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, accounts for 53% of sales. This segment's operations are located in the US, Canada, Brazil, and China; it distributes containers mainly to companies that make carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, and other beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   The metal beverage packaging, Europe segment, representing 21% of sales, includes the manufacturing of metal beverage containers, extruded aluminum aerosol containers, and aluminum slugs in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal food and household products packaging, Americas, 16% of sales, caters to the US, Canada, and Argentina. The company's smallest segment, aerospace and technologies, 10% of sales, makes and sells aerospace and related products for the defense, civil space, and commercial space markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   Ball's packaging revenue derives primarily from long-term contracts with a relatively few customers:
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   , and the US government accounted for 11%, 10%, and 10% of total 2015 sales, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ball's revenues declined 7$ from $8.6 billion in 2014 to $8 billion in 2015. Profits were also down by 40% from $470 million to $281 million during that same time period. The company's operating cash flow remained consistent for both 2014 and 2015, hovering around the $1 billion mark for both years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were attributed to unfavorable foreign currency effects in Europe and lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in North American steel food containers. The company was also affected by unfavorable pricing in the PRC (People's Republic of China), which was partially offset by higher beverage segment sales volumes.

  <p>
   Ball's blueprint has been pretty simple over the years: it acquires similar companies around the world to widen its customer base and extend its geographical reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a sweeping move for the industry, the company in mid-2016 acquired
   <company id="90063">
    Rexam
   </company>
   , one of its biggest rivals, for around $6.1 billion. The deal created the world's largest maker of food and beverage cans. The combined company is projected to generate $15 billion in sales and create $300 million in annual cost savings. As part of the stipulations to complete the deal, Ball agreed to sell twelve plants in Europe and two in Brazil. The company also completed the required sale of eight aluminum-can plants and related assets in the US to Ardagh Group for $3.1 billion. Further, it agreed to shut down Rexam's London headquarters by the end of 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ball in 2015 also completed its acquisition of
   <company id="14746">
    Sonoco
   </company>
   's metal end and closure facilities in Canton, Ohio. The Canton plants, which produce multiple-sized closures for the food can market, will become part of Ball's global metal food and household products packaging division.

  <p>
   The Ball Corporation began in 1880 when Frank Ball and his four brothers started making wood-jacket tin cans to store and transport kerosene and other materials. In 1884 the company switched to tin-jacketed glass containers for kerosene lamps. The lamps, however, were soon displaced by Thomas Edison's electric light bulb.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ball brothers then learned that the patent to the original sealed-glass storage container (the Mason jar) had expired. By 1886 the brothers had entered the sealed-jar business and imprinted their jars with the Ball name. In their first year they made 12,500 jars and sparked a patent war with the two reigning jar producers, who asserted that they controlled the correct patents and threatened to sue. The Ball lawyers proved that the patents had expired, and the jar remained Ball's mainstay for many years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began diversifying, but a 1947 antitrust ruling prohibited it from buying additional glass subsidiaries. Ball decided to take advantage of the space race by buying Control Cells (aerospace science research) in 1957; that operation became Ball Brothers Research Corporation (later Ball Aerospace Systems Division). The Soviets launched Sputnik that year, igniting a massive US scientific effort in 1958, and Ball won federal contracts to make equipment for the US space program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ball established its metal beverage-container business in 1969 when it bought Jeffco Manufacturing of Colorado. The operation soon won contracts to supply two-piece cans to Budweiser, Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Pepsi, and Stroh's Beer.
