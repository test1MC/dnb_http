   Marazzi Group is the largest tile producer in Italy, where it carries a market share of more than 10%. It is also a top seller in France, Russia, and the US, each among its largest markets (it makes roughly three-quarters of its revenues outside of Italy). The company plans to continue its international growth as well as further diversifying its product lines. Being owned by its new parent company Mohawk will allow Marazzi to extend its reach exponentially in the US.
