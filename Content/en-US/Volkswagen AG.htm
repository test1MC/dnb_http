   The effects of the 2015 emissions scandal are being felt in a number of ways. Total units sold dropped 2% on 2014 to a touch over 10 million, and the €16.1 billion allocated to the various efforts to mitigate the impact of the scandal - recalls, modifications, legal costs, customer outreach etc. - dragged net income down to €-4.1 billion. Despite all this, Volkswagen nevertheless grew total sales by 5.4% in 2016 to €213.3 billion, with the most impressive growth rate realized in North America, which saw unit sales as well as revenue grow.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities grew €2.9 billion in 2015, in line with the sales increase.

   Volkswagen is on the defensive. The company's primary concern is containing the fallout of the 2015 emissions testing scandal - in autumn 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency publicly announced that the company has been using software to cheat emissions tests. 11 million Volkswagen cars were equipped with software that altered emission control systems when under testing conditions; in normal conditions the vehicles released around 40 times more nitrogen oxide into the air than is allowed by EPA regulations. Volkswagen has earmarked €16.2 billion to cover the service corrections and win back public support with its customers. In addition, VW could pay up to $18 billion in fines in the US alone, and VW executives could face criminal charges. Total cost estimates faced by Volkswagen from the scandal range from under $20 billion to some $40 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also predicting that the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber will reduce the need for car ownership and eat into car sales in the long term. In spring 2016 Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in Uber-rival Gett, an Israeli firm that has a strong presence in the UK. The move follows a $500 million investment by General Motors in Lyft, a similar service.

  <p>
   Since the early 1920s auto engineer Ferdinand Porsche (whose son later founded the Porsche car company) had wanted to make a small car for the masses. He found no backers until he met Adolf Hitler in 1934. Hitler formed the Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des deutschen Volkswagen (Company for the Development of the German People's Car) in 1937 and built a factory in Wolfsburg, Germany. No cars were delivered during WWII, as the company produced military vehicles using the slave labor of Jews and Russian prisoners of war.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following WWII, British occupation forces oversaw the rebuilding of the bomb-damaged plant and initial production of the odd-looking "people's car" (1945). The British appointed Heinz Nordhoff to manage Volkswagen (1948) and then turned the company over to the German government (1949).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s VW launched the Microbus and built foreign plants. Although US sales began slowly, by the end of the decade, acceptance of the little car had increased. Advertising that coined the name "Beetle" helped carve VW's niche in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   VW sold stock to the German public in 1960. In 1966 it purchased Auto Union (AUDI) from Daimler-Benz. The Beetle became a counterculture symbol in the 1960s, and US sales took off. By the time of Nordhoff's death in 1968, the Beetle had become the best-selling car in history.
