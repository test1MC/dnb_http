   Infinity Pharmaceuticals acts on the endless possibilities for new cancer treatments. The firm works to discover and develop targeted therapies for different types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer. Such targeted therapies aim at inhibiting specific disease signaling pathways and proteins. In addition to cancer, Infinity Pharmaceuticals has candidates for various inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The company has multiple programs in preclinical and clinical trial stages; it also investigates candidates through partnerships with other drugmakers.

  <p>
   In the realm of pharma R&amp;D companies, key partnerships and development candidates sometimes fail to produce marketable products. For instance, Infinity Pharmaceuticals was developing saridegib (also known as IPI-926), a candidate for chondrosarcoma (a bone cancer) and myelofibrosis, with Mundipharma; however, in 2012 the companies halted trials on the drug due to disappointing clinical trial results and later ended their collaboration agreement.

  <p>
   Like most development-stage pharmaceutical firms, Infinity Pharmaceuticals has operated at a loss most years and expects to continue to do so until it has successful commercial products on the market. In addition, the company's revenues have fluctuated over the years as they have primarily come from the licensing and development agreements it holds with other companies, as well as other equity funding sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company had no revenue after its partnership with Mundipharma ended. At the end of that year, its total accumulated deficit was about $500 million.

  <p>
   Like any development stage pharmaceutical company, Infinity needs an approved product if it's going to turn a profit. It targets drugs that have the potential to change the fundamental way a disease is treated and tries to use its scientific expertise as a differentiating factor. It has also partnered with other pharma companies to find the fastest path to market for its candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Infinity announced a restructuring after its treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma exhibited disappointed phase 2 study results. The restructuring includes cutting 58% of its workforce and shuttering its discovery research organization.
