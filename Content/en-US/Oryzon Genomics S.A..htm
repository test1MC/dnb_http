   Oryzon Genomics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a focus on developing experimental therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The firm is a specialist in epigenetics, which is the study of changes caused by modification of gene expression instead of alteration of the genetic code. Its lead program, ORY-1001, is a selective LSD1 inhibitor which is being studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Another program under development is ORY-2001, which is being studied for its ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Oryzon went public in late 2015.
