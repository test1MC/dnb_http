   Geron is working to get important things through our thick heads. More specifically, it is working to developing compounds able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier that otherwise keeps potentially valuable cancer drugs out of the brain. The company is also developing pharmaceuticals based on protein inhibitor technologies that aim to demolish enzymes that feed cancer cells. The clinical stage biopharmaceutical company is developing a telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron's research and development efforts are focused on oncology targets, including breast and lung cancer, though it has also explored treatments for injuries and degenerative diseases.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While much of Geron's pipeline is still in preclinical development, it has a candidate in the early stages of clinical development. In clinical trials is imetelstat (formerly GRN163L), an inhibitor drug that aims to treat breast, lung, and other cancers by targeting the telomerase enzyme. The company has developed imetelstat from inception and owns exclusive worldwide commercial rights with US patent coverage extending through 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geron was also testing GRN1005 for the treatment of brain metastases resulting from breast and lung cancer. However, in 2013 the company terminated its license for GRN1005 and returned its assets to Angiochem.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its drug development activities, the company sells some telomerase detection and measurement kits to other research entities. Geron also has licensed some of its drug development technologies to third parties, for which it earns licensing fees; it can also earn milestone and royalty payments should any promising candidates emerge from the licensing partnerships.
  </p>

  <p>
   The fluctuations in Geron's revenues are due to the uncertain timing of revenues from license fees and royalties under licenses granted to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and collaboration agreements. The company's revenues decreased by 53% in 2013 due to a decline in product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research-use-only market, cell-based research products and nutritional products. This decrease reflects the assignment of our telomerase activation technology to Telomerase Activation Sciences, Inc. in late 2012 and the termination of its license agreement with Asia Biotech Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Geron doesn't have any commercial drug revenues and has yet to turn a profit. The company has incurred operating losses every year since its operations began in 1990 resulting  principally from research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with its operations. The company's net loss declined by 44% in 2013 due to lower direct external research and development costs in connection with reduced manufacturing of drug products and reduced clinical trial expenses resulting from the wind-down of its imetelstat trials in metastatic breast cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer and its GRN1005 trials. The decline in net loss was also a result of lower restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash outflow declined by $18 million in 2013 due to reduced operating expenses stemming from the the wind-down of imetelstat trials and GRN1005 trials and from restructurings.

  <p>
   Geron focuses on clinical development of imetelstat on hematologic myeloid malignancies, based on proof-of-concept data in essential thrombocythemia and progress of investigator-sponsored trial in myelofibrosis. The company's strategy for developing imetelstat may require it to enter into collaborations with clinical research organizations, investigators, academic institutions, vendors, clinical trial sites, corporate partners, licensors, licensees and others. In late 2014 Geron entered into a license agreement with
   <company id="12923">
    Janssen Biotech
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize imetelstat. Through the arrangement, Geron will receive an initial $35 million plus up to $900 million as development and regulatory hurdles are crossed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major setback, in 2014 the company was notified by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   , that its Investigational New Drug application for imetelstat had been placed on full clinical hold following their review of data related to hepatotoxicity in clinical studies. With this clinical hold, any patients in an ongoing Geron-sponsored clinical trial cannot receive any further treatment with imetelstat. This decision forced Geron to stop imetelstat treatment in its Phase 2 clinical trial in essential thrombocythemia. In 2013 the company conducted two randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat in solid tumors. One evaluated imetelstat in patients with metastatic breast cancer and the other evaluated imetelstat in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. It discontinued development of imetelstat in these solid tumor settings, including closing of the related clinical trials in 2013, and is currently focusing on the clinical development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company discontinued development of GRN1005 and returned assets to Angiochem, Inc., and also discontinued Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in patients with metastatic breast cancer
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company discontinued its discovery research programs and companion diagnostics program based on telomere length and closed its research laboratory facility located in Menlo Park, California.

   Company Background
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce its expenses and focus on its most-promising candidates in the field of cancer treatment (with hopes of eventually becoming profitable), in late 2011 Geron announced its intention to divest the hESC line of candidates. One of the company's hESC candidates, GRNOPC1, entered early stage trials for spinal cord injury in 2011 after passing some regulatory challenges. Geron will continue to monitor the GRNOPC1 trials until the divestiture is completed. As part of the restructuring, the company reduced its workforce by about 38%.
