   If you need a better view, why not just seek out the printed image? Cimpress (formerly Vistaprint) provides online self-service printing for small businesses and consumers. The company offers a range of marketing and promotional materials, including business cards, announcements, letterhead, brochures, calendars, t-shirts, and signage. It also offers creative services designed to assist customers' marketing efforts (copywriting and graphic design), as well as digital services (website design and hosting and email marketing). Cimpress markets its products and services primarily to small businesses via more than 25 country-specific websites. The company does business in approximately 130 countries. Cimpress was founded in 2000.

  <p>
   Cimpress has manufacturing, customer support, administrative, and sales operations in a handful of European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Tunisia, and the US. Its non-US websites account for nearly half of total revenue, and the company hopes to continue expanding internationally in order to maintain fiscal growth. It is focused on growing in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   The company's business strategy remains focused on targeting micro businesses -- organizations with fewer than 10 employees. The company is attracted to that market due to its size (some 60 million businesses in the US, Canada, and Europe are micro businesses), as well as its constant demand for products (such businesses are frequently changing, requiring new business identity products and marketing services). In addition, the growth of the Internet and digital technologies is causing micro businesses to shift from traditional marketing to online services.
