   Ormet Corporation is a major producer of primary aluminum in the US, and its operations ran the gamut of aluminum production. In addition to refining alumina, the company, through its Primary Aluminum unit, manufactures aluminum ingot, billet (pressed bars), sheet, foil, and other products for the fabrication, extrusion, and conversion markets. Its aluminum smelter in Ohio has the capacity to produce 270,000 tons of aluminum per year. Its former alumina refinery in Burnside, Louisiana (sold in 2013), could produce more than 500,000 tons of smelter-grade alumina per year. Ormet filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and sold its assets to Smelter Acquisition LLC.

  <p>
   In 2013, citing fall prices and rising costs Ormet filed for bankruptcy a second time, sold its assets to Smelter Acquisition, an affiliate of lender Wayzata Investment Partners LLC, for about $90 million. That unit then sought to sell Ormet's operating assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, the company sold its alumina refinery in Burnside, Louisiana to
   <company id="136686">
    Almatis
   </company>
   , the world's leading supplier of premium alumina for the refractory, ceramic, and polishing industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ormet announced that it was seeking a buyer of its Hannibal, Ohio aluminum smelter.

   The company has operations in Ohio, but is planning to sell that unit as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.

   Ormet sells exclusively to traders instead of end-use consumers.

   The 2013 bankruptcy decision was seen by Ormet leaders as the best option it had to restructure its debt and legacy costs while continuing its operations, as it allows the new owners to shed Ormet's legacy debts as part of a major restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to this decision (in 2012) the company secured a bauxite purchase contract with Argentina-based
   <company id="95034">
    Vale International
   </company>
   , which agreed will supply bauxite to Ormet's Burnside alumina refinery. The refinery consumes about 1.2 million tons of bauxite per year when it operates at capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 92% of the company's six pot line production for 2012 and about 75% of production from 2013 through March 2015 were under sales agreements with various commodity traders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ormet also teamed up with major customer Trafigura in 2012 to explore and evaluate joint investments in projects in the bauxite, alumina, and aluminum industry.

  <p>
   Since emerging from bankruptcy for the first time in 2004, Ormet has been hit with a string of net operating losses. By the end of 2010, it had accrued about $217.5 million in losses. To get the capital to restart and continue the operation of its Burnside refinery, Ormet sold its bulk handling terminal on the Mississippi river in Burnside, Louisiana, in 2011. The sale to Impala Warehousing, a US-based subsidiary of Trafigura Beheer, went for about $28 million. However, restart costs totaled nearly $27 million. Following the transaction, Trafigura began providing terminal services to Ormet's Burnside alumina refinery, primarily offloading bauxite and loading alumina.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ormet converts Trafigura's alumina into aluminum sow for a fee. The tolling agreements from both Trafigura and
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore Xstrata
   </company>
   take up more than 60% of the company's aluminum production. The two trading houses supply their own alumina to Ormet for smelting. In late 2011, Ormet and Glencore inked a three-year contract for Glencore to buy a significant part of Ormet's aluminum production beginning in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also looked in 2011 for a Chinese partner to form a joint venture carbon anode production company in China. The JV would build and operate a plant to produce about 95% of the annual anode supply for the company's smelter in Hannibal, Ohio. Carbon anodes are used in the smelting process, and shortages over the past three years have forced Ormet to raise its prices for the raw materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ormet was founded in 1954 and has been in the aluminum production business since 1956.
