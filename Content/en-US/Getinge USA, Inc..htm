   While Europe remains Getinge AB's largest market, the company has steadily built up its US presence through acquisitions and research and development efforts. For instance, to offset the ups and downs in demand for big ticket medical products, the company is expanding its line of sterile disposable products used in acute-care situations. It also forms collaborative development partnerships; Getinge USA teamed up with agricultural equipment manufacturer Detach AB in 2011 to develop sterile cleaning solutions for the North American poultry production industry.
