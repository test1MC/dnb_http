   Evonik has established a strong position in the North American coatings market with resource-efficient and environmentally-friendly products.

  <p>
   To take advantage of growing demand, in 2016 Evonik announced plans to build a plant for precipitated silica in South Carolina to supply the tire industry. To help it meet challenging CAFE standards, the US automotive industry and Evonik are looking to high-quality precipitated silica in order to produce fuel-efficient tires with good wet road holding properties.

   In 2015 the company increased capacity at its sodium methylate plant in Mobile, Alabama, to 72,000 metric tons.
