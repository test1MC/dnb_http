   Applied Materials makes the machines that make computer chips, flat panel TVs, and solar energy devices. The company's equipment vies for supremacy in many segments of the chip-making process, including deposition (layering film on wafers), etching (removing portions of chip material to allow precise construction of circuits), and semiconductor metrology and inspection equipment. Its services business accounts for about a quarter of revenue. Applied's plan to acquire its rival Tokyo Electron, the second biggest equipment maker, died in 2015 due to antitrust concern from US regulators.
  </p>

  <p>
   Applied operates in three segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display.
  </p>
  <p>
   Semiconductor Systems (65% of revenue) makes a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate integrated circuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied Global Services (25% of revenue) provides products that improve equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, and factory automation software for semiconductor, display, and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Display segment (10% of revenue) engineers products for making liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers (PCs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices as well as equipment for flexible substrates.
  </p>

  <p>
   Applied has operations in the US, Asia/Pacific, and Europe. Customers in Taiwan accounts for about a quarter of revenue, followed by China, 21%, South Korea, 17%, Japan, 12%, and the US, 11%.

  <p>
   Due to the highly technical nature of its products, Applied's direct sales force does most of the company's marketing and selling worldwide. Leading customers for Applied's chip making equipment include

  <p>
   Applied posted significant increases in revenue, net income, and cash from operations in 2016 (ended October) from 2015. Revenue of $10.8 billion in 2016 eclipsed the company's previous high of $10.5 billion reached in 2011. While 2016's $1.7 billion of net income was 25% higher than the 2015 figure, it didn't outpace the $1.9 billion hit in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, revenue from the semiconductor segment rose 12% on steady demand from manufacturers spurred by technology upgrades and capacity expansions. Foundry customers invested in new capacity to meet the demand for mobile chips while memory customers transitioned to 3D architectures. The global services revenue increased 6% from higher demand for spare parts and services. Display revenue jumped 28% as customers invested in mobile display manufacturing equipment. Sales to customers in China dropped 28% on slower investment in TV manufacturing equipment, while sales to customers in Korea leaped more than 200% on purchases of mobile display manufacturing equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in net income came from higher revenue as well as even and reduced spending in research, development, and engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations closed 2016 at about $2.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 2015 on increases in depreciation and amortization, customers deposit and deferred revenue, and decreases in inventories.

  <p>
   Applied has asked where is the semiconductor industry going and aims its products at the destinations. And so far, the company seems to have a pretty good map. It has developed equipment to address needs in logic, 3D NAND, patterning, and advance displays. A look at two markets, 3D NAND and display technology illustrates Applied's strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The increasing market for mobile devices has driven the development and adoption of 3D NAND flash, which is supplanting planar NAND. Applied's sales of equipment for making 3D NAND chips helped drive the 12% increase in fabrication equipment sales in 2016 (ended October). That includes sales to foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., as chip firms continue to concentrate more on design and outsource production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Display manufacturing is another focus for Applied. In 2016, China was second only to Taiwan in sales growth for the company. Sales of semiconductor and display equipment pushed China sales 23% higher in 2016. The company is producing the first generation of equipment for making bigger substrates for LCDs. The move toward larger screen TVs, 60 inches and bigger, drives the adoption of the new manufacturing technology. Applied estimates that its customers' capital spending on display technology will increase by about $2 billion in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up with the chip industry's constant drive toward smaller circuits, larger wafers, and new technologies such as copper interconnects, Applied relies heavily R&amp;D efforts. The company spends more than 15% of sales on R&amp;D each year.

  <p>
   Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron halted their proposed merger in April 2015 because they decided they couldn't clear antitrust concerns of regulators. The deal would have combined the two biggest companies in their industry, but allowed them to cut costs and increase efficiencies. Now Applied will have to find other ways to deal with the rising costs of equipping a semiconductor fab with increasingly sophisticated instruments.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Applied Materials was founded in 1967 in Mountain View, California, as a maker of chemical vapor deposition systems for fabricating semiconductors. After years of rapid growth, the company went public in 1972. Two years later it purchased wafer maker Galamar Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 Applied Materials suffered a 45% drop in sales as the semiconductor industry (and the US economy) contracted. Financial and managerial problems plagued the company following the recession, so in 1976 James Morgan, a former division manager for conglomerate
   <company id="11466">
    Textron
   </company>
   , was chosen to replace founder Michael McNeilly as CEO. Two years later Morgan also became chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   After selling Galamar (1977) and other non-core units and extending the company's line of credit, Morgan announced a plan to move into Japan. The company's first joint venture, Applied Materials Japan, was set up in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied got into the ion implanter market in 1980 through its acquisition of the UK's Lintott Engineering.
