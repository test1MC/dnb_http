   When the rubber meets the road, Kraton Polymers is responsible for both ends of the equation. It makes chemical ingredients used in both autos and in asphalt for road-building. As the operating subsidiary of holding company
   <company id="161384">
    Kraton Performance Polymers
   </company>
   , it is a leading global producer of styrenic block copolymers (SBCs). SBCs are a kind of polymer used in a variety of plastic, rubber, and chemical products, as well as for improving the stability of asphalt. Kraton Polymers splits its operations into four main end-use markets: Adhesives, Sealants, and Coatings; Advanced Materials; Paving and Roofing; and Cariflex, its brand for isopene rubber latex products. Kraton Polymers sells its products worldwide.

   The company has identified a few end-market segments to which it sells about 90% of its products. Those segments are: adhesives, sealants, and coatings; paving and roofing; and then advanced materials, which is comprised of compounding channels, personal care, and packaging and films. As a result the company focuses its R&amp;D and business development on those products. It also grows through acquisitions.

  <p>
   Kraton Polymers had been owned by
   <company id="50019">
    Royal Dutch Shell
   </company>
   until 2000 when investment group
   <company id="61408">
    Ripplewood Holdings
   </company>
   bought it. Texas Pacific Group acquired Polymer Holdings LLC (which owns Kraton), with help from affiliates of
   <company id="99789">
    J.P. Morgan Partners
   </company>
   , three years later. By 2009, the owners apparently felt confident enough in Kraton and in the rebounding economy to file for an IPO, choosing to form a holding company called Kraton Performance Polymers to serve as the parent company of operating subsidiary Kraton Polymers LLC.
