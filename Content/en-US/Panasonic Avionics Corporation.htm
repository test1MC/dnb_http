   The company grows through product innovation, acquisitions, joint ventures, and securing long-term contracts with end users. In 2012 Panasonic Avionics acquired control of AeroMobile Communications, LTD.

It allows passengers to use their mobile phones, smart phones and BlackBerry devices to make and receive voice calls and SMS text messages in flight, along with data services such as emails.
