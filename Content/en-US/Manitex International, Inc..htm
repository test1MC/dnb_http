   Manitex International makes products that are uplifting -- literally. One of the largest manufacturers of lifting equipment in North America, Manitex makes and sells boom trucks and sign cranes used in industrial jobs, as well as energy exploration, construction, and commercial building. Through Liftking, the company makes rough terrain forklifts, heavy handling transports, and military specialty vehicles. The Manitex family also includes Badger Equipment (cranes and material handling). A Crane &amp; Machinery unit distributes Manitex,

   , and Fuchs equipment.

  <p>
   Headquartered at Bridgeview, Illinois, the company has six main operating plants in North America and Italy. It has operations throughout the Americas, Autralia, and the EMEA regions, including Russia, Korea, Switzerland, and other countries. The US accounts for nearly 55% of the company's total revenue; Canada contributes nearly 25%.

  <p>
   The company divides its operations across two segments: lifting equipment (92% of sales) and equipment distribution (8%). Sales for boom trucks contributed 44% of its total revenue in 2012, while part sales and container handling equipment represented 16% and 12%, respectively.

  <p>
   Manitex sells its products through a network of about 50 full service dealers in Canada, Mexico, South America, the US, and the Middle East. It uses direct sales to sell its Sign Cranes. The company's exported military products are sold through Canadian Commercial Corporation to various foreign countries (outside of Canada).
  </p>
  <p>
   Major customers include Cropac Equipment (about 11% of its total revenue), the

  <p>
   Manitex has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last few years. Revenues surged 44% from $142 million in 2011 to $205 million in 2012. Profits more than doubled from $2.8 million to $8.1 million. Both these totals represented historic milestones for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2012 was attributed to a 45% spike in lifting equipment sales and a 43% rise in equipment distribution sales. The company saw explosive growth in both Canada (80%) and the US (52%). Sales in both Germany and Venezuela skyrocketed by more than 100% during 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The surge in profits for 2012 was attributed to the higher revenue and the favorable impact of non-recurring expenses related to legal settlements of two product liability cases.

  <p>
   Manitex grows through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it bought Indiana-based Sabre Manufacturing, a manufacturer of specialized tanks for liquid storage and containment services, for a purchase price of $14 million. The acquisition expanded its specialized product portfolio in its target markets.
