   Adient allows you to take a load off in your car. A global automotive seating supplier, the company makes complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests, trim covers, and fabrics. Its products go into passenger cars, commercial vehicles, light trucks, vans, pick-up trucks, and sport/crossover utility vehicles. To secure its global penetration, the company has major market positions in the Americas, Europe and China, and it has longstanding relationships with the largest global original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in the automotive sector. Adient was spun off from
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   , a maker of car batteries and automotive interior parts, in late 2016.

  <p>
   Adient operates through two reportable segments: Seating (99% of net sales) and Interiors (1%). Seating produces automotive seat metal structures and mechanisms, foam, trim, fabric, and complete seat systems. Interiors  produces instrument panels, floor consoles, door panels, overhead consoles, cockpit systems, decorative trim, and other products.

  <p>
   Adient operates 230 wholly and majority owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 33 countries. Additionally, it has partially owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe, and North America.

  <p>
   Adient's revenues declined 16% from $20.1 billion in 2015 to $16.8 billion in 2016. The revenue dip in 2016 was driven by the completion of its YFAI global automotive interiors joint venture the prior year (almost $3 billion), lower volumes due to plant wind downs ($20 million), unfavorable pricing and commercial settlements ($8 million), and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($9 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting $541 million in positive net income in 2015, Adient suffered a net loss of $1.4 billion in 2016. This was mostly due to $1.8 billion it set aside for income taxes and additional restructuring and impairment costs it incurred during the year. After posting positive cash flow of $397 in 2015, the company posted negative cash flow of $1.03 billion in 2016 as a result of the large amount of income tax paid.

  <p>
   Adient plans to take advantage of its dominating position in China, which has been established through strategic partnerships. It operates through 17 joint ventures with 60 manufacturing locations in 32 cities, which are supported by additional technical centers. In addition, Adient's strong position with European and American automakers is complemented by partnerships with all major auto groups in China, which has resulted in Adient's broad market penetration relative to seating competitors and market leadership in the industry's fastest-growing market. The company expects revenues in China to continue to grow as the automotive market continues to expand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, Adient purchased 30% of Yanfeng Global Automotive Interior Systems Co. (YFAI) in China in 2015. YFAI produces instrument panels, floor consoles, door panels, overhead consoles, cockpit systems, decorative trim, and other products.
