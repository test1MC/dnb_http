   In January 2016, the homebuilder partnered with

   to give Clayton customers an option to equip their homes with the appliance maker's products.

   Clayton Homes has been highlighting the affordability and energy-efficiency of its homes in recent years. In 2016, for example, it partnered with NeighborWorks Waco and the Next Step Network in Waco, Texas to give residents greater access to its affordable, energy-efficient, and locally-built homes.

        <p>
   Clayton's i-house is a modern energy-efficient modular home that features solar panels and sustainable materials like bamboo flooring. Its goal is for the i-house to represent more than 10% of its business. The company expanded its energy efficient housing line (in 2010) with the launch of ehome, which featured customizable options, such as energy saving appliances, windows, and fluorescent lighting.

   In April 2016, Clayton Homes purchased Hackleburg, Alabama-based homebuilder River Birch Homes.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in April 2016, the homebuilder bought Gallatin, Tennessee-based Goodall Homes, including 3,600 lots and 180 under-construction homes in Middle Tennessee. Goodall Homes, which delivered 436 homes in 2015, had been building single-family homes, townhomes, and condos since 1990.

   The recession dealt a blow to the manufactured housing industry. When demand fell and home buyers found it more difficult to obtain financing, several of the top manufacturers (
   <company id="10586">
    Fleetwood
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11817">
    Champion
   </company>
   , and Oakwood) went bankrupt and home production fell. To its benefit, Clayton was left to pick up some of the pieces. Its
   <company id="10941">
    Southern Energy Homes

   subsidiary acquired fellow Alabama manufacturer
   <company id="11808">
    Cavalier Homes
   </company>
   in 2009. Another Clayton subsidiary, CMH Manufacturing, bought the military housing assets of bankrupt Fleetwood in 2009. To keep itself above water, Clayton cut jobs and closed or consolidated plants.

        <p>
   The son of a sharecropper, James Clayton opened Clayton Homes, a retail mobile-home business, after borrowing $25,000 in 1966. By 1970 Clayton Homes was selling about 700 units annually. That year it began building mobile homes, and in 1974 it set up a mortgage subsidiary to finance sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   Clayton Homes went public in 1983. Sales remained strong despite a mid-1980s industry downturn. However, the early 1990s recession priced many people out of site-built housing. A growing acceptance of manufactured housing helped Clayton Homes move beyond the industry stronghold in the southeastern US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 and 1996 the company increased production capacity by building more plants. Clayton Homes entered the portable classroom business shortly after plans for a Clayton Homes community near Knoxville, Tennessee, caused concerns among its residents that the school system would become overtaxed. The company bought 22 retail centers and started 11 in fiscal 1998; the next year it acquired 15 locations and started 23. Clayton retired as CEO in 1999, and his son, president and COO Kevin Clayton, took the post.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales and profits declined in 2000 and 2001 as climbing US interest rates made it difficult for buyers to purchase manufactured housing and industry overcapacity created excess inventory at dealerships. Clayton Homes, however, was able to hold onto both profits and its reputation by acting conservatively and keeping lending standards relatively high. The company made gains in 2002, with a 16% increase in profits and a 4% rise in revenues that were boosted by increases in financial services and retail and communities sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   In August 2003 Clayton Homes became a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   , even though opposition had arisen and shareholders narrowly approved the deal. Investment icon Warren Buffett had become interested in the company after reading
   <em>
    First A Dream,
   </em>
   founder James Clayton's autobiography. The Clayton family held a 28% stake in the company and approved the acquisition.
  </p>
        <p>
   Clayton Homes purchased manufactured housing rival
   <company id="11109">
    Oakwood Homes
   </company>
   -- which was operating under a bankruptcy plan of reorganization -- for about $373 million in 2004. The acquisition catapulted Clayton past Fleetwood and Champion into the #1 US manufactured housing spot. Clayton Homes retained its headquarters, management, and employees.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 Clayton acquired
   <company id="108740">
    Karsten Homes
   </company>
   , a fellow manufactured home builder that operates facilities in California, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. Not long afterwards, Clayton purchased most of
   <company id="115421">
    Fleetwood Retail
   </company>
   , the retail outlet arm of Fleetwood Enterprises. The deal included 123 retail outlets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Clayton acquired Alabama-based manufactured home builder Southern Energy in 2006. A year later the company streamlined its operations and got out of the land lease business when it sold its housing communities division to BaseCamp Capital. The deal included the sale of some 60 properties and close to 18,000 houses.
