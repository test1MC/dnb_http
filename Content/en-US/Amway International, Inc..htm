   Selling makeup and vitamins to friends and family is a way of life at Amway International. One of the world's largest direct-sales businesses, Amway boasts more than 3 million independent consultants who sell its catalog of more than 450 personal care, household, nutrition, and cleaning products in more than 100 countries. Revival-like techniques are used to motivate distributors (mostly part-timers) to sell products and find new recruits to build the multi-level marketing platform. Operations outside of the US generate about 80% of sales, mainly in Asia. Founder Richard DeVos and the Van Andel family own Amway and its parent company,

        <p>
   Amway's nutrition product sales generated 43% of its direct-selling revenue in 2014, while beauty products contributed another 25%. Durable product sales made up another 19% of sales, while home care products and other offerings accounted for 8% and 5% of sales, respectively.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's success relies on setting up Independent Business Owners (IBOs) to sell its name brand products, but more importantly build its network. Although individuals are required to pay a membership fee, Amway asserts that they can then buy its products and sell them at a 20% to 25% markup. IBOs that recruit get a cut from the sales made by those members.

        <p>
   Based in Ada, Michigan, Amway manufactures and sells consumer products and business opportunities in more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, and the Americas. Its top 10 markets in 2014 were China, South Korea, Japan, United States, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, India, Malaysia, and Ukraine.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's manufacturing facilities are in Ada, Michigan; Buena Park, California; Guangzhou, China; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Amway also has regional shared service centers in San Jose, Costa Rica; Cyberjaya, Malaysia; and Zabierzow, Poland.

   Amway reported that its annual sales grew by 68% from 2004 through 2014, boasting that it's achieved sales growth in 13 of the last 15 years. Its sales have been particularly strong in China, with a growth rate of 27% over the past five years.
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite its long-term success, Amway's sales declined by 8% to $10.8 billion during 2014, mostly due to lower revenues in China and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Its sales grew modestly in the matured markets of South Korea and Taiwan, while sales grew by double-digits for the year in faster-growing markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatamala, Chile, Panama, Italy, and Spain. Amway also said that new product launches such as Truvivity by Nutrilite supplements and the Artistry Hydra-V collection had a notable impact on its sales growth in many countries.

   Amway has been expanding its manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities in recent years to boost production and foster new product creation. During 2014, Amway opened its $13-million Amway Botanical Research Botanical Research Center (ABRC) in Wuxi, China; opened its new $25-million manufacturing plant in Vietnam; introduced its new $81-million nutrition manufacturing facility in Michigan; and opened a new nutrition and R&amp;D facility in California. In mid-2013, it planned to invest $335 million in manufacturing and research and development expansion. The initiative involved upgrading four factories in the US, building a new manufacturing facility in India, and adding second sites in both China and Vietnam. Also that year, Amway broke ground on a new $95-million production plant in Tamil Nadu, India, set for completion in 2015. Its second plant in China would be located in Guangzhou; the $75-million facility was slated for completion by 2016.
  </p>
        <p>
   While the direct-selling business model has been popular around the world, Amway's focus has increasingly been on Asia's fertile market as well as other emerging markets in Latin America (where sales grew by double digits in 2014 alone). The company deepens its presence in the Asia/Pacific by outsourcing its manufacturing operations to third parties in the region as well as by aligning its product design and branding around their cultures.

   In January 2015, Amway purchased the California-based energy drink maker, XS, linking Amway to the fast-growing energy drink market (which was expected to grow by 13% annually until 2018 according to Euromonitor and Research and Markets). The acquisition would also strengthen Amway's entrepreneurial connection with young entrepreneurs under the age of 35.

   After serving in the Army Air Corps in WWII, high school pals Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel tried several moneymaking projects. In the late 1940s they became distributors for NUTRILITE, a California vitamin company that had pioneered network sales (in which distributors receive commissions on sales made by the people they recruit). In 1958, when NUTRILITE's leadership was failing, DeVos and Van Andel decided to develop their own product line. They founded the American Way Association (later shortened to Amway) in 1959. Van Andel oversaw Amway's nuts and bolts while DeVos provided the motivational spark.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amway's first product was a multipurpose solution called L.O.C. (Liquid Organic Cleaner). The firm then began making laundry detergent, other household cleaners, and personal grooming products. In 1963 Amway established distributorships in Canada. The company grew quickly: 70 building projects, including factories and warehouses, were built between 1960 and 1978. The "American Way" soon caught on in Australia and Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the early 1970s Amway bought NUTRILITE (1972) and expanded to Asia (Hong Kong, 1974). In 1979 an FTC ruling exonerated Amway of charges that it was a pyramid scheme: Because distributors receive commissions only on actual sales of their recruit network and Amway buys back excess inventory, the business was legitimate. In 1982 Amway pleaded guilty to defrauding the Canadian government of $22 million in import duties and was fined $50 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Following several suits alleging abusive sales practices, in 1984 Amway brought in William Nicholson (a former assistant to President Gerald Ford) to help it reorganize. In 1991 rival
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   (P&amp;G) won a $75,000 judgment against Amway distributors for spreading rumors linking P&amp;G with Satanism. Nicholson stepped down as COO in 1992.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company formed a joint venture in 1992 to build a plant in China. Amway Japan went public in 1993. That year DeVos retired as president and was replaced by his son Dick. In 1995 Van Andel retired, handing the chairmanship to his son Steve.
  </p>
        <p>
   China banned direct selling in 1998, but the company was allowed to have distributors act as sales representatives rather than buy the products and resell them. In 1999 DeVos and Van Andel launched Quixtar, which began selling Amway and brand-name items online. Amway bought all the remaining shares in Amway Japan and Amway Asia Pacific that it didn't already own, taking them private in 2000.
  </p>
        <p>
   Citing pressure from the Internet economy, Amway later announced that it would cut about 1,300 jobs (11% of its workforce). Amway said the cuts -- mostly of headquarters management and staff and international employees -- would save $300 million per year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 DeVos and Van Andel formed holding company Alticor to showcase businesses (outsourcing, Internet sales) outside its traditional direct-sales arena.
  </p>
        <p>
   China was Amway's top market in 2004, followed by Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Founder Jay Van Andel died at the age of 80 in December 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 Amway opened flagship stores in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
