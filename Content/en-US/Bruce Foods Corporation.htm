   Bruce Foods was Cajun long before Cajun was hot. Its Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is a top-selling variety nationwide (alongside
   <company id="55649">
    McIlhenny
   </company>
   's Tabasco brand hot-pepper sauce). It sells Louisiana-brand hot peppers, too. As one of America's largest privately-owned food manufacturers, it makes and markets less incendiary offerings, including Tex-Mex products and traditional Southern favorites, such sweet potato pancake, muffin, bread-pudding, and biscuit mixes. Cajun King seasonings, Casa Fiesta Mexican foods, Cajun Injector marinades, and Mexene chili seasonings round out the company's portfolio of products. Bruce Foods was founded in 1928; the Bruce family still owns and manages the company.

   Bruce Foods extended its reach into cooking oil by acquiring the Summerfield and Summer Oaks cooking oil brands from Summerfield, based in Birmingham, Alabama, in 2010. Bruce Foods bought the maker of peanut oil and cottonseed oil products to supplement its items that are intended for kitchen or outdoor use.

   As part of the Bruce Foods research and development program, the company caters to its retail and food service customers by formulating new recipes and coming up with new menu ideas. It formulates recipes for its company website, product label promotions, recipe cards, holiday pamphlets, magazine, newspapers, national chain restaurants, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Outcomes of this effort include Sweet Potato, Shrimp, and Jalapeno Bisques; Chipotle and Chevre Polenta Cakes; Buffalo Catfish Wraps; and Lemon Butter Garlic Vinaigrette. It also offers its customers custom formulation.
