   Embraer is flying high as one of the world's top four aircraft manufacturers. The company makes smaller commercial jets that seat between 30-120 passengers and seven models of executive jets. More than half of its revenues come from commercial jet sales; executive jets account for another 25%. The company's defense and security division (23% of sales) manufactures light attack, trainer, and surveillance aircraft for military markets, and is developing a jet-powered military tactical transport for the Brazilian Air Force. The company generates about 50% of its sales in North and South America and is rapidly increasing its customer base worldwide.

  <p>
   The commercial jet division's top seller is the ERJ 145 family of jets (for regional airline market), followed by the E-Jets (in between regional and mainline aircraft), which cater to the 50- to 130-seat niche. The jets are sold to more than 90 airlines in 60 countries worldwide, but the division generates most of its sales in Europe and Asia/Pacific.

   In this market slot, Embraer has been neck-and-neck with main rival Bombardier. To aid in the battle, Embraer has added to its offerings higher capacity planes -- such as the Embraer 170, 175, 190, and 195. The creation of another division -- New Programs for Commercial Aviation -- will help the company to decide whether it wants to remain in this niche market or if it wants to build larger planes, putting it in competition with the two biggest airplane makers: Europe's

   and US-based
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing

   .

   Embraer's defense systems division encompass military aircraft that are designed to support 20 air forces around the world in ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), as well as training and combat requirements. This division stands to increase its share of the company's revenues to almost 20%, based in part on the $1.3 billion contract with the Brazilian Air Force for the development of the KC-390, a new jet-powered military tactical transport with a 19-ton cargo capacity. The KC-390 is scheduled for action in 2016 and is expected to contribute heavily to the company's revenues.

  <p>
   Embraer has experienced steady growth over the years, with revenue increasing 1% from 2013 to 2014. The marginal growth for 2014 was fueled by a 22% surge in sales from its defense and security segment due to the execution of contracts with the Brazilian government. Despite experiencing revenue declines across all other geographical segments, the company experienced a 69% surge in North American sales during 2014.

   In addition, Embraer's profits have been consistent, hovering around the $345 million mark during the the last three years. The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years, declining 15% from $564 million in 2013 to $482 million in 2014.

   Outside Brazil, Embraer has been expanding into a number of new markets. Over the next decade, the company expects to realize a greater share of revenues from India and China. The company has sold 15 executive jets in India and has 30 more orders for the Phenom 100 model. Embraer manufactures planes in China through a joint venture with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC in English).

   Its Harbin Embraer Aircraft Industry (HEAI) has produced about 45 of the ERJ 145 commercial jet models and the 18 Legacy 600/650. China's demand for commercial airliners with 60 to 120 seats is estimated to be around 1,000 units over the next two decades. Embraer's $2 billion deal with CDB Leasing, part of the state-owned

   , provides funding for Chinese airlines to buy Embraer aircraft. So far, CDB Leasing agreed to buy 20 E-Jet 190 models for

   Embraer-Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was founded in São José dos Campos, Brazil, in 1969 as a government company, with military leader Ozires Silva as its chairman. Embraer produced the country's first aircraft, the 19-seat Bandeirante, that year.
