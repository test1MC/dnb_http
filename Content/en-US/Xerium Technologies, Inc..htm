   Xerium Technologies makes clothing, but not the kind that people wear. The company manufactures and supplies clothing and roll covers used on paper-making machinery. Xerium's clothing rolls are used as belts to convey paper through paper-making machines, and its roll covers are used on the machines' steel cylinders; both products are consumed during paper production. The company operates about 30 manufacturing facilities in about a dozen countries, primarily in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, and nets more than 60% of sales outside North America.

  <p>
   The company has two reportable segments: machine clothing and roll covers. The clothing segment (63% of total sales) makes and sells synthetic textile belts used to move paper along the length of paper making tools and equipment. Its roll covers operations (37%) make and refurbish the covers used on the steel rolls of a papermaking machine.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has nearly 30 manufacturing facilities in 13 countries (Argentina, Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and the US) located in the major paper-producing regions of North America, Europe, South America, and Asia-Pacific.

  <p>
   The company markets its products, primarily using its direct sales force, to the paper industry's leading producers. Its top ten customers accounted for 26% of net sales in 2015.

  <p>
   Xerium's revenues have declined the last two years, dropping 12% from $543 million in 2014 to $477 million in 2015. Xerium also posted net losses of $7.4 million in 2014 and $4.4 million in 2015. In addition, Xerium's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after dropping significantly in 2014, cash flow skyrocketed by more than 352% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue abatement for 2015 was due to declines from both its segments. Machine clothing segment revenues diminished by 14% due to a decrease in the value of the US dollar against foreign currency, mainly the euro. In 2015 both segments also experienced declines in Asia, due to the softening of the Indonesia and Korea markets and declines in South America and Europe, due to a weak Brazilian economy and the over-supply of machine clothing in Europe.

  <p>
   Almost as though the industry was working against itself, new, more technologically efficient paper machines are being introduced with lower-maintenance rolls, reducing roll cover replacement. Xerium plans to capitalize on this trend as its engineered fabrics are sturdier and longer lasting, requiring fewer replacements.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make the best of a lukewarm economic situation, Xerium is following paper producers into Asia in hopes of further squeezing its operating expenses and boosting production efficiency. In 2015 it built a new machine clothing plant in Bacheng, China, to produce high-end press felts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Xerium expanded its global footprint by opening a location in Turkey. The new facility provides pulp, paper, nonwoven production, and converting services to Turkey, Southeast Europe, and the Middle East regions.

  <p>
   In 2016 Xerium for $18 million acquired J.J. Plank Corporation, a supplier of equipment used in the production of paper, tissue converting, and food packaging. Through the acquisition, the company further strengthened its portfolio with the addition of spreader rolls, dandy rolls, and tissue embossing rolls.
