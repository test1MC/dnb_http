   brand), tow trucks (

    Jerr-Dan

   </company>
   ). Its emergency offerings range from snow blowers to aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles (
   <company id="109736">
    Pierce
   </company>
   ). More than 30 plants build the lineup. Vehicles are sold via dealers to global airport, institutional, construction, and municipal markets. Oshkosh also makes tactical trucks for the

    Department of Defense
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Oshkosh divides its operations across four segments. The access equipment segment -- consisting of JLG and Jerr-Dan -- generates 48% of sales and makes aerial work platforms, tow trucks, and telehandlers used by rental companies, construction contractors, manufacturing companies, home improvement stores, and the military.
  </p>
  <p>
   Commercial (16%) makes rear- and front-discharge concrete mixers, refuse collection vehicles, portable and stationary concrete batch plants for ready-mix companies and waste haulers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The defense segment (21% of total sales) supplies the US and foreign militaries, as well as law-enforcement agencies, with military tactical wheeled vehicles. The fire and emergency segment (15%) supplies commercial and custom firefighting vehicles and equipment, vehicles for aircraft rescue, snow removal, and broadcasting, ambulances, and mobile medical trailers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Oshkosh has manufacturing locations in eight US states and in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, the UK, and Romania. It also has joint ventures in Brazil and Mexico. The company sells and services products in more than 130 countries around the globe. The US accounts for nearly 80% of its net sales.

  <p>
   JLG sells its products through 3,500 locations spanning six continents. Oshkosh markets its Jeff-Dan carrier and wreckers through a network of 60 independent distributors. JLG's customers include
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   and SAME Deutz-Fahr. The US government represents about 15% of the company's sales.

  <p>
   After experiencing three straight years of declines, Oshkosh saw its revenues jump 3% from $6.1 billion in 2015 to $6.28 billion in 2016. The growth was fueled by a 44% surge in defense sales and a 17% bump in fire and emergency sales. Oshkosh also experienced a 60% rise in sales from the EMEA region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Defense sales in 2016 were affected by increased international sales of M-ATVs to the Middle East and increased sales to the
   <company id="105717">
    DoD
   </company>
   . Fire and emergency sales were up due to higher domestic fire truck deliveries and favorable pricing. Improved operational efficiencies also allowed the fire and emergency segment to increase its fire apparatus production rates to meet increased demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, however, fell 6% from $230 million in 2015 to $216 million in 2016 mainly due to an asset impairment charge of $27 million. In addition, cash flow from operations absolutely skyrocketed from $83 million in 2015 to $578 million in 2016 due to a significant reduction in inventory levels in its access equipment segment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Challenged by customer markets that have been down variously from 40% to 90% and especially by a lower US defense budget, Oshkosh has been implementing a lean strategy of cutting non-value added labor that has included reducing its manufacturing operations by 20% and unifying its purchasing operations into a single global unit. These measures are included under a plan called MOVE.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company intends to continue to pursue the MOVE strategy in fiscal 2017 and beyond, with the belief that this strategy will continue to drive actions that will position the Oshkosh to deliver strong shareholder value in the coming years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other prongs in the strategy include using new technologies to expand the functions of its products and developing business in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Expanding international operations and sales is a significant part of the company's growth strategy for fiscal 2017.

  <p>
   Bernhard Mosling and William Besserdich founded Oshkosh Truck in 1917, attracting investors with
   <i>
    Old Betsy
   </i>
   , a four-wheel-drive, 3,000-pound truck. Over the next few decades, the company developed a range of heavy-duty vehicles. Sales took off when the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   gave truck contracts to Oshkosh during WWII. Commercial sales increased after the war, the result of demand from mining and plantation companies. Oshkosh Truck went public in 1985. To reflect its more diverse operations, Oshkosh changed its name from Oshkosh Truck Corporation to Oshkosh Corporation in 2008.
