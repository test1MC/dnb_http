   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals takes a stand against gastrointestinal ailments and other medical conditions. The firm develops internally discovered gastrointestinal drugs; its first commercial product, Linzess (or linaclotide), a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic constipation, is sold in the US and in Canada under the brand name Constella. Linzess was developed with partner
   <company id="11951">
    Forest Laboratories
   </company>
   , which shares US marketing rights. Outside of the US, Ironwood licensed development and commercialization rights for the drug to
   <company id="158864">
    Almirall
   </company>
   in Europe and other partners in Asia. The firm also has products in development for other gastrointestinal, central nervous system (CNS), and inflammatory conditions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is focused on creating first-in-class medicines, primarily for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Manufacturing of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals' candidates is conducted through third parties and partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals' first
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved drug, Linzess, was approved in 2012 to treat adult patients with abdominal pain, bloating, and other symptoms associated with IBS, as well as patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. In early 2013 the drug was approved and launched by Almirall in Europe (where it is sold under the Constella brand) for the treatment of IBS. Later that year, it was approved in Canada (where it is marketed by
   <company id="10059">
    Allergan
   </company>
   ); it was approved for sale in Mexico (and marketed by Almirall) in 2014. The company is pursuing approval for the drug in Asia through partners including
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   and
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   . With Allergan (formerly Actavis), it is exploring additional gastrointestinal indications for the drug.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its agreement with AstraZeneca, Ironwood began promoting AstraZeneca's Nexium acid reflux treatment in the US market in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are sold in North America and Europe. Ironwood has development partnerships in China and Japan.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Following Linzess' FDA approval, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and Forest built up their sales and marketing networks to launch the drug in the US market. Though Ironwood Pharmaceuticals has a direct sales force in the US, it plans to continue to conduct all international sales through existing and new licensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Actavis (now Allergan) accounted for more than 60% of Ironwood's total revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals has yet to turn a profit and has accumulated a deficit of more than $967 million. It has managed to increase revenues in recent years, however, as its collaborative partnerships have matured and it has received higher development milestone payouts from its partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, revenue increased 234% to $76.4 million, driven primarily by growing Linzess sales in the US. A $10.2 million development milestone payment from Astellas also drove up earnings that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the higher revenue, plus a reduction in collaboration expenses due to higher Linzess sales in the US, the company's net loss declined $83 million to $190 million. The firm hopes to eventually become profitable after increasing Linzess sales and gaining approval for other candidates, though it expects to continue to spend most of its income on R&amp;D and commercialization efforts for several years to come.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also declined, decreasing 43% to $156 million.

  <p>
   The company is focused on becoming a leading provider of gastrointestinal medicines by increasing market penetration among potential Linzess patients. The company also intends to explore further gastrointestinal indications for Linzess, and it has additional research and development programs focusing on the development of other novel candidates for gastrointestinal, neurology, cardiovascular, and allergy conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals regularly looks for licensing or acquisition opportunities to expand its development pipeline into existing and new therapeutic fields.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company entered into an agreement with
   <company id="102602">
    Exact Sciences
   </company>
   to co-promote that firm's Colorguard product, a noninvasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals conducted an IPO in 2010. The company's decision to go public helped it generate additional funds to push the development and commercialization of Linzess forward.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 1998 by CEO Peter Hecht and director Gina Borino Miller, the company changed its name from Microbia to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals in 2008 to reflect its focus on the development of human therapeutics. To further focus on its core operations, in 2010 Ironwood Pharmaceuticals sold its Microbia subsidiary, which was involved in the development of fermentation technologies used to produce specialty ingredients and biomaterials, to Royal DSM.
