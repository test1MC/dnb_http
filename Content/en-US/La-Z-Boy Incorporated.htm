   La-Z-Boy works so that its customers can kick back and relax. A top US maker of upholstered furniture, La-Z-Boy sells its ubiquitous recliners, plus chairs, sofas, tables, and modular seating units. One recliner boasts a drink cooler, phone, and massage and heat system. Its brands include La-Z-Boy, England, Hammary, American Drew, Lea, and Kincaid. La-Z-Boy sells its products through about 110 company-owned stores, some 325 independent La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries, and 570-plus Comfort Studios (about 5,000 sq. ft. of dedicated La-Z-Boy space hosted by an independent retailer). La-Z-Boy also makes wood desks and bedroom items and licenses its name for use on furniture for the health care industry.

  <p>
   While the company enjoys a global reach, La-Z-Boy primarily sells its products in the US and Canada to furniture retailers and directly to consumers through its company-owned stores. The US typically generates 85% of its revenues each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   La-Z-Boy operates its business through three segments: Upholstery (such as recliners, sofas, chairs, and ottomans), Retail (company-owned stores located in nine markets), and Casegoods (consisting of bedroom and dining room sets, entertainment centers, and accent pieces).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its business, La-Z-Boy operates a manufacturing joint venture in Thailand that distributes furniture in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and other Asian countries. It also runs a sales and marketing joint venture in Asia to sell and distribute furniture in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Malaysia, among other countries there.

  <p>
   La-Z-Boy gains dedicated retail space -- either in stand-alone stores or dedicated galleries or studios within department stores -- through formal agreements with other furniture retailers. Deemed "proprietary" customers, they display and merchandise La-Z-Boy's products. Its customer mix in 2015 across its upholstery and casegoods segments include 58% proprietary, 8% major dealers (such as

   ), and 34% other independent retailers.

   La-Z-Boy's revenue has been increasing consistently the last five years. In fiscal 2015 (ended April), its revenue increased by 5% to $1.4 billion, due to a rise across all its operating segments. Its Retail segment increased 12% due to a spike in sales from active stores operating for over a year, along with additional sales volumes from new and acquired stores. In addition, Upholstery sales climbed by 5%, resulting from stronger volume and selling price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also experienced an upward trend in net income the last few years. In fiscal 2015, net income jumped by 29% to $71  million, due to the revenue gains coupled with additional earnings from discontinued operations related to its assets in its Bauhaus U.S.A. business unit. La-Z Boy's operating cash flow has fluctuated the last few years; after increasing in 2014, it dipped by 4% to $87 million in 2015 due to cash outflows in accounts payable and accounts receivables.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Over a five-year period starting in 2014, the company is focused on expanding its La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores network to 400 stores, averaging $4 million in sales per store. As part of the strategy, the company plans to open, relocate, or remodel 35 to 40 stores during fiscal 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also been increasing its La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio locations to expand its branded distribution channels. It hopes the strategy will generate growth across its Retail segment as it increases its company-owned store count and generates growth in the wholesale Upholstery segment as the proprietary distribution network is expanded.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the company's global expansion, it is looking for new partners to expand into under-penetrated areas such as Brazil and Eastern/Central Europe.

  <p>
   Carpenter Edward Knabusch repaired and built furniture in his family's garage in Monroe, Michigan, in the early 1920s. When people began clamoring for Knabusch's repair expertise, he quit his job, hired his cousin, Edwin Shoemaker, and in 1927 formed Floral City Furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The duo specialized in new designs, including a telephone stand with seat that they dubbed "the Gossiper." Their first recliner, a wooden porch chair that shaped itself to body contours, was developed in 1928. Positive response prompted family and friends to raise money (Shoemaker's dad mortgaged the farm) for a manufacturing plant. At a customer's urging, the pair upholstered the chair, and Knabusch drummed up even more interest with a contest to name the new piece. Entries included Slack-Back, Sit-N-Snooze, and the moniker that would help define an industry, La-Z-Boy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the midst of the Depression, the company thrived, turning the bottom factory floor into a showroom and offering entertainment and circus tents stuffed with merchandise to attract out-of-state visitors. The cousins amassed a petting zoo of farm animals collected, instead of money, from cash-strapped customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To separate manufacturing and a burgeoning retail operation, La-Z-Boy Chair was incorporated in 1941. Production stopped during WWII while Knabusch and Shoemaker made tank seats and crash pads.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its one-of-a-kind product styles helped to distinguish the company through the 1950s and 1960s. Its reputation grew, thanks to products such as a love seat fashioned in the form of a car seat, replete with lights, horns, fins, and tires (1959), and a chair that both rocked and reclined (1961). La-Z-Boy also began what would become a long-lived marketing campaign by using such celebrity spokesmen as football player Joe Namath and talk-show host Johnny Carson. Sales reached nearly $53 million in 1971, and La-Z-Boy went public the next year.
