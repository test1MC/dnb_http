   No jokes about "herd mentality," please. Foremost Farms USA is a major US dairy cooperative, owned by some 1,800 dairy farmers in its founding state of Wisconsin, and neighboring states in the upper-Midwest. The herds owned by member-farmers annually produce about six billion pounds of raw milk, which Foremost turns into dairy products for its customers. Taking the "America's Dairyland" motto of its home state seriously, the cooperative makes cheese, butter, and dairy-based ingredients. The cooperative's fluid milk is offered in bulk quantities and only to the commercial food sector, such as milk packagers, wholesalers, and food manufacturers.

   Baraboo, Wisconsin-based Foremost is owned by farmer-members located in its home state as well as Indiana, and Illinois, and parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, and Ohio.

  <p>
   In 2014 Foremost and
   <company id="58821">
    Michigan Milk Producers Association
   </company>
   formed a strategic alliance to help balance and add value to their members' milk supplies in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company has been shedding non-core businesses. In 2013 Foremost sold its dry blending business to
   <company id="56234">
    Agropour cooperative
   </company>
   , in order to focus on its ingredients business.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The cooperative in 2010 exited the retail milk business. It sold off its consumer-products division, including its milk processing plants and the Golden Guernsey and La Vaca Bonita milk brands to rival milk processor and distributor
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   . The deal positioned Foremost to concentrate on the wholesale business of cheese, butter, and dairy-ingredients production.
