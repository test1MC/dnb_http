   This TreeHouse has a full canopy. TreeHouse Foods is the nation's #1 manufacturer of non-dairy powdered creamer, sold under the Cremora brand, and pickles (Farman's, Nalley's, Peter Piper, and Steinfeld). The company also makes private-label soups, salad dressings and Mexican sauces, drink mixes, hot cereals, macaroni and cheese, skillet dinners, and jams. TreeHouse makes private-label products for foodservice distributors and restaurant chains, as well as for supermarkets and mass merchandisers -- the company's largest market that also buys its own brands. TreeHouse also boasts co-pack business and industrial customers. The company branches out through acquisitions.

   The company's product categories include beverages; salad dressings; snacks; beverage enhancers; pickles; Mexican and other sauces; soup and infant feeding; cereals; dry dinners; aseptic products; jams; and other products. It also offers natural, organic, and preservative-free ingredients in many categories. TreeHouse' wholly-owned subsidiary Bay Valley Foods LLC is a leading supplier of private-label foods to grocery stores and foodservice operators. In turn, Bay Valley operates several of its own subsidiaries: ST Specialty Foods, a maker of rice and pasta dishes, as well as add-meat skillet dinners, and potato side dishes; Sturm Foods, a manufacturer of hot cereals and powdered drink mixes; and jam-and-spread maker E.D. Smith.

   North American Retail Grocery accounted for 76% of the company's 2015 sales. Its Food Away From Home business brought in 12%, as did Industrial and Export. The snacks category is TreeHouse's biggest product line, generating 20% of revenue.

   The company markets its products to retailers, such as supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers, and also to the foodservice industry, including foodservice distributors and national restaurant operators. It supplies more than 200 food retail customers in North America, including each of the 50 largest food retailers, and more than 500 foodservice customers, including distributors who comprise 90% of the foodservice sales universe and more than 50 of the 100 largest restaurant chains.

   TreeHouse has sprouted robust revenue and profit growth in the past three years. After a 28% spike in 2015, revenue rose another 9% in 2015. Sales increased in the North American Retail Grocery and Industrial and Export segments with the help of acquisitions. Grocery revenue eroded on falling sales of single-serve hot beverage items and general grocery contraction. Sales were off in the Food Away From Home segment, dented by unfavorable Canadian foreign exchange, volume/mix decreases, and lower pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income's 28% leap to $115 million came from higher revenue and cost reductions from restructuring of the soup business (which has been completed) and the closures of the Seaforth salad dressing plant and the facility in City of Industry, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow for 2015 increased to $285 million from $12 million in 2014.

   The company focuses on expanding partnerships with retailers; driving growth and profitability from its existing product portfolio; leverage cross-selling opportunities across customers, sales channels, and geographies; and growth through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   TreeHouse is looking to higher margin businesses. It launched a single-serve roast coffee product line and is working to increase its distribution points and product offerings. The rollout of the single-serve hot beverage line gained momentum throughout 2013.

   TreeHouse has grown by strengthening ties with retail grocers who are demanding private-label food products as cash-strapped consumers seek goods with equivalent quality at a lower price. To maintain momentum, the food maker focuses on the most-purchased categories of private-label products, typically canned soup, salad dressings, powdered creamer, and pickles. Acquisitions have enabled TreeHouse to expand its production capacity and breadth of food products, capturing an ever greater amount of retail shelf space. To that end, in February 2016 it paid nearly $3 billion cash for

   private label business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a cost-cutting move TreeHouse said it would close its Cain manufacturing facility in Ayer, Massachusetts in 2017.

   In 2014 TreeHouse bought Flagstone Foods, a maker of healthy snacks. Flagstone reported 2013 sales of  $697 million. The company also bought Protenergy Natural Foods, a manufacturer of private-label broth, soups, and gravies. TreeHouse paid C$170 million (approximately $150 million) in cash for the business.

   TreeHouse also bought Sturm Foods, a maker of private-label hot cereal and powdered soft drink mixes from HM Capital Partners for $660 million in 2010. The move strengthened TreeHouse's private-label operations, as well as its packaging, mixing, and flavoring capabilities. Extending its reach in shelf-stable foods, TreeHouse bought out S.T. Specialty Foods from Windjammer Capital Investors in an all-cash deal valued at about $180 million. S.T. Specialty Foods primarily makes private-label macaroni and cheese and skillet dinners, mainstream staples of the dine-at-home

   The company bought Naturally Fresh, a privately-owned maker of refrigerated dressings, sauces, dips, and marinades, in 2012 for $25 million. The deal took TreeHouse from the shelf-stable grocery aisle to the refrigerated produce section, providing a premium presence. In 2012 TreeHouse acquired the assets of the Aseptic Cheese and Pudding business from
