   when it runs the scale of energy, mining, and paper. The heavy equipment company operates in several segments and offers corresponding maintenance and support services. Its minerals segment (73% of net sales) provides minerals processing services and system deliveries for mining customers and crushing and screening products for aggregates customers. Its flow control segment (27%) offers pumps and automation management equipment for mining, oil, and gas customers. Metso has operations in more than 50 countries and also owns a 41% stake in car maker

  <p>
   Metso operates production units on all continents, along with more than 90 service centers worldwide. It chiefly operates in Europe and North America (contributing 45% of revenue), along with Asia and South America.

  <p>
   Metso posted significant drops in revenues for 2013 and 2014. The revenue declines were mostly due to an overall decrease in orders for mining equipment, which reflects the mining sector's prevailing reluctance to invest in new production capacities. The company's balance sheet has also been impacted by the selling of its automotive operations in 2013.

  <p>
   After selling its automotive operations in 2013, Metso is now focused on growing its mining, aggregates, and oil and gas operations. To do this, it plans on rolling out additional products, opening new facilities in select locations, and acquiring complementary businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2014 and 2015, the company expanded its portfolio with the introduction of a range of new products including the addition of a new rock breaker series designed for primary stationary crushing stations. As part of its geographic expansion, Metso over the years has opened new service centers in Peru, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. It also opened a new valve technology center in South Korea.

  <p>
   In 2015 Metso acquired certain intellectual property rights related to the Falk Mill Products business of Rexnord Industries. The acquisition increased Metso's ability to provide not only the replacement parts and services for open gearing, but also additional technical competence in gears and pinions and the quality requirements necessary to produce these components. It also allowed the company to provide replacement gears and pinions for its customers utilizing original equipment manufacturer (OEM) drawings and specifications for mills and kilns purchased through the company and certain other end users.

  <p>
   Metso's story begins prior to WW II when the Finnish government opened arms plants for its defense forces. After their defeat by the Soviets, the Finnish government continued to operate the arms plants to pay war reparations. Run by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the company was named Valtion Metallitehtaat (VMT). In 1947, Yrjo Vesa, a shipbuilding executive, was appointed chairman and CEO of VMT, replacing the company's military leadership.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Finnish government changed the company's name to Valmet Oy in 1950. Under Vesa's leadership the company produced papermaking machinery, tractors, and ships. In 1953 the company was in financial straits after selling its ships at a loss, undervaluing its books, and restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another business, Rauma Corporation, got its start in 1942 as Rauma-Raahe Oy, a company formed from several sawmills and timber companies. It began building ships in 1945, and merged with Repola-Viipuri Oy and Lahti Oy in 1951 to form Rauma-Repola. While the company continued its timber and shipbuilding operations, it also began to make pulp machinery in the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sailed along until 1970 when it purchased Lokomo Oy, a maker of rock crushers, road graders, and logging machines. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the company grew through acquisitions. Purchases included US-based Jamesbury, a leading maker of industrial valves and control systems, Nordberg (rock-crushing equipment), Timberjack (logging machinery), and Sunds Defibrator (pulp machinery, Sweden).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Rauma-Repola merged with Finnish forest products company United Paper Mills (UPM) and formed Repola Company. Out of this union, the company formed a new subsidiary, Rauma Corporation, to hold its Timberjack, Sunds, Defibrator, Nordberg, and Neles-Jamesbury businesses. In 1995 Repola sold 25% of Rauma to the public and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. The next year Repola and Kymmene merged to form
   <company id="91040">
    UPM-Kymmene
   </company>
   , the #1 forest products company in Europe, and reduced their stake in Rauma to 34%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merging in 1999, Valmet and Rauma took the name Metso, a Finnish word for wood grouse.
