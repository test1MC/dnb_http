    Merck
   </company>
   . In 2014 the company's net loss increased 41% to $79 million as R&amp;D and other expenses rose. R&amp;D expenses were higher as the company built out a production area at one of its facilities, while other expenses such as increased headcount costs rose related to its new headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey.
