   Cancer and other diseases had better beware -- Agenus (formerly Antigenics) is packing heat. The firm develops heat shock proteins, which are related to the immune system's response to disease. Its patient-specific vaccines work on the theory that each person's cancer has a unique signature that can be derived from the tumor after it has been removed. The company refers to these vaccines as its Prophage Series, the lead drug candidate in the series, Oncophage, is the first personalized cancer vaccine to receive

    FDA

   fast track status, and is being developed to treat kidney and skin cancers. Agenus is also developing viral vaccines and QS-21 Stimulon, an improved vaccine adjuvant to make vaccines more effective.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Key products include the Checkpoint Antibody Program (acquired), HSP Platform (heat shock proteins, includes the Prophage series and herpes vaccine candidate HerpV), and Saponin Platform (QS-21).
  </p>
  <p>
   Russia is the only place where Oncophage is marketed; regulatory authorities there approved the vaccine for use in kidney cancer patients to prevent recurrence of the disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   The European Medicines Agency denied approval of the drug and the FDA has called for further testing of Oncophage. The company continues to conduct studies on its effectiveness and remains hopeful that Oncophage and the rest of the Prophage Series will be approved in the US and other markets. Other indications being tested for treatment by the Prophage Series include cancer affecting the central nervous system and brain cancer. On a much smaller scale the company has studied Prophage Series vaccines for treatment of melanoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of Agenus' other candidates, its QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant candidate is derived from plant compounds instead of aluminum-based compounds like most existing vaccine adjuvants. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to enhance their effectiveness and QS-21 seems to be better at stimulating an antibody response than vaccine adjuvants already in use. Agenus has licensed QS-21 to several other vaccine developers, including

   and a subsidiary of

   .

  <p>
   The company manufactures its candidates for clinical trials at its facility in Massachusetts. It makes Oncophage in Russia and had R&amp;D facilities in Switzerland and Germany.

  <p>
   Agenus partners with manufacturer NewVac to produce Oncophage in Russia, the only market where it's approved for sale.

  <p>
   Given that the company has one product marketed in one region, it has to count on licensing, supply, and collaborative revenue to keep it afloat. Agenus has incurred net losses of about $650 million since its inception in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue plummeted in 2013 after the company recorded an unusual $12 million license payment from GSK in the 2012. The following year revenue returned to around $3 million. Expenses, including R&amp;D spending, continued unabated resulting in a $30 million net loss and $19 million cash used in operations after $1 million positive cash flow in 2012.

  <p>
   The company is depending upon the formation of additional licensing and development partnerships, as well as the successful commercialization of Oncophage or one of its other candidates for its future success. To that end, in 2014 it partnered with Merck to develop cancer treatments and in 2013 with PharmLogix for the use of Stimulon to develop vaccines for addiction, allergies, and lung diseases.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 Agenus purchased 4-Antibody AG, a European biopharmaceutical company with operations in Switzerland and Germany. The acquisition gave Agenus its Checkpoint Antibody Program, among other candidates. Late the following year, it bought PhosImmune, a firm that has discovered a new portfolio of cancer neoantigens, for $2.5 million in cash and $7.4 million in Agenus shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in early 2016 acquired an antibody manufacturing pilot plant and capabilities from

   , expanding its own production abilities (and lessening its dependence on contract manufacturing organizations).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company changed its name from Antigenics to Agenus in early 2011 to reflect its broadening development portfolio and its increasing number of partnerships.
