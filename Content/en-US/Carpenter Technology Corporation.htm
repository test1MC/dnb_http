   This Carpenter works with metal, not wood. Carpenter Technology processes basic raw materials such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, and titanium to make various corrosion-resistant materials. Most sales come from stainless steel products and alloys that provide special heat- or wear-resistance or special magnetic or conductive properties. Finished products come in billet, bar, rod, wire, and other forms. Carpenter also produces certain metal powders. Markets include aerospace, automotive, medical, and industrial companies. Aerospace and defense accounted for 54% of its total sales in fiscal 2016 (June year end).

   The company manufactures, fabricates, and distributes specialty metals. Its three operating segments were Specialty Alloys Operations (premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations), Latrobe (the manufacturing and distribution operations of the Latrobe businesses acquired in 2012), and Performance Engineered Products (including Dynamet titanium, Carpenter Powder Products, Amega West and the Specialty Steel Supply distribution business that was gained in connection with the
   <company id="162360">
    Latrobe Specialty Metals
   </company>
   acquisition).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carpenter changed its reportable segments in 2014 to reflect the completion of the integration of the Latrobe Specialty Metals businesses. As a result Carpenter has two reportable segments, Specialty Alloys Operations and Performance Engineered Products.

   In fiscal 2016 net revenue was $1.81 billion, down 19% on 2015 due to decreased sales from Specialty Alloys Operations and Performance Engineered Products segments.Specialty Alloys Operations' sales decreased by18% reflecting a 13% drop in shipment volume stemming from weakness in the Energy and Industrial and Consumer markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Engineered Products Segment sales decreased 28% due to weak energy market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was $11.3 million, decreased by 81% in fiscal 2016 due to lower net sales and the presence of goodwill impairment.

  <p>
   Carpenter grows through strategic partnerships, organic expansion, and complementary acquisitions. In 2015 the company announced that a leading European aerospace engine maker approved Carpenter's manufacture of a nickel-based high-temperature alloy at its new superalloy powder manufacturing facility in Athens, Alabama.

  <p>
   As part of a restructuring plan, Carpenter expects to yield $30 million of annual fixed overhead cost savings. The restructuring plan includes cutting the company's salaried positions by 10%.

  <p>
   Expanding its supply position, in 2013 the company signed a multi-level agreement with
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies Corporation
   </company>
   , through its
   <company id="99062">
    Pratt &amp; Whitney
   </company>
   Division. The deal includes the production of superalloy powders (and associated licensing technology) and a long-term supply agreement. Carpenter plans to build a $20 million superalloy powder facility. Additionally, UTC's aerospace business units (Pratt &amp; Whitney, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Corp., UTC Aerospace Systems and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation) have agreed to purchase alloy steel bar/billet, nickel superalloy billet, stainless bar/billet, and strip laminate products from Carpenter for a period of ten years. Carpenter currently supplies UTC's aerospace businesses with a portion of their overall demand for nickel, stainless, and strip laminate products.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also signed a supply deal to provide
   <company id="41834">
    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   with advanced technology materials used in the manufacture of jet engine components, including rings, blades, vanes, and airfoils. Demand for the material will be generated by Rolls-Royce in the UK and the US, and its global suppliers. Materials in support of this program will be manufactured at Carpenter's Reading, Pennsylvania, and Athens, Alabama, specialty steelmaking facilities.

   Engineer James Henry Carpenter founded Carpenter Steel in Pennsylvania in 1889. The company began making specialty steels after winning a US Navy contract to develop armor-piercing projectiles. Business declined after Carpenter's death in 1898, but former rival Robert Jennings took over and the company rebounded, thanks to marketing savvy and the development of new steel grades. Carpenter first produced stainless steel in 1917. The company went public in 1937.
