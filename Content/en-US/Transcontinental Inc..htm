  <p>
   The company's revenue decreased $2 billion in fiscal 2013 down to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2014. The drop primarily resulted from lower advertising revenues. TC Transcontinental posted a net income of $105.1 million in fiscal 2014. That was an imrpovement compared to the net loss of $23 million the company claimed in fiscal 2013). The improved net income picture was due to decreased operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2014 TC Transcontinental's operating cash decreased to $335 million compared to $416 million in fiscal 2013.
