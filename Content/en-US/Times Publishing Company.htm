   The times may be a-changing, but Times Publishing still prints the
   <i>
    St. Petersburg Times,
   </i>
   one of the most respected regional newspapers in the US. Founded in 1884, the
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   boasts a daily circulation of about 300,000 in the Tampa Bay area and plays the role of archrival to
   <i>
    The Tampa Tribune,
   </i>
   owned by
   <company id="12141">
    Media General
   </company>
   . Times Publishing also operates local news and information website TampaBay.com and runs fact checking website PolitiFact. Affiliated units include monthly business magazine
   <em>
    Florida Trend
   </em>
   and community newspaper publisher Tampa Bay Newspapers. Times Publishing is controlled through a holding company by the
   <company id="107699">
    Poynter Institute
   </company>
   , a not-for-profit school of journalism in St. Petersburg.

  <p>
   With tough economic times and declining readership hitting the newspaper industry, Times Publishing has been shedding various publishing operations in order to cut costs and focus on improving the financial performance of its big city paper.

  <p>
   The St. Petersburg Times was started as the West Hillsborough Times, adopting its present masthead in 1892. Paul Poynter acquired the paper in 1912 and eventually passed control to his son Nelson Poynter, who built the Times into an important force in journalism. The newspaper business was willed to the Poynter Institute upon his death in 1978.
