   Dacor designs, makes, and distributes clean-lined upscale stoves, grills, dishwashers, refrigerators, ventilation equipment, and other cooking appliances and accessories. The manufacturer, which boasts showrooms in Atlanta, San Francisco, Chicago, and Baltimore, also peddles its products through specialty appliance retailers nationwide. Stan Joseph, who later founded Dacor with his wife Florence in 1965, created the first complete kitchen ventilation system, which became an essential feature of modern homes by the late 1950s. The company is still owned by the Joseph family; however, in 2016,

   agreed to acquire Dacor in a deal valued at $150 million.

   Dacor is a leading maker and marketer of upscale appliances. The company offers a complete line of American-made, luxury kitchen appliances, such as wall ovens, ranges, cooktops, dishwashers, warming drawers, microwaves, ventilation hoods, refrigerators, wine coolers, and outdoor appliances. It was the industry's first company to introduce an outdoor grill with built-in halogen lights.

   Increasingly popular with consumers, warming drawers and chic ventilation hoods are as much part of Dacor's product lines as its cooking appliances. With its Preference dishwasher collection, Dacor has focused on colored dishwashers -- with names such as Blue Water, Slate Green, and Anthracite Gray -- in response to its customers wanting more custom looks. With its Preference, Epicure, Millennia, and Integrated lines, Dacor is doing its best to compete with kitchen appliance behemoths the likes of

   and

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Dacor regularly rolls out new products, many of which incorporate the latest technologies. The company in 2014 launched the Discovery iQ 48" Dual-Fuel Range, which is the industry's first to feature an integrated, wirelessly-connected tablet.
