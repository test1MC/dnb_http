  <p>
   The company operates through six segments: Defense and Security Electronics, Helicopters, Aeronautics, Transportation, Defense Systems, Space, and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Helicopter segment works through
   <company id="132809">
    AgustaWestland
   </company>
   , which boasts expertise in all aspects of helicopter production, including avionics, flight control, and mission management systems. Aeronautics' main unit is Alenia Aermacchi, a maker of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and aerostructures as well as military and civilian aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Transportation segment provides rail and metro signaling and traffic monitoring systems, AnsaldoBreda (rail and metro rolling stock), and bus maker BredaMenarinbus. Defense Systems concentrates on missile systems, torpedoes, naval artillery, and armored vehicles. The Space segment offers satellite management through Telespazio and produces satellite systems through Thales Alenia Space. Both units are joint ventures with

   Amid worldwide defense budget cuts, Leonardo - Finmeccanica is looking to seek new markets for its defense technology capabilities. These include security, environmental monitoring and protection, cyber security, and smart cities. By segment, the company is looking to the civil aircraft market for growth in Aeronautics. The Space segment is also optimistic about growth in the civilian sector. While governments are cutting back on defense, they continue to increase demand for satellite operations. And despite cuts in defense spending, Leonardo - Finmeccanica expects that its defense operations will enjoy demand as emerging markets upgrade their fleets, among other factors. The company's defense operations are also poised to meet more demand for lighter and more easily maneuverable land vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the years 2015 through 2019, Leonardo - Finmeccanica is focused on increasing investments and activities in research and development within the fields of aerospace, defense, and security; improving and innovating its product portfolio; and reinforcing its international presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company changed its name to Leonardo (it's using Leonardo - Finmeccanica on an interim basis). It restructured that year and wanted a new name to reflect the change, choosing Leonardo after famed inventor/artist Leonardo da Vinci.
