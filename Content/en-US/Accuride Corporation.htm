   Accuride operates through three operating segments that design, manufacture, and distribute components for the commercial vehicle market, including heavy- and medium-duty trucks, commercial trailers, light trucks, buses, as well as specialty and military vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wheels segment (57% of sales) makes steel and aluminum wheels, while Gunite (24%) makes wheel-end components and assemblies. The Brillion Iron Works segment (19%) consists of ductile, austempered ductile and gray iron castings, including engine and transmission components and industrial components.

  <p>
   Accuride's revenues climbed 10% from $643 million in 2013 to $705 million in 2014. The revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by upticks in sales across all its segments: Brillion Iron Works (21%), Gunite (1%), and Wheels (10%). The Wheels segment increased primarily due to additional combined volume for the three major OEM segments, offset by a reduction in pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has suffered five straight years of net losses; however, from 2013 to 2014 its annual net loss shrank from $38 million to $2 million mainly due to an absence of impairment charges and other intangibles.

  <p>
   Accuride has plans to add to its Mexico facility to serve companies with truck assembly operations in Mexico. It is also improving its service markets in South America to mitigate swings in the North American commercial vehicle industry. Additionally, it has an eye on Asia and Europe for opportunities for the manufacture of steel and aluminum wheels.

  <p>
   Accuride in late 2015 improved its position in Europe with the purchase of steel wheel manufacturer Gianetti Ruote S.r.l. The deal gave Accuride immediate long-term supply contracts with key global OEM customers in Europe and advanced Accuride's strategy to become a major wheel supplier to the global commercial vehicle industry.
