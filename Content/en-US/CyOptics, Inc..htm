   CyOptics sees its way clear to optical networks. The company makes optical subcomponents based on indium phosphide (InP) -- a compound semiconductor that runs faster than silicon, the material in most microchips. Its products, including lasers, detectors, and transmitters, are used primarily in communications networking equipment, but also by the aerospace and defense sector, among others. CyOptics also offers silica-on-silicon fabrication, as well as packaging, assembly, and test services. Founded in 1999, the company was acquired by chip maker Avago Technologies (later renamed
   <company id="144560">
    Broadcom Limited
   </company>
   ) in 2013.

   In 2013 Singapore-based chip maker Avago Technologies purchased CyOptics for about $377 million in cash. The deal strengthened Avago's fiber optics product portfolio and also help it build a complementary optical components business.
