   In Japanese
   <i>
    mitsubishi
   </i>
   means "three diamonds" and Mitsubishi Corporation is one of Japan's crown jewels. The
   <i>
    sogo shosha
   </i>
   , or trading company, operates through six main business groups: living essentials (agricultural products, food and beverages, textiles, and construction materials); metals; machinery (power generation equipment, electrical systems, automobiles); energy (liquefied natural gas, crude oil); and chemicals (petrochemicals, fertilizers, plastics). Its other main business group is industrial finance, which handles banking, asset management, construction, and logistics. The company generated most of its fiscal 2012 gross profit from living essentials (42%), metals (24%), and machinery (16%).

   Yataro Iwasaki's close ties to the Japanese government (along with subsidies and monopoly rights) ensured the success of his shipping and trading company, Mitsubishi. Founded in 1870, Mitsubishi diversified into mining (1873), banking (1885), and shipbuilding (1887); it began to withdraw from shipping in the 1880s. During the next decade it invested in Japanese railroads and property.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1918 the Mitsubishi
   <i>
    zaibatsu
   </i>
   (conglomerate) spun off its central management arm, Mitsubishi Trading (the forerunner of Mitsubishi Corporation). By WWII the group was a huge amalgam of divisions and public companies. During the war it made warplanes, ships, explosives, and beer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <i>
    zaibatsu
   </i>
   were dissolved by US occupation forces, and Mitsubishi was split into 139 entities. After the occupation, the Japanese government encouraged many of the former business groups to reunite around the old
   <i>
    zaibatsu
   </i>
   banks. In 1954 Mitsubishi Trading became the leader of the Mitsubishi Group and established Mitsubishi International (US), which became a leading exporter of US goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1964 merger of three Mitsubishi companies created
   <company id="52292">
    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
   </company>
   , a top Japanese maker of ships, aircraft, plants, and heavy machinery. Mitsubishi Kasei, separated from Asahi Glass and Mitsubishi Rayon by a US fiat, became Japan's #1 chemical concern.
   <company id="52289">
    Mitsubishi Electric
   </company>
   emerged as one of the country's leading electrical equipment and electronics manufacturers. In 1971
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   invested in
   <company id="52288">
    Mitsubishi Motors
   </company>
   , which began making cars for the US automaker. That year Mitsubishi Trading was renamed Mitsubishi Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the 1980s Japan seemed economically invincible. Then its "bubble economy" burst. The group fell behind in electronics and autos in the US, consumer demand dried up at home, and Mitsubishi Bank was left with a heavy burden of bad loans. Group members, which traditionally provided materials, supplies, and sales outlets for each other, began loosening old
   <i>
    keiretsu
   </i>
   ties during Japan's recession of the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Chrysler sold its stock in Mitsubishi Motors, and two years later the companies severed production ties. This loss and declining demand in the US for Mitsubishi cars hurt auto sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitsubishi Bank merged with Bank of Tokyo in 1996 to form the biggest bank in the world, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM). In 1997 several Mitsubishi companies admitted paying off a corporate racketeer, setting off a wave of executive resignations.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 BTM had tumbled from the top spot and was unable to keep the money freely flowing to fellow Mitsubishi members.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hit hard by the Asian economic crisis, all the struggling Mitsubishi companies had to look outside of the
   <i>
    keiretsu
   </i>
   for help. In 1999 Mitsubishi Motors found a foreign partner,
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   , for its truck making operations. Mitsubishi Oil merged with an outsider, Nippon Oil, to form Nippon Mitsubishi Oil (later renamed
   <company id="52297">
    Nippon Oil
   </company>
   ). In 2000 DaimlerChrysler (now Chrysler and
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler
   </company>
   ) acquired a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors for $2.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Executives at Mitsubishi Motors were charged in 2001 after they allegedly kept the lid on thousands of reported defects in Mitsubishi cars instead of issuing recalls. Stung by this and the after-effects of scandals from the previous decade, Mitsubishi unveiled a new corporate philosophy as part of a strategy to revive the group's reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Mitsubishi disbanded its information technology and electronics business unit. The unit's operations were divided between the new business and machinery groups. In 2004 the company formed an alliance with
   <company id="10634">
    GE Yokogawa Medical Systems
   </company>
   (GEYMS) to provide GEYMS with help in developing its presence in the Japanese diagnostic imaging market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company formed a food distribution joint venture with five Japanese food wholesalers, comprising national wholesaler Meidi-ya and four regional companies. The joint venture, called Alliance Network, became one of Japan's largest food wholesalers. Mitsubishi had a 51% stake in Alliance Network. Later in 2004 Mitsubishi acquired the food, beverage additive, and pharmaceutical active and excipient businesses of
   <company id="10135">
    Ashland Distribution
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Mitsubishi bolstered its automotive operations when it acquired shares in
   <company id="41753">
    Isuzu
   </company>
   from General Motors; Mitsubishi ended up with a 10% stake in Isuzu. Mitsubishi and Isuzu soon after formed a European joint venture to market light-duty trucks throughout the continent. Later that year Mitsubishi bought the Avon Automotive subsidiary of
   <company id="93530">
    Avon Rubber
   </company>
   in a deal worth $120 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Mitsubishi bought majority control of Nosan Corporation, a manufacturer of livestock feed. In late 2007 the company acquired the majority interest in Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the medical health care front, Mitsubishi shifted the focus of certain of its subsidiaries to providing services to hospitals and nursing care facilities. It established the Trinity Healthcare Fund in 2007 to provide management support for the restructuring of hospitals and other medical institutions. Other Mitsubishi subsidiaries focused on medical services include ProCure, which is a medical equipment wholesale distributor and Apprecia, which provides hospital construction consulting services.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2007 the group began investing in energy-related assets as part of this strategy. It acquired nearly 40% of Encore Energy Pte., which in turn owns 51% of Medco Energy, an Indonesian oil and gas concern. The deal was valued at about $350 million and gave Mitsubishi a 20% stake in Medco. Mitsubishi was already working with Medco on an Indonesian gas plant, and the two companies plan to pursue further international energy partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 it entered the solar energy business, buying 34% of a subsidiary of Spanish renewable energy firm
   <company id="61051">
    Acciona SA
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitsubishi in 2010 it merged subsidiaries Mitsubishi Corporation Unimetals and Mitsubishi Shoji Light Metal Sales Corporation. The resulting company was named Mitsubishi Corporation Unimetals and remained a subsidiary of Mitsubishi. The merger was made to concentrate the company's management expertise in the non-ferrous metals industry.
