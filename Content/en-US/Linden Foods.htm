   Linden Foods targets a broad customer base that spans retail chain stores (as well as their convenience food manufacturers), catering and foodservice operators, and the general meat packing industry.

  <p>
   Its plans to grow include investing in meat plant and equipment. Manufacturing improvements enable the meat processor to cut costs and increase its lineup from whole carcasses and retail packs to individual portions of steak cuts and other specialty meats, such as extra-matured beef and gourmet burgers and veal. Among its introductions, Linden foods launched Banquet Royale Rose Veal, an alternative to traditional white veal for restaurants demanding quality coupled with ethical rearing and finishing of calves.
