  <p>
   Experiencing a rise in its customer base within the Northern borders of the UK, ICS Cool Energy in 2015 expanded its position in Scotland by moving to a larger office while also opening a Scottish depot. With the move, the company is aiming to improve lead times for those customers situated in and around Scotland.

  <p>
   ICS Cool Energy expands its core offerings through the use of acquisitions. In 2014 the company acquired MTA UK, a specialist in compressed air and gas treatment products. The acquisition gave ICS Cool Energy a broader focus on the OEM market and additional expertise in the compressed air treatment field.
