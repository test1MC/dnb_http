   Through subsidiaries, Diploma PLC operates in three segments: life sciences, seals, and controls. Its life sciences business makes consumable laboratory items and instrumentation and provides services for the health care and environmental industries. Its seals unit manufactures hydraulic seals, gaskets and cylinders for forklifts, dump trucks and other heavy construction machinery. The company's controls segment makes wiring, connectors, fasteners, and control devices for the aerospace/defense, medical, motorsport, and rail and power markets. Once focused in the UK, Diploma has expanded to Australia, Canada, Germany, and the US. Indeed, North America accounts for roughly half of total sales.

   Diploma's revenues increased 7% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to additional revenue from acquisitions.

  <p>
   Diploma has achieved revenue growth over the years through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 Diploma obtained Rutin AG, a Swiss non-trading holding company of the Kubo Group of companies based in Switzerland and Austria. Kubo is a supplier of seals, O-rings, gaskets and molded rubber parts to a large and diverse base of industrial customers in Switzerland and Austria.

   In 2014 Diploma acquired 80% of Technopath (Distribution), a supplier of products to the biotechnology, clinical laboratory, medical markets in Ireland and the UK. The deal extended the scope of Diploma's health care businesses into the markets of Ireland and the UK, as well as added important new products and suppliers to its network.
