  <p>
   Baldor is focused on organic growth through new product development, especially in the area of energy-efficient motors. On average, it releases 250 new products per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent company ABB is looking to boost its presence in North America and strengthen its position in the market for energy-efficient products, which is expected to grow as new energy efficiency legislation goes into effect in the US. Baldor's electric motors and mechanical transmission product lines, along with its established industrial customer base, fit well with ABB's energy-efficient drives and complementary motor products. Baldor also aims to expand internationally using the global customer base and strong channel sales organization of the Swiss conglomerate.
