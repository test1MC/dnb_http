  <p>
   Net sales of the company have seen an upward trend since 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 net sales increased by 6% due to higher North America and Greater China revenues partially offset by decreased sales from Emerging Markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, North America revenues increased primarily due to growth in its Sportswear, Jordan Brand and Running categories. Direct-To-Consumer revenues grew fueled by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores. and comparable store sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currency-neutral footwear revenue growth was attributable to higher revenues in most key categories, led by the Jordan Brand, Sportswear, Running and Women's Training. Apparel revenue growth was driven by its Sportswear and Men's Training categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has also moved upward since 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net income increased by 15% due to higher sales.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Phil Knight, a good miler, and Bill Bowerman, a track coach who tinkered with shoe designs, met at the University of Oregon in 1957. The two men formed Blue Ribbon Sports in 1962 in an effort to make quality American running shoes. The next year they began selling Tiger shoes, manufactured by Japanese shoe manufacturer Onitsuka Tiger. They sold the running shoes out of cars at track meets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company rebranded as NIKE in 1972, named for the Greek goddess of victory. The NIKE "Swoosh" logo was designed by a graduate student named Carolyn Davidson, who was paid $35. The same year NIKE broke with Onitsuka in a dispute over distribution rights.
  </p>
  <p>
   NIKE re-evaluated its long-term growth strategy in fiscal 2012 and, as a result, divested its Cole Haan and Umbro businesses in February 2013 and November 2012, respectively. NIKE sold Umbro to Iconix Brand Group for $225 million. The company sold Cole Haan to London-based private equity firm Apax Partners for $570 million.
