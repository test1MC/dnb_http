   Siam Cement has more to hold it together than its name suggests. It still makes cement (sold under the Elephant and Tiger brands), but gets most of its sales from petrochemicals, paper, and packaging; other lines of business include building products and distribution. Siam Cement also has real estate holdings. The company cracked out of its cement mold in response to Asia's financial crisis of the late 1990s; acquisitions made it one of Thailand's biggest industrial conglomerates, with five business units encompassing more than 100 companies. The government controls almost a third of Siam Cement.

  <p>
   Siam Cement operates in three segments: SCG Chemicals, SCG Cement-Building Materials, and SCG Paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCG Chemicals (50% of Siam Cement's 2014 revenues) makes and sells olefins, polyolefins, and other chemical products.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCG Cement-Building Materials (37% of revenues) makes and sells grey cement, ready-mixed concrete, white cement, dry mortar, roof tiles, concrete paving blocks, ceramic tiles, sanitary wares and sanitary fittings. It distributes cement, building and decorative products through distributors, and imports fuel products, waste paper, and scrap iron.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCG Paper (13%) is engaged in manufacture and sale of pulp, printing and writing paper, gypsum linerboard, kraft paper, corrugated boxes, and securities documents.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in ASEAN countries -- Thailand, China, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Thailand accounted for 60% of Siam Cement's revenues in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its products through the internet, including e-mail and social media.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Siam Cement's revenues increased by 12% (in local currency) in 2014 due to an 18% increase in SCG Chemicals, 6% in SCG Cement-Building Materials, and 9% in SCG Paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth in SCG Chemicals sales was due to higher sales volume in polyolefin; SCG Cement-Building Materials sales increased due to the 2013 acquisition of Prime Group, a ceramic tiles producer in Vietnam, including the increase of share portions in Siam Sanitary Ware and The Siam Sanitary Fittings Co.; and SCG Paper revenues increased due to higher sales volume in both the Packaging Chain and the Fibrous Chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siam Cement's net income decreased by 8% in 2014 due to higher cost of sales and selling and administrative segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash flow increased by 11%.

  <p>
   The company focuses on organic growth in all its segments. It also makes selected acquisitions to expand its capacity and technical know how.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand for building materials in ASEAN has seen a steady growth driven by the expansion of the construction sector in the region, especially Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia where the governments promoted scores of large-scale infrastructure projects. These projects include the special economic zone development project in Myanmar, the new airport construction project in Hanoi, Vietnam, the deep sea port construction project in Cambodia, and the construction of roads and rail lines to connect major cities in the region.

  <p>
   In 2017 Siam Cement acquire Vietnam Construction Material (cement operations in central Vietnam) for about $440 million.

  <p>
   In addition to the acquisition of a 90% stake in PT Indoris Printingdo, a high-value added packaging manufacturer in Indonesia with an annual capacity of 8,000 tons, in 2014, the company acquired Silathai Sanguan, which operates a crushing plant in Thailand; 55% of Panel World Co., Ltd., which operates cement-bonded particleboard in Thailand; 51% of Norner Holding, a leading Norway-based innovation and technology firm, specializing in material and polymer industries; and D-In-Pack Company Limited, which converts sheet boards to boxes and caters in Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Siam Cement formed a joint venture with Florim Ceramiche S.p.A of Italy (with SCG Cement-Building Materials holding a 33% stake) to establish a plant to manufacture high-end ceramic tiles with an annual output capacity of 5 million square meters.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired Prime Group, a major ceramic tiles producer in Vietnam.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a 2011 deal to enhance Siam Cement's presence in the Indonesian market, the company acquired majority stakes in two firms, Keramika Indonesia Asosiasi Tbk (94%) and Kokoh Inti Arebama Tbk (70%). Keramika is a ceramics manufacturer, while Kokoh is a nationwide distributor of building materials. The transaction fits Siam Cement's strategy of acquiring assets that mesh closely with its existing business units. Also in 2011, it acquired Vietnam-based Alcamax Packaging for about $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siam Cement has made major progress in its expansion in Southeast Asia, including the 2009 opening of a $185 million packaging paper plant in Vietnam. In 2010 Siam Cement acquired New Asia Industries Company, Vietnam's leading producer and distributor of corrugated containers, for $30 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siam Cement is putting its money where the petrochemicals and packaging paper companies are. The company in 2006 formed a partnership with
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   to build a plastics manufacturing facility that began operations in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thailand's first cement manufacturer, Siam Cement was founded in 1913 on orders from King Rama VI.
