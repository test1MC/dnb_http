   Svenska Cellulosa (SCA) is one of the world's largest paper and forestry enterprises. Its products include toilet paper (including the Velvet brand), baby and adult diapers, and hygiene products. Its forest group churns out paper (including newsprint), pulp, and timber. In Europe it is a leading maker of facial tissue, toilet paper, personal care products, and it is a global leader in incontinence products. The group owns more than 2.6 million hectares (about 6.4 million acres) of timberland in Sweden. It develops, produces, and markets products in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCA) was formed in 1929 when Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger acquired the forestry industry holdings of
   <company id="92023">
    Svenska Handelsbanken
   </company>
   , then Sweden's largest bank. Kreuger also bought several hydroelectric power stations, which served as power sources for Kreuger's pulp and paper operations. SCA acted as a holding company for nine pulp companies that operated as separate entities. In 1933 Kreuger committed suicide; Handelsbanken regained control of SCA, but quickly turned it over to Axel Wenner-Gren (founder of vacuum company
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   ) the following year. Also in 1934 SCA added a tenth company to its ranks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Displeased with the company's performance under Wenner-Gren, and concerned with US threats to place SCA on a trade blacklist because of Wenner-Gren's suspected affiliation with the Nazis, Svenska Handelsbanken regained control of SCA in 1941. In 1943 SCA sold one of its hydroelectric companies to improve its financial position.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCA benefited from high paper prices following WWII and, after getting out of debt, began trading its shares on the Stockholm bourse in 1950. That year Axel Enstrom became the president of SCA and began to consolidate the operations of its subsidiaries, creating a single forest company by 1954.
  </p>
  <p>
   Traditionally a pulp and sawn timber producer, SCA started producing paper, kraftliner, and corrugated board during the 1950s and 1960s. The 1970s marked continued expansion in the company's corrugated board and kraftliner operations as the company gained part-ownership of companies in Germany, Ireland, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appointed president of SCA in 1972, Bo Rydin led the company's expansion into value-added fiber-based products. In 1975 SCA purchased Molnlycke, a maker of disposable hygiene products, which was a main factor in the company's decreased dependence on paper and pulp products in the 1980s and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCA bought Peaudouce, a leading French disposable diaper company, in 1988, and Sverker Martin-Lof took the helm of SCA. Martin-Lof expanded SCA's corrugated board business by purchasing Italcarta (Italy) and similar companies. In 1990 the company purchased UK-based Reedpack (corrugated boxes and newsprint), and in 1992 it divested its hydroelectric operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCA purchased 75% of Germany-based PWA, a paper and packaging company, in 1995. Two years later SCA began a buying spree of hygiene and packaging companies in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (totaling 29 acquisitions by 2000). The company entered into a joint venture with papermaker
   <company id="42944">
    Holmen
   </company>
   in 1999 to form a fine-paper company (Modo Paper) with plans to divest its share later. The following year SCA sold its share in Modo to Metsa-Serla and purchased Metsa-Serla's corrugated board operations. SCA also purchased
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   's incontinence business in the US and Canada that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 the company announced more than $1 billion worth of acquisition deals, most notably the purchase of
   <company id="10648">
    Georgia-Pacific
   </company>
   's industrial tissue operations for $850 million. It also bought US-based packaging system company Tuscarora for about $284 million including debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2002 SCA expanded its tissue market share with the acquisition of Italian tissue maker CartoInvest for about $470 million including debt. That July, the company also sold its 51% stake in German liquid packaging company Zewathener to DS Smith plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company purchased Asia-based diaper company Drypers for about $90 million in 2004. The Drypers brand is the market leader in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. It also repeatedly increased its stake in Central Package Group (Cenpak) until it owned the entire business. Most of Cenpak's packaging business is in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group has also expanded its operations in Australasia and Mexico by acquiring
   <company id="127249">
    Carter Holt Harvey
   </company>
   's tissue operations and some of its personal care businesses in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2007 the company began exiting noncore markets. In the last few years SCA has axed about 3,600 jobs in Europe as part of a cost-cutting program. Early in 2007 Svenska Cellulosa sold its
   <company id="14961">
    North American packaging operations
   </company>
   to
   <company id="135708">
    Metalmark Capital
   </company>
   for $400 million. It also sold its Softis brand to an Italian tissue company named Sofidel. Approval for the Procter &amp; Gamble deal was contingent upon SCA divesting itself of certain handkerchief interests in Germany and Austria, per instructions by the European Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCA started an operational restructuring effort in 2008, which gained momentum under its new CEO Jan Johansson. The company coordinated efforts to trim SCA's specialty packaging operations in order to give hygiene products greater investment attention. By mid-year demand in the European packaging market was in sharp decline; product sales for the company dropped 10%. The company moved to divest or consolidate its conventional corrugated production operations in the UK and Ireland, and accelerated the closing of its New Hythe containerboard mill. By 2009 it closed 10 more corrugated board mills throughout Western Europe, as well as make staff cuts of some 2,000 workers, adding to the 1,000 job cuts made in 2008. SCA implemented price increases for its products, as well.
