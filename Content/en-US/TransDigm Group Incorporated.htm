   TransDigm's aviation components transcend any single airframe. Operating through several subsidiaries, TransDigm Group makes and distributes a wide range of components for commercial and military aircraft. Subsidiaries include AeroControlex (mechanical controls, pumps, valves), Adams Rite Aerospace (cockpit security products, electromechanical controls, interior latches and locks), Marathon Norco Aerospace (batteries, connectors), and Champion Aerospace (ignition systems and components). TransDigm estimates that its products are installed on about 95,000 transport, military, and general aviation aircraft.

  <p>
   TransDigm operates through three segments: Airframe (46% of total sales), Power and Control (51%), and Non-aviation (3%). Other subsidiaries include ADS/Transcoil (LCDs, clocks, transducers, brushless motors), Adel Wiggins (clamps, connectors, heaters, refueling systems), and Avionic Instruments (power conversion equipment).
  </p>
  <p>
   Additional subsidiaries include Avtech, which makes flight deck PA systems and cabin lighting and power products; Bruce Aerospace, which offers aircraft interior, exterior, and emergency lighting; CDA InterCorp, a maker of actuators, motors, and gears; and Skurka Aerospace, which provides electric motors, generators, speed transducers, and tachometers.

  <p>
   TransDigm manufactures its products in Belgium, China, Germany, Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the UK, and the US. Each year around 65% of its sales are generated from the US. It has almost 55 manufacturing facilities.

  <p>
   The company sells its products thorough a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts. Its major distributors are Aviall (a subsidiary of Boeing) and Satair (a subsidiary of Airbus).

  <p>
   TransDigm has enjoyed significant growth over the last five years. Revenues jumped 17% from $2.7 billion in 2015 to peak at $3.2 billion in 2016, a historic milestone for the company. The growth for 2016 was driven by increased sales across its Power and Control (22%), Airframe (13%), and Non-aviation (6%) segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Power and Control's growth was driven by a 24% spike in additional sales from acquisitions. Airframe's growth was fueled by a 5% bump in commercial aftermarket sales and a 5% spike in OEM sales. The Non-aviation segment growth was fueled by additional OEM sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits for TransDigm surged 31% from $447 million in 2015 to a record-setting $586 million in 2016. This was primarily due to its historic revenue growth coupled with reduced refinancing costs recorded during the year. After declining the previous year, TransDigm's operating cash flow increased from $521 million in 2015 to $669 million in 2016.

  <p>
   Strategically, TransDigm focuses on specialized products rather than commodities. Most of the company's sales come from proprietary products for which TransDigm owns the design and/or is the sole-source provider for a particular aircraft. And although the company grows organically through contracts for work on next-generation aircraft, such as the

   </company>
   A380 and the Boeing 787, the company's acquisitions have fueled its significant growth.

  <p>
   TransDigm acquires companies that offer niche products that fit well with other subsidiary operations or have significant aftermarket sales. In 2016 it purchased Data Device Corporation, a maker of databus and power controls products, for $1 billion. It expects the deal to enhance its presence across major military aircraft platforms and accelerate its growing presence on commercial aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company also completed the acquisition of
   <company id="11499">
    Breeze-Eastern
   </company>
   , a pioneer in the manufacturing of proprietary rescue hoists, winches, cargo hooks, and weapons-handling systems equipment, for $206 million in cash. Breeze-Eastern operates as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TransDigm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also made several key acquisitions throughout 2015. That year it acquired PneuDraulics -- a manufacturer of proprietary, highly engineered aerospace pneumatic and hydraulic components and subsystems for commercial transport, regional, business jet and military applications -- for $324 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it also picked up the aerospace business of Pexco for a total purchase price of approximately $496 million in cash. Pexco Aerospace manufactures extruded plastic interior parts for use in the commercial aerospace industry. TransDigm also bought the aerospace business of Franke Aquarotter GmbH, a manufacturer of proprietary faucets and related products for use on commercial transports and regional jets, for approximately $75 million in cash.
