   The Russians have come to the North American steel market in the form of Evraz Inc. NA. The company is the North American unit of Russian steel giant
   <company id="151280">
    Evraz
   </company>
   , and holds businesses acquired since 2006. Evraz Inc. NA consists of tubular goods producer Evraz Oregon Steel Tubular, steel plate manufacturer
   <company id="152660">
    Claymont Steel
   </company>
   , and Canadian steel tube operations that formerly had belonged to IPSCO. The company is North America's largest producer of large diameter pipe and steel rail, and the #2 producer of steel plate. It produces more than 5 million tons of flat, long, and tubular steel products every year for the infrastructure, defense, energy, and rail industries.

  <p>
   In 2014 net sales from Steel, North America contributed 24% of the total net sales of parent company
   <company id="151280">
    Evraz
   </company>
   as a result of higher sales volumes and improved pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from sales of construction products increased by 16% primarily due to higher sales volumes of beams produced by EVRAZ in Russia and resold in the American market by EVRAZ North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, revenues from tubular product sales increased by 18%, primarily as a result of a strong demand for large diameter line pipe and operational improvements implemented at EVRAZ North America's OCTG facilities.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 EVRAZ North America sold its structural tubing business (formerly known as Columbia Structural Steel) in Portland, Oregon to Maruichi Oregon Steel Tube, LLC, as it did not align with its strategic priorities.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company announced that it will make its largest single investment $200 million at its Regina, Saskatchewan plant.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 the company suspended operations at its steel mill in Claymont, Delaware, due to weak market demand and increased competition from imports. Evraz Inc. NA announced that it would consider restarting operations at the plant when market conditions improve.
  </p>
  <p>
   Evraz entered the North American market with the acquisition of Oregon Steel Mills in 2006 and has kept the acquisitions coming ever since. In mid-2008, when it closed the IPSCO deal, the company decided to gather all of these businesses under one umbrella -- thus the formation of Evraz Inc. NA.
