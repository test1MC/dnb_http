   Fitsco Industries would like to insert its products wherever its customers see fit. The company, founded in 1990, makes threaded inserts for use in metal, plastic, and wood and MDF (medium density fiberboard) products. Fitsco's products are marketed under names that include Heatfit (for use with thermoplastic material), Mouldfit (thermoplastic and thermoset), Pressfit (self broaching inserts), Rotofit (geared toward the roto-moulding industry) and Screwfit (self-tapping inserts). Fitsco can also make parts based on customers' own drawings. The company makes its fasteners in its manufacturing facility residing in the village of Eardington located in Shropshire, England.
