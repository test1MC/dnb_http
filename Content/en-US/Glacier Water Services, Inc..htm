Its machines, which are located in more than 40 US states and Canada, are connected to municipal water sources and are designed to reduce impurities in the water through processes such as micron filtration, reverse osmosis, carbon absorption, and ultraviolet disinfection. Glacier Water's machines are placed outside supermarkets and other stores. The company conducts business in Canada through subsidiary Gestion Bi-Eau Pure. In 2016 bottled water services company

   As it works to expand its portfolio of products and secure its foothold in the business of preparing and selling ice, Glacier Water Services in 2013 acquired certain assets of In-Store Bagging Machine Company. ISB makes proprietary in-store ice bagging machines that are designed specifically for placement in retail locations. The deal follows its 2012 purchase of the Aqua Fill water vending operation, which boosted its overall machine count to more than 23,000 in 46 US states and Canada.

  <p>
   An increase in machines on location (from the extra 1,600 Aqua Fill machines it purchased that year) helped Glacier Water Services post an 8% increase in revenue in fiscal 2012 to $111.9 million from $103.8 million in 2011. Also pumping up sales was growth in same-store productivity.
