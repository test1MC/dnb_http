   Intuitive Surgical brings an artistic flair to advanced surgical equipment. Employing haptics (the science of computer-aided touch sensitivity), the firm developed the da Vinci Surgical System, a combination of software, hardware, and optics that allows doctors to perform robotically aided surgery from a remote console. The da Vinci system reproduces the doctor's hand movements in real time, during minimally invasive surgery performed by tiny electromechanical arms and instruments. The company manufactures its systems and relies upon contract manufacturers to supply the instruments and accessories used with the systems.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The da Vinci system's oldest applications -- gynecological and urological procedures -- still account for the majority of da Vinci-assisted surgeries. (About 652,000 total procedures were performed in 2015.) Over time, the company has widened the system's applications to include cardiothoracic, transoral (head and neck), and general surgical procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with reducing trauma to the patient related to large incisions, Intuitive Surgical promotes its minimally invasive robotic systems as a means of increasing a surgeon's precision, intuitive control, range of motion, and vision during procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of the da Vinci systems made up 32% of revenues in 2015, while sales of instruments and accessories accounted for another 50% of sales. Intuitive Surgical also maintains relationships with (and earns additional revenues from) customers by providing system support and physician training services. These services accounted for nearly 20% of revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Intuitive Surgical sells its products in the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe; about 70% of sales come from its largest market, the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, where it has R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities as well as support and service operations. It also owns facilities in Norcross, Georgia; Aubonne, Switzerland; and Mexicali, Mexico. Intuitive Surgical leases R&amp;D and other facilities in Milford, Connecticut, and Blackburg, Virginia; it leases sales and operations facilities in Osaka, Japan, and Seoul.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Intuitive Surgical sells its products through a direct sales force in the US, Japan, South Korea, and most European countries (excluding Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). It uses independent distributors in other global markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hospitals can take several routes to obtain the big-ticket da Vinci systems. Some can plunk down the $1 million plus in cash, while others work with third-party leasing companies to spread the payments out over time. Once the system is in place, a hospital must continue to purchase replacement instruments and accessories from the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Distributors of the systems include Device Technologies, H. Strattner, Minogue Medical, UCIPharma, and Transmedic China.

  <p>
   The leading maker of surgical robots, Intuitive Surgical has seen strong growth in recent years as demand for less traumatic, minimally invasive surgical procedures has increased (with the exception of 2014). In 2015, revenue rose 12% to $2.3 billion as more systems, instruments, and accessories were sold. Service revenues also increased, as more customers used the da Vinci systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed revenue's trend and, in 2015, it increased 41% to $589 million. This was driven by the higher revenue plus a decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations followed suit, rising 16% to $772 million that year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Surgical robotics is a growing industry, expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Part of Intuitive Surgical's growth strategy is to introduce next-generation versions of the original da Vinci system. Newer models build on the robot's core technology, adding enhancements that include increased visual acuity and ease of use. Key growth areas for the firm include colorectal and hernia procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   While previous systems were all surgical- or anatomical system-specific, in 2014 the

    FDA
   </company>
   approved the da Vinci XI for use in a wide variety of surgeries. Also that year, the company received FDA clearance for its Single-Site Wristed Needle Driver device and its da Vinci Sp Surgical System, further expanding its single-incision product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, some 652,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci system, compared to 570,000 procedures performed in 2014 and 523,000 procedures performed in 2013. This growth has been driven by an increase in US general surgery procedures and, globally, urologic procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also expanding its organization as use of the da Vinci system increases. Intuitive Surgical is growing its direct sales organization, as well as its manufacturing and R&amp;D workforces. It also occasionally forms strategic alliances with other medical device firms in areas including product development, training, and marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intuitive Surgical took over the Japanese sales, marketing, service, support, and training for its products in 2014 in order to expand its presence in the Asia/Pacific region. It previously worked with Adachi for these functions.

  <p>
   Intuitive Surgical grows through occasional acquisitions, as well. In 2014 it bought Luna Innovations' fiber optic shape-sensing and localization technology, which can be used to monitor 3-D shapes.
