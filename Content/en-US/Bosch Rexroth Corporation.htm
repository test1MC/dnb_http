   Bosch Rexroth is putting some manufacturing muscle behind green technologies. The company is developing eco-friendly and energy-efficient applications for its automation systems, drives, and motion and control systems. It is also designing aluminum structural framing products for use in architectural and solar energy projects. Over the years it has worked with welding machine builder AMET Inc. to produce a system used to manufacture massive wind turbines. Bosch Rexroth's linear motion controls are used to improve the welding system's performance and cut manufacturing costs.

   In 2014 Bosch Rexroth opened a new hydraulics manufacturing and distribution center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The $2.2 million Brodhead Road expansion features a valve and manifold manufacturing center for mobile and industrial hydraulics, while the new logistics and distribution facility handles shipments to some 500 customers, including its nationwide network of drive and control distributors.
