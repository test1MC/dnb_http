   Surf or turf -- Yamaha Motor Corp., USA is on a roll. The company, a subsidiary of Japan's
   <company id="54040">
    Yamaha Motor
   </company>
   , manufactures motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), race kart engines, golf carts, and snowmobiles, as well as race boats, personal watercraft, and two- and four-stroke outboard motors. Branded apparel and merchandise coupled with consumer financing support Yamaha Motor USA's marketing. Its lineup, which is targeted to recreational and sports enthusiasts, is promoted through sponsored rallies and races. However, a growing number of rescue and armed services, including police, firemen, and

   </company>
   , are using Yamaha's off-road vehicles to cross tough terrains. A network of dealers sells the line.

   In 2014, net sales in North America accounted for about 19% of
   <company id="54040">
    Yamaha Motor
   </company>
   's total revenues, gaining from sales of 79,000 units, an increase by 3.1% over 2013. The company also saw a major increase in the sales of large outboard motors, recreational off-road vehicles (ATVs), and golf cars.

  <p>
   The parent company is focused on promoting snowmobiles aimed at building share in North American markets. It is also pushing the sale of its popular sports boats.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company's Yamaha Parts and Accessories division entered into a collaboration with leading exhaust manufacturer, Yoshimura R&amp;D of America, to deliver a new line of high performance, emissions-compliant, slip-on exhaust systems custom engineered for Yamaha's YZF-R1M, YZF-R1, and YZF-R3 sport bikes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company reported a growth in the sales of large motors in North America as the result of a continuing recovery in overall demand in the lake, river, and ocean markets, and a demand/production shift from inboard motors to outboard motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   ATV manufacturing moved from Japan to the US in 2013 to raise profitability by moving production to the site of demand. (The US represents about 50% of Yamaha's ATV sales).

   Yamaha Motor Corporation, USA was established in 1977 to expand Yamaha Motor's motorized sports products to North American markets. US race fans had taken note of the company's sixth place finish in the Catalina Grand Prix race in 1958. The attention spurred the company to sell its motorcycles stateside, first through Cooper Motors, an independent distributor, and later through other US dealers.
