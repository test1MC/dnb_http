   Carl Zeiss doesn't have Bette Davis eyes, but it does make products that enhance visibility. Microscopes, planetarium projectors, and camera lenses are part of a portfolio that make the company a leader in optical and optoelectronic manufacturing. It operates in more than 30 countries through five business groups -- Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology, Medical Technology, Microscopy, Industrial Metrology, and Consumer Optics/Optronics -- and a joint venture called Carl Zeiss Vision, the #2 global leader in eyeglass lenses. Its production facilities are located in Europe, North America, Central America, and Asia. Carl Zeiss is a subsidiary of

   (Carl Zeiss Foundation).

  <p>
   Dr. Carl Friedrich Zeiss founded the Carl Zeiss firm in Jena, Germany, in 1846 to produce microscopes and measuring instruments. Ernst Abbe joined Zeiss in 1866. Abbe's research background helped introduce optical theories to Zeiss' lens-development efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zeiss' son Roderich joined the company in 1881. That year Abbe met chemist Otto Schott, who was making glass of great purity and uniformity. In 1884 Carl and Roderich Zeiss and Schott and Abbe formed the Jenaer Glasswerk Schott und Genossen to develop optical and heat-resistant glass and crystal. The shop became the primary source of raw materials for Zeiss products. Carl Zeiss died in 1888.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1889 all of the Zeiss concerns were transferred to Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung (similar to a foundation). The aim of the Stiftung was to ensure the firm would follow the social values of the company's founders. Abbe granted his shares in Zeiss to the Stiftung in 1891. By 1900 Zeiss employment benefits included an eight-hour workday, paid holidays, health benefits, profit sharing, and a retirement plan. Abbe died in 1905.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the onset of WWI, Zeiss had established marketing branches in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg, as well as in Vienna and London, through the formation of Carl Zeiss, Jena Optische Werkstaette. The company established Carl Zeiss, Inc., in New York in 1925. By the mid-1930s the manufacture of civilian products gave way to the production of items for Germany's war effort, such as bombsites, U-boat targeting binoculars, and stereoscopic rangefinders.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war, as stipulated by the Yalta treaty, Russia occupied what would become East Germany (including Zeiss' Jena works). However, in 1945 US troops removed 126 management staff and scientists from the Jena factory and transplanted them in the US occupation zone. By 1948 the Zeiss works had become fragmented, with the Optische Werke Oberkochen (Carl Zeiss) located in Oberkochen in western Germany, and the state-owned VEB Carl Zeiss Jena in the east. The split between the two works became official in 1949, and the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung was moved from Jena to Heidenheim.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1953 Zeiss Oberkochen introduced surgical microscopes. Starting in 1962, space missions employed the use of Zeiss optics -- Oberkochen provided for the West, and Jena works provided for Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tensions peaked in the early 1970s over which factory had rights to the "Carl Zeiss" trade name. Despite rulings in the US and the UK, both firms continued to use the name to some extent until Germany's reunification in 1990. The Jena and Oberkochen works were reunited the following year after Oberkochen agreed to acquire only certain Jena assets and just 10% of Jena's bloated workforce of 70,000. Also in 1991 Carl Zeiss, Inc., bought diagnostic instrument company Allergan Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Raytheon acquired Zeiss' military and commercial marine steering systems division (Anschuetz). The company formed two joint ventures in 1998 to manufacture image-guided surgical instruments and systems for capturing and delivering satellite imagery.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 Carl Zeiss had been in the red for nearly five years. The company cut its workforce and jettisoned unprofitable enterprises. Zeiss sold its contact lens business to Bausch &amp; Lomb in early 2001. Partly because of its cost-cutting measures, the company's net income more than doubled for fiscal 2001. Later that year Zeiss spun off its semiconductor business (nearly 25% of sales) as Carl Zeiss Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2002 Carl Zeiss merged its ophthalmic products operations with Asclepion-Meditec AG to create publicly traded Carl Zeiss Meditec AG. Late that year Carl Zeiss opened a nearly $50 million plant for the lithography optics used in microchip production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the eye care sector of Carl Zeiss merged with SOLA International to create Carl Zeiss Vision.
