   Scripps Networks is focused on growing advertising revenues by increasing video plays and attracting more unique visitors to its websites through site enhancements and adding more video. Its strategy also includes trying to attract a broader audience through programming on national video streaming sites, developing new sources of revenue that capitalize on traffic growth at the company's own websites, and capitalizing on the movement of advertising dollars to mobile platforms.
