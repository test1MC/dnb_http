  <p>
   Konica Minolta's strategy essentially is to expand the scale of its business in certain growth markets. Its priorities include maintaining a top market position by launching new series and models of color multifunctional peripherals (MFPs) and production print systems; strengthening its optimized print services sales (OPS involves enhancing corporate printing environments for clients via centralized network-based management); and accelerating business development in emerging markets, especially in Asian markets. It opened Business Innovation Centers in five major markets in 2014. Then in 2015 the company opened a new R&amp;D center to concentrate on digital printing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In emerging markets, Konica Minolta has established regional head offices in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, an office in Thailand, and sales subsidiaries in Vietnam and Turkey to better serve high-growth Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern markets. A new production site is operating in Malaysia.

It acquired a printing production business in India, a technology distributor in Brazil, an Australian marketing services firm (which serves Asian markets), service companies in the US and the UK, and business services firm in the Czech Republic.
