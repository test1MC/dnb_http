  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, sales increased 3% on prior year to £6.0 billion due to positive performances in the Scientific, Technical &amp; Medical; Risk &amp; Business Analytics; and Legal segments, countered to an extent by a drop in Exhibition revenue. The positive segment performances was mainly down to good growth in electronic and face-to-face revenue, offset by a decline in print. The strongest growth was in Risk &amp; Business Analytics, up 7%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 6% to £1.0 billion due to higher net sales. Cash from operating activities likewise rose, by 2% to £1.9 billion.
