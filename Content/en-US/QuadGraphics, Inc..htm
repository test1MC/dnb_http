   In fiscal 2015 the company's revenue decreased by 4% to $4.6 billion, mainly due to decreased sales from US print and related services.

   Ink runs in the Quadracci family. Harry R. Quadracci founded Standard Printing in Racine, Wisconsin, in 1930, when he was 16. Four years later Quadracci sold out to William A. Krueger. Though he worked to build Krueger into a major regional printer, Quadracci had little equity in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Harry R. Quadracci's son Harry V. Quadracci joined Krueger as a company lawyer. Within a few years he had worked his way up to plant manager. Krueger was a union shop, and in those days unions dictated the work rules and often salary levels. In 1970 there was a three-and-a-half-month strike. At odds with new management and reportedly dissatisfied with the way Krueger caved in to union demands and the adversarial relationship between company and union, the younger Quadracci left.
  </p>
  <p>
   After 18 months of unemployment, in 1971 Quadracci formed a limited partnership with 12 others to get a loan to buy a press, which was installed in a building in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. The next year his father joined the company as chairman. Within two years the partners had recouped their initial investment, but the business' future remained in question until about 1976. One of its most innovative moves was to make its delivery fleet drivers into entrepreneurs by requiring them to find cargo to haul on their return trips.
  </p>
  <p>
   Working on a shoestring, Quadracci hired inexperienced workers and trained them, moving them up as the company grew. The need to improvise fostered a flexibility that Quadracci institutionalized by keeping management layers flat and remaining accessible to his employees. Beginning in 1974, Quadracci rewarded his workers with equity in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s Quad/Graphics' commitment to technology enabled it to offer better service than many of its competitors. It was also immune to the merger-and-acquisition fever of the time. Free of acquisition debt, the company had excellent credit and was able to finance equipment upgrades with bank loans. Quad/Graphics expanded by opening a plant in Saratoga Springs, New York (1985), and buying a plant in Thomaston, Georgia (1989).
  </p>
  <p>
   But there were missteps, such as its 1985 attempt to break into the newspaper coupon insert business dominated by Treasure Chest Advertising. Quad/Graphics sold that operation three years later. The company could not avoid the national economic downturn that began about that time, which forced it to lay off employees in the late 1980s and early 1990s and prompted it to reduce weekend overtime pay (from double time to time-and-a-half). The firm was also hit when a major customer consolidated its printing outside the Midwest. In response, Quad/Graphics increased its capacity in other regions of the US during the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company bought 40% of Argentine printer Anselmo L. Morvillo. Benefiting from the UPS strike and changes in the postal regulations, in 1997 Quad/Graphics expanded its shipping services with Parcel Direct, targeting parcels for large shippers such as catalog merchants, in cooperation with the US Postal Service. Also that year it created a joint venture color printing firm with Brazil's Folha Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Quad/Graphics expanded its international reach, agreeing to a joint venture in Poland. The next year the company was awarded the pre-press business of Cond√© Nast magazines. In 2000 it launched a business-to-business portal called Smart Tools.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was shocked in 2002 when Harry V. Quadracci drowned at age 66. His brother, Tom, was then appointed president. In 2004 Tom Quadracci assumed the role of chairman and CEO, while Harry's son, Joel, took over as president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quad/Graphics sold its package delivery business,
   <company id="135990">
    Parcel Direct
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="10552">
    FedEx
   </company>
   for $120 million in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, the company acquired Openfirst in a deal that was projected to double the printing firm's direct mail division QuadDirect. Later that year the firm acquired a printing plant in Reno, Nevada, expanding its distribution capacity on the West Coast. Tom Quadracci stepped down as CEO in late 2006, and Joel Quadracci succeeded him. Tom Quadracci remained executive chairman through the end of 2006 before retiring.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company bought Poland-based Winkowski, a leading commercial printer. Quad/Graphics later renamed the unit QuadWinkowski, and appointed Tom Frankowski, a veteran of its US manufacturing operations, as the unit's president.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to strengthen its international presence, the company extended its reach into Europe by acquiring Ireland-based Vigitek in 2008. Vigitek, whose scanners and inspection systems detect printing defects, was renamed Quad/Tech following the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on diversifying beyond its core catalog and magazine printing services, in 2008 Quad/Graphics invested $25 million to expand its direct mail division, which had previously been a smaller contributor. The move helped the company to acquire digital presses and envelope inserters and to update other features of its production center.
  </p>
  <p>
   As demand fell for printing services, in 2009 Quad/Graphics laid off about 550 plant workers nationwide. The company linked the workforce reduction to dwindling sales of catalogs and other media.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Quad/Graphics made a significant move to expand when it acquired one of its biggest rivals,
   <company id="43925">
    World Color Press
   </company>
   , for about $1.2 billion. It also became a publicly traded company at that time, listing on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   . Later that year the company closed eight plants and cut more than 4,000 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next in 2010 it purchased specialty products printer HGI Company. Quad/Graphics made the acquisition to bolster its commercial and specialty products offerings. HGI's specialty products include retail point-of-purchase (POP) displays and materials through its Tempt brand, which produces in-store signage and promotional programs for retail customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 and 2012 the company swapped several assets with Montreal-based print company
   <company id="55247">
    Transcontinental
   </company>
   . As part of the exchange, Quad/Graphics acquired three of Transcontinental's facilities in Mexico, and sold all but one of its eight Canadian facilities to Transcontinental (Quad/Graphics retained its Vancouver facility).
