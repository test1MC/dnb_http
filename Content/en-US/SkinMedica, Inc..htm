   SkinMedica wants to rejuvenate your skin with its medications. The firm develops prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) skin care products in therapeutic and aesthetic categories. Its
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved prescription products include Vaniqa, which impedes growth of unwanted facial hair on women, and EpiQuin Micro, a treatment for hyper pigmentation (spotty skin). Its non-prescription products (including skin cleansers, toners, and moisturizers) are primarily sold by partnering dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and other medical professionals in North America. Founded in 1999, SkinMedica was acquired by rival

   </company>
   in 2012.

   Botox-maker Allergan paid some $350 million to acquire SkinMedica and  its topical aesthetics skin care business, which includes both non-prescription and prescription products, in late 2012. The acquisition did not include SkinMedica's Colorescience mineral makeup line (which SkinMedica acquired in 2012); the Colorescience unit was spun off into a new entity upon closing of the Allergan deal. Following the purchase, SkinMedical operates as a separate entity from its existing headquarters in California.

  <p>
   In addition to authorized physician offices and medical spa facilities, the company's nonprescription beauty products can be ordered online through SkinMedica's website; however, such purchases must still be authorized by a skin care professional. To attract new physicians to its network, the company conducts direct marketing efforts through its sales force and holds product information seminars. It also seeks to increase product sales by providing merchandising and promotional assistance to its existing partners.

   Success in sales of its aesthetic product lines led the company to expand its direct sales force in 2010. Continued growth led SkinMedica to announce a 20% sales force expansion effort in 2011.

   Fast-growing SkinMedica is expanding through its research and development activities and acquisitions. SkinMedica has been adding to its aesthetic product line through R&amp;D efforts. It has launched a number of products based on its TNS rejuvenation formula, which includes collagen, protein, and antioxidant components, as well as products formulated from vitamins C and E. To expand its international offerings, in 2011 the company launched its Biometa Essential anti-aging serum in Europe and Asia. Also in 2011, SkinMedica introduced the CalmPlex product line, which reduces skin redness, in the US market. In 2012 the company announced that it will collaborate with
