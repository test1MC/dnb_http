   RentPath wants to walk you right to your new residence. The firm (formerly PRIMEDIA) publishes free residential real estate guides
   <em>
    Apartment Guide
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    New Home Guide
   </em>
   , and their digital counterparts, ApartmentGuide.com and NewHomeGuide.com. RentPath also operates Rentals.com, a paid listings site for residential rental properties, and related sites. All total its network of websites reaches about 3.8 million monthly unique visitors. RentPath's DistribuTech business distributes printed directories to display racks in 23,000 grocery stores, drug stores, and other retail outlets in nearly 40 states throughout the US. Affiliates of private equity firm
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   own RentPath.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to ApartmentGuide.com, NewHomeGuide.com, and Rentals.com, RentPath also operates Rent.com and RentalHouses.com.

  <p>
   In order to deal with the challenging real estate environment, RentPath has adopted a strategy of growing its audience by strengthening its online and mobile offerings. As part of these efforts, in 2012 the company acquired Rent.com from Internet auction giant
   <company id="56307">
    eBay
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. It made the deal to complement its extensive apartment and rental home resources, and was attracted to Rent.com's strong reputation, brand awareness, history, and URL.
  </p>
  <p>
   More recently RentPath has focused on upgrading and expanding its online empire, adding enhanced graphics, better user interfaces, and mobile capabilities to its sites.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 RentPath paid $13 million for San Francisco-based Lovely, a startup with a mobile app for researching and applying for an apartment and paying rent on mobile devices and via the Web.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After selling off all its nonreal-estate titles and assets, the company changed its name to RentPath in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   RentPath's titles formerly covered a variety of industries, but the company spent several years aggressively selling off assets not associated with its core real estate market. The unfortunate timing of its focus on real estate came just before the housing market collapsed, and RentPath's revenues declined for four consecutive years after the recession. In response, the company began reviewing strategic alternatives, and in 2011 TPG Capital affiliates acquired RentPath (then PRIMEDIA) in a deal valued at about $525 million. (Before the purchase, the company had been trading on the New York Stock Exchange.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Its shift to private ownership followed a period of drastic change at PRIMEDIA. Among the plethora of major divestitures the company made in the last several years was the selling or shuttering mainstream titles including
   <em>
    Modern Bride
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Seventeen
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Teen
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    New York
   </em>
   ; selling its
   <company id="53065">
    About
   </company>
   online guide website to
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times Company
   </company>
   ; and selling its
   <company id="119363">
    Channel One
   </company>
   (television news for schools) to
   <company id="59369">
    Alloy
   </company>
   . The company also sold its Enthusiast Media -- which published magazines in niche topics from automobiles to sports to photography -- to
   <company id="47938">
    Source Interlink
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion in cash.

   With several publishing properties up for grabs and most potential buyers burdened by debt, investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) zeroed in on the publishing industry as a solid investment opportunity. KKR and three publishing executives, including future PRIMEDIA CEO William Reilly, set up K-III Holdings to acquire Intertec Publishing and Newbridge Communications for $320 million in 1989. Reilly and KKR had been buddies since KKR backed him in his bid to buy Macmillan in 1988, a battle he lost to Robert Maxwell. But Reilly did get something from Macmillan: He took 45 of the company's executives with him to K-III, including his entire management team.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought
   <i>
    Weekly Reader,
   </i>
   Newfield Publications (sold 1995), and
   <i>
    Funk &amp; Wagnalls
   </i>
   in 1991, a deal that doubled K-III's number of operating divisions. Later that year the group beat out several rival bidders to pick up several publications from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. K-III paid $675 million for nine publications, including
   <i>
    Soap Opera Digest, Seventeen,
   </i>
   and the
   <em>
    Daily Racing Form
   </em>
   . By the end of 1992, K-III had spent $1.3 billion on acquisitions, but it had trouble starting its own magazines: Two publications test-marketed in 1993,
   <i>
    Soap Opera Illustrated
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    True News
   </i>
   (tabloid news), bombed.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Funk &amp; Wagnalls
   </i>
   acquired the
   <i>
    World Almanac
   </i>
   and the World Almanac Education division of United Media Publishing in 1993. K-III also bought directory publisher Nelson Publications that year. The firm acquired Channel One Network, office-skill trainer Katharine Gibbs Schools, and Haas Publishing (apartment rental guides) in 1994. K-III sold
   <i>
    Premiere
   </i>
   magazine in 1995 and went public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   K-III bought 14 magazines (including
   <i>
    Modern Bride
   </i>
   ) from Anglo-Dutch publisher
   <company id="41830">
    Reed Elsevier
   </company>
   and acquired Westcott Communications, which provides educational and career training programs via satellite and videotape, in 1996. The following year the company divested several noncore businesses, including Katharine Gibbs Schools. It also changed its name to PRIMEDIA because, according to CEO Reilly, "K-III is a horrible name."
  </p>
  <p>
   PRIMEDIA bought two publishing divisions of Cowles Media from
   <company id="10971">
    McClatchy Company
   </company>
   in 1998 (the deal included more than 35 enthusiast and trade magazines and 15 trade shows), acquired nine teen-oriented magazines, and formed PRIMEDIA Ventures -- a fund to invest in technology projects such as early-stage Internet companies. PRIMEDIA sold its supplemental education unit -- including student magazine
   <i>
    Weekly Reader,
   </i>
   several reference publications (including
   <i>
    Funk &amp; Wagnalls
   </i>
   ), and a textbook and assessment publisher -- to Ripplewood Holdings in 1999 for $400 million. Also that year Reilly announced his retirement from the company. Former NBC executive Tom Rogers replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company realigned its publishing and Internet operations in 2000, consolidating them into the new Primedia Consumer Magazine &amp; Internet Group to better organize the magazines with their respective Web site counterparts. In order to further strengthen its online efforts, PRIMEDIA signed partnership deals with Internet investment firm
   <company id="16748">
    CMGI
   </company>
   and
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   (each took a 5% stake in PRIMEDIA). It later bought Kagan World Media, a provider of financial information on the media industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 it formed a new unit called Media Central with Steven Brill (
   <i>
    Brill's Content
   </i>
   ) to combine many of its properties. The joint venture also took a minority stake in Brill's media company. After the closure of
   <company id="57501">
    Brill Media Holdings
   </company>
   and the shuttering of its flagship publication
   <i>
    Brill's Content
   </i>
   later that year, the operations of Media Central were turned over to PRIMEDIA (including Inside.com, which was transformed into a portal instead of an online publication).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year PRIMEDIA expanded into new media through its purchase of Internet information guide publisher About for almost $700 million. In a move to boost its magazine business, the company bought 60 titles owned by
   <company id="46910">
    Emap USA
   </company>
   (
   <i>
    Teen, Motor Trend, Hot Rod
   </i>
   ), paying its UK-based parent Emap $515 million. That year PRIMEDIA sold its Bacon's Information unit to Observer AB for $90 million as part of a plan to divest non-core holdings. In early 2002 the company sold its
   <i>
    Modern Bride
   </i>
   magazine to
   <company id="57226">
    Advance Magazine Publishing
   </company>
   (doing business as Condé Nast) for $52 million. It also shut down its struggling
   <i>
    Teen
   </i>
   magazine, sold its
   <i>
    Chicago
   </i>
   magazine to
   <company id="163305">
    tronc
   </company>
   for $35 million, and sold its American Baby magazine group in 2002 to Meredith Corp. for $115 million
  </p>
  <p>
   Rogers resigned in 2003 after a disagreement with the board and president Charles McCurdy took over as chief temporarily. Former technology publisher Kelly Conlin was named CEO in late 2003. The company sold several magazines that year, including
   <em>
    Seventeen
   </em>
   to Hearst Magazines and
   <em>
    New York
   </em>
   magazine for $55 million to a family trust headed by Bruce Wasserstein. Also that year the company divided up its Media Central unit to reduce overhead. In 2004, it sold its
   <em>
    Cable World
   </em>
   publication to PBI Media.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company unloaded About to The New York Times Company in 2005. Also that year its Consumer Guides unit acquired the new-home listings site americanhomeguides.com. PRIMEDIA sold its Business Information segment to PBI Media (now named
   <company id="112952">
    Prism Business Media
   </company>
   ) later in 2005. Chairman Dean Nelson took over as CEO and president that year, replacing Conlin.
  </p>
  <p>
   PRIMEDIA had generated some 60% of its sales from its Enthusiast Media magazine publishing unit, which included auto titles as well as other niche magazines in a wide range of topics including sports and photography; however, in 2007 the company sold Enthusiast Media to
   <company id="47938">
    Source Interlink
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion in cash in order to focus on its free consumer guides. PRIMEDIA said the sale of its Enthusiast Media business made the company "virtually debt free". In connection with the Enthusiast Media sale, the company appointed Robert Metz as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 PRIMEDIA bought RentalHouses.com and combined the online rental listings site with its other apartment listings properties at Rentals.com.  The company discontinued its Auto Guides division in 2008. The unit was PRIMEDIA's last non-real estate holding to be divested. Also that year Charles Stubbs replaced Robert Metz as president and CEO. Founder and former CEO Bill Reilly died in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company cut costs in 2008 by relocating its corporate headquarters from New York to Norcross, Georgia and reducing its overall headcount by more than 12% as a result of the consolidation of certain job functions. PRIMEDIA suspended additional print publications in 2009 in order to focus on its Internet offerings. Also that year the company eliminated about 100 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 affiliates of private equity firm TPG Capital acquired PRIMEDIA a deal valued at about $525 million. In 2012 PRIMEDIA acquired Rent.com from eBay.
