   and has equipment in use at some 90% of the world's surface mines.

   P&amp;H makes up its parent company's Surface Mining Equipment segment, which was able to increase its net sales by 29% from 2010 to 2011. It was helped by an increase in aftermarket and original equipment sales and by LeTourneau, a previous acquisition. Aftermarket sales were up in all regions led by higher sales in North and South America. The segment's net income climbed by 26% as a result of the higher sales volumes due to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption and cancellation charges.

   P&amp;H welcomed LeTourneau Technologies, after Joy Global paid more than $1 billion for the earthmoving equipment manufacturer from
   <company id="11290">
    Rowan Companies
   </company>
   in mid-2011. LeTourneau, which operated two business segments -- mining and drilling products -- made wheel loaders used in the mining and oil and gas drilling industries. It also designed offshore jack-up drilling rigs and manufactured the primary components for the rigs, as well. The acquisition added to P&amp;H's existing portfolio and moved it into a new area of resource extraction.

  <p>
   The company was founded by Alonzo Pawling and Henry Harnischfeger in 1884 as Pawling &amp; Harnischfeger. In 1911 Pawling sold his stake in the company to his partner and Pawling &amp; Harnischfeger became Harnischfeger Corporation. Joy Mining Machinery joined P&amp;H Mining Equipment in 1995 under a new holding company, Harnischfeger Industries, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 in 1999. When Harnischfeger emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2001, the company changed its name to Joy Global Inc.
