   Boasting one of the nation's top five refrigerated salad dressings, Naturally Fresh sells most of its products in iconic Mason jars. The company's a maker and distributor of Naturally Fresh-branded salad dressings, dips, sauces, marinades, and other condiments.

   Now under the TreeHouse Foods umbrella, Naturally Fresh's dressings and condiments are part of the TreeHouse products portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the TreeHouse deal, the condiments manufacturer had been working to diversify its revenue through a partnership with restaurant chains, such as its deal with
   <company id="47976">
    Hooters of America
   </company>
   . Hooters enlisted the help of Naturally Fresh in 2010 to make a line of Hooters-branded salad dressings. Consisting of Bleu Cheese and Ranch varieties, the dressings are sold in supermarket produce sections. Naturally Fresh is looking to develop additional restaurant-branded products for the retail market.
