   Rose Acre Farms relies on millions of hens to produce its profits. One of the nation's largest egg suppliers, the business farms and sells fresh chicken eggs marketed under the Rose Acre Farm and Eggland's Best brands. The company offers eggs from pen-kept hens and free-roaming, cage-free hens, both of which peck on a natural, hormone-free feed made in the farm's own feed mill. Rose Acre Farms also makes dried egg products, such as egg white protein, used in animal feed and nutritional supplements for athletes. The company's operations are supported by a fleet of refrigerated Rose Acre Farms semi-trailers that deliver its eggs to retailers or distributors. It's owned and operated by the founding Rust family.
