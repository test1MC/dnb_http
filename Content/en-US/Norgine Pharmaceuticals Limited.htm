   Norgine Pharmaceuticals is a specialty pharmaceutical firm that develops, manufactures, and markets medications for treating acute and chronic illnesses. Its core focus is on gastroenterology, hepatology, pain management, and incontinence. Its bestselling drug, Movicol (for constipation), brings in more than half of its sales. Its fastest growing treatment is Xifaxan (for traveler's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy). Other products include procedural bowel cleansing therapy Moviprep and constipation treatment Normacol. Norgine Pharmaceuticals is a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Norgine BV, which was founded in 1906 and operates manufacturing facilities in France and the UK.

  <p>
   Norgine's strategy for growth involves partnering with other pharmaceuticals manufacturers to broaden its pipeline portfolio. It also sells rights to its treatments to others to focus on its core products. Its goals are to reach double-digit growth and to strengthen its late-stage (phase III and onwards) portfolio.

   Some of the company's partners include Alizyme, Alfa Wassermann, Jubilant Biosys, and Molteni. In 2015 it acquired a majority stake in Arc Medical Design, which makes the endoscopic device Endocuff Vision for the detection of colon cancer. In 2014, Norgine partnered with China Medical System to bring Movicol to China; it also joined together with PlasmaTech Biopharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize the Mugard medical device (which prevents and manages lesions and symptoms of oral mucositis) in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
