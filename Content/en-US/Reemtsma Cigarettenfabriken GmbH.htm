   Cigarette maker Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken has rolled its own cigarettes for more than a century. The German company controls about a quarter of its home market and is one of the largest tobacco companies in Europe. The company produces a variety of brands, including Gauloises Blondes, Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant, Route  66, Rizla, R1, and JPS. It sells its cigarettes through affiliated operations in more than 130 countries around the globe. Health-related legal complications have as yet not touched the company, since the majority of its sales come from areas outside those litigious towards cigarette makers. Reemtsma is a subsidiary of the UK's

  <p>
   Most of the company's cigarettes are King-sized (84 mm in length). It also sells 100 mm-long 100-franc cigarettes, and non-filter cigarettes (Strangcigaretten). Its rolling tobacco blends consist of Markzware (dark), Halfzware (dim), and bright tobaccos.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cigarillos include classical Cigarillos (wrapped in a tobacco leaf) and filter cigarillos (covered by dark tobacco paper). Other products include filterhülsen (paper filter sleeves) and filling tobacco.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its success with the premium Gauloises Blondes and mid-range West brands, Reemtsma has a leading position in the value sector of the cigarette market.

   Reemtsma, the second-largest tobacco company (through its JPS brand) in Germany with a 24.3% market share, faces obstacles in growing in that country. Since 2008 the country's cigarette market has shrunken by about 5%, with 3% of the loss attributable to smoking bans, the company said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides cigarettes, the company has earned profits on other tobacco products, such as traditional fine-cut tobacco and roll-your-own items.

  <p>
   Bernhard Reemtsma set up the humble Dixi cigarette factory in Erfurt, Germany, in 1910. His sons Philipp and Hermann took over management and in 1923 moved the company to Hamburg. It grew during the Weimar Republic era to become Germany's largest cigarette maker, and in 1949 the company was renamed Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken. Reemtsma bought German competitor Roth-Handle in the mid-1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the deaths of Philipp and Hermann, the Hamburg-based coffee company Tchibo Holding bought 53% of the company from the Reemsta family. The holding company named Gunter Herz, a member of the family that owns Tchibo, to chair the supervisory board of Reemtsma, and the Reemtsma family relinquished management of the company. A restructuring plan in 1986 included the sale of all noncore assets, including shares in some breweries; production then focused on Berlin and Hanover.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 Tchibo increased its ownership stake to 75%. Reemtsma expanded into Central and Eastern Europe with the acquisitions of Tobana Ljubljana (1991, Slovenia), Debrecen (1992, Hungary), Slovak International Tabak (1993, Slovakia), and two factories in the Ukraine (1994).
  </p>
  <p>
   Jan Philipp Reemtsma, a grandson of Bernhard, was kidnapped in 1996 for 33 days; he was released for a ransom of $20 million. His book
   <i>
    In The Cellar,
   </i>
   published in 1999, described the ordeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reemtsma ventured into Asia in 1994 when it started a distribution company in Japan and signed a cooperation agreement with the Chinese tobacco monopoly. It bought a tobacco company in Poland in 1996 and one in Russia in 1998. Also in 1998 it entered into joint ventures in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan and opened two new factories in Poland and Ukraine. Reemtsma acquired about 80% of a tobacco factory in Macedonia in 1999 and took a majority interest in Paradise Tobacco Company in Cambodia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Reemtsma sold its 31% stake in Argentine tobacco company Massalin to Philip Morris (which already held a 64% stake). In 2002,
   <company id="52399">
    Imperial Brands
   </company>
   , the UK's #1 cigarette maker, bought 90% of Reemtsma for $5.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   An investigation by German custom officials into alleged trading violations by a group of Reemtsma employees led to the resignations of company board members Ludger Staby and sales and marketing director Manfred Häussler in July 2003. That year a German court dismissed a health-related lawsuit against Reemstma. A German smoker claimed the company didn't warn him that smoking is dangerous.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like its US counterparts, Reemtsma must deal with higher excise taxes, which were increased in Germany in early 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Imperial's leadership, Reemtsma has streamlined its manufacturing operations over the years. In 2004 Imperial closed Reemtsma's tobacco factory in Debrecen (Hungary). The company then relocated its cigarette production from Berlin to Poland in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a global restructuring following the takeover of Spain-based

   , Imperial shuttered Reemtsma's Berlin plant in 2011 and laid off about 20% of its German workforce, or some 420 workers.
