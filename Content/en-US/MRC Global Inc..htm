  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   MRC Global has set its sights on becoming the world's largest distributor of PVF and related products. To this end, MRC Global promotes itself as a one-stop shop for PVF purchases. Its operations couple sole-source supply agreements with MRO contracts throughout all phases of work in oil and gas and other process industries.

  <p>
   The company distributes products to a wide variety of end-users. It has operations in 20 countries and direct sales activities in 90. Their broad distribution network and customer base allow them to capitalize on their extensive inventory offering. MRC Global also sells its products via its inside sales force. They also have regional sales teams based in their core geographic regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its principal customers are companies active in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry as well as in other industrial and energy sectors.

  <p>
   In 2015 MRC Global's revenues decreased by 24% due to lower sales from the US (the result of a drop in customer spending related to the decline in oil and natural gas prices and unfavorable exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   It posted a net loss of $331.6 million in 2015 (compared to a profit of $144.1 million in 2014) due to lower revenues and an increase in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow increased to $689.9 million from $106.4 million in 2014. The increase was mainly due to a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable caused by lower sales.

  <p>
   In 2015, the company divested its oil country tubular goods (OCTG) product line. The divestiture was part of the company's strategy to reduce its exposure to upstream drilling volatility and focus on growing its higher margin product lines, particularly the valve, valve automation and instrumentation business.
  </p>
  <p>
   MRC Global is continuing to focus on organic growth and timely execution of its international strategy. To support its customers in producing regions, the company continues to extend the reach and efficiency of hub-and-spoke system of Regional Distribution Centers in 2015, extending its operations in Pittsburgh, and opening new centers in Rotterdam and in the UAE.
  </p>
  <p>
   Activity in US shale plays is expected to continue to drive midstream business, although at a slower pace. The downstream market gives the company the potential for more than $100 billion in projects for planned expansion and new build-out of petrochemical facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   MRC Global's one-stop shop strategy is underpinned both by efforts to augment its customer base, including penetration of new geographies, neighboring markets (such as crude oil refining and petrochemical processing), and acquisitions that complement the company's core activities.

   In 2014 the company divested its Canadian PCP business to Europump, which
