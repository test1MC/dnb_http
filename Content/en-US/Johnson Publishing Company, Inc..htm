   Snubbed by advertisers when he founded his company 60 years ago, the late John Johnson pushed his magazine company to the front of the pack. Led by flagship
   <em>
    EBONY
   </em>
   (a monthly&#160;general interest magazine for African-Americans)
   <em>
    ,
   </em>
   Johnson Publishing Company is a black-owned publishing firm.&#160;It&#160;also publishes news magazine
   <em>
    JET
   </em>
   . Its Fashion Fair Cosmetics is marketed for African-American women, while its EbonyJet Entertainment Group oversees branded content through theatrical, TV, and digital platforms. The company additionally has licenses for consumer products such as sunglasses and greeting cards.&#160;John H. Johnson founded the family-owned firm in 1942 with the publication of
   <em>
    Negro Digest
   </em>
   , inspired by
   <em>
    Reader's Digest.
   </em></p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Johnson Publishing&#160;has been faced with a challenging environment for print media, as well as intense competition from&#160;rival publication
   <company id="42511"><em>
     ESSENCE
    </em></company>
   . Advertising revenues and circulation figures have both seen some decline in recent years, and the company has been revamping its operations to combat the declines.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011
   <em>
    EBONY
   </em>
   launched a major redesign to target younger readers, featuring a&#160;new logo, look, and website. The redesign helped&#160;to boost circulation&#160;of
   <em>
    EBONY
   </em>
   , which had declined in 2010 (to 1.1 million, down from 1.3 million in 2009) but&#160;picked up some in 2011 (to 1.2 million). The company also made the changes to attract advertisers such as
   <company id="58365">
    Citigroup
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10322">
    JPMorgan Chase
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="13381">
    Fifth Third Bank
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   At
   <em>
    JET
   </em>
   , circulation has fluctuated as well. In the first&#160;six months&#160;of 2012,
   <em>
    JET
   </em>
   circulation averaged about 745,000, down from about 820,000 in the same 2011 period. In response, in 2012 Johnson Publishing decreased the publication frequency of
   <em>
    JET
   </em>
   from weekly to bi-weekly. The company has also reduced the number of free copies distributed to salons and other commercial locations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is boosting its digital operations, such as its
   <em>
    EBONY
   </em>
   digital application, as well as&#160;its non-publication operations. In 2012 the company stated that it is working to bring back the Ebony Fashion Fair, a traveling fashion show. Also in 2012, Fashion Fair Cosmetics expanded its offerings by launching a makeup collection from Sam Fine, a well-known makeup artist.

   John H. Johnson launched his publishing business in 1942 while he was still in college in Chicago. The idea for a black-oriented magazine came to him while he was working part-time for Supreme Life Insurance Co. of America, where one of his jobs was to clip magazine and newspaper articles about the black community. Johnson used his mother's furniture as collateral to secure a $500 loan and then mailed $2 charter subscription offers to potential subscribers. He received 3,000 replies and used the $6,000 to print the first issue of
   <i>
    Negro Digest,
   </i>
   patterned after
   <i>
    Reader's Digest.
   </i>
   Circulation was 50,000 within a year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Johnson started
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   magazine in 1945 (which gained immediate popularity and is still the company's premier publication) and launched
   <i>
    JET
   </i>
   in 1951, a pocket-sized publication containing news items and features. In the early days Johnson was unable to obtain advertising, so he formed his own Beauty Star mail-order business and advertised its products (dresses, wigs, hair care products, and vitamins) in his magazines. He won his first major account, Zenith Radio, in 1947; Johnson landed Chrysler in 1954, only after sending a salesman to Detroit every week for 10 years. For 20 years,
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    JET
   </i>
   were the only national publications targeting blacks in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   By the 1960s Johnson had become one of the most prominent black men in the US. He posed with John F. Kennedy in 1963 to publicize a special issue of
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   celebrating the Emancipation Proclamation. US magazine publishers named him Publisher of the Year in 1972. Johnson launched
   <i>
    Ebony Jr!
   </i>
   (since discontinued) in 1973, a magazine designed to provide "positive black images" for black preteens. His first magazine,
   <i>
    Negro Digest
   </i>
   (renamed
   <i>
    Black World
   </i>
   ), became known for its provocative articles, but its circulation dwindled from 100,000 to 15,000. Johnson retired the magazine in 1975.
  </p>
        <p>
   Unable to find the proper makeup for his
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   models, Johnson founded his own cosmetics business, Fashion Fair Cosmetics, that year, which carved out a niche beside
   <company id="48062">
    Revlon
   </company>
   (which introduced cosmetic lines for blacks) and another black cosmetics company, Johnson Products (unrelated) of Chicago. By 1982 Fashion Fair sales were more than $30 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company got into broadcasting in 1972 when it bought Chicago radio station WGRT (renamed WJPC; that city's first black-owned station). It added WLOU (Louisville, Kentucky) in 1982 and WLNR (Lansing, Illinois; re-launched in 1991 as WJPC-FM) in 1985. By 1995, however, it had sold all of its stations.
  </p>
        <p>
   Johnson and the company sold their controlling interest in the last minority-owned insurance company in Illinois (and Johnson's first employer), Supreme Life Insurance, to Unitrin (a Chicago-based life, health, and property insurer) in 1991. That year the company and catalog retailer Spiegel announced a joint venture to develop fashions for black women. The two companies launched a mail-order catalog called
   <i>
    E Style
   </i>
   in 1993 and an accompanying credit card the next year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Johnson Publishing launched its South African edition of
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   in 1995. Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. The next year, however, circulation of
   <i>
    EBONY
   </i>
   fell 7% as mainstream magazines began covering black issues more thoroughly and a host of new titles appeared. In response, the company restructured its ventures and closed its
   <i>
    E Style
   </i>
   catalog. Johnson Publishing retired
   <i>
    Ebony Man
   </i>
   (launched in 1985) in 1998 and
   <i>
    Ebony South Africa
   </i>
   in 2000.

   In 2002 John Johnson named his daughter Linda Johnson Rice as CEO of the company; Johnson kept the title of chairman and publisher. John Johnson died at the age of 87 in 2005. His wife Eunice, secretary-treasurer of Johnson Publishing, died in early 2010. She was 93. Eunice produced Ebony Fashion Fair, a traveling fashion show that featured designer couture and was the largest of its kind; the fair was&#160;produced annually&#160;from 1956 to 2009, raising money for scholarships and charities in cities across the US and Canada.
  </p>
        <p>
   Desiree Rogers was brought in as CEO in 2010 in order to turn the business around. Rogers was formerly White House social secretary&#160;during the first portion of the Obama administration. While the appointment represents a break with the company's family-run history,&#160;Rogers is close&#160;friends with chairman and former CEO Linda Johnson&#160;Rice.
