   Drew Industries makes wanderlust -- in comfort and style -- a possibility. The company manufactures aluminum and vinyl windows and doors, and other products (furniture and slide-out walls) for travel trailers and fifth-wheel recreational vehicles (RVs) (some 85% of sales) and manufactured housing (MH). Drew does business via two subsidiaries:
   <company id="120605">
    Kinro
   </company>
   produces windows, doors, and screens, and
   <company id="109701">
    Lippert Components
   </company>
   churns out axles, ramps, and chassis parts, as well as specialty trailers for hauling boats and snowmobiles. Brands include Equa-Flex, Happijac, RV Lock, Solera, Ground Control, and Level Up.

  <p>
   Drew operates about 45 facilities throughout the US. About half of its manufacturing plants are concentrated in Indiana.

  <p>
   Drew operates through two segments: RV products and manufactured housing products (MH). About 90% of its RV segment's net sales in 2015 were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. The MH segment makes fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting, and assembling components into finished products and operates through 13 manufacturing and warehouse facilities throughout the US.

  <p>
   RV products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs such as
   <company id="11478">
    Thor Industries
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="107990">
    Forest River
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="109684">
    Jayco
   </company>
   , and other OEMs. Drew's MH products are sold primarily to major producers of manufactured homes such as
   <company id="10351">
    Clayton Homes
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="45314">
    Cavco Industries
   </company>
   , and other OEMs. The company also sells both segments' products to distributors and retail dealers of aftermarket products.

  <p>
   With the painful effects of the recession firmly behind it, Drew has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last five years. Revenues jumped 18% to peak at $1.4 billion in 2015. Profits also surged 19% to reach $74 million in 2015. (Both these totals represented historic milestones for the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was driven by a 20% rise in RV sales thanks to an increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the company's primary RV market. Drew also experienced a bump in MH revenue as industry-wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes increased, as well as sales of components for new manufactured homes.

  <p>
   The company has made its mark in the RV and manufactured housing industries primarily by growing through acquisitions. As a result of the economic downturn, certain distressed manufacturers have placed their assets and intellectual property rights on the sales block, and Drew's subsidiaries have taken advantage of those opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company purchased Signature Seating, an Indiana-based manufacturer of furniture products and services for fresh water boat manufacturers. It also purchased Spectal Industries, a Canada-based manufacturer of windows and doors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2015, it picked up EA Technologies, an Indiana-based manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts. EA is also a provider of electro-deposition and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Drew for $36 million obtained Innovative Design Solutions (IDS), located in Troy, Michigan. IDS is a designer, developer, and manufacturer of electronic systems encompassing a wide variety of RV applications. The acquisition provided Drew with further access to cutting-edge electronic products for the RV industry as well as adjacent industries.
