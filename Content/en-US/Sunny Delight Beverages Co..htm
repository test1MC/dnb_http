   Rising from a purchase from
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   , the Sunny Delight Beverages Co. (SDBC) was founded in 2004. The company's brands, which are fortified with vitamins B1 and C and are primarily marketed to children, include SunnyD Original and SunnyD Orange Blends. Sunny Delight has since begun chasing after the adult juice market, shared with
   <company id="57224">
    Tropicana
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40398">
    POM
   </company>
   . Its products are available throughout North America. It's owned by Beverage Holdings, a unit of private investment firm
   <company id="100559">

   </company>
   . However, in 2016 the parent company agreed to sell SDBC to Brynwood Partners VII L.P.

   In 2016,
   <company id="100559">
    J.W. Childs
   </company>
   , owner of SDBC, agreed to sell SDBC to Brynwood Partners VII L.P. for an undisclosed amount pending regulatory approval. Brynwood Partners also owns the Harvest Hill Beverage Company which markets Juicy Juice products, the Hug juice brand and Daily's Cocktails brand.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ohio-based SDBC operates a handful of manufacturing facilities across the US, one each in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Texas. The company sells its products across the US, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SDBC makes and markets seven brands, such as SunnyD, Elations glucosamine and chondroitin dietary supplements, Fruit2O flavored waters, Veryfine juices, fruit smoothies, and Crystal Light bottled beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company supplies a range of customers in the grocery, club, mass merchandise, convenience, dollar, and drug channels.

  <p>
   Seeking to expand its reach in the beverage market, SDBC in mid-2014 began testing a carbonated juice drink aimed at consumers looking for an alternative to energy drinks. The new beverage, SunnyD X, is available in independently convenience stores in select grocery stores in Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. The marketing program for the new drink includes sampling at locations of interest to teens, such as concerts, sporting events, skate parks and beaches.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's goals include reducing packaging materials by 25 million pounds, improving shipping efficiency, reducing per-unit non product related water usage by 25%, and cutting per unit energy usage by 25%. It is also focused on maintaining zero waster at its manufacturing sites.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired the Texas facility (in Sherman) from owner
   <company id="10811">
    J. M. Smucker
   </company>
   . SDBC had been leasing space in the Texas plant since 2004 to make its SunnyD drinks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buying Smucker's plant is part of a broader effort by SDBC to improve its manufacturing operations in the US, setting the stage for expansion. The company is investing more than $70 million to upgrade the supply chain and data systems at its five plants. The upgrades include implementing robotic warehousing systems at each plant and using more environmentally sustainable consumer packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better compete with rivals such as POM, Tropicana, and others, SDBC has concentrated on providing high-end products and catering to adults, who aren't likely to give up fruit juice. The company in 2012 acquired the Bossa Nova Beverage Group, which offers acai juice, mangosteen juice, acerola juice, and goji berry juice. It also rolled out new products, such as its Elations, a drink fortified with glucosamine and condroitin, which are supplements said to help relieve joint pain. In addition to bottled Elations, the company offers a powdered variety that can be added to any bottled water.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a deal that erased the company's debt and helped to fund its North American expansion, SDBC sold its drink operations in France, Spain, Portugal, and the UK to Orangina Schweppes, a European beverage maker that is owned by
