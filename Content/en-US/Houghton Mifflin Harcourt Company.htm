   Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company (HMH) would like to thank all the professional students out there. The firm is a publisher of educational material, covering areas from pre-K through grade 12, as well as adult learners. HMH publishes textbooks and printed materials, and provides digital content online to 50 million students and 116,000 school districts in more than 150 countries. It additionally publishes fiction (including J.R.R. Tolkien's
   <em>
    The Lord of the Rings
   </em>
   series and the popular line of
   <em>
    Curious George
   </em>
   books), as well as nonfiction titles and reference materials, and offers professional resources and educational services to teachers.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In late 2013 the company launched an IPO, and most of the $219 million in proceeds it earned went to its shareholders.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Bankruptcy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   HMH filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 2012 and emerged a few months later. Houghton Mifflin was stung by the ill effects of the global financial crisis, which caused massive spending cuts in the US school budget, its main market. Education accounts for about 90% of the company's revenues, and struggling state and local governments had been forced to cut back on education-related purchases, causing HMH to file for Chapter 11.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   HMH is headquartered in Boston and has 15 additional facilities in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, and Texas. An international location resides in Ireland. The US accounts for 95% of its total sales.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   HMH operates through two main segments: Education (88% of sales) and Trade Publishing (12%). Within these segments, a variety of divisions and brands focus on different of K-12, international, and trade and reference holdings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Imprint
   <company id="13516">
    Steck-Vaughn
   </company>
   publishes text books and other educational material, while The Learning Company offers educational software brands such as Reader Rabbit, Carmen Sandiego, ClueFinders, and Oregon Trail. Its
   <company id="99320">
    Classroom Connect
   </company>
   brings software and other technology advances to K-12 schools in the US. Best-sellers from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Trade and Reference Publishers include titles from the
   <em>
    Curious George
   </em>
   series and the
   <em>
    Peterson Field Guides
   </em>
   . The company also publishes the
   <em>
    American Heritage Dictionary
   </em>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   HMH outsources about 80% of the printing and binding of its products to two vendors.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   HMH's revenues decreased slightly by less than 1% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 (hovering around the $1.3 billion mark the last two years). The dip was driven by a $47 million decline in domestic education sales from the prior year. New adoption and open territory sales also declined in 2012. These factors were offset by a 13% surge in international sales for 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reported a net loss of $87 million in 2012. This loss was significantly down from the $2.2 billion loss it suffered the previous year due to around $1.6 billion it posted on impairment charges.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   HMH intends to deepen its penetration of existing educational markets by adapting and broadening its content and service offers. It aims to expand into high-growth education markets and extend its international presence by targeting regions that have a high demand for English language offerings; these countries include Brazil, China, India, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, and the Middle East Gulf region.
  </p>
        <p>
   It primarily achieves these goals through partnerships with suppliers overseas and through acquisitions. In 2013 HMH it announced partnerships with suppliers in both the Middle East and Philippines for distributing its educational content. Also that year, HMH added to its technology product portfolio through the purchase of Choice Solutions, a data analytics firm catering to state and district-level education systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 HMH made a big purchase when it obtained certain assets belonging to the Professional/Trade division of
   <company id="13868">
    John Wiley &amp; Sons
   </company>
   . The acquisition included the assets of classic reference titles such as
   <em>
    Webster's New World Dictionary
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    CliffsNotes
   </em>
   .

        <p>
   In 1848 printer Henry Houghton bought part of a printing company started in 1832. The company acquired other printers' booklists, but by 1880 it was deep in debt. George Mifflin became a partner, and the company, then known as Houghton Osgood, became Houghton Mifflin. In the following decades the bookmaker prospered primarily on the strength of its nonfiction trade and educational lines.
  </p>
        <p>
   Houghton Mifflin's sales from the 1950s to the 1970s followed the curve of the baby boom, from elementary and high school to college publishing. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company moved to strengthen its position in the education market, acquiring Rand McNally's education unit (1980) and textbook publishers McDougal, Littell &amp; Co. (1994) and D.C. Heath (1995).
  </p>
        <p>
   The costs of the acquisitions, a failed attempt to outsource distribution, and disarray in the trade book area sent Houghton Mifflin into the red in 1995. However, the consolidation of Heath paid off in 1996, as sales and earnings rebounded. Acquisitions continued in 1997 (cookbook imprint Chapters Publishing) and 1998 (Pearson's Discovery Works unit).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Houghton Mifflin took an interest in OnlineLearning.net (distance learning) and acquired Computer Adaptive Technologies, a producer of computer-based testing materials. Strengthening its new media education lines, the company bought video and software developer Sunburst Communications in 1999.
  </p>
        <p>
   Houghton Mifflin increased its online presence in 2000 with the acquisition of Internet testing company Virtual Learning Technologies and through several strategic agreements. The next year the company was acquired for $2.2 billion (including the assumption of $500 million in debt) by French conglomerate Vivendi Universal (now just
   <company id="92356">
    Vivendi
   </company>
   ). Houghton Mifflin was placed under Vivendi Universal's publishing unit, which in 2002 decided to sell off most of its assets as part of Vivendi Universal's $9.8 billion divestiture. A group of investors (including affiliates of
   <company id="40463">
    Thomas H. Lee
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   ) bought Houghton Mifflin that year for some $2 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the publisher settled a dispute with the estate of Margaret Mitchell over the book
   <i>
    The Wind Done Gone,
   </i>
   a retelling of the historical bestseller
   <i>
    Gone With the Wind
   </i>
   from a slave's point of view. That year Hans Gieskes, formerly chairman of Monster.com, replaced Nader Darehshori as CEO of the company. The company was sold to two investment firms in 2002. Gieskes left the company in 2003.
  </p>
        <p>
   Anthony Lucki took over as CEO. In 2006 the company was sold to a new parent company (which later became Education Media Publishing Group), for some $5 billion. The following year Houghton Mifflin acquired several Harcourt brands to form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.
  </p>
        <p>
   Harcourt traces its roots to 1919, when Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace, former classmates at Columbia University, quit their jobs at Henry Holt &amp; Co. and joined Will Howe to begin their own publishing firm in New York called Harcourt, Brace and Howe. Howe left after less than a year and the name became Harcourt, Brace and Co. The company published such notable works as
   <i>
    The Economic Consequences of Peace
   </i>
   by John Maynard Keynes and
   <i>
    Main Street
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Arrowsmith
   </i>
   by Sinclair Lewis. During the 1920s, Harcourt, Brace diversified into religious works and high school and college textbooks. Harcourt turned the company over to Brace in 1942.
  </p>
        <p>
   William Jovanovich, who had joined the company as a salesman, became president of the firm in 1955 following the deaths of Harcourt (1954) and Brace (1955). (Jovanovich died in 2001). The company merged with World Book Company in 1960 to become the largest publisher of educational materials in the US. Renamed Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc., the company went public that year. Jovanovich became chairman in 1970. Renamed Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), the company continued its acquisition spree throughout the 1970s and 1980s, buying The Psychological Corporation in 1970 and Sea World in 1976 (sold in 1989). Jovanovich retired as chairman in 1990. In 1991 General Cinema acquired HBJ.
  </p>
        <p>
   Movie-theater pioneer General Cinema was founded in 1922 as Philip Smith Theatrical Enterprises. Smith's son Richard became CEO in 1961 and renamed the company in 1964. GC bought 37% of Carter Hawley Hale in 1984, which owned the Neiman Marcus Group (founded 1907). Three years later GC traded its interest in Carter Hawley for a 44% stake in the retailer. After buying HBJ, General Cinema was renamed Harcourt General in 1993 and spun off its theaters as GC Companies. (GC was bought by rival AMC Entertainment in 2002.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 Harcourt General acquired Assessment Systems, a provider of computerized testing and licensing services. Two years later it bought National Education Corporation for about $854 million, topping a bid from Sylvan Learning Systems. Also in 1997 it became a majority owner of Steck-Vaughn, but the acquisition put Harcourt into the red that year. In early 1998 the company bought the remaining 18% stake in
   <l1>
    Steck-Vaughn
   </l1>
   it didn't already own for $42.8 million. It also paid $415 million for Mosby, Inc., the health sciences unit of Times Mirror (later acquired by rival Tribune).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Harcourt expanded its professional development titles by buying Knowledge Communication, which it merged into Drake Beam Morin. Later the company spun off most of its stake in Neiman Marcus, retaining a 10% interest. Smith stepped down as CEO, turning those duties over to his son, Robert, and son-in-law, Brian Knez.
  </p>
        <p>
   Dutch legal and medical publishing giant Reed Elsevier bought Harcourt in 2001 and sold some of its businesses (such as its higher education and corporate training operations) to Thomson Learning to alleviate antitrust concerns. Reed Elsevier later changed the company's name from Harcourt General to Harcourt Education. In 2003 the company cut several hundred jobs through layoffs and early retirement citing a difficult business climate.
  </p>
        <p>
   Following the tough times, the publisher began to gain its stride and strengthened its operations with acquisitions such as Saxon Publishing in 2004 and UK-based textbook publisher Payne-Gallway in 2005. In 2004 the company changed the name of its Harcourt Supplemental Education unit to
   <company id="140045">
    Harcourt Achieve
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Educational publisher Houghton Mifflin purchased several Harcourt brands from
   <company id="41830">
    Reed Elsevier
   </company>
   to form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2007. The deal included the acquisition of US-based text book publishing giant Harcourt Education, as well as the Harcourt Trade Publishers and Greenwood-Heinemann (now Heinemann) businesses, for some $4 billion. Houghton Mifflin's purchase of the Harcourt brands formed a leader in the US education publishing market. (In tandem with this deal, Reed Elsevier sold its international education publishing business
   <company id="138807">
    Harcourt Education Ltd.
   </company>
   to education firm
   <company id="41338">
    Pearson
   </company>
   for some for $950 million.)
  </p>
        <p>
   Reflecting a slowdown in book sales, in 2008 the company briefly stopped acquiring new manuscripts in its consumer books division. The move, unusual in the publishing industry, was a result of an overall slump in the global economy. Also in 2008 Houghton Mifflin streamlined operations when it sold its College Division for $750 million in cash to Cengage Learning (formerly Thomson Learning) in order to focus on K-12, trade, and reference titles.
  </p>
        <p>
   Education Media Publishing Group head Barry O'Callaghan replaced Lucki as CEO of the company in 2009 following a financial restructuring. O'Callaghan resigned from the position in 2011. The following year Houghton Mifflin filed for bankruptcy.
