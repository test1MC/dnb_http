   Gardner Denver doesn't grow flowers in the Mile High City. The company makes blowers, petroleum pumps, and a variety of compressors, such as reciprocating, rotary screw, and sliding vane compressors, as well as positive displacement and centrifugal blowers. Compressed air products are its principal offering. Manufacturing plants and industrial facilities use the compressors to produce durable goods, process petroleum and pharmaceuticals, and treat wastewater. Gardner Denver also makes vacuum products, fluid-transfer products, and well-servicing pumps for oil and natural gas companies. It is adding new lines, such as water-jetting products. The company was taken private in mid-2013.
