   Keith Richards and Itzhak Perlman can't wait to get their fingers on D'Addario &amp; Company. The company is one of the world's top makers of strings for musical instruments under the D'Addario brand (pronounced Da-Dairy-O) and a top producer of musical instrument accessories. D'Addario's other product lines include Planet Waves (cables, connectors, and instrument accessories), Rico (woodwind reeds and mouthpieces), and Evans and PureSound (drumheads and drum kit accessories). D'Addario's products are sold in more than 5,400 US music retail stores across some 120 countries. Begun in 1974, D'Addario is owned and run by its namesake family. The family's ancestors in Italy began making strings in the 1600s.

   Although it is a proponent of lean manufacturing and automation, D'Addario has been able to keep most of its production processes on US shores. The company invests in cross-training and teaching new skills to its employees, which has helped it to move work from China back to its Long Island facilities -- and avoid layoffs.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company reorganized into two distinct divisions led by co-presidents, including John D'Addario III. The aim of the reorganization is to position the company for growth and advance a succession plan for the family-owned business. Also that year, D'Addario established D'Addario China in Shanghai, to manage sales and marketing throughout Mainland China. It also opened a new showroom in Manhattan that features its orchestral strings and woodwinds products.
