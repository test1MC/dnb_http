   Vivendi's way of life is to provide movies, TV, videos, games, music, and more. After selling its telecommunications assets, which accounted for more than half of the company's business, the French firm is concentrating on digital media, movies, TV, games, and music. Vivendi's media assets include
   <company id="100557">
    Universal Music Group
   </company>
   (UMG) and
   <company id="41802">
    CANAL+
   </company>
   , the top pay-television provider in France, and Europe's largest distributor and producer of films.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Canal+ Group is Vivendi's biggest business, bringing in 54% of revenue. UMG, which gets most of its revenues from recorded music by artists such as Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, LMFAO, and Rihanna, accounts for 45% of revenue. The other 1% is from the Vivendi Village unit, which include Vivendi Ticketing, Wengo (expert counseling), Watchever (subscription video-on-demand), and the Paris concert hall L'Olympia.

  <p>
   Headquartered in France, the company is present in 67 countries. France accounts for 45% of revenue; the rest of Europe, 25%; the US, 17%; and the rest of the world, 13%.

  <p>
   The company's revenue dropped 2% in 2014 from 2013, mainly attributable to a 7% decrease in UMG revenue. Canal+ sales rose 3% and Vivendi Village revenue rose 35% in 2014. Canal+ counted about 680,000 more subscribers in 2014 with strong performance from Africa and Vietnam. The movie division banked on releases such as
   <em>
    Paddington
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The Imitation Game
   </em>
   (winner of the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay), and
   <em>
    RoboCop
   </em>
   to post higher results. Net income, however, jumped 141% higher in 2014 with a big assist from discontinued operations. The company actually posted a loss for the year, but income from the discontinued telecommunications operations more than made up for it.

   Vivendi completed its exit of the highly competitive telecommunications business to invest more in media and content. It sold telecom operators SFR to Numericable, Maroc Telecom (in Morocco) to
   <company id="106016">
    Etisalat
   </company>
   , and GVT (Brazil) to
   <company id="41846">
    Telefonica
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to its entertainment portfolio with several acquisitions.

  <p>
   In 2015 Vivendi began negotiations with
   <company id="139061">
    Orange
   </company>
   to acquire an 80% stake in Dailymotion, a video-streaming website, for about $235 million. Vivendi would help Dailymotion accelerate its growth internationally and to enhance its content.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vivendi's Canal+ Group acquired a majority stake in Studio Bagel, the top comedy channel network on YouTube in France, in 2014. Also in 2014 UMG acquired the British company
   <company id="115592">
    Eagle Rock Entertainment
   </company>
   , a producer and distributor of music programming for DVD, Blu-Ray, and digital TV and media.

  <p>
   Authorized by an imperial decree, Compagnie Générale des Eaux was founded in 1853 by investors such as the Rothschild family and Napoleon III's half-brother to irrigate French farmland and supply water to towns. It won contracts to serve Lyons (1853), Nantes (1854), Paris (1860), and Venice (1880).
  </p>
  <p>
   A supplier of water and other basic services for most of its history, the company that became Vivendi didn't move strongly into other areas until the 1980s when it made investments and acquisitions into telecommunications and then media and entertainment in the 1990s.
