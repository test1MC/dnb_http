   Kefir is not milk with a pedigree, but it
   <em>
    is
   </em>
   cultured and it's the lifeblood of Lifeway Foods. In addition to the yogurt-like dairy beverage called Kefir (sold under the Tuscan, Lassi, and BasicsPlus brands), the company's products include farmer and cream cheeses, Sweet Kiss (a sweetened cheese spread), and a vegetable-based seasoning called Golden Zesta. Its ProBugs offering, a flavored drink with live kefir cultures packaged in pouches, is aimed at children. A longtime staple in the dairy cases of health-food stores, Lifeway's products are available throughout the US, as well as internationally. The dairy products company has been expanding its menu of products with additional children's items.

        <p>
   Lifeway reported sales of 118.6 million in 2015, a slight slip from 2014. The company sold fewer cheese and frozen products while offering greater discounts and promotional allowance.

        <p>
   Net income came in a $1.97 million in 2015, about the same as 2014. The company cut selling expenses, which included a lower ad budget, 12.3% in 2015.

   If a little Kefir is good, Lifeway decided more would be better. The company released more than 50 varieties of its Kefir product including more than 20 new flavors in 2015. The numbers include versions that are fat- free, 1%, and whole milk, and organic and conventional. Lifeway also introduced a 16-ounce protein enhanced kefir

   In July 2013, Lifeway's wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifeway Wisconsin, acquired Golden Guernsey Dairy Limited's dairy plant in Waukesha for $7.4 million to provide additional manufacturing capacity to grow its Kefir-based business. The purchase more than quadrupled Lifeway's production capacity.
