   While its Brazilian parent company doesn't break out sales for its US arm, Springs Global Participações reported a 21% increase in sales in 2013 versus 2012. Revenue in North America rose 27% year over year.

   In response to the downturn in the US economy during the financial and housing crises, Springs Global Participações reorganized to reduce its exposure to the North American market. In June 2012 it Springs Global US sold the Wamsutta brand. Springs Global has also focused on building its own portfolio of brands. In 2010 Springs Global debuted its Court of Versailles luxury textile brand, which is authorized to reproduce the Palace of Versailles' official designs. However, in August 2012 Springs Global US (SGUS) and Bedrock Holdings formed Springs Canada Holdings to tap the Canadian market. Springs Canada Holdings is 87.5% owned by SGUS and 12.5% is owned by Bedrock.

   Springs Global US' parent is looking to dominate about 10% of the world's market for bed and bath products. It has made headway by distributing its goods to top retailers and is aided by manufacturing operations spanning Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and the US. Springs Global Participações has expanded its product assortment in South America, which has contributed to increased sales there.

  <p>
   Springs Global was founded in 1887 as Fort Mill Manufacturing Co., a cotton miller organized by Samuel Elliott White and a group of investors, including Leroy Springs, White's future son-in-law. Springs later founded his own cotton mill, Lancaster Cotton Mills, in 1895 and gained control of Fort Mill Manufacturing in 1914, three years after White died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leroy's only son, Elliott Springs, became president in 1931 when his father died. Left with massive debt and six aging cotton mills, Elliott rejuvenated the company by modernizing mill equipment and consolidating the plants into the Springs Cotton Mills (1933). During WWII the company's seven mills made fabric for military use.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1945 Springs started the Springmaid line of bedding and fabrics. Elliott's satiric, risqué, but effective ads (beginning in 1948) helped the company become a leading producer of sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Elliott died in 1959 and his son-in-law, William Close, became president. With profits sharply declining, the company went public as Springs Mills in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first non-family member to be president, Peter Scotese from
   <company id="12493">
    Federated Department Stores
   </company>
   , was hired in 1969. The next year Springs began working with designer
   <company id="57938">
    Bill Blass
   </company>
   . It diversified into synthetic fabrics in 1971 by buying a minority interest in a Japanese textile plant producing UltraSuede for apparel and cars.
  </p>
  <p>
   Springs acquired Graber Industries (window-decorating products) in 1979 and three years later changed its name to Springs Industries. In 1985 it acquired M. Lowenstein, which made Wamsutta home furnishings; the deal also gave it Clark-Schwebel Fiber Glass (industrial fabrics). Springs added Carey-McFall (Bali blinds) in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining economic conditions throughout the textile industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s forced Springs to close plants and trim its weakened finished-fabrics segment (the downsizing continued into 1993). A $70 million charge in 1990 led to a $7 million loss, its first in 25 years as a public company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historically a maker of apparel fabrics, Springs had grown vulnerable to imports and launched a long-term plan to focus on home furnishings through sales and acquisitions. In 1991 the company set up a bath group with the purchase of C. S. Brooks. Springs became a leading seller of home textiles in Canada the next year by buying the marketing and sales units of C. S. Brooks Canada and Springmaid distributor Griffiths-Kerr. A hostile takeover bid for rival Fieldcrest Cannon was rebuffed in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding in 1995, Springs acquired Dundee Mills (baby and health care products, towels), Dawson Home Fashions (bath accessories, shower curtains), and Nanik Window Coverings (blinds, shutters). In 1996 the company sold its Clark-Schwebel subsidiary and the following year purchased half of American Fiber Industries (pillows, mattress pads, comforters).
  </p>
  <p>
   Crandall Close Bowles became the eighth president of Springs in 1997. The next year she took over the chair and CEO posts from Walter Elisha.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further focus on its home furnishings business, in 1998 the company sold its UltraSuede business (but kept its UltraLeather business) and its industrial products division. In 1999 Springs finally exited the apparel fabrics business when it sold its Springfield division to a management group, then it purchased Regal Rugs (bath and accent rugs) and the remaining 50% of American Fiber Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2001 the Close family agreed to partner with private equity firm Heartland Industrial Partners to take Springs private. In September the deal was completed, increasing the family's stake to 55%, with Heartland owning the remaining 45%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2002 Springs acquired the rug division of Beaulieu Group, followed in April by its purchase of the sourced quilt division of Ultima Enterprises. In June Springs completed another acquisition, taking control of Burlington Industries' window treatments and bedding consumer products businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2003 Springs completed its acquisition of Charles D. Owen Manufacturing, one of the last remaining blanket makers in the US. That year Springs acquired Oxford Bath.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company split its two business units, textiles home furnishings and window fashions, into separate companies in late 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Springs Global became bilingual in early 2006 with its merger with Brazilian company Coteminas. The move combined Coteminas' low-cost production with Springs' quick turnaround and recognizable brand names to create one of the world's largest sheet and towel manufacturers. As part of the deal, its parent moved its headquarters to Brazil, but it kept some sales, marketing, and executive functions in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2007 Springs Global sold its infant and toddler product line, which included inventory, intellectual property, and certain other assets and liabilities, for about $11 million (adjusted from a previous figure of $12.4 million due to inventory).
   <company id="11855">
    Crown Crafts
   </company>
   picked up the line to expand its products portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help compensate for declining sales, Springs Global US shut down two of its manufacturing centers in Mexico and the US in 2008. It also refinanced its debt to a lower interest rate.
