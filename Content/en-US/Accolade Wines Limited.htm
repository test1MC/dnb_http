  <p>
   With an eye toward growth, Accolade has been expanding its brand offerings as well as the geographic reach of its products through acquisitions in recent years. In early 2015, the company purchased the award-winning Grant Burge Wines in the Borossa Valley (Australia), which added several well-known brands to the company's Australian lineup. The year before, it purchased two award-winning New Zealand wine brands, Mud House and Waipara Hills, as part of the company's "New World" wine strategy, aimed at offering a full service of its wines from around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since CHAMP's investment in the company back in 2011, Accolade has also been re-invigorating its existing brands. In 2012, for example, Accolade Wines introduced a ready-to-drink sparkling wine collection targeting the under-40 female market. The offerings, which are intended to complement Accolade's existing wine portfolio, include fruit-flavored wine bellinis, punches, and spritzers similar to those served in restaurants and pubs.

  <p>
   In February 2015, Accolade Wines acquired Grant Burge Wines, with the deal securing the well-known Grant Burge brand, the Burge and Rathbone Fine Wine Merchants business, and the historic Krondorf Winery. The acquisition was part of the company's plan to expand its operations into the Barossa Valley area in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2014, Accolade purchased two New Zealand wine brands, Mud House and Waipara Hills, along with their assets, from the Mud House Wine Group. The acquisition was meant to expanded their premium product line offered globally.
