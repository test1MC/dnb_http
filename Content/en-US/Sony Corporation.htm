   Sony is synonymous with consumer electronics. It's especially big in TVs and game consoles like the new PlayStation4. Officially named Sony Kabushiki Kaisha, the company designs, makes, and sells a host of electronic equipment, instruments, and devices for consumer, professional, and industrial markets. Professional products include semiconductors and components. A top global media conglomerate, Sony boasts additional assets in the areas of music (

   ), and TV (

   ). Sony also has several financial services businesses and an advertising agency in Japan.

  <p>
   Sony's primary manufacturing facilities are located in Asia, including Japan where it is headquartered. Japan is also its single largest market by sales (32% in fiscal 2012, ends March ). The US, China, and Europe are also key markets.

  <p>
   Sony realigned its reportable segments in 2012 as part of a reorganization. The operations of the former Consumer, Professional &amp; Devices (CPD) and Networked Products &amp; Services (NPS) segments are now part of the Consumer Products &amp; Services (CPS) -- the company's largest segment by sales -- and Professional, Device &amp; Solutions (PDS) segments. CPS includes LCD televisions, Blu Ray disc and DVD players, digital and video cameras, PCs, and gaming consoles. Certain PlayStation products are marketed and distributed by Sony Computer Entertainment LLC and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd. PDS, the company's second largest segment, includes broadcast and other B2B products, as well as semiconductors and components.
  </p>
  <p>
   A smaller business segment, Sony Ericsson, was renamed Sony Mobile Communications in 2012. As a result of a reorganization that Sony is undertaking, plans to even further realign its business segments are under way.

  <p>
   Sony's products are marketed worldwide by sales subsidiaries and unaffiliated distributors, as well as direct online sales.

   Sony's fiscal 2012 (ends March) sales fell 9% vs. the prior year, while net income continued its steep decline. Indeed, the company marked its fourth consecutive year of unprofitability in 2012 as its losses widened.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sony's consumer products and services segment, CPS, remains the company's bread and butter, accounting for 45% is its fiscal 2012 sales. But competition is fierce in this industry, with
   <company id="12644">

   <company id="14120">

   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   (Wii) jockeying for dominance in game console sales globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rising Yen, decreasing demand for its products, pricing pressures, and the lingering global economic crisis has sidelined Sony in recent years. After logging a record profit in 2007, the company has seen its business stall as consumers tightened their belts.

  <p>
   The most pressing part of Sony's current strategy is turning around its electronics businesses. With a new management team established in April 2012, the company moves forward with a plan to strengthen certain core areas: digital imaging, game, and mobile. Sony is trying to develop new products, expand its hardware and software offerings, and integrate the operations of its smartphone business (operated by Sony Mobile) with its tablet and PC businesses. Another aspect of this strategy is to turn around its TV business to improve profitability there; TVs generate a large chunk of sales within the CPS segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company may have a hit on its hands with the new PlayStation4 (PS4), which went on sale in North America in November 2013. Indeed, Sony sold more than 1 million PS4s in the first 24 hours of sales. The new games console is the centerpiece of the new management team's turnaround strategy for Sony's consumer electronics and film businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sony also has been consolidating manufacturing facilities, selling off businesses and facilities, and reducing headcounts. Divestments include its TV production assets and personal computer division. It's closing 20 retail stores in the US and cutting 1,000 jobs as part of a much larger reorganization.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a very competitive electronics environment, Sony is simultaneously trying to innovate and launch products in new markets, such as it is doing with medical peripherals like printers, monitors, cameras, and recorders. The company is drawing on its audio and visual expertise to build a 4K technology product lineup. 4K is said to deliver more than four times the resolution of full HD.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the music side, Sony's wholly owned subsidiary
   <company id="43635">
    Sony Corporation of America
   </company>
   (SCA) in 2012 led a group of investors in a high-profile, high-dollar deal. Alongside the Estate of Michael Jackson, David Geffen, and
   <company id="123521">
    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   , SCA acquired

    EMI Music Publishing
   </company>
   for $2.2 billion from
   <company id="58365">
    Citigroup
   </company>
   . The company's Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which owns more than 750,000 copyrights, now oversees EMI Music Publishing and its 1.3 million copyrights on behalf of the investor group. (Sony/ATV Music Publishing is co-owned by subsidiaries of SCA and trusts formed by the Estate of Michael Jackson.)

  <p>
   Akio Morita, Masaru Ibuka, and Tamon Maeda (Ibuka's father-in-law) started Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering in 1946 with funding from Morita's father's sake business. The company produced the first Japanese tape recorder in 1950. Three years later Morita paid Western Electric (US) $25,000 for transistor technology licenses, which sparked a consumer electronics revolution in Japan. His firm launched one of the first transistor radios in 1955, followed by the first Sony-trademarked product, a pocket-sized radio, in 1957. The next year the company changed its name to Sony (from "sonus," Latin for "sound," and "sonny," meaning "little man"). It beat the competition to newly emerging markets for transistor TVs (1959) and solid-state videotape recorders (1961).
  </p>
  <p>
   Sony launched the first home video recorder (1964) and the first solid-state condenser microphone (1965). Its 1968 introduction of the Trinitron color TV tube began another decade of explosive growth. Sony bet wrong on its Betamax VCR (1976), which lost to rival Matsushita's (now
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic Corp
   </company>
   .) VHS as the industry standard. However, 1979 brought another success, the Walkman personal stereo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pressured by adverse currency rates and competition worldwide, Sony used its technology to diversify beyond consumer electronics and began to move production to other countries. In the 1980s it introduced Japan's first 32-bit workstation and became a major producer of computer chips and floppy disk drives. The purchases of CBS Records in 1988 ($2 billion) and Columbia Pictures in 1989 (a $4.9 billion deal, which included TriStar Pictures) made Sony a major force in the rapidly growing entertainment industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm manufactured
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's PowerBook, but its portable CD player, Data Discman, was successful only in Japan (1991). In the early 1990s Sony joined
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   to create a new kind of game console, combining Sony's CD-ROM drive with the graphic capabilities of a workstation. Although Nintendo pulled out in 1992, Sony released PlayStation in Japan (1994) and in the US (1995) to great success. Two years later, in a joint venture with
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , it developed a line of PC desktop systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rather than support an industry-wide standard, in 1997 Sony teamed up with
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   to make another recording media, called Super Audio CD, which could replace videotapes and CDs. (Sony and Philips created the CD and continue to receive royalties from it.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Sony shipped its first digital, high-definition TV to the US, folded TriStar into Columbia Pictures, merged its
   <company id="57161">
    Loews
   </company>
   Theatres unit with Cineplex Odeon, and launched its Wega flat-screen TV.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philips,
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   , and Sony formed a joint venture in early 1999 to develop networked entertainment products. Also in 1999 Nobuyuki Idei became CEO, and the company introduced a Walkman with the capability to download music from the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Sony formed PlayStation.com Japan to sell game consoles and software online; it also introduced its 128-bit PlayStation 2, which plays DVD movies and connects to the Internet. The company later restructured, placing all of its US entertainment holdings under a newly-formed umbrella company called Sony Broadband Entertainment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 Sony started an online bank with Japan's
   <company id="52295">
    Sakura Bank
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10322">
    JP Morgan Chase
   </company>
   . Struggling to coordinate its content units (music, movies, games, etc.) with its manufacturing operations (TVs, VCRs, radios, etc.), Sony announced yet another corporate restructuring plan; that move placed all electronics units under one upper-management group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adverse market conditions in 2001, aggravated by the September 11 attacks, led
   <company id="56367">
    Sony Pictures Entertainment
   </company>
   to consolidate its two domestic television operations, folding Columbia TriStar Network Television into Columbia TriStar Domestic Television (CTDT).
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2002 an investment group led by
   <company id="52539">
    Onex Corporation
   </company>
   acquired its Loews Theatres unit (which filed for bankruptcy in February 2001). In the course of the fiscal year ending March 2002, Sony laid off about 13,700 employees, primarily in its electronics and music businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an attempt to capitalize on the strength of its own brand, Sony Pictures Entertainment renamed its Columbia TriStar Domestic Television (CTDT) and Columbia TriStar International Television (CTIT) divisions in September 2002, designating them as Sony Pictures Television (SPT) and Sony Pictures Television International (SPTI), respectively. In October 2002 Sony transformed its
   <company id="57347">
    Aiwa
   </company>
   unit into a wholly-owned subsidiary and absorbed the struggling firm in December 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Sony adopted a US-style corporate governance model (made possible by a revision in Japan's Commercial Code) and acquired CIS Corp., a Japanese information system consulting firm. In an effort to cut costs through manufacturing consolidation, Sony closed its audio equipment plant in Indonesia that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sony unveiled the Vaio Pocket in 2004, a portable music player designed to compete with
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's iPod; Vaio Pocket debuted in the US later that year. Sony also introduced a similar product, Network Walkman -- its first Walkman with a hard drive -- in 2004. In October 2004 the company launched a music download system in Japan dubbed MusicDrop. The system utilizes
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   's Windows Media Player.
  </p>
  <p>
   To manage its financial units (Sony Life Insurance Company, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank), it created Sony Financial Holdings in 2004. The company announced in 2005 that Idei would be succeeded by foreigner Howard Stringer, who had been in charge of Sony's entertainment unit. In 2005 Sony sold its minority stake in music club
   <company id="60526">
    Columbia House
   </company>
   to BMG Direct, a subsidiary of Germany's
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   . In December 2005 the company spun off Sony Communication Network, the subsidiary that operates So-Net Internet service (which has nearly 3 million subscribers), through an IPO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2006 Sony created a holding company for its Japanese-based retail operations (Sony Plaza, Sony Family Club, B&amp;C Laboratories, CP Cosmetics, Maxim's de Paris, and Lifeneo) and sold 51% of the holding company to investment firm Nikko Principal Investments Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008 Sony bought out
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   's 45% stake in joint venture Sony Optiarc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2010 sold the measuring equipment business of Sony Manufacturing Systems to Mori Seiki, a Japan-based precision tool maker, in a deal valued at about ¥6 billion (nearly $70 million). It also sold off its 90% stake in Sony Baja California, its main TV factory in North America located in Tijuana, Mexico, to Taiwanese company Hon Hai Precision Industry. It generated $217 million for its share in
   <company id="104038">
    HBO Latin America
   </company>
   , which it sold to
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2012 Sony acquired
   <company id="41776">
    Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
   </company>
   's 50% stake in Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, marking the completion of the previously announced transaction. As a result, Sony Ericsson became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony and was renamed "Sony Mobile Communications."
