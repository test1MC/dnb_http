   As a supplier of paper for newsprint and magazines Norske Skog's performance is closely tied to the publishing industry, and as an industry in decline Norske Skog is must face the challenges of a paperless world. Globally the consumption of newsprint is decreasing with Europe and North America at the forefront of the trend. In response to the shifts, Norske Skog has taken steps to reduce capacity in Europe and has been consolidating operations to reduce costs. It sold a paper mill in the Netherlands along with its global recovered paper business to H2 Equity Partners, which will help Norske Skog reduce debt. It will raise prices for all publication papers products in 2017, particularly so in Britain due to the Brexit-hit Pound Sterling.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, News of the World shut its doors contributing to lowered demand for the company's products in the UK. Although Norske Skog UK is primarily a sales office it remains vulnerable should demand for newsprint continue to decline.
