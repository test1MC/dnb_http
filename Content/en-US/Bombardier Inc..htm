   Canada's Bombardier is the world's only manufacturer of both planes and trains (but no automobiles). The company's
   <company id="138843">
    Aerospace
   </company>
   division manufactures business (Learjet), commercial (CSeries), and amphibious military (Bombardier 415) aircraft, while overseas its Germany-based Transportation division manufactures rail vehicles, including monorails, light rails, metros, commuter trains, high-speed trains (including the very high speed ZEFIRO), and locomotives. Both are industry-leading businesses. A third division,
   <company id="116714">
    Flexjet
   </company>
   , offers fractional jet ownership and charter services. (In late 2013 Bombardier announced it was selling Flexjet.)

        <p>
   Over the next decade, industry forecasts show sustained growth in business and commercial aircraft markets. As a result, Bombardier's Aerospace unit continues to invest in and develop new state-of-the art aircraft lines, such as its CSeries commercial aircraft family, which is aiming to be the world's greenest and most fuel efficient mainliner.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Aerospace division made one of its largest business aircraft sales in its history in late 2012 when luxury aviation company VistaJet signed a deal for up to 142 Global family business jets for $7.8 billion if all options are exercised. Deliveries of these aircraft will begin in 2014. Prior to that in mid-2012, Bombardier Aerospace won another landmark business jet order from
   <company id="54066">
    NetJets
   </company>
   for a whopping $7.3 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   On the rail transportation side, demand for sturdy and efficient trains continues to be driven by urban and suburban development worldwide, as well as ongoing demand for reliable public transportation. In South America's largest metropolis, Sao Paulo, Brazil, Bombardier's Transportation division is undertaking a notable project to build the world's largest largest mass transit monorail to deal with the city's congestion. The monorail is due to begin operating in early 2014. The project is part of a broader effort by Bombardier to gain a stronger foothold in emerging markets with high growth potential; others include China, India, and Russia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier's Transportation division is actively involved in China's development of urban mass transit and advanced rail networks. Demand is strong there as the growing popularity of rail transportation is actually eating into the profits of regional aviation companies. Bombardier Transportation has three joint ventures in China, as well as several wholly owned foreign enterprises and offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. One of its key contracts is a $4 billion order from China's Ministry of Railways (MOR) to deliver of several different types of ZEFIRO very high speed trains.

   Bombardier engineers and industrial designers spent two years designing the Vancouver 2010 Olympic torch. To ensure the flame would not extinguish in temperatures reaching minus 36 degrees Celsius (minus 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), the company blended propane and isobutane, a mixture that supports fire at extremely cold temperatures. It manufactured 12,000 torches, each with a side vent to allow the flame to unfurl like a flag.

   Bombardier got its start in the 1920s when mechanic Joseph-Armand Bombardier began converting old cars into snowmobiles. He founded L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limited in 1942 to make commercial snow vehicles. In 1959 Bombardier introduced the first personal snowmobile, the Ski-Doo.
  </p>
        <p>
   At age 27, Laurent Beaudoin became the company's president in 1966. Bombardier went public in 1969. When the bottom dropped out of the snowmobile business due to the energy crisis in 1973, Beaudoin diversified, and in 1974 Bombardier won its first mass transit contract to build Montreal subway cars. Expanding further into mass transportation, Bombardier merged with MLW-Worthington Limited, a builder of diesel engines and diesel-electric locomotives. In 1978 the company became Bombardier Inc.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the 1980s Bombardier continued to diversify. It expanded into military vehicles and became the leading supplier to the North American rail transit industry. The company entered the European railcar market in 1986, the same year it acquired Canadair, Canada's largest aerospace company, from the national government.
  </p>
        <p>
   Founded in 1920 as the aircraft division of Canadian Vickers, Canadair became a separate company producing military and civilian aircraft in 1944. Acquired by
   <company id="104013">
    Electric Boat
   </company>
   (which became part of
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   ) in 1947, it was nationalized by the Canadian government in 1976. In 1978 Canadair introduced its Challenger 600 business jet, which became a major seller.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier began development of a commuter aircraft, the Canadian Regional Jet (a 50-seat derivative of the Challenger), in 1989. In 1990 the company bought US-based Learjet and its service centers, and two years later it acquired a stake in de Havilland, a regional aircraft maker, which it jointly owned with the Province of Ontario. The company bought German railroad equipment maker Waggonfabrik Talbot in 1995.

        <p>

   selected an international consortium in 1996 headed by Bombardier to produce high-speed trains, electric locomotives, and train maintenance facilities. Also that year the Global Express business jet made its first flight.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier doubled the size of its European operations in 1998 by buying German railcar maker Deutsche Waggonbau. In 1999 Bombardier announced the launch of its all-new business jet, the eight-passenger Continental.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sold its 50% stake in Shorts Missile Systems to Thomson-CSF (now
   <company id="90847">
    Thales
   </company>
   ) in 2000. Also that year Bombardier landed an $817 million contract to supply Spanish carrier Air Nostrum with 44 planes. It also inked a $2 billion deal to make 94 regional jets for
   <company id="10448">
    Delta Air Lines
   </company>
   ; the Delta order included options for an additional 406 aircraft through 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier signed a deal with
   <company id="14731">
    SkyWest
   </company>
   in 2001 worth about $1.4 billion for 64 Canadair regional jets. It was also selected by a bankruptcy court as winning bidder for Outboard Marine's Evinrude and Johnson outboard marine engine assets. Completing an agreement made the year before, Bombardier acquired DaimlerChrysler's
   <company id="53508">
    Adtranz
   </company>
   rail systems unit for about $725 million, making it part of its Bombardier Transportation division. Later in the year, the company announced that it would take a charge of about $600 million and lay off about 10% of its aerospace workforce (it also said that it would cut another 7% of that workforce if demand did not grow).
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier sought about $870 million in damages in 2002 from DaimlerChrysler (now
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler
   </company>
   ) over the Adtranz deal, claiming that the level of equity in Adtranz was overstated and that the costs related to third-party contracts were higher than stated at the time of the deal. Later that year Bombardier temporarily suspended business jet production. Bombardier divested its Recreational Products unit (snowmobiles and personal watercraft) in 2003.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier announced in 2004 that it was considering building a family (
   <em>
    CSeries
   </em>
   ) of 100- to 130-seat jets that would compete directly with
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   . The next year the company's board approved the larger
   <em>
    CSeries
   </em>
   planes, but it deferred its final decision; in 2006 Bombardier announced that it would focus instead on 80- to 100-seat passenger planes. In 2007 the company announced the new project's official name -- the CRJ1000. That same year Bombardier began a performance improvement project at its Transportation division. The project, which aimed to improve performance by trimming costs -- chiefly procurement costs -- began to show signs of effectiveness in 2007. The company continued to seek the right mix of suppliers for parts, including low-cost sources.
  </p>
        <p>
   CEO Paul Tellier resigned in 2004 amid rumored boardroom differences with Laurent Beaudoin, who assumed the CEO duties. A year later in 2005 the company sold its inventory finance division, which provided equipment financing, to
   <company id="106285">
    GE Commercial Finance
   </company>
   for $2.4 billion ($1.4 billion in cash and $1 billion in assumed liabilities).
  </p>
        <p>
   Deliveries and orders were booming for Bombardier's line of business jets before the worldwide credit crisis and recession hit in 2008. The company had 232 deliveries for business jets in fiscal 2008, compared with 212 in 2007 and 197 in 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   Laurent Beaudoin maintained his role as chairman when in 2008 he handed over the president and CEO titles to his son Pierre.
  </p>
        <p>
   The business and civil aircraft markets experienced their most turbulent conditions, since the aftermath of September 11, due to the global recession and credit crisis in 2009. The perpetually dicey financial condition of the airline industry -- due to fluctuating fuel prices and shifts in consumer spending -- affected demand for commercial aircraft. Bombardier's limited number of customers, many of which are government agencies or publicly held companies, watched as their own revenues fell due to the recession.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bombardier adapted by reducing its production of business jets and CRJ regional aircraft and reducing its workforce by 4,700 (about 13%). The company also took the opportunity to build on its customer services, opening a service center in Europe and a third service center in the US.
