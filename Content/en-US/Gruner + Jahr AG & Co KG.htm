   Gruner + Jahr (G+J) is the international magazine and newspaper publishing arm of German media giant
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   , which owns a 75% stake. The company publishes more than 500 magazines, newspapers, and digital publications in 30 countries, including
   <i>
    Stern
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Brigitte
   </i>
   in Germany and
   <em>
    Top Girl
   </em>
   in Italy. Gruner + Jahr operates through five divisions: G+J Germany; G+J International; G+J France; Print; and Corporate Services. Its US magazine operation, which made up about a quarter of revenue, was sold in 2005. The company also owns European financial newspaper
   <i>
    Financial Times Deutschland
   </i>
   . In addition, G+J offers commercial printing services and distribution services. The founding Jahr family owns 25% of the firm.

  <p>
   Gruner + Jahr traces its roots to 1947, when John Jahr and Axel Springer (founder of German media giant
   <company id="51022">
    Axel Springer Verlag
   </company>
   ) teamed up to publish the women's magazine
   <i>
    Constanze.
   </i>
   Springer left the partnership in 1960, and five years later Jahr joined printer Richard Gruner and publisher Gerd Bucerius to form Gruner + Jahr. The company soon became the second-largest publisher in West Germany with market-leading titles such as
   <i>
    Stern
   </i>
   (politics) and
   <i>
    Brigitte
   </i>
   (women's issues). Jahr retired from active management in 1970.
  </p>
  <p>
   German media conglomerate Bertelsmann acquired a minority stake in G+J in 1969, expanding its ownership to a controlling interest in 1973. With Bertelsmann's guidance -- and funding -- G+J began expanding throughout Europe, launching women's and science magazines in France and Spain. Aided by the relative strength of German currency, the company expanded into the US, buying
   <i>
    Parents
   </i>
   magazine in 1978 and launching a US version of successful German travel publication
   <i>
    GEO
   </i>
   the following year. (Several years and millions of dollars later, it sold the US version of
   <i>
    GEO
   </i>
   ). G+J also acquired
   <i>
    Young Miss
   </i>
   (renamed
   <i>
    YM
   </i>
   in 1986) and Waseca, Minnesota-based Brown Printing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerd Schulte-Hillen, head of G+J's printing division, was appointed chairman of G+J in 1981. The following year the company launched the French women's magazine
   <i>
    Prima.
   </i>
   It became one of the first non-US magazines to spread through Europe on a large scale when G+J began publishing a UK version in 1986. Also that year the company entered the newspaper business with the acquisition of Hamburg-based daily
   <i>
    Hamburger Morgenpost
   </i>
   (sold in 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 G+J joined Mirror Group (now
   <company id="90442">
    Trinity Mirror
   </company>
   ) to purchase Berliner Verlag, East Germany's largest newspaper publisher. (The newspaper was sold in 2002). The company became one of the top 10 US magazine publishers in 1994 after it bought
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times Company's
   </company>
   women's magazine division (
   <i>
    Family Circle, McCall's,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Fitness
   </i>
   ) for $325 million. However, as G+J struggled to integrate its new US titles into its portfolio, advertising declined and employees defected. It made huge investments to improve the titles. In 1998 the company announced an agreement with
   <i>
    <company id="41278">
     National Geographic
    </company>
   </i>
   to publish the magazine in Germany, France, and Poland. The following year it created G+J Multimedia Ventures to acquire stakes in new media companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   G+J joined UK media giant
   <company id="41338">
    Pearson
   </company>
   to launch a German version of the venerable
   <i>
    Financial Times
   </i>
   business daily in 2000. (The company acquired Pearson's 50% of the venture in 2008). That year former
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc.
   </company>
   executive Daniel Brewster was appointed to head G+J's US operations. Under his leadership, the company  went on an unfortunately timed buying spree and acquired
   <i>
    Inc.
   </i>
   from Boston-based Goldhirsh Group for about $200 million and later bought high-tech business magazine
   <i>
    Fast Company
   </i>
   from
   <i>
    <company id="47282">
     U.S. News
    </company>
   </i>
   publisher Mort Zuckerman for $340 million to anchor G+J's new business information group. The company also sold its UK magazines to
   <company id="40209">
    The Hearst Corporation
   </company>
   . Later that year newspaper division chief Bernd Kundrun was appointed chairman and CEO of G+J as Schulte-Hillen became chairman of the Supervisory Board.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was hit soon after by the tech market crash and advertising downturn in 2001 and stung by some high level editorial departures. That year the company relaunched the 125-year-old
   <i>
    McCall's
   </i>
   as
   <i>
    Rosie
   </i>
   (with talk show host Rosie O'Donnell). The magazine ceased publication in 2002, however, following editorial control struggles between O'Donnell and the publisher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The negative publicity from a court battle betwen O'Donnell and the publisher, in addition to the revelation that Gruner &amp; Jahr USA had misrepresented its circulation numbers, were factors in the 2004 exit of US division head Daniel Brewster. Brewster filed a lawsuit shortly after his dismissal, accusing the company of violating a non-disparagement clause in his contract by bad-mouthing him in the press. The company replaced Brewster with former Reiman Media head J. Russell Denson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Denson began his reign by dismantling a unit responsible for developing new magazine concepts, saying the company instead needed to concentrate on its foundation before its growth. Denson next announced the company would trim its annual costs by $25 million primarily through laying off up to100 employees and reducing the number of copies of magazines on the newsstand.Gruner &amp; Jahr sold its struggling teen title,
   <em>
    YM,
   </em>
   to
   <company id="57226">
    Advance Magazine Publishers
   </company>
   (doing business as Condé Nast)  in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   G+J exited all of its US magazines in 2005, ending an expensive and unsuccessful attempt at breaking into the market.
