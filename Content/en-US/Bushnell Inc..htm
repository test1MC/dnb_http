   In recent years, Bushnell has been focused on extending its reach into high-end optics and eyewear.
  </p>
        <p>
   To strengthen its outdoor accessories business, Bushnell in 2012 acquired Primos Hunting, a Mississippi-based company that specializes in making and marketing game calls and other hunting gear. The purchase built on Bushnell's Night Optics USA buy in 2011. Night Optics USA is known for its professional quality night vision and thermal technologies for commercial, law enforcement, and military applications.

        <p>
   Focused on eyewear, the company acquired the Cébé brand from Italy-based eyewear maker
   <company id="99473">
    Marcolin
   </company>
   in 2009. Cébé's name has been stamped on performance sunglasses, ski goggles, optical frames, and helmets. The deal has helped Bushnell to expand its stable of eyewear brands, which includes Bollé ski goggles and sunglasses and Serengeti all-purpose sunglasses.

   The company benefits from several longtime partnerships. It counts the National Rifle Association, International Hunter Education Association, and the American Birding Association among its alliances.

   The US government has been a Bushnell devotee for years. Extending a list of previous purchases, the government in 2009 awarded Bushnell a contract for a military version of its Elite line of spotting scopes, which are commonly used with firearms. The scopes have been used by the US's multinational forces.

        <p>
   Named for founder David Bushnell, the company started as a maker of binoculars, and its scope of business has expanded in the decades since. Bausch &amp; Lomb bought the company from its namesake in 1971; B&amp;L divested its sport optics division in 1995, and Bushnell came under the ownership of Wind Point Partners at the end of the decade. Wind Point extended Bushnell's reach to the eyewear market and bolstered its offering of outdoor accessories.
