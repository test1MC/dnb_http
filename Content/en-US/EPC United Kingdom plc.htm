   The company's strategy is to become a full-service provider, and EPC-UK has expanded from its main three units (explosives, blasting services, and additives), to include another two units (transport and EDSL). Its additives division markets more the 10,000 tons of 77%-80% sulphuric acid per annum. In 2014 EPC-UK's the additives unit at Bramble Island commissioned a pilot facility to recover a waste 77% sulphuric acid stream.
