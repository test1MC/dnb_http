   Plantronics' customers appreciate its hands-off approach. The company makes lightweight communications headsets that can be worn over the head, behind the ear, or in the ear, freeing hands for other tasks. Its other products include the Clarity brand of amplified telephone handsets for hearing-impaired users, text telephones, emergency response systems, and mobile phone headsets. Serving the consumer and business markets worldwide, Plantronics sells its products through distributors, manufacturers, and communications service providers. The company gets about 56% of its sales from US customers.

  <p>
   About three-quarters of its sales are from Plantronics' Enterprise equipment, which includes headsets outfitted for unified communications, other corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems. The rest of sales are from consumer products, which include Bluetooth and corded products for mobile phone applications, personal computer and gaming headsets, and products under its Clarity brand.

  <p>
   The company maintains a manufacturing plant in Tijuana, Mexico; light assembly is done at locations in California and Tennessee. Bluetooth and other products are outsourced to contract manufacturers in Asia. Sales offices are located in China, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the US, where 56% of sales originate, customers in Europe and Africa generate 25% of sales, customers in the Asia-Pacific region, 12%, and the Americas outside the US, 7%.

  <p>
   Revenue rose 5.6% in 2015 to $865 million thanks mainly to strong sales of headsets designed for Unified Communications (UC) and more demand for mobile, office and contact center products. Profit was down a bit (-0.10%) to $12.3 million in 2015 on higher costs in sales and research and development. Cash flow from operations came in at $154 million in 2015, up from $141 million in 2014.

   To expand its consumer reach, Plantronics launched new products targeted toward the growing stereo headset market. It is also developing other new consumer products launched in 2015 (Voyager Edge and Backbeat Pro) and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, UC represents its key long-term driver of revenue and profit growth, as business communications shift from voice-centric systems supported by traditional PBX infrastructure to those fully integrated with voice, video, and data. Product development and sales and marketing are focused on headsets and other audio products for UC, especially software for enterprises. UC is a system that connects desktop phones, instant messaging, video chat, VoIP, and other telecommunication services.
