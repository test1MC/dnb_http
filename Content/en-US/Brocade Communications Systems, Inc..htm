   Brocade Communications Systems maintains silky smooth computer network operations. A leading supplier of data center networking products, Brocade makes Fibre Channel switches and related software for connecting corporate storage systems and servers. Its products are used in storage area networks (SANs), which pool storage resources across enterprises for easier management and more efficient asset use. Brocade's products support internet connectivity and enterprise mobility, as well as key technologies such as software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and cloud computing. It generates about half of its sales in the US. Brocade agreed to sell to
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   for $5.9 billion in 2016.

   Broadcom, a maker of communications-related computer chips, agreed to pay $5.9 billion for Brocade. The addition of Brocade's networking gear to Broadcom's networking chips should help Broadcom better compete for business generated by data centers, cloud computing, and the internet of things. As part of the deal, Brocade's
   <company id="162887">
    Ruckus Wireless
   </company>
   , which was acquired in 2016, would be sold. Consummation of the transaction is expected in 2017.

   Brocade's products are made by such contract electronics manufacturers as
   <company id="58638">
    Hon Hai Precision

   (Foxconn Electronics),
   <company id="102381">
    Accton

   . The company also relies on
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics International
   </company>
   for service repair.
  </p>
  <p>
   Storage Area Netwiork (SAN) products -- which include switches, directors, and other products used for data storage -- account for a bit more than half of sales. Internet Protocol (IP) networking products (Ethernet switches and routers for network connectivity) and global services (maintenance, installation, consulting, and other assistance) contribute about 30% and 17%, respectively.

  <p>
   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for about 50% of sales. Outside the US, it gets about 30% of sales from the EMEA region and about 14% from the Asia/Pacific region. On its own, Japan supplies 4% of Brocade's sales.

   With help from the acquisition of Ruckus, Brocade reported a 4% revenue increase to $2.3 billion in 2016 (ended October). The inclusion of Ruckus revenue boosted the IP Networking segment as did a change in the way Brocade recognizes revenue from distributors. Sales inthe company's SAN product business dropped 6% in 2016 because of a weaker demand for storage in general and operational issues at some of its OEM partners. Although Brocade shipped fewer units, the average selling price increased about 4% with the introduction of the Gen 6 Fibre Channel product and higher density configurations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brocade's profit tumbled 37% to $214 million in 2016 as it dealt with higher costs associated with acquisitions. Ruckus Wireless and another deal brought increased spending on research and development and sales and marketing, due in part, to compensation. Brocade also incurred expenses related to the acquisition and integration of Ruckus into operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company generated about $410 million in cash from operations in 2016 (down from $447 million in 2015). Cash flow consisted of net income offset by cash used for changes in assets and liabilities

  <p>
   As networking technology relies less on hardware, Brocade is building up its software portfolio especially in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Smarter software is taking on the role of switching and balancing networks loads, a job that had been handled by hardware. The company has reduced spending on its hardware-based application delivery controller product line and boosted investment in its software-based application delivery controller products. The release of the Gen 6 Fibre Channel technology in boosted 2016 revenue and the company expects that to continue in 2017. The technology was picked up by OEMs

   (including EMC),
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu

    Hitachi Data Systems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="47100">
    NetApp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond its in-house research Brocade is adding software capabilities through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The challenge for Brocade is to ramp up its IP Networking product line to generate more revenue before its hardware-oriented SAN product line loses too much steam.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition by Broadcom, expected to close 2017, should open new markets for Brocade. As part of the deal, however, the IP Networking segment (including Ruckus Wireless), the fastest growing part of the company, is to be sold to satisfy regulatory concerns.

   In 2016 Brocade closed its acquisition of
   <company id="162887">
    Ruckus Wireless
   </company>
   , which makes products for large-scale WiFi connectivity, for $1.5 billion. Brocade will move to sell its networking products to customers of Ruckus ($373 million in revenue in 2015). It will also open its markets to Ruckus products.
  </p>
  <p>
   On March 29, 2016, Brocade completed its acquisition of a privately held developer of software for data center automation. The deal accelerates Brocade's efforts to deliver scalable, open source fabric automation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Brocade bought Connectem Inc., a developer of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology, to broaden its software-based mobile networking portfolio. Also in 2015 Brocade acquired the SteelApp business unit from
   <company id="132353">
    Riverbed Technology
   </company>
   . The SteelApp product line strengthens Brocade's software networking portfolio for IP data center deployments.

   In 2003 Brocade acquired Rhapsody Networks, which added the SilkWorm Fabric AP and SilkWorm Multiprotocol Router to its product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The storage networking market has seen widespread consolidation in recent years, with both startups and industry leaders being targeted. Brocade acquired rival
   <company id="60232">
    McDATA
   </company>
   in 2007. The stock swap was valued at approximately $973 million. Brocade has a history of using acquisitions to widen its product and technology portfolio. It also purchased network acceleration specialist Silverback Systems in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year it acquired network switch maker
   <company id="59146">
    Foundry Networks
   </company>
   for $2.6 billion. The purchase of Foundry added a number of new products to Brocade's lineup, including network edge and core switches, network management software, and Web switches and accelerators. It also moved the company into more direct competition with such companies as
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54603">
    Juniper Networks
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Gregory Reyes, who resigned as Brocade's CEO in 2005 in the wake of allegations over the company's past practices in granting stock options, was convicted in 2007 on 10 federal criminal charges for backdating stock options and later sentenced to 21 months in prison and a fine of $15 million. His conviction was overturned in 2009, and he was retried in 2010. The second trial ended in conviction on nine of the 10 charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another executive, former HR VP Stephanie Jensen, was separately tried and convicted on backdating charges in 2007. On appeal, her conviction was upheld, but the appeals court ordered the trial court to resentence Jensen, who originally was sentenced to serve four months in prison and to pay a fine of $1.25 million. The trial judge then cut her prison term in half, to two months, and retained the fine.
