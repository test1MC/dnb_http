   Eagle Materials is perched near the top of the building materials business. The company manufactures and distributes cement and gypsum wallboard, which together account for nearly 75% of its total sales. Eagle Materials also produces ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and recycled paperboard. Its products are sold to residential, commercial, and industrial construction customers throughout the US. The company operates about 25 plants and manufacturing facilities. It also has about 100 railcars for shipping its wallboard products to customers across the country. Founded in 1963, Eagle Materials was spun off by homebuilder

   </company>
   in 2004.

  <p>
   Eagle Materials operates five main business segments: Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, Recycled Paperboard, and Oil and Gas Proppants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cement sales accounts for nearly 40% of Eagle's total sales, while Gypsum Wallboard accounts for another 35%. Its Paperboard and Concrete and Aggregates segments each make up another roughly 10% of total sales, while Oil and Gas Proppants generate around 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to wholly-owned plants in Illinois, Wyoming, and Nevada, Eagle owns a 50% stake in Texas Lehigh Cement Co., in Buda, Texas. Eagle manufactures gypsum wallboard at five plants, representing about 35% of sales. Republic Paperboard Co., the company's paperboard business, is located in Oklahoma and accounts for about 20% Eagle's sales. Concrete and aggregates make up the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dallas-based Eagle Materials sells its gypsum wallboard throughout the US, focusing on markets nearest its production facilities. The company sells cement in six regional markets, including northern Nevada and California, the greater Chicago area, the Rocky Mountain region, the Central Plains region, and Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
   Most of the demand for Eagle's cement products come from the infrastructure, commercial construction, and residential construction. About 50% of the total demand comes from public works infrastructure projects.
  </p>

  <p>
   Eagle's sales and profits have been rising at a healthy clip over the past few years thanks to increased demand for cement, concrete, and other aggregate materials amidst the strengthening US economy. The company's more recent Oil and Gas Proppants business has also been boosting annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eagle Materials' revenue jumped by 19% to a record $1.07 billion in fiscal 2015 (ended March), thanks to a combination of its CRS acquisition in the Oil and Proppants business, higher average net selling prices across all of its materials segments, and higher sales volumes across all segments except aggregates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher revenue in FY2015 drove the company's profits higher by 50% to $186.85 million (the highest level since 2007), while operating cash spiked by 37% to $234.12 million thanks to higher cash earnings.

  <p>
   Strengthened demand for construction products as the US economy has gained steam has buoyed Eagle's prospects for 2015 and beyond. With its cement sales network spanning the entire nation, and with infrastructure spending, industrial construction, and residential building activity expected to heat up, the company anticipated that calender year 2015 would be good for cement demand across all of its regional cement markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides growing on its own, the company likes to acquire aggregate, cement, or other raw building material-producers that complement or bolster its material product offerings. In recent years, the company has been looking to acquire frac-sand producers to expand its service offerings in lucrative shale regions.

  <p>
   In 2014, Eagle Materials agreed to purchase CRS Proppants as well as its subsidiaries including Great Northern Sand LLC, which has long supplied high-quality northern-white frac-sand to the energy industry. The company expressed that CRS Proppants' services were highly complementary to its own frac-sand operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eagle's Audubon Materials subsidiary agreed in late 2012 to purchase a pair of cement plants in Missouri and Oklahoma from rival
   <company id="10880">
    Lafarge North America
   </company>
   for about $446 million in cash. The purchase, which included six distribution terminals, two aggregates quarries, eight ready-mix concrete plants, and a fly ash business, marked Eagle's return to acquisition mode.

  <p>
   Prior to the recession, the firm had designs on expansion, especially in its core wallboard and cement business. The company opened a fifth gypsum wallboard plant in 2007 to increase production capacity, but the addition proved untimely.
