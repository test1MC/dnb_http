   Michael Levy, who previously founded Lexicon (handheld language translators) and Sports-Tech (video analysis systems and software for sports teams), founded SportsLine in 1994. By the time the site launched in 1995, it already had 40,000 registered users. Levy tapped
   <company id="12404">
    Turner Broadcasting
   </company>
   's top sports sales executive, Mark Mariani, to line up advertisers for SportsLine (which had also begun radio broadcasting) in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early the following year SportsLine inked a deal with
   <company id="10256">
    CBS
   </company>
   , giving the network a 12% stake (later boosted to 38%) in the company. SportsLine's main site was renamed cbs.sportsline.com, and CBS agreed to provide $57 million in advertising and on-air promotion for the site during sports events broadcast by CBS, including the 1998 Winter Olympics. It also signed an exclusive 10-year agreement with Michael Jordan to create and provide content for his own official Web site and launched its sports odds site, VegasInsider.
  </p>
  <p>
   SportsLine went public in 1997, and the following year it bought Internet golf company GolfWeb for about $15 million and introduced SportsLine WorldWide, which offers sports information in a variety of languages (Spanish, German, Dutch, Portuguese). It also inked deals to distribute its content through Internet search providers
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   and
   <company id="100062">
    Excite
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also expanded in Europe in 1999 by purchasing
   <company id="41832">
    Reuters
   </company>
   ' Sportsweb.com site and setting up London-based unit Sports.com with partners
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , MediaOne Ventures, and Reuters. The next year the company acquired Las Vegas Sports Consultants (betting odds) through its VegasInsider unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 SportsLine entered into a licensing and sponsorship agreement with the
   <company id="40327">
    National Basketball Association
   </company>
   . It also jumped on the Internet bandwagon of 2001 by cutting about 20% of its workforce, citing the poor economy and weak advertising market, and terminated its Asian Sportsline.com joint venture agreement. The company's fortunes improved later that year, though, when it scored a deal to operate the
   <company id="40330">
    NFL
   </company>
   's official Web site. In 2003 SportsLine sold its Las Vegas Sports Consultants and VegasInsider operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Viacom acquired the 62% of the company it didn't already own in 2004 and early the following year Stephen Snyder was tapped to lead SportsLine as its general manager. CBS formed CBS Digital Media that year under the leadership of
   <company id="58506">
    MarketWatch.com
   </company>
   founder Larry Kramer to oversee the new media operations of the broadcasting division, including SportsLine. In late 2005 Viacom split into two separate companies, with CBS Digital Media (and CBS SportsLine) joining the newly-formed
   <company id="12435">
    CBS Corporation
   </company>
   . CBS Digital Media later became CBS Interactive.
  </p>
  <p>
   CBS SportsLine changed its name to CBSSports.com in 2007.
