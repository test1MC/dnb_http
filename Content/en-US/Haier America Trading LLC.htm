   Haier America became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Haier Group in 2013 after acquiring the shares held by minority joint venture shareholders. The share purchase was made to further align the Chinese company's global resources toward growth of the Haier brand in North and South America. Further underlining its commitment to the North American market, Haier is expanding its operations here with a new headquarters in Wayne, New Jersey slated to open in the second half of 2014.
