   Alpha and Omega Semiconductor (AOS) really
   <em>
    is
   </em>
   the alpha and omega of the semiconductor industry. The company designs and sells more than 1,500 types of analog power semiconductors, including power ICs (integrated circuits) and power discrete (non-integrated circuits) chips, such as power MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors). (Power semiconductors are used in power switches to control the amount of electricity needed to run electronic devices.) AOS primarily uses

  <p>
   AOS makes about three quarters of its revenue from its discrete segment with Power IC contributing 19% and test and packing accounting for 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   AOS's power discrete products consist primarily of low, medium and high voltage power MOSFETs. AOS can update its Power ICs quickly with a multi-chip approach in which it can change only the MOSFETs without changing the power management IC.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AOS's two geographic markets of note are Hong Kong, 85% of revenue, and China, 13%. The US and other countries split the remaining 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates a fabrication facility in Oregon for product development.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shanghai Hua Hong Grace Electronic Company Limited is the company's third-party wafer manufacturer. Its share of AOS business has declined from 38% of AOS's wafer production in 2013 to 25% in 2015 (ended June).
  </p>
  <p>
   AOS's packaging and test operation is in Shangai. The company's have the capacity to package and test more than 500 million parts per month.
  </p>

  <p>
   AOS sells most of its products to distributors, who sell them to OEMs. The company's biggest distributors in 2015 were WPG, 36% of revenue, and Promate, 25% of revenue. AOS sells directly to Samsung, which accounts for some 11% of AOS revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sells to ODMs (original design manufacturers) through distributors. ODMs have traditionally been contract manufacturers for OEMs, but have begun making their own products. ODMs using AOS products Compal Electronics, Inc., Hon Hai (Foxconn), Quanta Computer In., Pegatron, Wistron Corp., and AOC International.
  </p>
  <p>
   AOS is not a big advertiser, spending just $500,000 on advertising in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AOS broke a series of annual sales declines with a 3% increase to $328 million in 2015 (ended June). Power IC product sales increase with an 11% rise in unit shipments. Revenue from packaging and testing services fell because of reduced demand from declining PC sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss increased in 2015 to about $8 million compared to a $4.6 million loss in 2014. AOS had higher income taxes and cost of goods sold also increased in 2015. The higher taxes stemmed from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic markets and a decrease in the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations decreased by about $10 million in 2015 from 2014 because of changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2015, AOS maintained a program to diversify and increase the number of products it sells by developing new silicon and packaging platforms. It also seeks to develop higher performance MOSFETs. The company targets markets and applications that include merchant power supplies, flat panel TVs, smart phones, tablets, gaming consoles, lighting, datacom, home appliances, and industrial motor controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the past two years, AOS has released the AOZ1334, a single-channel EZPowerâ„¢ Smart Load Switch, for tablets, notebooks, set-top-boxes, solid-state drives, networking equipment, and LCD TVs; six new 25V and 30V MOSFETs (AON7760, AON7510, AON7758, AON7764, AON7536, and AON7538), for personal computing, gaming, servers, and telecom/datacom applications; and AOC2804 and AOC2806 for batter protection for one- and two-cell portable battery pack applications such as smart phones, tablets, media players and wearable devices.
