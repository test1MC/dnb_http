  <p>
   The construction market's demand for new equipment has prompted KONE to expand its capabilities. The company aims to capitalize on infrastructure opportunities to modernize the elevators and escalators operating in urban markets, where approximately 20% of elevator and escalator systems are more than 20 years old.

  <p>
   KONE improves its domestic footprint through select acquisitions by its parent company. In 2016 it acquired the service and repair business of Elevators Unlimited. The deal expanded KONE's scope inside the greater Denver metropolitan area.
