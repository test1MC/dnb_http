   Aptuit has grown through the acquisition of facilities. Once it has established a presence in a market, the company also works to strike partnerships and contracts with local drug developers. For instance, in 2013 it entered a supply agreement to provide APIs to
   <company id="156161">
    Aegerion Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   . That year Aptuit's Verona center expanded its services to include nutritional ingredient development through a partnership with Microbion and Total Quality Foods; and in 2012 Aptuit extended its strategic partnership with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   for dedicated drug development work at The Aptuit Center for Drug Discovery &amp; Development in Verona.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upgrading its R&amp;D capacity, in 2013, Aptuit formed the Aptuit Scientific Advisory Board  comprised of scientific experts from within the company. The board meets regularly to assess Aptuit's current and long term scientific capabilities and objectives and recommends actions.
