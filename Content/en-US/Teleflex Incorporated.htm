   Teleflex helps medical professionals manage fluids and oxygen in critical care settings. Teleflex makes surgical instruments, medical devices, and disposable supplies for hospital procedures, especially catheters for all parts of the body. It divides its medical products by use into critical care, surgical care, and cardiac care. It also makes custom medical instruments which it sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Although the company primarily distributes its products to hospitals and health care providers (more than 80% of sales) in more than 150 countries, the US accounts for more than half of sales. Teleflex manufactures its products in the US, the Czech Republic, Germany, Malaysia, and Mexico.

  <p>
   Teleflex's six operating segments include: Vascular North America; Anesthesia/Respiratory North America; Surgical North America; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Asia; and OEM. The company's OEM segment designs and manufactures medical devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers while the rest of the divisions makes and sell critical care, surgical, and cardiac medical devices for hospitals and health care providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its custom medical instrument services include design, engineering, testing, manufacturing, and packaging. The OEM division markets products, including catheters, devices, sutures, and performance fibers, under the Deknatel and TFX OEM brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teleflex's critical care products make up two-thirds of its sales. They include devices used to manage vascular access, anesthesia, respiratory care, and urologic and other procedures; they are marketed under the Arrow and Gibeck brands. Its surgical care line features single-use surgical products used in both traditional, minimally invasive, and robotic surgical procedures. Its brands include the Deknatel, Pleur-evac, and Weck names. Teleflex' cardiac care products include a variety of catheters and bigger ticket equipment to deliver oxygen during cardiac surgery.

  <p>
   Teleflex has nearly 30 global manufacturing sites; major locations are found in the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Malaysia, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Domestic sales account for about half of the company's revenue.

  <p>
   In 2013 Teleflex's revenue increased 9% from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion due, mainly, to the $121 million brought in by new acquisitions. Critical care and surgical care products lead the growth while sales slowed in OEM and cardiac care. After restructuring-related asset impairment charges in 2012, the company once again reported positive net income of about $151 million in 2013. Cash flow has also improved - it grew 19%, to $230 million, due to the increase in net income and it used less cash on income tax and receivables.

  <p>
   Teleflex strategic initiatives include investing in new technologies, developing new products and extending product lines, and expanding the use of its existing products in current markets and new geographic areas. The company is also looking to make select acquisitions and participate in collaborations and licensing agreements to build its pipeline. As the company grows, it is working to leverage its direct sales force and distribution network and achieve economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution. It restructured in 2014 to consolidate and better align its divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it introduced nearly 30 new products and line extensions.

  <p>
   Teleflex acquired Mayo Healthcare, a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the Australian market, in 2014 for $28.5 million. This followed a very busy year in acquisitions when the company picked up device makers in the vascular, anesthesia, surgical care groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016 the company agreed to buy medical device firm
   <company id="60751">
    Vascular Solutions
   </company>
   in a $1 billion transaction. Vascular Solutions makes catheters for vascular conditions, including the Pronto extraction catheter, as well as the Vari-Lase laser system for treating varicose veins. The acquisition will boost Teleflex's vascular and interventional business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early the following year, Teleflex agreed to buy
   <company id="113793">
    Pyng Medical
   </company>
   , a Canadian firm which commercializes devices for emergency medical treatments.
