   , which enjoys a cult following. Through partnership agreements, Hasbro UK offers items under the Littlest Pet Shop, My Little Pony, Play-Doh, Spider-Man, Star Wars, and Transformers brand names.

   Hasbro UK operates its business through a headquarters office and a warehouse. Its parent's Global Operations segment arranges for product manufacturing and sourcing for the subsidiary. The corporate culture at the UK office includes service projects for the local community through the Big Kids Charity Bike Ride and volunteering time to paint murals, trim invasive plants at a park, and help design a play area for school children.

  <p>
   The UK subsidiary has developed its roots, but in recent years has not grown. Generating nearly half of its revenue outside the US, parent Hasbro is more aggressively growing its business in Eastern Europe and in emerging markets in Asia and Latin and South America rather than focusing on extending the reach of its UK business. To this end, it established a presence in Peru in 2010 and in Colombia in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the UK and across its international segment, Hasbro has built several key brands, such as Littlest Pet Shop, Nerf, Monopoly, FurReal Friends, and Beyblade, among others.
