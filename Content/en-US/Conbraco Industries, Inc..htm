   Folks at Conbraco Industries refuse to go with the flow. Conbraco, an acronym of its original name Consolidated Brass Co., makes backflow valves and various stainless steel and bronze products for regulating the flow of water or other fluids for myriad plumbing and process industry applications. Products include butterfly and safety relief valves, check valves, and actuators, sold under the APOLLO Valves brand. In 1968 the company launched the Apollo Series 70 ball valve, a part that became an industry standard worldwide. Conbraco is a subsidiary of
   <company id="91921">
    Aalberts Industries
   </company>
   , a Netherlands-based industrial services and flow control company.

   Conbraco is stationed in Matthews, North Carolina, and has foundries and manufacturing locations in Pageland and Conway, South Carolina.

   Aalberts takes advantage of the synergies between it and Conbraco for producing products critical to the chemical industry, oil, gas, and energy companies, and pulp and paper plants. Conbraco also sells product lines to the commercial building and fire protection industries, as well as retailers.

  <p>
   Each company stands to benefit from collaboratively developing a complete package under three brands (APOLLO Valves, EPC (Elkhart Products) metallic fittings, and LASCO Fitting's plastic offerings) that penetrate North American and European markets. Aalberts' sales network crosses almost every country in Europe. Moreover, Conbraco's state of the art foundry operations introduce new technologies, not part of Aalberts' flow control businesses. Conversely, Aalberts' automated machining and assembly expertise enhances Conbraco's manufacturing operations.

  <p>
   Conbraco's roots trace back to 1928, when two Detroit-based manufacturers merged their brass valves and fittings businesses: American Lubricator and Brass Co. and Sterling &amp; Skinner Manufacturing Co.
