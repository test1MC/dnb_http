   Back in dentistry school, founder Dr. Stuart Nordstrom, even in his most creative dreams, likely didn't glimpse what the future held for him. Creative Nail Design (CND), a family-run company, makes nail polish, skin care, and nail care products. In the 1970s one of Nordstrom's dental patients (also a manicurist) recognized the scent of sculpted porcelain nails in a mix Nordstrom used to create a temporary cap and challenged him to improve upon existing nail enhancement products. That he did, and today CND's products are sold nationwide through retailers such as
   <company id="109606">
    Sally Beauty Supply
   </company>
   and
   <company id="60271">
    Ulta

   . Its brand names include Cuticle Eraser, Scentsations, SolarBalm, and SolarOil. CND is owned by
