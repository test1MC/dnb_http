   Penn Color might not have anything to do with your pen color, but there's a good chance that some piece of plastic within your line of sight is colored by Penn. The Pennsylvania company manufactures dispersions, colorants, inks, and coatings primarily for the plastics industry, (for use in synthetic fiber, films, compounds, and cast and extruded sheet products), but also for automobile makers, printers, construction materials, packaging, wall covering and flooring, and even for use in nail polish. A leader in the global color industry, Penn Color serves customers worldwide.

   Penn Color has seven manufacturing plants in the US, in the Midwest (Wisconsin), Southeast (Georgia), and Northeast (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) and one apiece in India and the Netherlands. It also has a research and development lab in China.

   Innovation is a key to Penn Color's growth. In 2013 it launched Pennacle-L, an enhanced colorant for PET converters who prefer to use liquid colorants for high volume beverage applications.

  <p>
   Expanding its production capacity, in 2011 Penn Color opened a new 70,000 sq. ft. masterbatch manufacturing facility in Venray, the Netherlands, to produce color masterbatches for companies in the plastic industry (which make building products, appliances, and packaging for consumer food, household chemicals, medical, and personal care and other uses). That year, it also completed a 52,000 sq. ft. plant in Milton, Wisconsin, to produce color concentrates for companies in the plastic industry.
