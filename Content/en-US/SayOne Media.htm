   <em>
    The Manufacturer,
   </em>
   a trade magazine that includes content related to the manufacturing industry. The title has both print and digital editions. Hennik also publishes
   <em>
    Lean Management Journal

Both publications provide industry news, analysis, case studies, and reviews. In addition, the company's ERP Connect is a conference for manufacturers that addresses topics on the use of enterprise software.

   In fiscal 2015, revenue was up 10% to £2.4 million, due to return on investment in people and systems -- particularly web and social media based communications. Net income climbed 57% to £118,143 on the back of higher revenue and lower tax paid.
