   If you've ever enlisted the help of a monkey to match your shirt and shorts, you're likely to be familiar with Garan. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes coordinated apparel for infants, toddlers, and children. Products are sold under its customers' private labels, as well as its own brand, Garanimals. Characters like Charley Chimp help young children dress themselves with coordinated hang-tags. Most of Garan's products are sold through distribution centers in the US to major national chains, such as

   The apparel maker relies on one customer for most of its sales. Sales to big-box retailer
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   accounts for more than 90% of Garan's revenue. The company also earns revenue through licensing agreements with independent third parties.

   It's focused on social media and content generation to boost its brand online. In 2012 Garan launched a
   <em>
    Learn, Play, Share
   </em>
   website that incorporates its Garanimals blog, which offers information, tips, and trends related to animals, fashion, and technology.
