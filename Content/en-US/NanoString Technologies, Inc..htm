   NanoString Technologies helps unspool the mystery of the human genome. The company makes a complex genomic analysis device that can be used onsite at clinical laboratories, instead of being shipped offsite for study. Called the nCounter Analysis System, the device uses tissue extracted from a tumor to analyze up to 800 genes in a single experiment. These tests can help researchers understand the molecular basis of some diseases, such as cancer. In addition, its Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay, a molecular diagnostics test, went into wide release in late 2013. Founded in 2003, the company went public in mid-2013.

  <p>
   The company began selling the nCounter Analysis System to life sciences researchers in 2008. To date, it has sold more than 140 systems. The systems are made by two third-party manufacturers, Japan-based Precision System Science and Oregon-based Korvis Automation. NanoString does produce its own consumable products, such as reagents, at its Seattle facility.

  <p>
   NanoString's consumables segment accounted for 43% of revenue in 2014 while instruments made up 39%. The segment responsible for the ProSigna in vitro diagnostic kits was just 1% of revenue, but it grew by 269% in 2014 from 2013.

   The company generates 68% of its revenue from the US with Europe and the Middle East accounting for 19%, and Asia-Pacific, 13%.

   NanoString uses direct sales calls, trade shows, seminars, academic conferences, and Internet marketing to help sell the nCounter Analysis System, which can have a sales cycle of up to one year. It uses a direct sales force in North America; outside the US, it uses both direct sales and a network of about a dozen distributors around the world. So far its sales and marketing efforts target department heads, research lab directors, and research scientists at academic institutions, biopharmaceutical companies, publicly and privately funded research institutions, and contract research organizations.

  <p>
   While NanoString's revenue has moved steadily up the ladder year-to-year, it has compiled increasingly deeper net losses. In 2014, revenue reached $47.6 million, a 51% increase from 2013. The company's number of installed base customer grew 43% in 2014 and that growth helped drive growth of its consumables business. The company posted a net loss of $50 million in 2014 compared to a net loss of almost $30 million in 2013. Besides higher costs in sales and research and development that have an impact on growth, NanoString's higher cost also included paying off a former credit facility in 2014. Cash flow from operations remained negative in 2014 at $38 million, higher than the negative $31 million from 2013.
