   Richard Gere's Armani-clad

   helped to boost what Giorgio Armani had already built. Armani is known for the sleek, unstructured look of its men's and women's suits. The firm licenses its name for perfume, watches, and accessories, but apparel still accounts for more than half of sales. Armani's retail empire spans more than 35 countries and includes some 300 stores. Its stores bear such names as Giorgio Armani, Armani Exchange, Emporio Armani, Armani and Collezioni. Armani owns Simint, the Italian holder of the Armani jeans license, and has been moving the production of other lines in-house. Despite persistent flotation flirtations, the designer maintains ownership of his company.

   After experimenting with medical school, photography, and fashion-buying, Giorgio Armani designed a menswear line for Nino Cerruti in 1964. Six years later Armani left Cerruti to affix his own label on the fashion industry. He soon made his name when in 1974 his leather bomber jackets changed the way leather was used in fashion. In 1975 Armani and partner Sergio Galeotti sold their Volkswagen and used the money to form Giorgio Armani S.p.A. Galeotti ran the business; Armani made the clothes. The company soon launched the Armani label with the "rumpled jacket," a loosely unstructured alternative to traditional suits. Fred Pressman, buyer for upscale department store Barneys New York, was one of the company's first customers, spending $10,000 for the exclusive New York rights to Armani. Americans spent $90,000 on Armani goods during the company's first year in business. As the company grew, it signed a license with Italian textile company Holding di Partecipazioni to produce its men's and women's lines.

   As business went global in the 1980s, Armani suits (for men and women) were an icon of high-powered success. Hollywood's love affair with the designer began in 1980 when the designer dressed actor Richard Gere in the film

   </i>
   . The film and Gere's character inextricably linked Armani's understated look with Hollywood glamour. Two years later the designer appeared on the cover of

   magazine, the first to do so since Christian Dior in the 1940s. In the late 1980s Armani helped start a popular trend of designers dressing celebrities. Armani covered basketball coach Pat Riley and film stars Sharon Stone and Warren Beatty from the Los Angeles store that he opened in 1988. Through its manufacturing subsidiary Simint, Armani launched the mass-market label Armani Exchange in 1991. In 1996 the company opened flagships in Tokyo, London, and New York.

   In 2000, amid concerns about the company's ability to outlive the man, Armani appointed several key executives and began bringing major production licenses back in-house. The company formed a joint venture with fellow Italian designer Ermenegildo Zegna to produce and market his menswear collections and bought two factories from Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali. Armani also launched a cosmetics line, a new perfume, and a home furnishings line. Giorgio Armani was also the first living designer to be featured in a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.

   Armani formed a joint venture company with Vestimenta in 2001 for the production and distribution of men's and women's clothing. That year it also bought the rest of Simint it didn't already own.

   2002 brought the acquisition of two new production companies: Deanna SpA, manufacturer of knitwear, and I Guardi and four specialized shoemaking factories.
