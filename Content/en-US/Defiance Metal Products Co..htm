   Defiance Metal -- which takes its name from its headquarters in Defiance, Ohio -- is a precision fabricator of metal parts and assemblies. Its line runs from brackets and cases, to chassis, framing, housings, panels, and racks. In addition to fabricating and finishing sheet metal, the company manufactures sheet metal forms. Defiance Metal's parts and assembly process begins with design and engineering, and moves on to CNC (computer numerical control) laser cutting, robotic welding, heavy stamping, and painting. Products cater to commercial and military vehicle, heavy-duty truck, and HVAC&amp; markets. DMP has been in operation since 1931. It started as a tool and die shop and expanded to a stamping facility.

   DMP balances its business on diverse, less consumer driven arenas such as buses and medium to heavy-duty vehicles, commercial construction and HVAC, and military supply contracts. Its one-stop, on-site lineup has also helped to reduce the negative exposure to economic downturns. For example, in addition to complex metal parts and assemblies, the metal fabrication company provides value-added services such as metal finishing, using both epoxy coating and powder coating, as well as logistics and packaging services.
