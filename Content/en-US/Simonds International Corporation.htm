   Whether or not you measure a thousand times, Simonds gives you an edge for cutting once. Founded in 1832, Simonds International is North America's oldest manufacturer of industrial cutting tools. The company maintains more than a million square feet of manufacturing space for producing a variety of tools for cutting through metal, wood, paper, and plastics. Its metal-cutting products include carbon, bimetal, and carbide-tipped bandsaw blades. Other products include wood-cutting items, such as bits, shanks, circular saws, machine knives, wide bandsaws, and circle saws, as well as files (a hand-cutting tool for producing a smooth finish on materials), steel rules, and farrier rasps.

  <p>
   Simonds has achieved the status of the oldest maker of industrial cutting tools in North America by serving several industries. The company caters to nearly a dozen customer groups, such as aerospace, automotive, lumbermill, metalworking, pallets, pulp/paper, tree care/tree service, woodchip processing, and fabricators, among others.

  <p>
   Simonds has steadily developed its presence in the marketplace by expanding its operations to about a dozen facilities in Canada, Germany, and the US. In 2012 the company established a new Central US Weld &amp; Distribution Center in Louisville, Kentucky. Focused on bandsaw welding and finishing systems, the facility provides faster order turnaround for customers, higher order fill rates, and high weld quality.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have also provided Simonds with a vehicle for boosting its customer base, as well as for solidifying its position as an industry-leading manufacturer of cutting tools. To further expand in the Western Canadian saw mill market and strengthen Simonds as a top supplier of wide band saws, the company in late 2012 purchased the wide band saw manufacturing assets and circular saw finishing assets -- located in Langley, British Columbia -- belonging to Cal Saw Canada.
