   If you have to ask, "How much?" you probably can't afford a Bulgari bauble. One of the world's leading luxury jewelry and watch companies (behind

   ), Bulgari has been crafting prized pieces for the rich and famous for about 125 years. Today Bulgari reaches a larger -- but no less exclusive -- market through more than 280 well-placed Bulgari stores, as well as select retailers worldwide. Japan is the Rome-based company's biggest market. Bulgari's lines include jewelry, watches, perfumes, leather goods, silks, pens, and eyewear (under license with Italy's

   in 2011.

   Sotirio Bulgari, a descendant of Greek silversmiths, moved to Italy during the middle of the 19th century and in 1884 opened a shop in Rome selling "artistic silverware, antiquities, and jewelry." (He also Italianized his name to Bvlgari, as it still appears in advertising today.) To combat the slow Roman summer, Bulgari packed up his limited stock and summered with the rest of Italy in the mountain resort town of St. Moritz, selling his wares to vacationers. By 1905 he had six shops and, with his sons, he opened the store on the prestigious via Condotti in Rome across from the Spanish Steps, a famous landmark. This shop remains the most prestigious and well-known Bulgari store.

   The sons took an interest in stones and jewels and expanded the business in that direction in the early decades of the 20th century. The senior Bulgari made changes of his own: He departed from the traditional French styling of the day and created his own unique, Greek-inspired style. The jewels caught the eyes of Hollywood, and stars from Mary Pickford to Tyrone Power were seen wearing Bulgari. Grace Kelly wore Bulgari before and after she became a princess. In the 1940s Bulgari began making watches.

   In 1963 one of the most famous rings of all time was purchased at a Bulgari shop by Richard Burton for his

   co-star Liz Taylor, who was married to singer Eddie Fisher at the time. By the 1970s Bulgari was ready for international expansion, opening stores in New York (its first overseas), Paris, Geneva, and Monte Carlo. The Bulgari-Bulgari was introduced in 1977, and it is still the company's best-selling watch. In the early 1980s the company established watch division Bulgari Time in Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Bulgari kicked off a campaign to expand its brand by introducing Au the Vert, a unisex fragrance, which was soon followed by Bulgari pour Femme. In 1995 Bulgari went public and was listed on the Italian stock exchange and the international SEAQ of London. The following year the company's brand expansion continued with the introduction of silk scarves. In 1997 Bulgari formed a joint venture with Ferragamo Group to market and distribute Ferragamo and Ungaro perfumes. Also in 1997 the company introduced silk ties for men, eyewear (licensed to Luxottica), leather goods, and other accessories such as keychains, pens, cufflinks, and tie clips.

   Bulgari moved into housewares in 1998, signing a licensing agreement with tableware manufacturer Rosenthal for china, crystal, stemware, and flatware. In 2000 Bulgari introduced Rettangolo (1930's-styled watches) and licensed its name to luggage and accessories for Cadillac's retro-car, the Imaj. The company also agreed to buy three Swiss watchmaking units from Singapore-based jewelry retailer The Hour Glass Ltd.

   In March 2001 Bulgari formed a joint venture with
   <company id="56078">
    Marriott International
   </company>
   to create a chain of Bulgari-branded hotels and resorts. In 2002 Bulgari opened its first Russian store in Moscow.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the Bulgari store on Fifth Avenue in New York City reopened following a renovation. The company also opened its largest store in the world, the 11-storey Ginza Tower in Tokyo. In 2008 it opened its largest store in Europe, located in Paris.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Bulgari formed a partnership with Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (China) that will expand the distribution of its watches there.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2011, the Bulgari family traded its 50% stake in the company for a 3.5% stake in LVMH, which launched a takeover of the Italian firm. In September Bulgari became a subsidiary of LVMH, when the French luxury goods firm completed a $5 billion tender offer for Bulgari's shares.
