   Looking for real power? Let's talk circular saws, model 100 routers, and orbit finishing sanders. Thanks in part to the home improvement movement, Porter-Cable tools are picked up by handymen and women, professional woodworkers and construction workers, as well as electricians and plumbers. The company makes electric tools (tabletop saws, bench top planers, and radial drill presses), cordless tools (drills and drivers), air tools (hammers, nailers, and spray guns), and related accessories. Its lines are sold primarily through retailers, such as home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and lumber yards, including
