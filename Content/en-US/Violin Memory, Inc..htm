  <p>
   Violin Memory's flagship product is the Flash Storage Platform, an integrated design of software, firmware, and hardware. With the platform, active data (Tiers 0, 1, and 2) can be consolidated onto a single tier, which simplifies administration. The Symphony Management Suite Version 3.0 allows software to be orchestrated in just a few clicks of the mouse.

   The company draws almost three quarters of its revenue from product sales with the rest coming from its service component.

  <p>
   After a 46% revenue increase in 2014, Violin Memory's 2015 (ended January) revenue struck a sour note, dropping 27%. The fall to $79 million in revenue reflected the company's switch from its 6000 All Flash Arrays line to the newer Flash Storage Platform. The 6000 Series All Flash Arrays still accounted for 83% of revenue in 2015 although the dollar amount was $24 million lower than in 2014.
