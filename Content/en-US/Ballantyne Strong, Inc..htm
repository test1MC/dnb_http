   Robert Ballantyne began supplying movie theater equipment in 1932, and after WWII his company, Ballantyne of Omaha, began making equipment for drive-in theaters. Ballantyne retired in 1960 and sold his firm to ABC Vending. Under its new parent, the company entered the foodservice business, making pressure fryers for theater snack stands. Lightbulb maker Canrad-Hanovia bought Ballantyne in 1976, later merging it with its Strong Electric unit (spotlights and projector lamphouses). After Canrad acquired Simplex Projector in 1983, ARC International purchased Canrad in 1989 and merged Ballantyne, Strong, and Simplex. Ballantyne went public in 1995.

  <p>
   In 1996 the company was buoyed by the rapid growth of IMAX theaters and Iwerks motion simulator rides. Ballantyne acquired Xenotech and Sky-Tracker of America in 1997, makers of high-intensity searchlights. John Wilmers took over as CEO, and the following year Ballantyne acquired Design and Manufacturing (film platter systems), teamed with MegaSystems to develop a 3-D projection system, and increased its overseas sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ballantyne struck a $45 million agreement with Regal Cinemas (now part of Regal Entertainment Group) in 1999 to provide at least 2,000 projection systems over the next two years, marking the company's largest-ever purchase agreement. But a nationwide slowdown in theater construction hurt the company's bottom line in 2000, forcing it to lay off 18% of its employees. To add insult to injury, Ballantyne's stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, ARC International, went into receivership. ARC's stake in Ballantyne was acquired by Omaha merchant bank The McCarthy Group the next year. Also in 2001 the company was contracted to supply searchlights for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

   The company discontinued its restaurant equipment product line in 2007. That year the company moved further into the digital realm with the formation of a venture between Ballantyne and digital technology firm
   <company id="159700">
    RealD
   </company>
   . The venture is researching 3D technology and ways to fund the outfitting of digital projectors to movie exhibitors. Also that year the company acquired Marcel Desrochers, a Canadian manufacturer of screen systems for North America. In addition, its lighting division purchased the Technobeam lighting product line from High End Systems in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2009 began distribution of digital equipment through an agreement with
   <company id="120854">
    NEC Solutions
   </company>
   . Allso that year it changed its name from Ballantyne of Omaha, as the majority of customers associate the business with the Strong brand.  The following year Gary Cavey replaced the retiring John Wilmers as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company decided to sell its Omaha, NE-based analog projector facility and manufacturing equipment and relocate its corporate headquarters to a new, smaller location in Omaha.
