   Bonnier Corporation was founded in 2007 when parent Bonnier AB purchased 18 magazines from
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc
   </company>
   . and combined those assets with its World Publications' 20 special interest magazines. (Bonnier AB acquired World Publications, publisher of
   <em>
    Garden Design, Saveur
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Sailing World
   </em>
   , in 2006.) Bonnier Corporation expanded significantly in 2009 when it acquired five magazines from the struggling Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., adding niche titles
   <em>
    Popular Photography, Flying, Boating, Sound &amp; Vision
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    American Photo
   </em>
   to its portfolio.
