   The division aims to benefit from J&amp;J's acquisition of Swiss orthopedic device maker Synthes. The parent purchased Synthes for $21 billion in 2011, adding the maker of surgical implants, tools, and fixation devices to the DePuy organization.

   It expands its portfolio further through partnerships. For instance, the medical developer offers specialized allograft tissues -- such as VERTIGRAFT Structural Allograft and the SYMPHONY I/C Graft Chambers -- through an exclusive alliance with biologics firm LifeNet, which provides organ donation and tissue banking services. DePuy Spine struck an agreement with Osseon Therapeutics in 2010 to distribute that company's Osseoflex steerable spine augmentation needles for the treatment of compression fractures.
