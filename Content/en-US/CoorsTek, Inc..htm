   CoorsTek gets its buzz by making advanced technical ceramics, precision-machined metals, and engineered plastics, not beer. Its materials are used in automotive components (about a billion a year), energy equipment, medical devices, and high-performance machinery  for the semiconductor industry, among other products. CoorsTek also offers materials testing, analytical chemistry, custom manufacturing, and precision machining, among other services. The company operates facilities across the globe (primarily in North America and Europe). Once a part of the Adolph Coors Company (now
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   ), it is owned by chairman John Coors and his family.

   Products for fuel cells (ceramic tubes, planar substrates), chemical and scientific labware (mortars and pestles, crucibles, and dishes), power generation (ceramic brick linings, electron tube components), and optical components (sintered silicon carbide, aluminum oxide ceramics) are among its highly specialized components. CoorsTek also makes diamond grinding wheels, ceramics for semiconductor wafer processing equipment, and plastic bearings and bushings. Subsidiary CoorsTek Armor Solutions specializes in making lightweight integrated armor panels for ground vehicles, air, and marine crafts.

   While CoorsTek relies on acquisitions (like the $450 million purchase of its Japanese rival, Covalent Materials, in 2014) to expand its scope, it also conducts research and development. In 2016 the company out $120 million toward the Center for Advanced Materials in Golden, Colorado. In a related R&amp;D move, the company, the Coors family, and
   <company id="124494">

   teamed up on the CoorsTek Center for Applied Science and Engineering. The 100,000-sq.ft. building at the School of Mines campus in Golden provides educational and research facilities for faculty and students.

   As a private company, CoorsTek can respond quickly in changes to its up-and-down customer bases in defense, energy, and semiconductor equipment.

  <p>
   Much of CoorsTek's product and geographic expansion has come through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired the Philips ceramics operation in Uden, Netherlands, expanding its strategic partnership with Philips. CoorsTek serves both Philips and other regional customers from Uden. The deal adds about a dozen manufacturing locations throughout Europe including in the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

   CoorsTek's 2015 deal for assets of BLS Textiles Inc. of Cambridge, Ontario extends its vehicle armor products. The BLS assets were integrated into CoorsTek's DEW Engineering &amp; Development subsidiary.

  <p>
   CoorsTek dates back to 1910, when Adolph Coors invested in the Herold China and Pottery Co., a manufacturer of oven-safe porcelain. The business was renamed Coors Porcelain in 1920 and gradually expanded into technological applications. The company was part of Coors' 1992 spin off of ACX Technologies (now
   <company id="15728">
    Graphic Packaging
   </company>
   ), and later broke from ACX Technologies to be rechristened CoorsTek in 2000.
