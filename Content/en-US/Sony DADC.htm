   In order to help its clients (which includes other Sony divisions, as well as software, DVD distribution, and film production companies, among others) have more control over proprietary content , Sony DADC has been expanding its digital service offerings to include anti-pirating technologies for CD-ROMs and other optical disc media. The company's PID technology (Postscribed ID) automatically registers software on CD-ROMs so that the software cannot be downloaded again on other computers. It also makes SecuROM, a coded technology that differentiates between an original disk and a copied disk and inhibits the function of the copied disk.

   The company also offers products that help companies track the behavior of disk users. Its eBridge application, which is built into DVDs or CDs, reports users' behavior back to marketing departments, surveyors, and other parties that are interested in knowing how consumers are using their content.
