   Handling more than 125 million bushels of grain a year, Riceland Foods is ingrained in its business. The agricultural cooperative processes and markets the rice, soybeans, and wheat grown by its 9,000 member/owners, who farm in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas. One of the world's largest rice millers, it sells white and brown rice, plus flavored rices and meal kits under the Riceland and private-label brands. The co-op sells to food retailers and food service and food manufacturing companies worldwide. Riceland also makes cooking oils and processes soybeans, bran, and lecithin, and offers rice bran and hulls to pet food makers and livestock farmers as feed and bedding.
