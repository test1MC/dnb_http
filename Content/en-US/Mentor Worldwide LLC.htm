        <p>
   Mentor was founded in 1969.

        <p>
   Incorporated in 1969, Mentor initially made devices to control urological disorders and instruments to measure the electrical activity of nerves (this line was discontinued in 1980). To diversify, Mentor in 1989 acquired previously unrelated Mentor O&amp;O, marketer of ophthalmic surgical products. Mentor bolstered this line a year later with its purchase of Teknar, a maker of diagnostic ultrasound equipment for use by ophthalmologists and urologists. In 1991 the company entered international waters, establishing offices in Europe, Australia, and Canada. It also shifted its plastic surgery business into subsidiary Mentor H/S (later renamed Mentor Texas).

   A year later, when silicone gel breast implant litigation began to burgeon, Mentor became mired in a host of product liability lawsuits. The company escaped with relatively little damage, agreeing in 1993 to pay about $25 million to settle all claims. Mentor turned to liposuction to reduce its dependence on the sale of breast implants, which had been the driving force in the company's plastic surgery business. By 1997 Mentor had gained approval for human trials of an ultrasound device that would emulsify fat.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Mentor tried to expand into cosmetic medical products, but its unsolicited bid for Collagen Aesthetics was trumped by competitor INAMED. Mentor sold most of its surgically implanted lens business to a unit of Novartis in 2000 as part of a restructuring move that also involved layoffs.
  </p>
        <p>
   The following year Mentor bought South Bay Medical, a company focused on developing an automated needle-loading system for use in brachytherapy procedures. That was the first in a string of acquisitions. Mentor acquired Porges S.A., a urological products company in France. The company also acquired Byron Medical, a distributor of liposuction equipment and supplies. In 2005 Christopher Conway resigned, and Joseph Whitters took over his position as chairman.
  </p>
        <p>
   Early in 2009 drug and consumer health care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson paid $1.07 billion for Mentor.
