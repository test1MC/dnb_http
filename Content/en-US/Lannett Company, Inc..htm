   Lannett banks on the designation of "bioequivalent" for its products. The firm develops, manufactures, packages, markets, and distributes generic prescription drugs in the US, including thyroid treatment levothyroxine, digoxin for congestive heart failure, migraine drug butalbital, and ursodiol for gallstones. Such medicines are pharmaceutical equivalents, or bioequivalents, of branded medicines made by other drug companies. While Lannett maintains two plants, it also relies on manufacturer Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals for a significant portion of its inventories. The company produces medicines in oral solid (tablets, liquids, and capsules) and topical dosages forms.

  <p>
   Two of Lannett's product lines, levothyroxine sodium and digoxin, collectively accounted for 50% of the company's net sales in fiscal year 2015 (ended June). Both of the top products are primarily manufactured by Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pain management products include Cocaine Topical Solution, which is primarily used during ear, nose, or throat surgery; Morphine Sulfate oral Solution for pain in adults; and Oxycodone HCl Oral Solution for moderate to moderately severe pain. Through the 2015 acquisition of Silarx Pharmaceuticals, Lannett added several more pain management products.

   Lannett's customers include the big wholesale US pharmaceutical distributors as well as group purchasing organizations, chain drug stores, and other pharmaceutical companies. Top customers include

    AmerisourceBergen

   (30% of net sales in fiscal 2015),
   <company id="10977">

   (11%), and

   (7%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Lannett employs a direct sales force; it also promotes products through trade shows and publications.

   Revenues rose modestly in fiscal 2012 and 2013 and dramatically in 2014 and 2015. In fiscal 2015 (ended June), revenue increased 49% to $407 million, largely due to tremendous growth in gallstone treatments. This in turn was driven by price increases for Ursodiol. Other treatment areas that saw growth that year included migraine, glaucoma, and thyroid deficiency; a new muscle relaxant product also helped revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has also been on the rise, rose 162% to $150 million in fiscal 2015. Higher revenue led to that growth but was partially offset by higher operating expenses and reduced gains on investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following suit, cash flow from operations increased 185% to $128 million in 2015.

   Like any drug developer, Lannett maintains a steady stream of potential drugs in its pipeline. New product introductions are key to keeping ahead of its competitors, and as such, the firm focuses on developing products with few or no generic competitors. The company maintains its own R&amp;D staff, partners with third-party developers, and sometimes simply purchases new products from other generic makers, or buys other pharmaceutical companies outright.

   In 2015, the company's newly acquired subsidiary Silarx Pharmaceuticals received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for its generic version of antidepressant Abilify. This followed the 2014 approval of Lannett's generic versions of
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ' Femara Tablets (for treatment of breast cancer) and Lehigh Valley Technology's Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the company's focus areas of development is the market of narcotics and controlled substances, as Lannett believes the demand for pain medicine will continue to increase as the Baby Boomer generation ages. Lannett is also looking to grow in new specialty fields of medicine, as well as new dosage formulations (such as ophthalmic or nasal products), through strategic relationships or acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lannett signed an agreement with Symplmed in mid-2014, through which Symplmed became the exclusive US distributor of Lannett's generic version of ACEON, a treatment for high blood pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016 Lannett made a number of changes to cut costs, including cutting 10% of its total staff (with plans to ultimately cut 20% over the next three years). It also closed the Princeton, New Jersey, corporate offices of the recently acquired Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals. The restructuring efforts, which aim to streamline and consolidate operations, are expected to generate some $40 million in savings within 12 months.

   In 2015 Lannett bought Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals for $1.23 billion. Formerly the US generics business of Belgian firm
   <company id="93837">
    UCB
   </company>
   , Kremers makes treatments for such ailments as ADHD and gastroesophageal reflux. The deal is one of several that have been announced or completed in the generics arena, which is growing in importance as more drugs lose patent protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company acquired New York-based Silarx Pharmaceuticals for $42.5 million. Silarx makes and markets liquid pharmaceutical products, including generic and over-the-counter products.
