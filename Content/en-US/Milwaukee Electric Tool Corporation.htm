   While its Chinese parent company doesn't breakout Milwaukee's sales, it reported that Milwaukee had a strong year in 2013, delivering double-digit sales growth and expanding in key product categories. Sales of Techtronic's Power Equipment business (to which Milwaukee belongs) rose 10% in 2013 versus 2012, to $3.1 billion, supported, in part, by the strong global expansion of Milwaukee. Indeed, the Power Equipment business accounted for 73% of group sales.

   As part of its growth strategy, Milwaukee Electric has focused on developing new products and technologies. Recently, it has worked to expand its cordless line with the M12 and M18 lithium-ion systems, successfully gaining ground in market share. In 2012, the power tool maker launched FUEL. which enhances the performance of lithium-ion power tools with longer runtime, improved motor life, and increased power. More recently, it rolled out a range of M12 FUEL sub-compact cordless power fools for professional and industrial users. In 2013, it expanded its popular SAWZALL blade product line with the launch of Double Duty and Jam Free blades.

   After breaking from its power tool tradition in 2010 by introducing a new line of hand tools, the company expanded its hand tool line in 2011 by adding two dozen new products. Milwaukee Electric also has a history of setting industry precedent. In 2005 the company launched a cordless lineup powered by lithium-ion batteries; other power tool manufacturers followed suit and today many offer a line of lithium-powered tools. The company continues to develop its lithium technologies for use in current and future products.
