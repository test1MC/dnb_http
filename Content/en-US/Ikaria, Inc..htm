   Ikaria does its best to care for the most vulnerable among us. The vertically integrated company performs R&amp;D, manufacturing, and sales and marketing in pursuit of easier breathing for critically ill infants. Its INOtherapy system includes the drug INOMAX (inhaled nitric oxide), delivery mechanism, and support services sold in North America as well as in Australia and Japan. The system works with existing ventilators and anesthesia machines to ease the symptoms of hypoxic respiratory failure, which causes lung blood vessels to constrict. Ikaria is pursuing additional approvals for INOMAX and is seeking other critical care drugs for its pipeline.

  <p>
   Ikaria filed for an IPO in 2006 but was forced to withdraw its registration citing poor market conditions. It had hoped to use the estimated $160 million in IPO proceeds to repay debt, for general corporate purposes, and to cover costs the company expected to incur by consolidating two of its existing facilities into the new company headquarters.

   To extend its product base, Ikaria is researching the therapeutic potential of terlipressin, which could be used to reverse kidney failure by redistributing blood flow to the kidneys. It is also investigating a potential treatment for preventing cardiac and congestive heart failure following acute myocardial infarction.
