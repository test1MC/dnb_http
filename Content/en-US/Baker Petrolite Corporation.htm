  <p>
   There are no separate financials for Baker Petrolite, which operates as a part of the parent company's North America segment. However, parent

   </company>
   reported that North American revenues were flat in 2013 despite rig counts declining 7% (primarily due to lower gas prices driving down onshore rig activity) as increased revenues from stronger Gulf of Mexico drilling and completion fluids, pressure pumping, completion systems, and wireline services product lines compensated for the decline in onshore drilling. The North American segment contributed about 49% of the parent company's total revenues that year.
