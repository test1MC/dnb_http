   Shintech is the largest producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the US. PVC is a plastic resin used in a wide range of consumer goods and industrial materials. Known for its durability, it is often used as a substitute for wood. Through manufacturing plants in Texas and Louisiana, Shintech serves customers primarily in North America, but it also exports its resin products worldwide. The only other product the company makes is caustic soda used by the chemical industry and also found in consumer products, such as paper, soap, synthentic textiles, and food. Shintech is the US subsidiary of Japanese diversified chemical giant

   Still bouncing back from a recession that resulted in sluggish demand for its PVC products in the US housing market, Shintech is bolstering its sales and marketing efforts and moving forward with an expansion of its Louisiana production facility that will roughly double its PVC output, bringing its total annual production capacity to about 2.6 millions tons. Scheduled for completion in 2011, the company intends to outfit the facility with more integrated capabilities to produce its main raw material, vinyl chloride monomer, in house. Historically, Shintech has sourced most of its vinyl chloride monomer needed to make PVC from
