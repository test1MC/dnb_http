   Roper Technologies is an industrial manufacturer with products that control, pump, scan, authorize, and analyze. Its business segments include medical and scientific imaging (digital imaging products and software), energy systems and controls (controls and sensors, testing/inspection equipment), industrial technology (pumps, leak testing, flow measurement), and RF technology (toll/traffic systems, card systems, and software). Roper's lines are used in niche markets engaged in RF (radio frequency), water, energy, research and medical, education, transportation, and security applications. The company aims for end-markets seeking value-added, engineered products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Roper divides its operations across four segments. Medical and scientific imaging (digital imaging products and software) generated 34% of its sales in 2015; RF technology (radio frequency, toll/traffic systems, card systems, and software), 29%; industrial technology (pumps, leak testing, and flow measurement), 21%; and energy systems and controls (controls and sensors, testing/inspection equipment), 16%.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company sells its products via its direct sales force, as well as through manufacturers' representatives and distributors. TheMedical and Scientific Imaging segment also sells through value added resellers and OEMs.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's operating units grow their customer base by expanding their access to customers and entering adjacent markets.

        <p>
   Roper has experience unprecedented revenue growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $3.58 billion in 2015. Profits also reached $696 million in 2015, another company milestone. In addition, cash from operating activities increased by 11% from 2015.
  </p>
        <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by a bump in medical and scientific imaging segment sales mainly due to organic growth from medical businesses and new contributions from acquisitions. The rise in profits was attributed to gains made on divestitures and foreign exchange gains from its non-US based companies.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2015 the company changed its name from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies to reflect that the company has gone far beyond its industrial roots to serve several high-value end markets. Its growth strategy includes the use intellectual capital, application engineering expertise, new product development, and channel expansion.
  </p>
        <p>
   Roper also makes no secret of its plan to grow through acquisitions. It purchases companies that represent opportunities to expand in existing markets or enter new, related ones. The company targets companies that have high growth potential and ones it can easily assimilate.

        <p>
   Roper is focused on enhancing its software operations through key acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired Aderant Holdings for $675 million. Aderant is the technology leader in its niche market with a broad suite of software packages for law firms. The deal is expected to generate approximately $125 million of Roper's revenue in 2016.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired two companies: RF IDeas, a leading provider of proprietary identification card technology tools and software; and Strata Decision Technology, a provider of cloud-based analytics and performance platforms used in financial planning, decision support, and cost improvement for the health care industry. The company will operate as part of Roper's medical segment.

        <p>
   George Roper founded the company in 1919 in Rockford, Illinois, to make gas stoves and gear pumps. In the late 1950s the stove works were spun off to Sears as the Roper Corporation, and the pump-making operations were moved to Georgia. Roper was a public company until a 1981 leveraged buyout (a takeover of a company using borrowed funds.) UK-born Derrick Key, who joined Roper in 1982, became CEO in 1991. The company went public again the next year as Roper Industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the 1990s Roper grew by acquisitions both at home and abroad. However, it gained entry into Eastern Europe in 1993 by winning a seven-year contract worth $350 million with Russian gas czar OAO Gazprom to install advanced control systems across Russia's vast pipeline system.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company added digital-imaging and analytical systems for electron microscopes in 1996 by purchasing Gatan International, a California company with branches in Germany and the UK. Roper's 1997 purchases included Industrial Data Systems (leak-testing equipment, Utah); Petrotech (systems integration for fluid-control products; Louisiana, with an Indonesian unit); and Princeton Instruments (spectral and imaging cameras; New Jersey, with locations in France and the UK).
  </p>
        <p>
   Roper expanded its digital-imaging line in 1998 by acquiring Photometrics, Ltd. (digital cameras and detectors) and PMC/Beta Limited (vibration sensing and control equipment). Roper's bid to buy Leach Holding fell through, impeding its effort to boost its industrial components offerings. In 1999 it bought Varlen's petroleum analysis instrumentation unit and Eastman Kodak's motion analysis operations (digital video equipment).
  </p>
        <p>
   Roper's focus on providing high-margin products to niche markets spurred growth through acquisitions that included Eastman Kodak's high-speed and high-resolution digital video equipment unit, as well as makers of testing equipment for the petroleum industry. the company bought Struers Holdings' two operating units, which provided preparation equipment used in quality inspection (Struers A/S), and material shaping equipment used to make semiconductors and optoelectronics (Logitech).
  </p>
        <p>
   Roper acquired Hansen Technologies in 2001 and added Struers' operating units in 2001; in 2002 it spent about $83 million on Zetec (industrial testing equipment), Duncan Technologies (industrial digital cameras), AiCambridge/"Qualitek" (leak detection equipment), Quantitative Imaging (industrial and scientific digital cameras), and Definitive Imaging (image analysis software). At the same time, however, Roper exited some of its Petrotech businesses and was hit by the downturn in the semiconductor industry, the oil and gas exploration markets, and the generally weak economy.
  </p>
        <p>
   At the end of 2003 Roper acquired Neptune Technology Group Holdings (meter-reading technology) for $475 million. Expanding beyond its core controls, pumps, and analytical tools businesses, Roper acquired radio-frequency identification technology and related services provider
   <company id="127706">
    TransCore Holdings
   </company>
   for $597 million in 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company purchased Louisville, Colorado-based security applications technologies provider Inovonics Wireless Corporation for $45 million in 2005. That same year Roper strengthened its presence in the medical imaging market by acquiring Kalona, Iowa-based CIVCO Medical Instruments Co., a supplier of specialized medical products, from
   <company id="131774">
    KRG Capital Partners, LLC
   </company>
   . It also bought Orange City, Iowa-based MEDTEC, a maker of technology used in diagnosing and treating cancer, for about $150 million, to fold into its CIVCO operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired Dynisco LLC in 2006 for $243 million from the Audax Group, a private equity investment firm. Also known as Dynisco Instruments, the business made pressure and temperature measurement and control instruments, primarily for the plastics industry, with applications in life sciences. In recent years Dynisco acquired Alpha Technologies and Viatran Corp., suppliers of analytical instruments and sensors for various applications. Dynisco became part of Roper's Energy Systems and Controls segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisitions in 2007 were less costly, totaling $106 million, and largely benefited the company's Energy Systems and Control segment; four businesses were acquired that brought on board pressure measurement sensors, air intake-cut off devices, audio recording, vibration monitoring, and process control equipment. The RF Technology segment gained a rugged mobile computers provider, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging obtained a manufacturer of computers and software for mobile computing.
  </p>
        <p>
   Between 2007 and 2011, the company has averaged more than four acquisitions a year, with six each in 2007 and 2008. The largest of the 2008 acquisitions was the purchase of
   <company id="128843">
    The CBORD Group
   </company>
   for $375 million. CBORD makes electronic ID and debit cards for colleges and universities, hospitals, supermarkets, and other businesses and institutions. The acquisition diversified the company's RF Technology interests beyond transportation and water utilities to health care and education end-markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cumulatively, Roper's other acquisitions in 2008 ran to $331 million, with the RF Technology segment receiving additional boosts with Getloaded.com, Technolog, and Horizon Software. Horizon Software builds upon the capabilities previously brought in by CBORD.  A provider of software, Horizon captures corporate dining, health care, K-12 education, military, and senior living markets. The two other deals in 2008 (Tech-Pro and Chalwyn) grew the company's Energy Systems and Controls portfolio with industrial test instruments and software and air shut-off valves.
  </p>
        <p>
   Other acquisitions over the years included Heartscape, which developed a technology that can detect heart attacks quicker and with more accuracy; iTradeNetwork, a provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based trading network and information services used by the food industry; and United Toll Services, which made toll and traffic systems and software vital to transportation infrastructure projects that are anticipated to receive an uptick in funding.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired
   <company id="51281">
    Sunquest Information Systems
   </company>
   , a provider of health care software catering to more than 1,700 large and midsized hospitals and laboratories, for about $1.4 billion. The deal allowed it to broaden its product portfolio into new areas. The prior year it snapped up Northern Digital (NDI), a Canada-based 3-D technology provider for the medical industry. Seen as a growth industry, NDI's products are used in computer-assisted medical procedures. As with the other acquisitions, NDI became part of Roper's medical operations.
