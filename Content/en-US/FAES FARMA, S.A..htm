   FAES is involved in many phases of the healing process. FAES (aka Fábrica Española de productos químicos y farmacéuticos) develops, manufactures, and sells prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter drugs, and chemical raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system products are key drug categories; FAES also makes therapies for metabolic and ophthalmic disorders, osteoporosis, and other conditions. Most of FAES's sales are in Spain and Portugal, but sales in the some 60 countries where it operates are growing, especially in Latin American and African nations. FAES was founded in 1933.

  <p>
   Revenue dropped 7% in 2012 as the Spanish government imposed restrictions on pharmaceutical companies and generic competitors came on the market. Net income, however, increased 38% due to other income and reduced expenses. Cash flow held steady.
