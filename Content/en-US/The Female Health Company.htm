   ! Business at The Female Health Company (FHC), maker of condoms for women, is gaining momentum. The female condom is the only female contraceptive that is
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved for preventing both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The firm's condoms are sold in 140-plus countries worldwide (under the FC2 name), mostly in South Africa, Brazil, and Uganda. Outside the US, many of its products bear the Femidom name, among others. FHC also provides low-cost female condoms in Africa through an agreement with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). It sponsors the Female Health Foundation, which provides women with health education.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Headquartered in Chicago, FHC generated a third of its fiscal 2013 revenue from South Africa and Brazil. The balance of its customers is located in Uganda, Nigeria, the US, Congo, Zimbabwe, India, the UK, and Malaysia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company boasts manufacturing locations in the UK, Malaysia, and India.

  <p>
   Focused on developing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer health care products, FHC operates its business in one industry segment. The company's FC2 Female Condom, which is available in the US and in more than 140 countries, offers women dual protection against sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, as well as unintended pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>
   It owns certain worldwide rights to the FC2 Female Condom, including patents that have been issued in several countries. Patents cover the key aspects of FC2, such as its overall design and manufacturing process.
  </p>

  <p>
   The FC2 Female Condom is the only currently available female-controlled product that's approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   . Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cleared FC2 for purchase in
   <company id="114849">
    United Nations
   </company>
   agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the company's relatively small customer base are large global agencies, such as its three largest customers: the United Nations Population Fund (62% of unit sales), the United States Agency for International Development (less than 10% of unit sales), and South Africa's distributor Sekunjalo Investments Corporation (PTY) Ltd. (less than 10% of unit sales). Other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly from FHC or through in-country distributors or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
  </p>
  <p>
   The personal health care products company significantly boosted advertising costs in fiscal 2013. It spent $221,718 in 2013, up from $52,949 in 1012 and $32,858 in 2011.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Thanks to its increased advertising expenses paired with revenue losses, FHC's profits decreased some 6% in fiscal 2013 vs. 2012. The company's revenue dropped by 10% during the reporting period. Unit sales dropped 11% as compared to 2012 due to the Brazil and South Africa shipping large orders. To its benefit, the average FC2 sales price rose 1% in 2013.

  <p>
   FHC has pledged to significantly boost its global education and training investment through 2018.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has built a strong foundation for its current FC2 Female Condom from its first generation product, FC1. It's further supported by representatives in global locales who provide technical support and assist with customers' prevention and family planning programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   FHC generates most of its revenue from the sale of its FC2 Female Condom, recognized upon shipment of the product to customers. The company also earns revenue by licensing its intellectual property to Hindustan Lifecare Limited, an exclusive distributor that makes and sells the FC2 Female Condom in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FC2 Female Condom is made of a nitrile polymer, which allows for a faster, cheaper manufacturing process. The primary difference between the first-generation FC1 condom and the FC2 condom is that the FC1 condom can be cleaned and reused several times (a benefit the company doesn't necessarily recommend).
