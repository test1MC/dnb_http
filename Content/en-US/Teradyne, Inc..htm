   Electronics makers concerned about quality and consistency can put their products through the Teradyne tests. The company is a leading supplier of automated test equipment and a maker of systems for testing semiconductors. Teradyne caters to electronics manufacturing services suppliers, as well as OEMs who use its test systems to analyze complex electronics used in the computing, consumer electronics, military/aerospace, and telecommunications industries. Customers include
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   , government contractors, and the US government. Teradyne has operations in Asia, Europe, and the Americas; but it generates the majority of sales from customers in Asia.

  <p>
   Teradyne operates through three segments - semiconductor tests, wireless tests, and systems tests. The semiconductor test group, which accounts for almost 80% of sales, includes the design, manufacturing, and marketing of semiconductor test products and services used both for wafer level and device package testing. The wireless and systems test group each account for 10% of sales. Wireless tests include products and services for smartphones, tablets, notebooks/laptops, personal computer peripherals, and other Wi-Fi and cellular enabled devices. The systems test group designs, makes, and sells testing products and services for military/aerospace instruments, hard disk drive storage, and circuit boards.

  <p>
   Teradyne conducts semiconductor test operations in all of its facilities, which are located in China, Costa Rica, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the US. Systems test facilities co-exist at the company's facilities at its headquarters and in China and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company doesn't manufacture its own products, but relies on subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers such as
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics
   </company>
   in China to make its well-known FLEX and J750 products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its two biggest markets are Taiwan, 30% of sales, and China, 18%. US customers account for 13% of sales.

   Teradyne primarily uses a direct sales force to sell its products; customers in Asia (the hub of the semiconductor industry) account for 80% of sales. In 2014 the company's three largest customers accounted for 21% of revenue.

  <p>
   Sales grew 15% in 2014 to $1.6 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 2013. Revenue rose 27% for semiconductor test and 6% for system test.  The semiconductor test jump came from higher system-on-a-chip product volume. The increase in system test revenue was from higher volume in storage test and production board test activities. Profit fell 50% to $81 million due to an increase in operating expenses from goodwill impairment  from the wireless test segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $492 million in 2014 from $267 million in 2013.

   In 2015, Teradyne bought Universal Robots for $285 million, bolstering Teradyne's System and Wireless Test segment in a growing business. Universal Robots develops low-cost, easy-to-deploy and easy-to-program robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality and increase manufacturing efficiency. With Universal Robots on its roster, Teradyne is targeting a bigger share of the $100 million collaborative robotics market, which is growing at a fast clip.

   In 2014, Teradyne acquired Avionics Interface Technologies, a supplier of equipment for testing data communication connections, for about $21 million. The purchase fits in with Teradyne's defense and aerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems. A

  <p>
   College pals Nicholas DeWolf and Alexander d'Arbeloff (who met in an alphabetical ROTC lineup at
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   ) founded Teradyne in 1960 to develop industrial-grade electronic test equipment. The name combines "tera" (10 to the 12
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   power) and "dyne" (a unit of force); to the founding duo, it meant "rolling a 15,000-ton boulder uphill." The company's first headquarters was a loft over Joe &amp; Nemo's hot dog stand in downtown Boston. In 1961 the company sold its first product -- an automatic tester for semiconductor diodes called a go/no-go diode tester -- to
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   for $5,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teradyne grew rapidly during the 1960s as it introduced new products, including testers for integrated circuits, resistors, transistors, and diodes. In the latter part of the decade, the company began using computers to speed up the testing process, helping create the automatic test equipment (ATE) industry. It formed Teradyne Components (later Teradyne Connection Systems) in 1968 to produce electronics connection assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teradyne went public in 1970. That year, with the first slump in the semiconductor industry, the company laid off 15% of its workforce and began diversifying its customer base. DeWolf departed Teradyne in 1971, leaving d'Arbeloff to run operations. The market quickly recovered, and the company grew and prospered again. In 1972 it began working on a telephone system testing device, the 4Tel. However, the market slumped again, and in 1975 Teradyne cut its staff by 15% a second time.
