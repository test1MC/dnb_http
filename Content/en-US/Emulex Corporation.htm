   Emulex sets an example in the data storage market. The company is a leading maker of host server products (HSP) and embedded storage products (ESP). Its LightPulse fibre channel host bus adapters (HBA) are used to connect storage devices in direct-attached storage configurations, as well as storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS) systems. Emulex also develops HBAs based on the fibre channel over Ethernet protocol. The company primarily sells directly to equipment makers who incorporate Emulex components into their own storage platforms; its top customers have been
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   (29% of sales) and
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   (16%). Emulex was acquired by
   <company id="144560">
    Broadcom Limited
   </company>
   in mid-2015.

  <p>
   Broadcom completed the acquisition of Emulex in 2015 and runs Emulex as a subsidiary. Emulex's connectivity business aligns with Broadcom's portfolio and should key the expansion of Broadcom's enterprise storage business.

  <p>
   Other company products include Fibre Channel host bus adapters, 10Gb Ethernet network interface cards, Ethernet-based converged network adapters, controllers, embedded bridges and switches, and connectivity management software. These components are used to connect computer servers, networks, and storage devices largely in data centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Emulex has strong relationships with a number of large computing equipment makers, the company is working to expand its distribution network, looking to technical distributors including value-added resellers and systems integrators, to reach a broader international customer base.

  <p>
   Emulex's sales increasingly come from the Asia/Pacific region as it has looked overseas for growth. This is partly due to the location of the production locations of its customers, and is not necessarily indicative of the products' use or installation destinations. Emulex made 75% of its sales outside the US. It has offices and research and development facilities in North America, Asia, and Europe.

   are the only two customers that have individually accounted for more than 10% of Emulex's sales, but its top five customers represented 65% of total revenue.

  <p>
   Emulex's financial reports for 2014 were its last as an independent company. Its revenues fell 7% from $479 million in 2013 to $447 million in 2014. The revenue drop for 2014 was driven by a 12% dip in network connectivity products revenue coupled with a 9% decrease in storage connectivity and other products revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had also suffered four straight years of net losses due to high cost of goods sold in addition to hefty operating expenses. Emulex's operating cash flow fell dramatically in 2013, but it increased by $37 million in 2014.

  <p>
   On the heels of its fourth straight year posting a net loss, Emulex focused on streamlining its operation structure. In 2014 it recorded restructuring charges of $1.1 million, primarily consisting of workforce reductions of about 15%, to reduce operating expenses. It also closed engineering facilities in addition to its Bolton, Massachusetts, facility incurring a restructuring charge of $8.1 million.
