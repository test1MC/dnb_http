   U.S. Robotics keeps collecting connections. The company provides internal and external modems, card reader/writers, hubs, adapters, and cables for businesses and consumers. It also offers VoIP phones with
   <company id="133264">
    Skype
   </company>
   -compatible technology. The company has designed modems that utilize the V.92 standard, a technology that allows faster data transfer than that of standard 56K modems. In addition to dial-up modems, U.S. Robotics offers Ethernet modems, as well as broadband and DSL routers. Other products include USR Call Director, which connects telephone lines with modems, Point of Sale units, and faxes. U.S. Robotics is owned by
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   , a private equity buyout firm.

  <p>
   In 1975 Casey Cowell, a University of Chicago economics graduate, teamed up with fellow alumni Paul Collard (who later left the firm) and Steve Muka (who died in 1985) to enter the budding computer field. U.S. Robotics (named after a company in Isaac Asimov's
   <i>
    I, Robot
   </i>
   ) first produced an acoustic coupler that connected computers over phone lines via the handsets. In 1976 an FCC ruling allowed non-
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   products to be plugged into phone lines, freeing the company to move into modems. It grew quickly, first as a distributor and after 1988 as a manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Robotics went public in 1991. In 1995 the company acquired Megahertz (credit card-sized modems and network adapter cards), ISDN Systems (network connection devices), and Palm Computing (handheld computing devices).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Amber Wave Systems (Ethernet switches) and Israel-based network switch maker Scorpio Communications in 1996. In 1997 U.S. Robotics introduced a system for accessing the Internet over cable TV networks. In 1997
   <company id="12475">
    3Com
   </company>
   bought U.S. Robotics for $7.3 billion -- at the time one of high techdom's largest deals ever.
  </p>
  <p>
   3Com continued to sell U.S. Robotics-branded modems until 2000, when it spun off Palm Computing (now
   <company id="60253">
    Palm
   </company>
   and
   <company id="106162">
    ACCESS Systems America
   </company>
   ). 3Com sold roughly 80% of its analog modem business to networking equipment maker
   <company id="102381">
    Accton Technology
   </company>
   and electronics contract manufacturer NatSteel Electronics in 2000.
   <company id="14296">
    Solectron
   </company>
   subsequently acquired NatSteel Electronics, giving it a majority stake in U.S. Robotics (Accton and 3Com retained minority stakes).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 U.S. Robotics completed testing of modems based on a standard known as V.92, which increased the speed of 56K modems. Also that year Solectron acquired NatSteel Electronics, and with it a majority stake in U.S. Robotics. In 2002 the company introduced cable and DSL modems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solectron sold its 63% stake back to U.S. Robotics' management in 2004. The company's ownership changed hands again in 2005, with
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   buying U.S. Robotics.
