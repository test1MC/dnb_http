   Cordis is a hearty subsidiary of
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   . The firm develops products to treat circulatory system diseases including congestive heart failure and cerebral aneurysms. Its Cordis Cardiology division focuses on cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment, while Cordis Endovascular develops devices for peripheral and biliary conditions. Biologics Delivery Systems makes cardiac mapping equipment used to improve the delivery of biological therapies. Cardinal Health acquired Cordis from
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   for $1.94 billion in 2015. (The sale did not include Cordis' former
   <company id="103996">
    Biosense Webster
   </company>
   unit, which develops medical sensor and electrophysiology technology for cardiovascular use.)

  <p>
   Cordis has expertise across several main categories. Its main divisions -- Cordis Cardiology and Cordis Endovascular -- focus on cardiovascular disease management and the treatment of peripheral vascular and biliary obstructive diseases. Cordis Cardiology products include catheters, guidewires, access kits, and vascular closure devices, while Cordis Endovascular offerings include catheters, stents, filters, guidewires, and closure devices. The divisions also offer training and support services for physicians. The firm's smaller divisions offer controlled vascular drug delivery, electrophysiology, medical sensor, and biologics delivery technologies.

  <p>
   The company was formerly part of J&amp;J's Medical Devices and Diagnostics division.

  <p>
   The company has struggled in recent years due to competition in the cardiovascular stent market from companies like
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105069">
    Medtronic CardioVascular
   </company>
   , as well as concerns over the safety of some of its drug-coated stents, which certain studies have indicated come with a higher risk of blood clots than similar bare metal devices. As stent sales continued to drag down the J&amp;J devices division, J&amp;J decided to exit the cardiac stent market (while continuing to make other types of vascular stents). Cordis stopped working on the development of its next-generation NEVO drug-eluting stent system and ceased the manufacturing of its CYPHER stent lines by the end of 2011.

   Cordis is refocusing its operations around the Cardiology and Endovascular division's offerings of access, diagnostic, and therapeutic products for cardiovascular, lower extremity, and abdominal ailments. It aims to add new vascular solutions for endovascular and cardiology procedures where a significant patient need exists to replace lost revenues from its stent products. Specifically, it is targeting research and development projects in superficial femoral artery disease and closure devices used after an interventional procedure and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Cordis is also focused on Biosense Webster's electrophysiology offerings, which include cardiac mapping and ablation systems.

  <p>
   After regaining its footing, Cordis branched out acquisitively in 2013 through the purchase of Flexible Stenting Solutions, a developer of venous, peripheral arterial, and biliary stents. The acquisition allows Cordis to extend its vascular and peripheral solutions, especially for patients with peripheral artery disease.

   Cordis was founded in 1959 and bought by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1996. It was sold to Cardinal Health in 2015.
