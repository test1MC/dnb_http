    Telesat

   and XTAR, a joint venture with Spain's Hisdesat. Telesat leases satellite transponder capacity to cable and satellite broadcasters as well as voice and data networks, while XTAR provides satellite services to the US and Spanish governments. Telesat has about a dozen satellites in orbit, while XTAR has two satellites in orbit. Loral owns 63% of Telesat and has a 56% stake in XTAR. The company is headquartered in New York and has a presence in the US, Canada, Spain, and other allied countries.

   Telesat, the world's fourth-largest satellite operator, has about a dozen satellites in orbit. Its operations are divided into three units: broadcast, enterprise services, and consulting. The broadcast division distributes programming from former parent

   , among others. Its enterprise services unit encompasses North American data networks, broadband Internet service in Canada, and government services; it also offers satellite capacity to telecom carriers, and provides terrestrial network extension services for connecting enterprises with far-flung locations. Telesat's consulting operations help businesses and government agencies establish, operate, and upgrade satellite systems.

  <p>
   XTAR has two satellites in orbit that support critical communications for the US and Spanish government, as well as the Belgium Ministry of Defense, the Norwegian Ministry of Defense, and the Danish armed forces. The joint venture was the first commercial provider for government satellite services.

   Telesat focuses on sales to government service integrators instead of seeking out business directly from the US government. Telesat is also focusing on emerging markets, such as the Middle East and the Caribbean. Serving more than 400 customers, Telesat has been able to garner strong cash flows by aligning contracts with a satellite's orbital life.
