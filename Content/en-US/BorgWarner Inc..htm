   If suburbanites need four-wheel-drive vehicles to turbocharge their urban drive, that's OK with BorgWarner. The company is a leading maker of engine and drivetrain products for the world's major automotive manufacturers. Products include turbochargers, air pumps, timing chain systems, four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive transfer cases (primarily for light trucks and SUVs), and transmission components. Its largest customers include
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen

   ,
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="58357">

  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BorgWarner operates nearly 75 manufacturing and technical facilities in some 20 countries (including more than a dozen in the US and about half a dozen each in Germany, China, and South Korea). Europe is by far BorgWarner's largest market; Germany accounts for roughly 25% of total sales, and Hungary and France collectively account for 10%. The US generates around 25% of its sales, with South Korea and China combined representing almost 20%.

  <p>
   BorgWarner divides its operations into the two segments of engine products (about 70% of total sales) and drivetrain products (about 30%). The engine group optimizes engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance and includes engine timing systems, boosting systems, ignition systems, air and noise management, and cooling and controls. The drivetrain group provides automotive transmission components. Turbochargers for light vehicles is the company's largest product line, representing 30% of sales.

   The company markets its products to OEMs of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans, and light trucks) through separate sales teams for its two product divisions. In 2015
   <company id="41853">

   each generated 15% of the company's overall sales. Other key customers include Chrysler, Nissan, and General Motors.

  <p>
   After posting milestone revenues of $8.3 billion in 2014, BorgWarner saw its revenues decrease by 3% to $8 billion in 2015. Profits also dipped 7% from $656 million to $610 million during that same time period due to a spike in interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue drop for 2015 was fueled by decreases in both its segments: engine (4%) and drivetrain (3%). Engine segment sales were unfavorably affected by weak commercial markets around the world, and drivetrain was mainly hurt by lower sales of transmission components in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   BorgWarner experienced two straight years of increased operating cash flow, with spikes of 12% reaching $802 million in 2014 and 8% peaking at $868 million in 2015.

  <p>
   The engine maker's strategy is to follow market share as it shifts away from Detroit and toward Asia and Europe. Manufacturing operations are situated close to demand, enabling the company to ship products directly from its plant to the customer. Western automotive companies are scrambling to grab a piece of the market in Asia, particularly in China, which is signaling to overtake the US as the largest automotive market in the world.

  <p>
   BorgWarner has been generating additional revenue over the years through the use of acquisitions. In a milestone transaction in late 2015, the company acquired
   <company id="47448">
    Remy International
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion. Remy is a global producer of rotating electrical components with key technologies and operations spanning 10 countries. The deal enhanced BorgWarner's rapidly developing powertrain electrification technology line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it acquired Gustav Wahler GmbH &amp; Co. KG, a producer of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves and tubes as well as engine thermostats for both on- and off-road applications, for $111 million. The acquisition strengthened BorgWarner's strategic position as a producer of complete EGR systems and created additional market opportunities in both passenger and commercial vehicle applications. Gustav has locations in Germany, Brazil, China, Slovakia, and the US.

  <p>
   BorgWarner traces its roots to the 1928 merger of major Chicago auto parts companies Borg &amp; Beck (clutches), Warner Gear (transmissions), Mechanics Universal Joint, and Marvel Carburetor. The newly named Borg-Warner Corporation quickly began buying other companies, including Ingersoll Steel &amp; Disc (agricultural blades and discs) and Norge (refrigerators).
