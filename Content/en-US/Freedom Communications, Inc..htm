   Freedom Communications was a newspaper publisher with more than 40 newspapers and magazines for cities and communities in California. Its portfolio includes
   <em>
    The Orange County Register
   </em>
   , which boasts a circulation of about 235,000. The company also published about 30 weekly community papers and specialty publications. Its Freedom Interactive division created websites and other new media content for its properties. Freedom Communications was founded by R. C. Hoiles. It filed for bankruptcy a second time in late 2015 (the first time was in 2009). It was sold to Digital First Media in 2016.

  <p>
   Raymond Cyrus (R. C.) Hoiles entered the newspaper business in the early 1900s, selling subscriptions for his brother Frank's newspaper, the
   <i>
    Alliance
   </i>
   (Ohio)
   <i>
    Review.
   </i>
   He later served as a printer's devil (earning $2 a week) and business manager before buying one-third of the paper. By 1921 R. C. and Frank had added two more Ohio papers to their holdings, the
   <i>
    Lorain Times
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Mansfield News.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   R. C. wanted to use the newspapers to speak out against what he saw as social ills, such as the influence of labor unions, but Frank wouldn't print such controversial opinions. Eventually the brothers parted ways, and R. C. bought the Lorain and Mansfield papers. In 1927 he acquired Ohio's
   <i>
    Bucyrus Telegraph-Forum.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   A local newspaper war (complete with two attempts on R. C.'s life) caused R. C. to sell the Lorain and Mansfield papers in 1932. Looking for a new challenge, he moved his family to Santa Ana, California, in 1935 and bought the
   <i>
    Santa Ana Register.
   </i>
   He formed Freedom Newspapers in 1950 with seven papers; when Hoiles died in 1970, the company owned 16. Clarence Hoiles, who had been working with his father since the late 1920s, succeeded R. C. In 1978 Bob Segal became the first nonfamily member to run the business. Freedom bought its first TV station in 1981 and added four more by 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clarence's death in 1981 sparked a family feud over control of the company; R. C.'s other son, Harry, sued to divide the firm's assets but lost his case in 1990. That year Freedom launched the 24-hour Orange County NewsChannel and started buying small weekly newspapers in Orange County. Freedom launched a Spanish-language weekly in Orange County in 1992. The following year the company formed a magazine subsidiary and changed its name to Freedom Communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Freedom joined CurtCo Publishing in a magazine publishing joint venture, CurtCo Freedom Group. The following year it sold its Orange County NewsChannel to LA cable operator Century Communications (acquired by Adelphia in 1999). Also that year it made a large investment (believed to be as high as $15 million) in
   <i>
    P.O.V.
   </i>
   David Threshie, publisher of the
   <i>
    Orange County Register
   </i>
   retired at the end of 1998; under Threshie's 20-year tenure, the paper won three Pulitzer Prizes and increased readership by a third.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold a handful of magazines to Michigan-based Business News Publishing. That year Freedom acquired all of CurtCo Freedom and formed an interactive media division for its increasing focus on the Internet. Also in 1999 Sam Wolgemuth was promoted from president of Freedom Magazines to company CEO and president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to increased competition from titles such as
   <i>
    Maxim,
   </i>
   the company folded
   <i>
    P.O.V.
   </i>
   in 2000. In 2001 the company stopped publishing its struggling
   <i>
    Home Office Computing
   </i>
   magazine. That year it also shut down its
   <i>
    MODE
   </i>
   magazine, dedicated to fashion for plus-sized women, after unsuccessfully trying to find a buyer for it. In early 2002 the company stopped publishing
   <i>
    Small Business Computing
   </i>
   magazine after an unsuccessful bid to find a buyer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lacking support from company board members, Wolgemuth resigned as CEO in 2002 and was replaced by company executive Alan Bell. The following year the company was sold to a family shareholder group backed by
   <company id="43093">
    The Blackstone Group
   </company>
   and
   <company id="121843">
    Providence Equity Partners
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company acquired 10 community newspapers in North Carolina from Craven County Publications. Bell was replaced as CEO in 2006 by Scott Flanders, previously chief at mail-order giant
   <company id="60526">
    Columbia House
   </company>
   . Flanders departed in 2009 to take up the reins at Hugh Hefner's
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy Enterprises
   </company>
   , and board member Burl Osborne was named interim CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the face of declining revenue and mounting debt, Freedom Communications filed for bankruptcy later in 2009. It emerged the following year under the control of an investment group led by hedge fund
   <company id="109881">
    Angelo Gordon &amp; Co.
   </company>
   The reorganization, which cut the company's debt by about $450 million, ended the Hoiles family's interest in Freedom Communications after more than 75 years. Mitchell Stern, formerly head of Fox Television Stations (a part of
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   's
   <company id="58035">
    Fox Entertainment
   </company>
   division), was hired as CEO later that same year.
