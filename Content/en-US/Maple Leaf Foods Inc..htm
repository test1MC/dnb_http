   Maple Leaf Foods helps feed Canada. The company is one of Canada's largest meat processors; it produces fresh and processed pork and poultry products under the flagship Maple Leaf and Schneiders brands. Maple Leaf Foods' meat products group also includes value-added prepared meats, lunch kits and snacks, along with its fresh pork and poultry products. The company's other consumer brands include Maple Leaf Prime, Maple Leaf Natural Selections, Schneiders Country Naturals, and Mina. Maple Leaf Foods sold off its bakery operations in 2014. Its agriculture business mainly supplies feed to livestock operations.

  <p>
   The Company primarily markets its products in Canada, the US, Mexico, and Japan. Maple Leaf Foods serves all of Canada, which brought in about 75% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2014.

  <p>
   The company's meat products group accounted for 84% of revenue in fiscal 2014. Maple Leaf Foods' agribusiness group includes Canadian hog production operations that primarily supply the meat products group with livestock as well as toll feed sales.

  <p>
   Maple Leaf Foods has suffered continuous declines in revenue in the past few years. In fiscal 2014 revenue decreased by 28% to $3.1 billion (Canadian dollars) primarily due to the sale of the bakery business (Canada Bread) and a decline in revenue from the company's agribusiness group due to lower pricing in the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the decline in revenue in recent fiscal years the company has enjoyed continuous growth in net income in the last five years. During fiscal 2013 and 2014 net income spiked primarily due to gains from selling off operations.

  <p>
   The company has been consolidating its facilities in an effort to lower costs. Maple Leaf Foods transformed its manufacturing network with a new 400,000 square foot Heritage plant in Hamilton, Ontario, expansions at three existing facilities, and the closing of seven legacy plants. The company consolidated its distribution network and has gone from 19 centers to two, including a newly constructed facility in southwest Ontario.

  <p>
   Maple Leaf Mills Limited was Canada's largest flour producer when the UK's
   <company id="90541">
    Hillsdown Holdings
   </company>
   purchased it in 1987. The milling business had roots stretching back to the mid-1830s, but it had been formed from the 1961 mergers of three separate Canadian flour millers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoping to build a diversified food empire, in 1990 Hillsdown purchased Canadian Packers, Canada's largest meat and food processing company, and merged it with Maple Leaf Mills to create Maple Leaf Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1995, despite cuts, sales, and upgrades, Maple Leaf remained largely a commodity producer and was ailing. Still, it was one of Canada's largest food companies, including the Canadian Corporate Foods baking operation. Maple Leaf soon became the object of desire for Wallace McCain. Wallace had been booted from his position as co-CEO of McCain Foods (one of Canada's largest food processors) and was looking for other opportunities. He and his brother, Harrison, started McCain Foods in the mid-1950s; a feud over who would succeed the brothers led to arbitration and Wallace's ouster in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wallace then marched off with sons Scott and Michael and longtime McCain executive Archie McLean in tow. Wallace and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board each put up approximately C$110 million and managed an LBO of Maple Leaf Foods in 1995. McLean was named CEO, Michael was made president, Wallace presided as chairman, and they began to trim and reshape the money-losing Maple Leaf.
  </p>
  <p>
   Divestitures included smaller milling operations, real estate, seafood businesses, and other noncore holdings. Thus lightened, Maple Leaf went on to purchase two other meat processors: Gainers and Burns Foods in 1996. A bitter negotiation with union meat packers in 1997 cost the company money, but in the end it won lower base wages and effectively reorganized Canada's meat processing industry. That year Maple Leaf's 68%-owned baking company, Corporate Foods, changed its name to Canada Bread to better reflect its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the beginning of 1999, McLean stepped down and Michael was handed the position of CEO. Soaring hog prices grounded Maple Leaf's profits in 2000, but the company continued with small meat and aquaculture acquisitions. In 2001 Maple Leaf purchased two fresh pork processing operations from
   <company id="57809">
    Schneider Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2002 Maple Leaf's bakery division acquired two smaller specialty baking operations, and then swapped out all of its businesses to Canada Bread. The exchange brought its ownership of Canada Bread up to 73.3%. In 2003 the company steadily purchased additional shares, gaining it nearly 85% of Canada Bread and over the next few years its ownership had nudged up nearly 88%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maple Leaf purchased Schneider from
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   in 2004. Later that same year, the company sold C$165 million of its common stock to help pay for the acquisition. It also invested some C$110 for the construction of a fresh pork processing plant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a streamlining move, the company reduced the number of its operating units from 14 to 10 in 2005. Its consumer foods businesses, which include Larsen Packers, Maple Leaf Consumer Foods, and Schneider Foods, were merged into Maple Leaf Consumer Foods. Its fresh pork and poultry operations were consolidated as Maple Leaf Fresh Foods. Maple Leaf Animal Nutrition was created out of Landmark Feed and Shur-Grain, and its international business was reorganized under the name Maple Leaf Global Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to concentrate on its bakery, meat, and meals businesses, in 2007 Maple Leaf sold its animal nutrition business to Netherlands-based
   <company id="59206">
    Nutreco Holding
   </company>
   for C$500 million (about $470 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2008 some of the company's products were recalled due to an outbreak of listeriosis traced to
   <em>
    Listeria
   </em>
   -contaminated machinery at its deli-meat operations. Twenty-one people died from food poisoning linked to the Maple Leaf products, and some 5,000 people were either directly or indirectly affected by the outbreak. Class-action lawsuits were filed, and in December 2008 Maple Leaf agreed to pay the victims. It paid out a total of C$27 million (about $22 million) to settle the lawsuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2008 it sold most of its Ontario and Alberta hog operations to concentrate on its Manitoba hog facilities, cutting its hog production from more than 1 million animals in 2007 to an estimated 750,000. That year it acquired another rendering company, Central By-Products, which joined Rothsay.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2010 Maple Leaf completed the sale of a pork-processing plant in Burlington, Ontario, to Fearmans Pork (an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners) for about $20 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 chairman Wallace McCain died and in 2014 the company sold off its bakery business.
