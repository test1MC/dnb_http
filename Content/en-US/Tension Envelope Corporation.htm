   Tension Envelope has an ambition to seal up its market. The family-owned and operated company makes more than 12 billion envelopes each year, selling its product directly to companies in such industries as direct advertising, financial services, publishing, and health care. The company makes standard envelopes as well as producing custom envelopes that include sleeves and wallets, medical sleeves, photo envelopes, and reply envelopes. Other products include financial statement envelopes and photo finishing packaging. Tension Envelope also provides flexographic design guides and art and design service (for more eye-catching envelopes).
