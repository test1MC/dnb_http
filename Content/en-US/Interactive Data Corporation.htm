   Data Broadcasting was formed in 1992 as the successor to the Financial News Network, a bankrupt financial cable TV network. Alan Hirschfield, former CEO of Twentieth Century Fox and Columbia Pictures, and Allan Tessler, experienced in restructuring businesses, were brought in; they sold many of Financial News' assets but held onto two information services, DBC West (stock data for private investors) and Shark Information Services (serving professional traders).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its services and markets through key acquisitions. In 1994 it bought Computer Sports World (online sports data) and Capital Management Sciences (fixed-income data and analysis). The following year Data Broadcasting bought and merged with its chief rival (Broadcast International), bought a stake in Internet Financial Network (online distributor of SEC filings), and sold Shark. These transactions also hurt earnings in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Data Broadcasting acquired international news provider Federal News Service Group in 1997. It also put its InStore Satellite Network and CheckRite International business services divisions up for sale to focus on information services and fund future acquisitions. National Data Corporation, a provider of transaction processing services, bought CheckRite International in 1998; InStore Satellite was a tougher sell, but finally went to

   in 1999. Also that year MarketWatch.com, a financial news Web site operated by Data Broadcasting and CBS, went public (each company retained a 34% stake). (MarketWatch.com later changed its name to
   <company id="58506">
    MarketWatch
   </company>
   in 2004 and was sold to
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones &amp; Company
   </company>
   in 2005.) Data Broadcasting later sold its AgCast business to closely held agricultural publisher The Farm Journal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 UK media company Pearson took a 60% stake in Data Broadcasting in exchange for its global equities information business, Financial Times Asset Management. Former Pearson executives Stephen Hill and Stuart Clark took over as chairman and CEO, respectively. Data Broadcasting later sold its DBC Sports unit (including odds maker Las Vegas Sports Consultants) to former SportsLine.com subsidiary VegasInsider. Also that year Data Broadcasting acquired Thomson Financial's security data business (Muller Data Corporation).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 Data Broadcasting sold its stake in MarketWatch.com to Pearson. It later changed its name to Interactive Data Corporation. The following year the company purchased Merrill Lynch's security data business (Merrill Lynch Securities Pricing Service). Interactive Data purchased McGraw-Hill's S&amp;P ComStock (now called

  <p>
   The following year Interactive Data acquired the assets of FutureSource, a provider of real-time futures and commodities data, and in 2005 it bought IS.Teledata, a provider of customized financial information portals and terminals. IS.Teledata was subsequently renamed Interactive Data Managed Solutions.

   In a move to expand its revenue from consumer-oriented services, the company acquired online stock information provider Quote.com from search portal Lycos (owned by Korea's
   <company id="135299">

   ) for about $30 million in 2006. The acquired business, which includes investment community message board Raging Bull, operates as part of Interactive Data's eSignal division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company grew when it acquired the market data division of Xcitek. The purchase added North American corporate actions information, such as reorganization, cost basis, and class action data, to its Interactive Data Pricing and Reference Data business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interactive Data expanded internationally when it purchased Kler's Financial Data Service, a provider of reference data to the Italian financial industry, for about $30 million in cash in 2008. It continued this strategy later that year when it acquired about 80% of NTT DATA Financial Corporation (NDF) for some Â¥2.4 billion (or approximately $26 million). NDF gave Interactive Data a direct presence in Japan and expanded its business in the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company acquired the Online Financial Solutions (OFS) business of
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   . Interactive Data made the purchase in order to grow its Web-based solutions business in North America, and placed the OFS assets into its U.S. Managed Solutions unit. Specifically, the deal boosted its Web capabilities in developing and hosting news, market data, research and advanced charting, portfolio management, and alerting.

   Clark retired in 2009 and was replaced by Raymond D'Arcy, who has served in a variety of executive roles during his nearly 30-year tenure with the company. The following year private-equity firms
