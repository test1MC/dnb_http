   SSAB Enterprises really deals the steel. The steelmaker produces steel mill products (coil and discrete plate) and fabricated products that include cut-to-length products (hollow structural, hot-rolled coil, sheet, and slab steel). The company operates two steel mills and three cut-to-length facilities in Canada and the US. The division stays adaptable by using Steckel mill technology, which permits the company to alternate between coil and discrete plate production in response to market demand. Its markets include the manufacturing, agricultural, and transportation industries. The North American business unit of Swedish steel company
   <company id="152209">

   produces around 5.2million tons of steel annually.

  <p>
   The company's production takes place at two steelworks -- Mobile, Alabama and Montpelier, Iowa. SSAB Americas has processing and storage facilities are also in Houston and St. Paul, as well as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. In order to increase proximity to the South American market there are storage facilities in Curitiba (Brazil) and Santiago (Chile).

  <p>
   SSAB Americas produces ordinary heavy plate and quenched steel. The steelworks in Mobile and Montpelier produce steel slabs completely from scrap metal and have a crude steel capacity of 1.3 and 1.2 million tons, respectively.

   SSAB Americas (both North and South American operations, of which SSAB Enterprises is a part) accounted 41% of the total sales of
   <company id="152209">
    SSAB Svenskt Stål
   </company>
   in 2013. SSAB Americas revenues decreased by 11% in 2013. Overall demand was relatively weak in the beginning of 2013 due to limited inventory restocking by customers and continued pressure from imports. As the year progressed, gradual improvement was reflected in the market with the biggest drivers being the Energy and Heavy transport sectors. The sales volume for North America increased by 5% in 2013. Expansion in natural gas and oil extraction was the other driving force in the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales to Latin America were driven primarily by the mining industry and heavy transport manufacturers. In Brazil demand was strongest from trailer manufacturers who expanded the use of high-strength steels to include both Weldox and Domex, in addition to the Hardox wear steel. Steel shipments to the automotive industry in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, faced severe competition from local producers and imports, and demand from non-automotive manufacturers for high strength steels was lower than expected.

   SSAB Americas is constantly reviewing opportunities to continue to grow in the plate market throughout the Americas and to support the growing needs of its customers. In 2014 parent SSAB Svenskt Stål entered into an agreement with an engineering firm to undertake a study to identify the requirements related to expansion. The project would result in the Montpelier facility increasing its capacity to as much as 2.1 million finished tons per year. The Iowa expansion of the SSAB Americas plant would increase melting and casting capabilities by up to 1.2 million tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Driven by sales growth, primarily in the Heavy Transport segment and energy sectors, SSAB Americas has continued to strengthen its position as the leading supplier of high strength steels and heavy plate in North America. In 2013, at its Mobile operations, the company expanded its Hardox and Weldox product range. At the same time, Wear Services increased its offering and capacity at several facilities to assist customers in the mining aftermarket.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2013 SSAB Americas invested about $574 million to facilitate an expansion of the heat-treated product portfolio at the plant in Mobile and to increase capacity and services within Wear Services in Northport and St. Paul in the US, as well as in Santiago, Chile.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the construction of the new quench line in Mobile, completed in 2012, SSAB has significantly increased its capacity for producing quenched steel in the Americas from 100,000 to 300,000 tons. With SSAB's expertise in this area and the unrivaled reliability of the Hardox brand, the company is looking to grow this solution based area of the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its position as a leading supplier of heavy plate in North America, in 2012 SSAB Enterprises began production at its new quench and temper line in Mobile, more than doubling its quenched steel production capacity. The company's product portfolio has expanded with the growth in Hardox wear steel and Weldox structural steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also investing to grow other markets, including integrating Wear Solutions in Birmingham, Alabama (chromium carbide overlay products), and expanding its capability to process Hardox and Weldox in Houston and St. Paul.
