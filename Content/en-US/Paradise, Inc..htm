   In 2015 net revenue decreased by 6% due to lower sales in Molded Plastics segment, attributable to a decision by a long term plastics customer within the housing market to transition production of an injection molding part to its own facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Candied Fruit segment sales decreased by 2% due to consolidation within the supermarket industry which limited the number of outlets for the company to sell its glacé fruit products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paradise's net income increased by 5% as the result of a decline in amortization expenses and the absence of interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 operating cash flow decreased by 23% due change in inventories.
