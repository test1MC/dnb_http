   Getmapping is the UK's leading provider of aerial photography, height data, mapping products, satellite imagery, and data hosting solutions. It sells aerial photographs of the UK for print and digital media. The majority of its products and services are sold online and are geared towards end uses such as books, atlases, CAD software programs, educational materials, games, and catalogs. Getmapping also sells topographic information from

    Ordnance Survey
   </company>
   to complement its products, and offers products based on its Millennium Map (a comprehensive aerial photographic survey of the UK), including jigsaw puzzles, 3-D DVDs, and flight-simulator scenery products. Getmapping was founded in 1999.

   In fiscal 2015 (ended December) revenue climbed 8% to £6.0 million, the company's highest ever figure. The company's Africa operations performed strongly, climbing 38% on prior year to £1.6 million. On the downside, weakness in the oil industry meant a mapping project in Angola was suspended, as was a perennially underfunded project in South Africa. Despite the record revenue, however, the company incurred a net loss of £380,000 (versus a profit of £541,000 in 2014) due to a poorly carried out transfer to a new software system, Ultramap. The six months it took to embed the technology into Getmapper's workflow impacted on client service and caused significant administrative costs.

   Getmapping faces an existential threat from the potential loss of aerial photography contracts with the Scottish government and DEFRA (Department for the Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs) to Ordnance Survey (OS). The contracts are up for renewal in Q1 2017; should OS win as management expect, Getmapping's entire aerial photography business is at risk. Getmapping has taken legal recourse: in 2014 it filed a complaint with the European Commission Competition Directorate, citing unfair state aid in the value-added markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Getmapping is countering competition from Ordnance Survey by expanding is aerial photography into North West Europe. In 2016, it won a survey project covering just over a third of the Netherlands. The threat from OS is also the primary factor behind expanding its business in South Africa (it acquired Geosense in 2011) as well as its online services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Getmapping made the decision to transfer to Ultramap software for its aerial photography to meet new specifications for the Ordnance Survey national survey project. After early teething problems, the software is processing photography at an increased rate.
