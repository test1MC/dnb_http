   Dynamic Homes makes and markets modular homes in a dynamic fashion. Over 90% of the homebuilder's manufactured single-family homes are custom built, and are sold primarily in the upper Midwestern US through a network of authorized local builder/dealers. Dynamic Homes constructs about 500 homes a year that range in size from 560 sq. ft. cabins to 2,380 sq. ft. two-story custom homes. Custom options include appliances, floor coverings, lighting, roofing, and siding. The builder also makes modular apartments, nursing homes and senior living facilities, motels/resorts, small office buildings, and large commercial complexes.
