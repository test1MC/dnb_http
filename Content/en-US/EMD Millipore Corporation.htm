   EMD Millipore (doing business as MilliporeSigma) is about making life science research, development, and production faster, easier, and more effective. The company is a US-based subsidiary and one of four main divisions of Germany's
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   . Outside of North America, it is known as the Merck Millipore division. The company is a top tier supplier of a comprehensive set of products and services primarily to pharma, biotech, and academic markets worldwide. Its product portfolio includes more than 60,000 active pharmaceutical ingredients, drug delivery compounds, chemicals and reagents, and instruments. With the parent company's 2015 acquisition of

   Parent Merck's business is divided into two main sectors: Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals. Divisions
   <company id="90988">
    Merck Serono
   </company>
   and Consumer Health Care (mainly OTC pharmaceuticals) make up Merck's Pharmaceuticals business sector, while Performance Materials and EMD Millipore (including its three business units Bioscience, Lab Solutions, and Process Solutions) comprise Merck's Chemicals business sector. MilliporeSigma (or Merck Millipore as it is also known) is parent Merck's second-largest division by revenues behind Merck Serono.
  </p>
  <p>
   MilliporeSigma's Bioscience unit delivers products and technologies that improve laboratory productivity and work flows for life science research. The Lab Solutions unit supplies products for research, analytical and clinical laboratories, while Process Solutions helps pharma and biotech companies develop and/or improve their drug manufacturing processes. Among MilliporeSigma's services are contract manufacturing, custom packaging, testing, consulting, and maintenance.

  <p>
   MilliporeSigma's main customer base includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions. Certain lab-related products and services are geared at the food and beverage and personal care (cosmetics) industries, which require a significant degree of testing due to consumer regulatory requirements.

   In 2015 Merck completed the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion. Sigma-Aldrich was a multinational chemical, life science, and biotechnology company. With the deal EMD Millipore and Sigma-Aldrich are one organization within Merck KGaA, and is now known as MilliporeSigma in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   EMD Millipore was established after Merck acquired leading life science company Millipore Corp. for €5.2 billion ($7 billion) in mid-2010. Merck subsequently folded its EMD Chemicals (or Merck Chemicals) business into EMD Millipore to create a top three player in the life sciences industry, with enhanced global manufacturing, sales, and distribution capabilities and a comprehensive range of products, technologies, and services for pharma and biotech companies and university labs.

  <p>
   In 1954 Jack Bush, an engineer for the Lovell Chemical Company of Watertown, Massachusetts, purchased the rights to a new membrane-production process from his employer and founded Millipore Filter Corporation. As the company grew and expanded its range of fluid-analysis and -purification products, it changed its name to Millipore Corporation. The company made its name as a supplier with a broad range of high-quality products, from peptide synthesizers to ceramic filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Millipore, still under founder Bush, made its first attempt at diversification in 1980 by buying Waters Chromatography (high-performance liquid chromatography equipment). But the two operations required different approaches: Millipore's business revolved around meeting customers' specifications, and Waters' required launching new products for new markets. By the mid-1980s Waters began to drag down Millipore's profitability. John Gilmartin, who had become CEO in early 1986 after predecessor John Mulvany died in a helicopter crash, tried to turn the struggling unit around.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 Millipore acquired Biosearch, a company that specialized in equipment for synthesizing DNA and peptide molecules. Biosearch's operations were meant to create synergies between Waters and Millipore. Biosearch was never able to find a niche, however. Millipore's return on capital fell from 14% in 1987 to less than 10% in 1993, despite the company's halving of capital spending. In 1994 Gilmartin sold both Waters and Biosearch, netting about $300 million on the pair. Some investors were less than happy, as the glut of cash and steady income flow from its core businesses made the firm a prime target for a takeover. Millipore defended itself by buying back about $200 million worth of stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Millipore elevated William Zadel to CEO in 1996 and focused on internal growth and the acquisition of companies with integratable membrane technologies. The company bought Amicon Separation Science from W. R. Grace &amp; Co. that year. Amicon had a larger presence than Millipore in the ultrafiltration market and provided a ready-made entry into the fast-growing process market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Millipore extended its penetration in the semiconductor process market by purchasing Tylan General, adding precision mass-flow controllers and vacuum- and pressure-control and measurement equipment used in the production of integrated circuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Millipore sold Tylan's gas-panel business in 1998 and acquired Anatel Corporation's total organic carbon monitoring technology (used in laboratory water-purification systems). The next year Millipore bought UK-based Bioprocessing Corporation (protein purification media).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Millipore announced plans to spin off its microelectronics business. The next year it separated its microelectronics operations as a subsidiary, Mykrolis Corporation. In 2002 it spun off the unit as a separate company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2005 Francis Lunger stepped down as president and CEO of the company, retaining his role as chairman. Martin Madaus, the former president and CEO of Roche Diagnostics, was named president and CEO to replace him.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Millipore combined its life sciences and laboratory water divisions into a new bioscience division. The company maintained its biopharmaceutical division. That year the company acquired NovAseptic. To complement that purchase Millipore acquired Newport Bio Systems in 2006. Newport makes single-use process containers, bags and liners used by biopharmaceutical companies. It also acquired
   <company id="43781">
    Serologicals Corporation
   </company>
   that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company was acquired by Merck KGaA and its US operation named EMD Millipore.
