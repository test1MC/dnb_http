   WaterFurnace Renewable Energy relies on the heat within the earth to energize its products. The company, also doing business as WaterFurnace International, makes and sells geothermal HVAC systems that utilize heat stored in the ground for residential, commercial, and institutional applications. Its cooling systems work in reverse, extracting heat from indoors. Touting its systems as more efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly than HVAC systems that use fossil fuels, the company has installed more than 300,000 units. Other operations install geothermal loops that heat and cool homes and businesses by circulating pressurized water through hundreds of feet of looped pipe that is buried on-site.

  <p>
   WaterFurnace sells its systems through HVAC contractors and distributors mainly in the US and Canada, but is increasingly looking overseas for growth, particularly in emerging markets as India and the Asia/Pacific. It sells its products in about 30 countries.

   WaterFurnace's balance sheet remained consistent from 2010 to 2011, with revenue levels hovering around $138 million and profits levels staying static at almost $14 million. For 2011, the company recognized a 2% increase in sales in the commercial market, its primary target area for growth. Sales in the US accounted for around 85% of its total sales in 2011, while Canada represented roughly 10%. The company's cash flow for 2011 increased by 61%.

  <p>
   In light of a steep downturn in new housing starts, WaterFurnace has been emphasizing dealer-direct and commercial sales, as well as private label manufacturing. The company hopes that the higher prevalence of geothermal heating and cooling systems in Canada and Europe will eventually translate stateside, and that an increase in demand for its geothermal products in the US will help drive sales.
  </p>

   The company also seeks ways to improve its systems. In early 2011 it acquired assets of Australian firm Hyper Engineering, which designs and makes current inrush control devices for electric motors. It incorporated the newly acquired technologies into its own pumps and now markets them to other manufacturers.
