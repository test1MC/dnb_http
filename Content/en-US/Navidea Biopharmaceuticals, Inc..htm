   Navidea Biopharmaceuticals is tracking down cancer with targeting agents. The biopharmaceutical company specializes in diagnostics, therapeutics, and radiopharmaceutical agents. It has several radiopharmaceutical products in development designed to help surgeons detect disease. The firm's targeted products and platforms include Manocept and NAV4694. Its Lymphoseek product, part of the Manocept platform, gained

    FDA
   </company>
   approval in 2013 (and European approval in 2014) and is marketed in the US to detect cancerous tissues. Other candidates aim to detect cancer and neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Customers include diagnostic laboratories, physicians, and patients.

  <p>
   Radiopharmaceuticals in research and development stages include RIGScan (cancer) and NAV5001 (Parkinson's). The company's NAV4694 candidate, licensed from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , is in development to help in the imaging and diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The Manocept platform targets disorders including cancer, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and Crohn's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company outsources manufacturing of commercial and R&amp;D-stage drugs to third-party providers.

   Following FDA approval of Lymphoseek in 2013, Navidea contracted with

   's nuclear pharmacy services unit to provide exclusive distribution of the drug.

  <p>
   Through 2012, Navidea was dependent on grants to stay afloat. After bringing Lymphoseek to the US market, the company has generated (growing) sales revenues, as well as an upfront milestone payment related to Lymphoseek's distribution in China. Because of this activity, revenue increased 455% to $6.3 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has lost money most years due to R&amp;D expenditures. However, it reduced its loss in 2014 to $36 million (versus $43 million in 2013) as sales earnings increased and R&amp;D costs declined. Operating cash outflow, which had risen every year since 2011, rebounded somewhat in 2014. That year, the company reported $29 million in cash outflow (versus $36 million in 2013) due to changes in inventory and accounts receivable.

  <p>
   To expand its product portfolio and launch products internationally, Navidea is focused on establishing distribution partnerships with other pharmaceutical entities. The company was granted approval to market Lymphoseek in Europe for the detection of certain types of cancer in 2014; Navidea formed a commercialization agreement with Norgine BV to bring Lymphoseek to that market. It expects to see measurable revenues from Europe beginning in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   Navidea also has agreements for the distribution of Lymphoseek in Canada (with Enigma Biomedical Group), Taiwan (with Global Medical Solutions Taiwan), and China (with Hainan Sinotau Pharmaceutical).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company established a new subsidiary, Macrophage Therapeutics, which will explore additional applications for Navidea's Manocept platform. It did so after discovering the technology's potential in treating diseases linked to the over-activation of macrophages (
   <em>
    e.g.
   </em>
   autoimmune, infectious, cardiovascular, and central nervous system diseases).
