  <p>
   Spear &amp; Jackson is based in Sheffield England and has divisions across the UK, France, and Australia. Spear &amp; Jackson boasts a share of the French market through its merger of Forges de Lavieu and Laurenty, makers of agricultural tools and lawn and garden implements. The French concern has similarly branched out with a line of children's gardening products.

   Innovation and new product launches are a key part of Spear &amp; Jackson's growth strategy. Selected new products include Predator Bow Saws, Razorsharp Pro Heavy Duty Bypass Secateurs, Jigsaw Blades (Metal Cutting), COLOURS Loppers, Kew Kids Stainless Forks, and Kew Kids Stainless Hand Trowels.

  <p>
   Despite an uncertain economy coupled with soft demand in the retail and building markets in the UK in the late 2000s, Spear &amp; Jackson boosted sales by introducing new products and winning new business with independent retailers. The company simultaneously shuttered its hacksaw blade plant in the UK, and transferred production in 2011 to a subsidiary in China, where much of its sourcing and production is handled.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tool and equipment maker's parent anticipated that the move would offset increasing material and operating costs as well as extend market development and distribution of its products in developing regions. Spear &amp; Jackson's operations in Australia and New Zealand targeted new business by broadening their product lines to include automotive equipment and air compressors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spear &amp; Jackson traces its roots to 1760 and the early years of the Sheffield steel industry.
