   in Russia? You Yandex. The Internet company, headquartered in The Netherlands for tax purposes, operates Russia's most popular search engine. Yandex.ru boasts a market share of about 60% to google.ru's 35%. Like Google, Yandex generates almost all of its revenues from advertising, counting more than 550,000 advertisers in 2014. Other digital services include Yandex.Mail, Yandex.Maps, news aggregator Yandex.News, online payment system Yandex.Money, and e-tailer Yandex.Market. Yandex also operates search engines in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. Founded in 2000 by CEO Arkady Volozh and CTO Ilya Segalovich, the company launched an IPO in May 2011.

   Yandex sites attract some 67 million unique visitors in Russia and 13 million in Turkey, according to comScore MMX. In December 2014, Yandex websites attracted 9.8 million unique visitors in Ukraine and 2.5 million in Belarus, and 2.2 million in Kazakhstan.

   Yandex's advertising service, called Yandex.Direct, is similar to Google's AdSense and AdWords. The automated, auction-based system allows advertisers to bid for desired keywords for targeted search results. (Users searching for sports scores would see ads for sports-related companies and products, for example). Websites in its Yandex Ad Network generate revenue on a cost-per-click basis, where advertisers pay only when users click on the ads. Yandex also powers the search capabilities to other websites in the Yandex Ad Network. (The company's R&amp;D division is based in Silicon Valley and employs about 15 former Yahoo! and Google engineers). Although Yandex has partnerships with social networking sites such as

   and

   Odnoklassniki and My World, it anticipates that they are becoming its first competitors for online ad budgets, as they are experimenting with new ways of monetizing user traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another larger competitor in the company's quest for online dominance is the Russian government. The laws of the emerging Internet services and e-commerce market are still unclear and ambiguous in Russia, and the government can, at its discretion, order Yandex to pay fees and fines for certain licenses, permits, and registrations. High-profile companies in Russia are often subject to aggressive sanctions, including invalidating contracts, having their licenses withdrawn, facing sudden and unexpected tax audits, and even facing criminal prosecution. Businesses can also face battles for control from the county's oligarchs seeking to obtain controlling or minority stakes in successful companies, either through economic or political influence or government connections.
