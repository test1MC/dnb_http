   American Italian Pasta Company (AIPC) uses its noodle in many ways. The company is one of the biggest makers of dry pasta in North America, by volume, offering some 300 different pasta shapes and 3,100 stock-keeping units, or SKUs, from angel hair to ziti. Its name brands, such as Golden Grain, Heartland, and Mueller's, are staples on retail shelves in the US and overseas. The company's regional private-label customers include most major US grocers and club stores. It also serves the institutional market, comprising food service operators that supply restaurants and schools, and food manufacturers that use pasta as an ingredient. AIPC is owned by

   .

        <p>
   While ConAgra doesn't break out AIPC's sales, it reported that its Private Brands segment posted pasta sales of $564.3 million in fiscal 2014 (ended May) up from about $193 million the prior year. The hefty increase was due in large part to the Ralcorp acquisition (and with it AIPC).

   Both retail and institutional markets are served by four pasta plants located in Arizona, Missouri, South Carolina, and Italy. Their location is intended to optimize grain reception and transportation savings.

   Domestic sales are make through an internal sales force, as well as food brokers and distributors in the US, and Canada. The facility in Italy caters to demand for authentic Italian pasta products from European and other international customers, and North Americans. About 80% of sales are generated by retailers, including grocery, mass merchandise, and drugstore outlets.

    Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   . These proceedings were finally settled in 2008. The company had filed no annual financial reports with the SEC from 2004 until 2008 when it filed annual reports for 2005, 2006, and 2007. It has filed regularly since then.
