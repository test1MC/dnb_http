   Hillenbrand knows a thing or two about life and death. Through its largest subsidiary,
   <company id="118577">
    Batesville,
   </company>
   Hillenbrand is a top supplier to the death care industry, providing nearly half the caskets used in the US. Batesville makes a variety of caskets in materials ranging from wood to stainless steel. Increasingly, it also produces urns and other cremation products to satisfy increasing demand for lower-cost cremation. The company's Process Equipment Group (PEG) designs and makes equipment and systems used by industrial manufacturers. The PEG includes subsidiaries
   <company id="13879">
    K-Tron
   </company>
   , Rotex, and Coperion, and was formed by a trio of acquisitions made in the past several years. Hillenbrand was spun off from Hillenbrand Industries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Historically a US-centric business, Hillenbrand has worked to lessen its reliance on US customers by extending its reach abroad. To this end, the company has concentrated on developing its presence in Switzerland and Canada. In fiscal 2012 (ended September), the US accounted for 83% of Hillenbrand's sales (versus 93% in 2009), while Switzerland and Canada accounted for 8% and 5%, respectively. Batesville makes most of its caskets in the US, but also operates production facilities in Mexico.

  <p>
   Hillenbrand has two primary businesses. The largest, Batesville, accounting for about 60% of Hillenbrand's sales, is an established company founded in 1884 that sells its burial products through a direct sales force to more than 12,000 licensed funeral homes in the US, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the UK, and Australia. Batesville manufactures both metal and solid and veneer hardwood caskets, cremation urns, and burial vaults. It also makes caskets suitable for "green" burials.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Process Equipment Group (PEG) was formed by the purchases of Coperion, Rotex, and K-Tron. It accounts for about 40% of sales. New Jersey-based K-Tron produces feeders, crushers, conveying systems, and other equipment used in the industrial manufacturing processes. Under the Rotex brand, the PEG designs, makes, sells, and services dry material separation machines that sort particles based on their size. Rotex brand equipment is used in a variety of industries including frac sand, potash, urea, phosphates, plastics, and food processing.

  <p>
   Batesville branded burial and cremation caskets and other funeral supplies are marketed by a direct sales force to licensed funeral professionals. The PEG also sells its material handling equipment through independent sales representatives.

  <p>
   Hillenbrand's sales topped $983 million in fiscal 2012 (ended September), an increase of 11% versus the prior year. Net income declined by 1% over the same period. Driving the double-digit increase was the PEG, which posted a 53% increase in annual sales due primarily to the Rotex acquisition in 2011. Batesville's sales declined 5% over the same period. 2012 marked the third year of increasing sales for the company. The small decline in net income was attributed to increased operating expenses and the amortization expense related to the Rotex purchase.

  <p>
   Hillenbrand has moved to diversify its revenue stream in recent years as consumer preferences are shifting and as the total number of deaths in North America, where most of Batesville's products are sold, has been flat. More consumers are choosing cremation and other alternatives to traditional burials. Cremations as a percentage of total deaths now represent more than one-third in the US and more than one-half in Canada.

  <p>
   Aiming to build a "family of companies" revolving around manufacturing, distribution, and customer service, Hillenbrand acquired Stuttgart, Germany-based Coperion Capital GmbH for $545 million in December 2012. The purchase expanded the company's global footprint, bolstered its PEG, and leveraged replacement parts and service capabilities. It's anticipated that the group, with Coperion under its umbrella, will generate more than $1 billion in revenue and represent two-thirds of Hillenbrand's overall sales in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, the firm expanded its manufacturing equipment division through the purchase of ROTEX Global from Windjammer Capital Investors for $240 million in cash in September 2011. ROTEX makes machines (along with replacement parts and accessories) that separate dry materials for various industrial applications, a complementary addition to Hillenbrand's existing equipment line. Although its products are sold throughout the US and abroad, ROTEX boasts a significant customer base in Europe and Asia -- two regions in which Hillenbrand has been looking to strengthen its presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company acquired New Jersey-based K-Tron International, which produces feeders, crushers, conveying systems, and other equipment used in the industrial manufacturing processes. The $435-million purchase gave Hillenbrand access to a much more diverse customer base that comprises chemical, food, pharmaceutical, and plastics companies.
