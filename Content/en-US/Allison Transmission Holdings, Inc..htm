   In the world of automatics, Allison Transmission has pull. The company builds automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles and hybrid-propulsion systems for city buses. Allison's customers include OEMs of garbage trucks and city transit buses, military transports, and dump trucks. The company also makes electric drives for buses and shuttles (it is the world's #1 heavy-duty hybrid producer), and remanufactures transmissions for aftermarket customers. The US accounts for nearly 75% of its total revenues. Allison serves customers in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa in more than 80 countries.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Indianapolis, Allison has regional headquarters located in Brazil, China, the Netherlands, and India. Other manufacturing facilities reside in those countries in addition to Hungary.

  <p>
   Allison serves customers through an independent network of 1,400 independent distributor and dealer locations worldwide. In 2015 it sold 63% of all fully-automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty on-highway commercial vehicle applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's top three customers -- Daimler, Navistar, and Volvo -- accounted for 21%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of its net sales during 2015. The company sells substantially all of its transmissions in the North American on-highway market to OEMs, including Blue Bird, Daimler, Hino, Navistar, PACCAR, Spartan Motors, and Volvo.

  <p>
   Allison's revenues have fluctuated the last few years. After increasing in 2014, revenues dipped 7% to $1.99 billion in 2015. Profits also fell 20% from $229 million in 2014 to $182 million in 2015. Operating cash flow, however, increased marginally by 1% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were fueled by lower sales from several segments, including Outside North America Off-Highway (57%), North America Off-Highway (45%), Defense (28%), and North America Hybrid-Propulsion Systems for Transit Bus (22%). These segments were affected by lower demand for hydraulic fracturing applications, diminished US defense spending, lower demand from China, slow demand for North American service parts, and weak demand across the energy and mining sectors during 2015.

  <p>
   Allison's long-term growth strategy depends on increases outside of North America. As part of that strategy, it has established manufacturing facilities in India and Hungary. It has also dedicated significant human resources to serve markets where it anticipates increased adoption of its products, including China, India, Brazil, and Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company opened a new multipurpose facility in the Netherlands to better serve its customers across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The facility further expanded Allison's capability to provide its OEMs with transmissions that are "installation ready."
