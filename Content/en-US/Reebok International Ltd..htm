   Reebok International feels comfortable stepping out onto any surface. The company, a subsidiary of Germany's
   <company id="92632">
    adidas AG
   </company>
   , has long been at home in sporting arenas as a top US maker of athletic shoes. In addition to its namesake sportswear and accessories, Reebok caters to hockey aficionados through its Canadian
   <company id="15482">
    Reebok-CCM Hockey
   </company>
   division, and its Sports Licensed Division. It operates more than 220 retail stores. Reebok, which has been credited with igniting the aerobics craze of the early 1980s, has fallen out of step since then. Under adidas, the company is trying to regain traction in the athletic shoe and apparel market.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Reebok's growth strategy involves launching new brand lines of shoes that connect with its consumers. In 2011 it introduced RealFlex, running and training shoe designed to promote natural movement. RealFlex features some 75 independent sensors on the bottom of the shoe strategically positioned to twist, bend, expand and support to help athletes' feet move naturally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like its competitors, Reebok is also aiming to grow sales and market share by participating in the craze for body toning athletic shoes and apparel. To that end, it has launched EasyTone walking shoes and RunTone running shoes, which claim to tone the wearer's bottom and leg muscles. The toning line exceeded sales expectations with the company claiming to have sold millions of pairs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buoyed by the success of toning shoes, in 2010 Reebok extended the EasyTone line to men and launched  EasyTone Apparel, a collection of tops and bottoms designed to create resistance as the wearer moves and thus tone key muscles. However, the
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   knocked the legs out from under Reebok in September 2011 when it accused the company of deceptive advertising. Reebok agreed to pay $25 million to customers who bought the popular shoes.

  <p>
   After two long decades of playing second fiddle to
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   , Reebok's acquisition by adidas in 2006 for about $3.8 billion lent it the stature to compete head to head with its #1 nemesis in a battle of the global brands. adidas' purchase of Reebok allowed adidas to hurdle the $10 billion sales mark for the first time in its history. adidas refers to Reebok as its "milestone acquisition." After the dust settled on the deal, Reebok continues to maintain its brand, Massachusetts headquarters, and its identity.

  <p>
   English runner Joseph Foster invented a spiked running shoe in 1894. Other runners liked it so much that Foster started his own shoe company, JW Foster and Sons, in 1894. In 1924 he supplied the shoes for the British Olympic team. Two of Foster's grandsons formed a companion company, Reebok (named for a speedy African antelope), in 1958. It eventually absorbed JW Foster and Sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reebok remained a small British shoe company until 1979, when Paul Fireman, a distributor of fishing and camping supplies, noticed the shoes at a Chicago international trade show. He quickly acquired the exclusive North American license to sell Reebok shoes. Pentland Industries, another British company, agreed to finance him for 56% ownership of Reebok USA. Fireman acquired 40% of the new venture; the rest went to a group of US investors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Realizing that competing with established companies such as NIKE and adidas would be tough, Reebok USA looked to the aerobic-shoe market. In 1982 it introduced Freestyle, a women's Oxford-style sneaker, followed by a line of men's fitness shoes in 1983. The introduction of these new lines of aerobic shoes coincided with a rise in the popularity of aerobics, and the Freestyle became one of the best-selling shoes in history. Sales went from $3.5 million in 1982 to $919 million in 1986, giving Reebok USA a temporary lead over NIKE in the athletic-shoe industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1985 Reebok USA acquired the original British Reebok company. That year Reebok International went public, acquiring Rockport (walking and casual shoes, 1986), Avia (athletic shoes, 1987), Frye (boots, 1987; sold 1989), and Boston Whaler (recreational boats, 1989; sold 1993). The company advanced athletic-shoe technology with such innovations as the Pump, an inflatable basketball shoe, and Avia's cantilever sole. In 1992 Reebok launched the Greg Norman apparel collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   With hopes of replacing NIKE's Air Jordan shoes, Reebok teamed up with NBA newcomer Shaquille O'Neal in 1993 to launch the Shaq Attaq line. But the sneaker boom was slowing as consumers turned to hiking boots and smaller companies stole market share from leaders NIKE and Reebok. That year Reebok sold its Avia shoe and apparel unit and acquired the Ralph Lauren footwear business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998, with Reebok's athletic-shoe market share having slipped to 13% from 22% in the early 1990s, CEO Fireman cut the workforce by 10%. He also recruited former Sony executive Carl Yankowski and Rockport CEO Angel Martinez to run the Reebok division. The two began moving Reebok away from endorsement megastars (it released O'Neal from its squad).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 sales continued to tumble. The company cut another 10% of its workforce and Yankowski left. Fireman took charge of the Reebok brand and Martinez (who resigned in June 2001) moved over to head marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Reebok, amid signs of a turnaround, decided to shift production from Asian countries to "consumer" countries to avoid human rights issues. The company signed a 10-year exclusive contract to supply the NFL with uniforms and other licensed items. That year it extended Venus Williams' contract to $40 million over five years, making it the largest endorsement ever for a female athlete.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reebok bought the operating assets of bankrupt LogoAthletic (sports apparel adorned with team emblems) for about $14 million in 2001. Reebok announced its agreement with the NBA that year to become the exclusive licensee of NBA- and WNBA-branded apparel and footwear, as well as the outfitter of warm-ups and uniforms for all of the pro basketball teams. In early 2002 the company launched several initiatives aimed at creating an edgy, urban image for its shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2003 Reebok Canada signed a multi-year agreement with the
   <company id="113681">
    Canadian Football League
   </company>
   , making Reebok the league's official supplier of footwear, uniforms, gloves, sideline apparel, and accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Reebok agreed to be acquired by adidas. When the deal was completed in 2006, Fireman stepped down as chairman, president, and CEO and agreed to serve as an advisor to adidas management. With Reebok since 1994, Paul Harrington was appointed by adidas as president and CEO of the Reebok business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reebok sold its Ralph Lauren Footwear unit to
   <company id="40369">
    Polo Ralph Lauren
   </company>
   for about $110 million in 2005.
