        <p>Wielding great welding power, Lincoln Electric, the world's largest maker of arc welders and welding gear by sales, is a global manufacturer of welding and cutting products, including arc welding power sources, consumable electrodes, fluxes, fume extraction equipment, robotic welding systems, and wire feeders; other welding products include regulators and torches. The company also has a leading global position in the brazing and soldering alloys market. In North America, which accounts for nearly 60% of its sales, products are sold through a network of industrial distributors. In addition, Lincoln Electric has an international sales organization that sells to more than 160 countries.<![CDATA[

        <p>
   The company gets about 60% of its revenues from the US. It operates 45 manufacturing facilities in almost 20 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Turkey, the UK, the US, and Venezuela).<![CDATA[  ]]></p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>In 2016 Lincoln realigned its organizational structure into three segments: Americas Welding, International Welding, and The Harris Products Group, which specializes in cutting, soldering, and brazing services.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Customers include metal fabricators, offshore oil and gas explorers, power generation facilities, and shipbuilding, automotive, and structural steel construction companies.</p>
        <p>Its products are sold in both domestic and international markets. In North America, products are sold chiefly through industrial distributors and retailers and directly to users of welding products. Outside of North America, Lincoln Electric has an international sales organization comprised of employees and agents who sell products from the its various manufacturing sites to distributors and product users.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>Lincoln Electric's revenues dropped 10% from $2.5 billion in 2015 to $2.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by decreases for all operating segments due to softer demand associated with the current economic environment and weakness in the oil and gas and US export markets.</p>
        <p>Asia Pacific Welding sales fell due to its continued strategic re-positioning efforts within the market. South America Welding sales in 2016 fell in the midst of a highly inflationary environment, particularly in Venezuela.</p>
        <p>Profits, however, surged 56% from $127 million in 2015 to $198 million in 2016. This was the result of lower material costs, more efficient cost control efforts, and stronger price management. The company’s bottom line also benefitted from the absence of pension settlement and asset impairment charges during 2016.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company grows through acquisitions which enhance its A-to-Z list of offerings and grow its geographic presence. In 2016 the company acquired Iowa-based Vizient Manufacturing Solutions. Vizient is a robotic integrator specializing in custom engineered tooling and automated arc welding systems for general and heavy fabrication applications. The helped Lincoln diversify its end-market exposure and broaden its global growth opportunities.</p>
        <p>In 2015 the company picked up Ohio-based Rimrock Holdings Corporation, a manufacturer and integrator of industrial automation products and robotic systems with two divisions. The addition of Wolf Robotics expanded the company’s leadership position in the arena of automated welding and cutting.</p>
        <p>In 2015 Lincoln also obtained Specialised Welding Products (SWP), a provider of specialty welding consumables in Australia and New Zealand. SWP also provides fabrication, maintenance, and repair services for alloy and wear resistant products used in mining and energy sector applications. The deal broadened Lincoln Electric's presence and specialty alloy offerings in the emerging Asia Pacific region.</p>

        <p>
   John Lincoln founded The Lincoln Electric Company in 1895 to make and repair electric motors. By the time his younger brother James joined Lincoln as a salesman in 1907, John had expanded into rechargeable batteries and had also begun researching arc welding. John dedicated himself to research and left James to handle management.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the workplace, James formed an advisory board made up of elected employee representatives from each department. Its twice-monthly meetings became a cornerstone of the company's Incentive Management System, which Lincoln based on six tenets: people as assets, Christian ethics, principles, simplicity, competition, and customer satisfaction. As part of the system, piecework pay and group life insurance (unusual at the time) were begun in 1915. Meanwhile, John perfected the electric arc welding machine that soon became the company's chief product, and in 1917 he formed The Lincoln Electric Welding School.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1934 workers offered to work longer hours during the Depression in exchange for a share of the company's profits; that year bonuses averaged 30% of pay. By the 1940s Lincoln was the world's #1 maker of arc-welding equipment, with subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, and the UK, and licensees in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. Lincoln added a pension plan and an internal promotion program during WWII as ship manufacturing fueled demand for its products.
  </p>
        <p>
   William Irrgang, a German engineer with 26 years at the company, succeeded James Lincoln as president in 1954 (James became chairman). Under Irrgang and Lincoln the company practiced conservative policies: It prohibited capital spending projects with paybacks lasting more than one year. Irrgang became chairman in 1965 and was named CEO (a new title) in 1972, the same year George Willis, a

   MBA and devotee of the Incentive Management System, became president. Willis was constrained by Irrgang's conservatism and the economic woes of the early 1980s. Sales dropped and though Lincoln's policy of not laying off workers was strained, workers shifted jobs into maintenance or sales work.

        <p>Lincoln's short-term initiatives are focused on weakening the impact of unfavorable end-market conditions and maintaining cost-reduction actions announced in 2015. Through the help of these efforts, Lincoln posted a rise in net income in 2016, its first increase in three years.</p>
