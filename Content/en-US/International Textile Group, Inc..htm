   The totally material group -- International Textile (ITG) -- asks, dress uniform or jeans? ITG makes a range of apparel and technical fabrics, military garb, as well as specialty textiles, and, less so, auto safety fabrics. It stands as the world's #1 producer of better denim fabrics, including premium brand

    Cone Denim
   </company>
   used in retail goods. Other business units include Burlington, Safety Components, and Carlisle Finishing. ITG is also one of North America's top manufacturers of worsted wool and commission printers and finishers. The US and Mexico are its largest markets.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounts for 40% of the company's sales, while Mexico generates 33%. Other foreign markets account for the remainder of revenue.

   Demand for the company's apparel fabric generally arises, directly or indirectly, from apparel wholesalers and retailers. Its customers have included V.F. Corporation, Levi Strauss &amp; Co, and the US military.

   ITG has experienced fluctuations in its revenues over the years. After posting decreased revenues in 2014, the company saw revenues increase 3% from $595 million in 2014 to $610 million in 2015. Profits also increased to $17 million, mainly due to a decrease in a loss from discontinued operations. Cash flow from operations surged by 57% from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's growth for 2015 was fueled by additional sales from Commission Finishing due to higher sales volumes and an improved product mix related to new patterns as well as new customers in governmental business. ITG also experienced an increase in Bottom-Weight Woven Fabrics sales due to increased demand for denim and new programs in the wool uniform business, higher selling prices, and an improved product mix in the technical fabrics and synthetic fabrics businesses.

  <p>
   In the wake of the recession, ITG has vigorously preserved its presence in the bottom-weight woven fabrics and denim marketplace. Its strategy is pinned to being the largest and most diversified maker of denim and worsted wool fabrics, along with a smattering of specialty technical and automotive safety fabrics.

  <p>
   Defense contractor Valentec used its experience at making miniature munitions parachutes to develop airbag products. In 1992 it became a certified supplier for auto, aerospace, and defense manufacturer TRW. Safety Components was formed as a Valentec subsidiary in early 1994 and went public that May. The new company retained a limited munitions business that began growing when it won a $60 million contract to make 120mm mortar cartridges for the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Safety Components won a contract to supply airbags to General Motors subsidiary Delphi Interior and Lighting. That year the company also formed a partnership to make airbags in China for the Asian market. Safety Components acquired manufacturer Phoenix Airbag (Germany) in 1996 and also began building a plant in the Czech Republic. That year Safety Components won an extension of its TRW airbag contract through 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company's sales more than doubled in 1998, the result, in part, of its 1997 purchases of JPS Automotive (the airbag-fabric division of Collins &amp; Aikman) and Valentec, which had been Safety Components' largest shareholder. Also in 1998 Safety Components won a major defense artillery contract and received an airbag order worth $39 million a year. The company ended its joint venture in China in 1999 and recorded a loss that fiscal year caused by factors that included consolidation expenses, the GM workers strike, and new model startup costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Safety Components filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2000; it emerged from that October. In late 2000 the company sold its Valentec Systems defense consulting business for about $4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its airbag operations, Safety Components in 2001 put its metal and defense business up for sale and consolidated many of its operations at lower-cost facilities. In September 2001 the metal and defense unit was sold to a subsidiary of
   <company id="15114">
    Orbital ATK
   </company>
   , and that November the company's UK subsidiary acquired Woodville Airbag Engineering, a division of Smiths Group. In 2003 many of Woodville's operations were moved from the UK to lower-cost manufacturing locations, including the Czech Republic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2003, holding company Zapata Corporation bought a controlling stake in Safety Components. Zapata sold its interest in the company in 2005 to investor Wilbur L. Ross, Jr's WL Ross &amp; Co. The following year Ross moved to merge Safety Components with his fabric-making concern International Textile Group. The new entity adopted the latter company's name.
