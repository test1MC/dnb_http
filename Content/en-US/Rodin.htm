   Products made by Rodin (formerly Phoenix Gold) produce enough throbbing bass to rock your media room and maybe even make your neighbors call the authorities. The company makes high-end audio electronics (amplifiers and equalizers), speakers, and accessories for the home theater market. Its products, originally made in Portland but now overseas, are sold through specialty retailers worldwide under the Phoenix Gold, Carver Professional, and AudioSource brand names. In late 2003 PG Holding (controlled in part by former chairman and CEO Timothy Johnson) purchased a majority stake in the company. Phoenix Gold was acquired, in turn, by a group of investors in 2006 and changed its name in 2007.

   Rodin's key customers tend to be teenage boys and young men who love a throbbing bass and are willing to pay for quality. Some products, such as top-end Carver Professional amplifiers, sell for more than $2,000.

   Peterson founded the company in 1984 to sell car and home audio and video cables and accessories at Tom Peterson's, an electronics store founded by his father. Two years later it became part of the store's parent company, XTI-Xonix Technologies. Peterson and Johnson bought the division before XTI went bankrupt in 1991.

   Since the late 1980s the company has expanded into nearly every facet of car audio. In 1994 it introduced the Cyclone, a car stereo speaker that uses a small motor to produce sound rather than the traditional magnet and cone (it generates three times the bass of other systems).

   In 1995 the company went public and expanded into the professional and home audio markets. That year the firm acquired Carver's professional amplifier division, which makes sound systems for concert venues and touring rock bands. With company resources strained by the Carver acquisition and too many product introductions in 1996, the company suffered its first loss since leaving XTI.
  </p>
  <p>
   Proving to be another tough year for the company, in 1998 its stock value dropped after the company was criticized by a former director and a major investor. NASDAQ then demoted then Phoenix Gold from its national to small-cap listings. A restructuring late in 1998 included layoffs, a hiring and wage freeze, and the elimination of a poorly performing speaker line.
