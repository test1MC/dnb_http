   For Coronado Biosciences, parasites have something to give to patients with autoimmune disorders. A biopharmaceutical company, Coronado is developing a candidate to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and multiple sclerosis, all of which are brought on by over-reactive immune systems that attack, rather than protect, the human body. The drug, TSO, features an unusual active ingredient -- an intestinal parasite -- that serves to temper the human body's immune response. TSO is the company's prime candidate and is in clinical-stage development. Coronado also has another candidate in development to treat leukemia and other cancers. The company went public in 2012.

  <p>
   Coronado raised nearly $30 million in its 2012 IPO. Like most public pharmaceutical companies, it said it would use the funds to continue development and trials for its candidates.

  <p>
   The company's TSO candidate uses a species of whipworm found in pigs that is also prevalent in third-world human populations. The drug is the result of research that hypothesizes that a lack of intestinal parasites found in populations in developed countries correlates to hyperactive immune systems. On the other hand, Coronado's cancer drug candidate affects the body's immune system by activating, rather than quelling, certain immune system cells that kill cancer cells by destroying their cell membranes and structures.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Coronado doesn't have any sales or marketing personnel and has said it will either hire or engage a third-party to provide sales and marketing once its products are approved.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Coronado has yet to generate any revenue. Its net loss has been declining though R&amp;D expenses continue to climb. The company has an accumulated deficit of $84 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's aim is to shepherd current products through regulatory approval process while developing or purchasing additional candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coronado originally acquired TSO and other assets from Asphelia Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Coronado has an agreement with OvaMed under which OvaMed will supply and manufacture TSO. The company also acquired exclusive rights to TSO in North America, South America, and Japan under a license agreement with OvaMed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coronado acquired the worldwide rights to develop and market its cancer candidate from an affiliate of University College London.
