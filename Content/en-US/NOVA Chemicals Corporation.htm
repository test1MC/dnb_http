   Always looking for new chemical money makers, NOVA Chemicals Corporation produces a wide range of plastic and chemical products. Its Olefins and Polyolefins units manufacture ethylene -- the most widely produced petrochemical -- and polyethylene -- the most widely used plastics material for consumer and industrial markets. Uses include packaging, toys, bottles, and building products. Its Performance Styrenics unit makes expandable polystyrene (EPS) and ARCEL resins, used in packaging and insulation. NOVA Chemicals is owned by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company.

  <p>
   NOVA Chemicals has seven manufacturing plants in North America and five operating and sales locations in China, Canada, Switzerland, and the US. In 2013 it got 50% of its revenue from the US, and 44% from Canada.

  <p>
   The company has four reporting segments: Polyethylene (35% of the company's 2013 revenues); Corunna Olefins (33%, ethylene and co-products); Joffre Olefins; and Performance Styrenics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales and Marketing
  </p>
  <p>
   NOVA Chemicals' products are marketed primarily through its own sales force, with support from established distributors, agents and traders. Canadian products are sold into the US primarily through subsidiary, NOVA Chemicals Inc., for resale through distribution arrangements.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2013 the company's revenues grew by 4% due to higher sales prices and record sales volumes in its Polyethylene segment. The industry average Polyethylene sales price was 7% higher, and sales volume was up 11%. Joffre Olefins' revenues increased due to higher sales volumes for ethylene and co-products, partially offset by lower ethylene and co-product sales prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   NOVA Chemical's net income grew by 24% in 2013 due to higher revenues and profits from continuing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash inflow declined to $954 million in 2013 (down from $1.15 billion in 2012) as the result of a change in the working capital due to an increase in trade receivables and inventories.

  <p>
   In 2015 NOVA Chemical announced the commercialization of SURPASS HPs667-AB polyethylene resin. This new high-performance resin is a result of the customer-focused research and development work at the company's Centre for Applied Research and Centre for Performance Applications in Calgary.

  <p>
   Responding to the growing supply of and demand for low cost feedstocks from North American shale plays, in 2013 the company began construction of the Polyethylene 1 Expansion Project in Alberta.

    INEOS Styrenics
   </company>
   .Through the joint venture, NOVA Chemicals had been one of the world's largest producers of styrene monomer and styrenic polymers. Prior to the buyout, the venture had provided about 30% of NOVA Chemical's business and produced more than $1 billion in revenues for the company in 2010.
