   Work at Advanced Drainage Systems (ADS) isn't going down the drain, it is the drain. ADS makes high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe for storm and sanitary sewers, agricultural drainage, road and highway construction, and residential and commercial development. The corrugated "tile" runs from culverts to drains, grates, grease interceptors, and leaching chambers. ADS offers a green building lineup, made from recycled material. It also makes drains made of concrete. Customers are mining and timber operators as well as engineers in highway construction and waste management systems. ADS products lie under US sports sites such as Augusta National, Dodger Stadium, and Lambeau Field.

  <p>
   ADS operates roughly 50 US and international manufacturing facilities. It also has about 30 distribution centers in the US. Sales from the US account for roughly 85% of its total revenue.

  <p>
   Targeting public works, ADS pushes for new service approval of its pipes' structural strength and flow efficiency. Federal regulations have helped; state governments receiving federal monies must consider drainage materials beyond steel and concrete. Although competitors in the concrete industry disagree with the rule's application to HDPE, certain ADS pipe offerings have received a nod from the departments of transportation in several states, including Florida (FDOT) and Utah (UDOT).

   Money-saving features and the reduced environmental impact of ADS corrugated HDPE pipe have contributed to winning civil construction contracts. Because a large amount of pipe can be loaded with each delivery, truck transportation time, cost, and emissions are reduced.

   ADS's revenues surged by 10% to peak at a record-setting $1.18 billion in 2015, while its profits declined 23% to $8.62 million. The company's domestic sales increased in 2015 due to spikes in both pipe and Allied product sales. This was largely the result of an increase in demand from the residential construction and nonresidential construction sectors as both markets continued strong recoveries. The erosion of profits for 2015 was attributed to additional expenses and losses association with a previous acquisition.

   ADS is broadening its customer base by expanding its offerings through a series of business acquisitions and joint ventures. In early 2015, it purchased Ideal Drain Tile Limited and Wave Plastics (Ideal Pipe) for $44 million. Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures, and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition strengthened its position in Canada and enhanced its manufacturing, marketing, and distribution capabilities.
