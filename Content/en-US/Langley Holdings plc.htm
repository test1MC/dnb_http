   No hype, Langley Holdings has a hold on the material progress of the world through several primary operating divisions and diversified niche businesses. Its Claudius Peters division makes machines and technology used for materials handling and processing (cement, coal, gypsum) and in aerospace manufacturing. A Pillar Power arm builds uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for banks to broadcasters, while ARO Group touts resistance welding technology for auto and other OEM tools. Niche businesses include manufacture of cranes and material handling equipment used in ports to steel works, as well as process plant and steel fabrication machines. The company was founded in 1975 by Tony Langley, its owner.

  <p>
   The company is based in the UK with principal operating divisions located in Germany, France, and the UK and more than 70 subsidiaries worldwide.

  <p>
   Langley's revenue increased by 58% in 2013 due to 10% growth in its Piller division driven by higher demand for data center systems. In addition, its defense and airport operations performed well in the UK, US, and Australian markets.

   Langley and its divisions launch offices in select markets and utilize acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2014 Manroland Sheetfed GmbH introduced its own subsidiary in India, based in New Delhi with local offices in Mumbai and Chennai. In 2013 ARO Welding Technologies enhanced its global presence by opening a subsidiary in Brazil. The next year, ARO expanded its manufacturing capacities in China.

   In 2014 Langley acquired DruckChemie, a German print chemicals group, to expand its reach in Europe and Brazil.
