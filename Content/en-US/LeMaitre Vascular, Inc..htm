   LeMaitre Vascular makes the veins run on time. The company makes both disposable and implanted surgical vascular devices, including catheters and stents, under such brands as AnastoClip, EndoFit, and Pruitt-Inahara. Originally founded by a vascular surgeon to develop a valvulotome to prepare veins for arterial bypass surgery, the company has since expanded its offerings to include a device to create dialysis access sites and another to treat aortic aneurysms. Le Maitre sells 12 product lines, most of which are used in open vascular surgery and some of which are used in endovascular procedures. Its products are sold to hospitals in North America, Europe, and Japan through a direct sales force.

  <p>
   The company manufactures most of its products in a single facility in Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to tap into the world's third-largest medical device market, LaMaitre opened its first office in China in mid-2014.

  <p>
   LeMaitre sells its products through a direct sales force, but also relies on a few distributors in several countries. The company, however, is expanding its sales force to reach its customers more directly.

  <p>
   The company has grown by competing in niche markets, expanding its worldwide direct sales force, and acquiring and developing complementary vascular devices. LeMaitre also intends to grow by pursuing regulatory approval of its products in new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with acquisitions, product enhancements and developments are at the heart of the firm's growth strategy. As new products are acquired or launched, the company also cleans out its closet and discontinues or divests products it no longer considers complementary.

  <p>
   In 2016, LeMaitre acquired Restore Flow Allografts for $14 million plus potential performance payments. Restore Flow processes and cryopreserves vascular veins and arteries, which LeMaitre will use as it expands its range of biologic products. Other recent acquisitions for the company include OmniFlow II and ProCol.

  <p>
   LeMaitre was founded in 1983 by vascular surgeon George D. LeMaitre, to develop a valvulotome to prepare veins for arterial bypass surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 LeMaitre Vascular raised more than $30 million from its initial public offering. The company spent part of the proceeds to pay off debt; it also used proceeds toward its goals of increasing research and development efforts, hiring new sales representatives, and acquiring complementary products or businesses.
