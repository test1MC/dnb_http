   To save costs at its production facility, in 2013 the company announced the results of its energy efficiency efforts in partnership with the
   <company id="40460">
    Tennessee Valley Authority
   </company>
   . Logan refitted its light fixtures and upgraded equipment (including pumps and air dryers), cutting the mill's annual power consumption by more than 2 million kilowatt-hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it completed upgrades to the air pollution-control equipment at one of its cold mills, resulting in an 85% reduction in particulate emissions and an 82% reduction in VOC emissions.
