   M/A-COM Technology Solutions (aka MACOM) has many components for all your semiconductor needs. The holding company makes analog semiconductors used in wireless and wireline applications across the radio-frequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter wave spectrum. Its portfolio encompasses some 3,500 standard and custom integrated circuits, modules, and subsystems across 40 product lines. MACOM's chips are used in such products as automotive navigation systems, point-to-point radios, radars, CATV set-top boxes, MRI systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

  <p>
   MACOM uses a fab-lite manufacturing model that involves using both company-owned fabrication facilities (fabs) and third-party foundries to meet production needs. Fab-lite is used by many chip makers to maintain control over quality and proprietary processes, while having access to additional production capacity when needed to meet increased demand. The fab-lite model also reduces the amount of capital investment required to maintain and upgrade semiconductor fabs.

  <p>
   MACOM produces gallium arsenide (GaAs) and silicon semiconductors at its facility in Massachusetts, which also serves to meet the internal domestic facility requirement to be a strategic supplier under aerospace and defense contracts. It is in the process of updating the plant to include Gallium Nitride (GaN) fabrication operations as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has design and component manufacturing facilities in California, China, Ireland, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for 36% of sales followed by China, 22%, Taiwan, 13%, and other countries, 28%.

  <p>
   MACOM counts a diverse customer base of more than 6,000 companies including systems manufacturers, OEMs, contract manufacturers, and distributors. Its top 25 direct customers account for a combined 55% of sales. About 12% of sales went to
   <company id="173562">
    Alltek
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products through its direct sales force and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors, as well as an e-commerce channel. The direct sales force is staffed in 32 locations worldwide, augmented by independent sales representatives and distributors around the world.

  <p>
   Sales, at $420 million in 2015, were just a notch up from $418 million in 2014. The company lost revenue from the automotive business it sold. Without that impact, sales were 24% higher with contributions from acquisitions made in the past several years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company turned a $48.6 million profit in 2015, turning around a $15 million loss in 2014. The company had lower restructuring charges in 2015 and gains from the discontinued business that showed up on the bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations trended higher in 2015 to $33.7 million from $25 million in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2015 MACOM sold its automotive business to Autoliv because the business didn't fit into its core strategy. The sale brought in about $82 million. The company also divested the  wireless business of Mindspeed, which was acquired in 2013.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   MACOM spent nearly $100 million on two significant acquisitions in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought FiBest Limited, a Japan-based merchant market component supplier of optical sub assemblies, for some $60 million. The move extends the optical networking components it supplies, expanding its market in data centers for 100G data rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   MACOM also bought Aeroflex's diode business in a $38 million transaction. The deal brings a complementary product portfolio in JAN-certified diodes and transistors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013 MACOM bought California-based fabless semiconductor designer
   <company id="102687">
    Mindspeed
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. It then turned around and sold Mindspeed's wireless infrastructure business unit to
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   and its Comcerto CPE communications processor business to
   <company id="162145">
    Freescale
   </company>
   . The divestitures allow MACOM to remain focused on its core competencies within the high performance analog, RF, microwave and millimeter wave markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 MACOM bought
   <company id="105309">
    Nitronex
   </company>
   , a designer and manufacturer of gallium nitride (GaN) based RF chips. It paid $26 million for the company, which expands its product portfolio with GaN-on-Silicon epitaxial and pendeoepitaxial semiconductor process technology and materials.

  <p>
   The company arose out of the former
   <company id="112667">
    M/A-COM, Inc.
   </company>
   which was bought by Tyco Electronics (now
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   ) and renamed Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems. TE Connectivity sold M/A-COM's RF components and microwave subsystems assets to
   <company id="57756">
    Cobham
   </company>
   for $425 million in 2008 and its wireless assets to
   <company id="10709">
    Harris
   </company>
   for $675 million in 2009. Cobham then sold M/A-COM Technology Solutions, Inc. (M/A-COM Tech), the company's commercial business, to a private equity firm, GaAs Labs, for $90 million in 2009. (M/A-COM Tech traces its roots back to 1950, when it was founded as Microwave Associates).
