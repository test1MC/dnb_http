   Bretford looks to serve education and workplace environments that need storage and transport furniture for iPads and iPad minis. To this end, the company developed and launched a Mobility Cart 42. As its name implies, it's capable of charging, storing, securing, and transporting up to 42 iPads or iPad mini tablets. The cart also features separate locking front and rear compartments to keep chargers locked separately from their devices and direct the heat from chargers to dissipate away from the iOS devices. It is aimed at the growing use of iPads by the education market.

   In 2015 the company launched its PureCharge family of quick-charging carts and stations that are available to the UK and Australian markets.

   In 2013 Bretford wound down production of many of its traditional library and conference room products to focus instead on technology-enabled furniture to support today's collaborative work and 21st Century learning environments. Bretford reports exponential increases in demand for its EDU 2.0 line of mobile and powered furniture, while demand for more traditional and "old-school" products declines.
