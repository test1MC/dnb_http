   L.S. Starrett has forged its business inch by inch. It makes more than 5,000 products, including hand measuring tools (Evans Rule tape measures, steel rules, combination squares, micrometers) and precision instruments (vernier calipers and height and depth gauges). Starrett sells its products in more than 100 countries, boasting major subsidiaries in Brazil, Scotland, and China. The company also makes levels, vises, lubricants, saw blades, and vocational and educational materials. Starrett caters to machinists in the metalworking industry but also serves the DIY, automotive, aviation, construction, marine, and farm equipment industries. The company was founded in 1880 in Massachusetts by Laroy S. Starrett.

  <p>
   Starrett has seen its balance sheet fluctuate over the last few years. After declining from 2012 to 2013, its revenues increased 1% to $247 million in 2014. The growth for 2014 was driven by sales increases in China, the UK, and the US.

   On the heels of experiencing a net loss of $162,000 in 2013, the company posted profit of $6.7 million in 2014. Starrett's operating cash flow fell by nearly $10 million from 2013 to 2014, declining from $20 million to nearly $11 million.

  <p>
   Starrett seeks to grow by expanding its product line and by focusing on lean manufacturing. In mid-2014, the company introduced high performance carbide-tipped band saw blades. The new product is designed to improve production, increase blade life, and reduce cost per cut.

   The L.S. Starrett Company was founded in 1880 by Laroy Sunderland Starrett. An avid inventor, Starrett had filed 100 patents for his inventions before he set up shop in Athol, Massachusetts. He established offices in London and Paris in 1882. By the time of his death in 1922, his company's Athol factory was the world's largest plant devoted to fine mechanical tools. Starrett was listed on the NYSE in October 1929, a week before the stock market crashed.
