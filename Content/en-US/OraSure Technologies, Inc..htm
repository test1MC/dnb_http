   When it comes to diagnostic tests, OraSure is certain it can deliver results. The oral specimen kits and other diagnostic tests developed by OraSure Technologies are designed to detect drug use and certain infectious diseases, namely HIV and hepatitis C. Its OraSure products use oral specimens rather than traditional blood or urine based methods to test for HIV. The Intercept line uses oral samples to test for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, PCP, and amphetamines. OraSure has also developed a rapid HIV blood diagnostic testing method, and it has entered the genetic testing market through its DNAG subsidiary. OraSure sells its products in the US and internationally to health care facilities and medical laboratories.

        <p>
   Products include tests that detect antibodies to the HIV and HCV viruses and tests for drug abuse detection. OraSure operates in two primary segments: Its OSUR business (70% of revenue) develops, manufactures, and sells diagnostic products, specimen collection devices, and genetic testing devices. Meanwhile, OraSure Technologies makes and sells enzyme immunoassay test kits and oral fluid collection devices for insurance laboratories; these products are used to assess the health and behavior of insurance applicants.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition to diagnostic tests and specimen kits, OraSure's Histofreezer cryosurgical removal system treats a range of different types of skin lesions, including plantar and genital warts and other common benign skin lesions. OraSure also sells an OTC wart remover under the Freeze n' Clear brand.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Only about 25% of OraSure's sales come from abroad, but the company is expanding its international sales efforts. Subsidiary DNAG leases a 23,500 sq. ft. facility in Ottawa, Canada.
  </p>
        <p>
   OraSure's products are available across North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.

        <p>
   OraSure uses direct agents, collaborative partners, and independent distributors to market its products in the US and abroad. Marketing techniques include trade shows, distributor promotions, and print advertisements. Customers include public health clinics, hospitals, pathology laboratory operators, and doctors' offices.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company spent $6,910 on advertising, down from $17,142 spent in 2013.

   The company's revenues have been steadily climbing for the past five years. Revenue increased 8% to $106 million in 2014 on higher sales, especially of its Oragene molecular collection systems, HCV detection products, and cyrosurgical systems products. Additionally, licensing and product development earnings rose due to OraSure's co-promotion agreement with
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   for the HCV line.
  </p>
        <p>
   To date, OraSure hasn't been profitable. Net losses declined 59% to $5 million in 2014, though, due to the firm's higher revenue and lower marketing expenses. Cash flow from operations, which had spiked in 2013 due to settlement payment from
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   , declined marginally in 2014 to $7 million. That decline was primarily due to an increase in inventory of its OraQuick HCV product as well as higher expenses.

        <p>
   In addition to geographic expansion, OraSure is also increasing its product offerings by developing diagnostic tests for other infectious diseases. In 2014, R&amp;D activities were focused primarily on developing its next-generation Intercept i2 collection device, testing a new rapid Ebola test using the OraQuick platform, and support for its existing products.
  </p>
        <p>
   OraSure's growth strategy also consists of pursuing additional FDA approvals and European registrations for its best-selling product lines OraQuick and Intercept. In partnership with
   <company id="11473">
    Thermo Fisher
   </company>
   , it develops and supplies oral fluid drugs of abuse assays to be used with its Intercept i2 collection device. The company entered an agreement with AbbVie in 2014 to co-promote OraQuick in the US and abroad. Additionally, OraSure Technologies and AbbVie joined together with the Healthy Trucking Association of America to educate truckers about the hepatitis C virus.
  </p>
        <p>
   Additionally, the company is starting to offer some existing products over-the-counter. It already sells some of its cryosurgical wart removal kits on an OTC basis in Central America and Europe.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To enter the molecular diagnostics market, while keeping its emphasis on oral fluids, OraSure acquired private Canadian firm DNA Genotek (DNAG) in 2011. In exchange for some $53 million, OraSure obtained DNA Genotek and its oral fluid collection products, including the Oragene DNA sample collection kit, which is used in a range of settings including academic research labs and personal genetics testing.
