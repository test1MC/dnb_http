   With Beam's strength in bourbon and Suntory's expertise in spirits, Beam Suntory is looking to build on its core brands by focusing on power brands and risings stars. The strengthen its brands and their connection with consumers, the company is investing in television, digital, and print advertising, as well as in-store marketing. Beam Suntory is also looking to its strengthened global distribution network to promote growth in markets worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beam Suntory plans to reinforce brand-building marketing activities for iconic global brands including Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Hibiki, and also strengthen key brands in each region to drive sustainable, profitable growth. To drive growth in Japan, Beam Suntory will position -196°C Strong Zero, Horoyoi, canned Kaku Highball, Funwari Kyogetsu and Sumiwataru series, and also launch the new Hibiki JAPANESE HARMONY whisky, new RTDs Kokusibori and The O.N.E. and the new RTS Matcha Kaoru Osake.

   In 2015 Hornitos Tequila introduced Hornitos Spiced Honey, which features 100% blue agave Hornitos® Plata Tequila infused with natural honey flavor and a special spice blend. Hornitos Tequila is the first major player to debut a honey tequila product.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Pinnacle Vodka launched two flavor innovations, Pinnacle Mimosa and Pinnacle Habanero. In 2014 Pinnacle Vodka released a new flavor innovation, Pinnacle CranApple Vodka.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Beam Suntory began distribution of the Suntory Japanese and Scotch whiskies and Midori liqueur in the US and Germany.

  <p>
   Fortune Brands began in 1864 as W. Duke and Sons, a small tobacco company started by North Carolina farmer Washington Duke. James Buchanan Duke joined his father's business at age 14, and by age 25 was its president. James advertised to expanding markets, bought rival tobacco firms, and by 1904 controlled the industry. That year he merged all the competitive groups as American Tobacco Company. In a 1911 antitrust suit, the US Supreme Court dissolved American Tobacco into its original constituents, ordering them to operate independently.
  </p>
  <p>
   James left American Tobacco the next year. He established a $100 million trust fund composed mainly of holdings in his power company, Duke Power and Light (now
   <company id="10481">
    Duke Energy Corporation
   </company>
   ), for Trinity College. The school became
   <company id="40136">
    Duke University
   </company>
   in 1924.
  </p>
  <p>
   George Washington Hill became president of American Tobacco in 1925. For the next 19 years until his death, George proved himself a consummate adman, pushing Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, and Tareyton cigarettes to top sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smokers began switching to filter-tipped cigarettes in the 1950s because of health concerns. American Tobacco, however, ignored the trend and continued to rely on its popular filterless brands until the mid-1960s. In 1962 the firm sold J. Wix and Sons (Kensitas cigarettes) to UK tobacco firm
   <company id="53931">
    Gallaher Group
   </company>
   for a stake in Gallaher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company remained solely in the tobacco business until 1966, when it purchased Sunshine Biscuits (sold 1988) and Jim Beam Distillery. Reflecting its increasing diversity, the firm became American Brands in 1969. The next year it added Swingline (office supplies) and
   <company id="103896">
    Master Lock
   </company>
   . Meanwhile, American Brands increased its stake in Gallaher, controlling 100% by 1975. In 1976 the company bought Acushnet (Titleist and Bulls Eye); it added FootJoy in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Threatened with a takeover by E-II Holdings (a conglomerate of brands split from Beatrice), American Brands bought E-II in 1988. It kept five of E-II's companies -- Day-Timers, Aristokraft (cabinets), Waterloo (tool boxes), Twentieth Century (plumbing supplies), and Vogel Peterson (office partitions; sold 1995) -- and sold the rest (
   <company id="43677">
    Culligan
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40046">
    Samsonite
   </company>
   ) to Riklis Family Corporation. Acquisitions in 1990 included
   <company id="103866">
    Moen
   </company>
   (faucets) and Whyte &amp; Mackay (distillers). The company bought seven liquor brands in 1991 from Seagram.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Brands sold its American Tobacco subsidiary, including the Pall Mall and Lucky Strike brands, to onetime subsidiary B.A.T Industries in 1994. The firm acquired publicly held Cobra Golf in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year American Brands changed its name to Fortune Brands and completed the spinoff of its Gallaher tobacco subsidiary. In 1998 Fortune bought kitchen and bathroom cabinetmaker Schrock from
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   , doubling its sales in that category. Also that year it bought Geyser Peak Winery (sold in 2007) and Apollo Presentation Products (overhead projectors).
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to trim costs, Fortune relocated its headquarters to Lincolnshire, Illinois, in 1999 (the company moved again in 2006, this time to Deerfield, Illinois). Also in 1999 Norman Wesley was named chairman and CEO. That year Fortune formed
   <company id="61203">
    Maxxium Worldwide
   </company>
   (a non-US wine/spirits sales and distribution joint venture) with
   <company id="91934">
    Rémy Cointreau
   </company>
   and
   <company id="90205">
    Highland Distillers
   </company>
   and it bought Boone International (presentation products) and NHB Group, a manufacturer of ready-to-assemble kitchen and bath cabinetry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Fortune and Swedish company
   <company id="92083">
    V&amp;S Group
   </company>
   formed
   <company id="103410">
    Future Brands
   </company>
   , a joint venture to distribute Absolut vodka in the US. (Future Brands was later dissolved in 2008 when V&amp;S and Fortune split ways.) Also in 1999 Fortune's
   <company id="104239">
    Jim Beam Brands Worldwide
   </company>
   unit unloaded its UK-based Scotch business for $290 million as part of its strategy to focus on fast-growing, premium brands. Fortune Brands bought The Omega Group, a manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinetry, for $538 million in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 20,000 barrels of Fortune's Jim Beam bourbon went up in smoke during a warehouse fire in the summer of 2003. The Bardstown, Kentucky, facility was believed to be the victim of a lightning strike from a passing thunderstorm. Also that year the company expanded its home and hardware division by acquiring privately held doormaker
   <company id="104725">
    Therma-Tru
   </company>
   for approximately $925 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortune Brands merged its holdings in
   <company id="13550">
    General Binding Corporation
   </company>
   and office products company ACCO World (Day-Timers, Swingline, Apollo, Kensington) in 2005. It spun off the resulting firm,
   <company id="104519">
    ACCO Brands Corporation
   </company>
   , in order to focus on its Home and Hardware, Spirits, and Golf segments. The company had previously tried to sell ACCO World but abandoned the idea when it didn't receive an acceptable offer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Fortune spent about $5 billion (subsequent adjustments added $350 million more) to acquire more than 20 wine and liquor brands formerly owned by Allied Domecq. First,
   <company id="46900">
    Pernod Ricard
   </company>
   acquired Allied Domecq with Fortune's monetary help; Pernod Ricard then began transferring a group of previously agreed-upon assets -- including Sauza tequila, Canadian Club whiskey, Courvoisier Cognac, Laphroaig single-malt Scotch, and Clos du Bois wines -- to Fortune. The company sold its US wine holdings in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In less "intoxicating" news, Fortune bolstered its home and hardware division in 2006 when it bought vinyl-framed window replacements maker
   <company id="108530">
    Simonton Building Products
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Fortune became embroiled in a lawsuit over the 10% stake in Beam Global Spirits &amp; Wine that it didn't already own. Sweden's V&amp;S Group owned the stake and wanted to transfer it to the Swedish government as part of its 2008 sale to Pernod Ricard. However, Fortune wanted to buy the stake back. After some legal wrangling and negotiating, Fortune repurchased the minority stake for some $455 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further disentangle Beam Global from the V&amp;S Group, Pernod Ricard paid $230 million to exit a joint distribution deal between the two companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Fortune paid Pernod Ricard $103 million for
   <company id="15894">
    Cruzan
   </company>
   , one of the fastest-growing brands of rum in the US. Fortune Brands continued to stock the bar when it bought the Holland-based vodka brand EFFEN from
   <company id="59294">
    Sazerac
   </company>
   in 2009. As part of the deal, Fortune sold its Old Taylor whiskey brand to
   <company id="59294">
    Sazerac
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Beam Global Spirits in 2008 established an international distribution alliance with
   <company id="100938">
    The Edrington Group
   </company>
   , simplifying its routes to market and giving it better control over distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortune Brands, Inc. sold its golf assets in 2010 and 2011. It then spun off its home and security business and renamed itself Beam Inc in 2011. The spinoff of Home &amp; Security comprised a distribution of its stock to Fortune shareholders in fall 2011. The deal followed a sale of Fortune's golf equipment company
   <company id="104294">
    Acushnet
   </company>
   in mid 2011 to
   <company id="156440">
    Fila Korea
   </company>
   and Korean private equity Merae Asset for $1.23 billion. (Fortune had already sold its Cobra golf brand to
   <company id="91292">
    Puma
   </company>
   in 2010.)
  </p>
  <p>
   To help fund internal growth and acquisitions of premium brands, Beam is divesting certain non-strategic brands (mainly in the economy vodka and Canadian whisky categories). To that end, Beam has agreed to sell a collection of brands (including Wolfschmidt and Dark Eyes vodka, Calvert, Bellows, Canada House Canadian, and Tempo Triple Sec), and inventory to Luxco for about $65 million. Previously, Beam sold non-strategic German spirits brands and the Cockburn port brand and inventory in 2010. The deals raised more than $49 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plans to separate came shortly after activist investor William Ackman became Fortune's largest shareholder (with an 11% stake). Ackman said that the group was undervalued in its then-current structure, limiting opportunities for growth and shareholder return. Bearing heavily on the company's future, its home and security division was hit hard by the downturn in the US home products market. Fortune cut its manufacturing facilities by a third and purged jobs at all levels to weather the downturn.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beam is also entering newer niche markets with high growth profiles. In spring 2011 the company bought out low-calorie spirits brand Skinnygirl Cocktails, maker of the ready-to-drink Skinnygirl Margarita. Created by reality TV star and chef Bethenny Frankel, the line's beverages contain all natural ingredients and no preservatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2012 Beam acquired the last independent Irish whiskey producer, Cooley Distillery, for about $95 million. The purchase marked the spirits maker's entrance into the fast-growing Irish whiskey category. In May of the same year Beam purchased two brands -- Pinnacle Vodka and Calico Jack rum -- from White Rock Distilleries for $605 million in cash.
