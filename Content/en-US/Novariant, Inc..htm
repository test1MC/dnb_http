   If you're in the agricultural market, Novariant's products won't steer you wrong. The company designs equipment control systems using global positioning system (GPS) and other location technologies, which support its trademarked 7D RTK GPS positioning receivers. Its devices and software provide machine guidance, steering, and control for industrial equipment used in agriculture and mining, as well as the construction, transportation, and aerospace industries. Novariant's self-steering agricultural products are produced under its flagship AutoFarm brand.

   The company's precision farming system ParaDyme offers GPS hands-free steering, planter control, and data logging and mapping for its entire product suite. Novariant also offers the OnTrac2 GPS Assisted Steering System for tractors, sprayers and combines. The device, which latches onto the steering wheel, yields greater precision and lower fuel costs. The company also makes available retrofit kits to upgrade its Raven Viper Pro equipment with GPS automatic steering.

   Novariant grows its business by launching additional products to attract new and repeat customers.

GeoSteer is compatible with field applications such as tillage, planting, crop spraying, and harvesting.

   Capitalizing on the current popular trend of portable devices, Novariant in 2013 launched SimpleSteer, a tablet-based auto-steering display product. SimpleSteer converts a commercial tablet to a command and monitoring post for any auto-steering operation.
