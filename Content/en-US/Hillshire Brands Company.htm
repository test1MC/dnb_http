   Got meat? Hillshire Brands Company (formerly
   <company id="11323">
    Sara Lee Corp.
   </company>
   ) certainly does. Hillshire Brands is the home of the Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Jimmy Dean, and State Fair brands of deli meats and other packaged-meat products, including hot dogs and sausages, as well as artisanal brands Aidells and Gallo. For dessert, the company serves up Sara Lee's line of frozen goodies, including cheesecake. Taking its name from its predecessor's most-recognized meat brand, Hillshire Brands formed in 2012 when Sara Lee split into two publicly traded companies, the other being its European coffee-and-tea business,
   <company id="174965">
    D.E. Master Blenders 1753
   </company>
   . It became a unit of
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   in 2014.

  <p>
   In mid-2014 the company was acquired by
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   and became a wholly owned subsidiary.

  <p>
   Post-acquisition, the company became part of Prepared Foods segment of Tyson Foods; Prepared Foods contributed 19% to the parent company's revenues in 2015.

  <p>
   Chicago-based Hillshire Brands conducts business primarily in the US, where the company operates 10 meat processing plants and three bakeries.

  <p>
   In 2015 Prepared Foods' revenues increased due to incremental volumes from the acquisition of Hillshire Brands and increase in average sales price positively impacted by that acquisition.

   In April 2014 the company announced it will close its meat plant in northwest Alabama at the cost of about 1,100 jobs. In May it agreed to buy
   <company id="162901">
    Pinnacle Foods
   </company>
   (Duncan Hines cake mix and Log Cabin syrup) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $4.3 billion. Months later poultry giant Tyson agreed to buy Hillshire in a $7.75 billion deal. The offer required Hillshire to drop its bid for Pinnacle, which it eventually did.

  <p>
   The separation of the meat and coffee businesses created a pure play in packaged meats and allows Hillshire Brands Co. to focus on reviving the meat brands, which were spoiling under the old Sara Lee. Hillshire Brands has pledged to roll out new products (13% to 15% of sales by 2015) and marketing campaigns for the meat brands and to boost revenues by 4% to 5% by the end of 2015. About 85% of the company's sales now come from its meat and meat-centric products, with the rest coming from frozen desserts.

  <p>
   Shedding non-meat assets, Hillshire in 2013 sold its Australian bakery business, Kitchens of Sara Lee Pty. Ltd., to
   <company id="42939">
    McCain Foods
   </company>
   for about $85 million in cash. In the months before Sara Lee split to form Hillshire, it sold its North American Foodservice coffee and tea business to
   <company id="10811">
    The J.M. Smucker Company
   </company>
   for $400 million.

   In 2014 Hillshire acquired Van's Natural Foods from private equity owner Catterton Partners for $165 million. Van's, which rings up about $60 million in annual sales, makes gluten-free and allergy-friendly, frozen breakfast and snack foods.

   In 2013 the company acquired jerky maker California-based Golden Island, marking Hillshire's entry into the dried meat snacks market.
