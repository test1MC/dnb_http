   Autocam has seen demand for environmentally sustainable products surge over the years, which makes it well-positioned in the automotive market. Its annual revenue is roughly $250 million. About 60% of its sales represent GDI-related parts, and Autocam expects 75% of its sales to be generated from fuel saving products by 2015.

   Over the years the company has ramped up production on two new product lines: precision parts for gasoline direct injection pumps (found on
   <company id="10597">

   's Eco-Boost and Chevrolet's ECOTEC engines); and housings for oxygen sensors that read gasoline engine exhaust gases to determine if the engine is running optimally.

  <p>
   Autocam was launched in 1982 as a subsidiary of Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Autodie Corp. ("Autocam" comes from the multispindle cam automatic turning machines that produce its products.) The next year Autodie appointed John Kennedy as its CFO. Kennedy, who was responsible for Autocam's day-to-day management, bought the company from Autodie in a 1988 LBO for $6.5 million. As president and CEO, he made the money loser profitable. Autocam went public in 1991.

  <p>
   Keen on reducing its dependence on
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   and the auto parts business, Autocam targeted the medical and electronics markets with its purchase of California's Rehrig Manufacturing in 1992. Nevertheless, the next year the company signed a major deal with GM to supply 35% of the auto giant's fuel system components. Autocam also began an apprentice program in 1995 to in order to ensure a continuous flow of skilled labor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autocam's $18 million acquisition of the Hamilton Group in 1997 gave it a larger presence in the braking systems market. In 1998 it bought affiliated Brazilian precision-metal manufacturer Qualipart Industria E Comercio Ltda. The company also expanded its transportation-related products that year when it paid $73 million for Frank &amp; Pignard (power steering, diesel fuel injector, and braking system components; France). That year Autocam lost a major customer for its computer hard-drive components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Autocam agreed to be bought by Titan Holdings and its
   <company id="100148">
    Aurora Capital Group
   </company>
   unit. The deal was completed the next year. Early in 2001 Autocam acquired French automotive supplier Bouverat Industries, a maker of electric motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company purchased the precision metals division of Canada-based ATS Automation Tooling Systems in 2006. The acquisition gives the company a stronger foothold in the Canada market. That same year Autocam shuttered the ATS auto parts plant in Kitchener, Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company recapitalized in 2007 and got rid of more than $200 million in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even after recovery was well underway, the devastation of the 2009 economic downturn was still a topic in the manufacturing world. Autocam, with its vested interest in the automotive sector, was not exempt from the low-demand backlash. The company was forced to restructure and make deep cuts in its workforce, the first time in its almost 25-year history. The initiative completed in 2009 slashed Autocam's debt and reshaped its financial foundation, as well as shifted the company from public to private, again. Revitalized, the business group is pursuing growing demand in automotive fuel-efficient, green technologies, and in the medical device sector, an array of cutting-edge orthopedic, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular surgical applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autocam gained momentum in spring 2010 by scoring a preferred supplier award with its largest customer, Bosch. The award gives Autocam an advantage over competitors bidding on new Bosch products. Autocam's core product line is direct fuel injector components, which are vital to achieving an engine's fuel efficiency; moreover, its fuel injectors offer a higher profit margin and are anticipated to lead the company's growth. Autocam partnered with the Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA) and to develop a line of environmentally friendly gasoline and diesel direct-injection components and fuel pumps. The company will invest more than $32 million in the project; in return, it received a six-year tax abatement from MEGA.
