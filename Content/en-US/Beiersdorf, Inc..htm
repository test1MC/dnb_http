    Beiersdorf AG
   </company>
   's Americas business, the US subsidiary makes and markets skin care brands NIVEA, Aquaphor, and Eucerin. While Beiersdorf, Inc. was founded in 1960, its flagship product NIVEA was developed back in 1911. Named from the Latin word "nivius" meaning "snow white," NIVEA provides the foundation for Beiersdorf's products portfolio. The company also discovered Eucerin, the industry's first water-in-oil emulsifier, at the turn of the century. Beyond body care, the NIVEA lineup extends to lip balms, facial creams, and men's grooming products, sold through grocery stores and mass merchant retailers, such as

  <p>
   While parent Beiersdorf AG does not break out separate financials for Beiersdorf's business in the US, it has reported that sales in the Americas region rose by 12% in 2012 as compared to 2011. In North America, specifically, Beiersdorf logged 3% gains vs. 2011, thanks to performance successes with its NIVEA Men and NIVEA Face lines. Eucerin continued its positive sales while NIVEA Shower slipped slightly. (Also part of the Americas region, Latin America made up for modest increases in North America by posting nearly 18% growth, mostly from Brazil.)

  <p>
   Beiersdorf's business in North America is focused on developing its three key brands -- NIVEA, Eucerin, and Aquaphor -- for growth throughout the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Americas segment has managed to retain and build market share through product innovation coupled with shedding underperforming brands. To this end, the parent has established a laboratory to focus on the needs of Latin and South American consumers, a rapidly growing region for skin care products. Among its introductions, the Eucerin brand added its first series for protecting men's skin after shaving.
