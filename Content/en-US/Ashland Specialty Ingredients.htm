  <p>
   In 2013 Ashland Specialty Ingredients' revenues decreased by 9% primarily due to lower pricing (and to a lesser extent a decline in volumes), and changes in product mix. The decline in pricing was primarily in the energy market as a result of much weaker demand in for certain guar products for use in fracking activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company contributed 33% of its parent's total revenues in 2013.
