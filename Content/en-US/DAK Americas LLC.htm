   DAK Americas manufactures products that are high in fiber but are not in breakfast cereal. The company built its business on producing polyester staple fibers (PSF), used in textiles and home furnishings. DAK Americas is one of the largest producers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resins, used in carbonated soft drink and water bottles. It also makes terephthalic acid (TPA) monomers, used in PSF and PET products, and specialty polymers, sold in markets such as film and packaging and nonwovens. DAK Americas maintains manufacturing facilities in the Carolinas and Mississippi in the US as well as in Mexico. Alpek, a subsidiary of Mexican industrial giant
   <company id="95024">
    Alfa, S.A. de C.V.
   </company>
   , owns DAK Americas.

        <p>
   The company acquired the PET business of
   <company id="16569">
    Eastman Chemical
   </company>
   in 2011 for some $600 million. The deal included three production facilities in Columbia, South Carolina, including two PET resin units and one purified TPA unit. Eastman's polyethylene terephthalate business was one of the top PET manufacturing operations in the US. In addition to the plants, the company gained access to a production technology that may reduce production costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year DAK Americas also acquired the PET resins business of
   <company id="11618">
    Wellman
   </company>
   , including production facilities in Mississippi that are being integrated into the DAK Americas Resins Business Unit. The acquisition boosts DAK Americas' total PET resin production capacity to more than 3.4 billion pounds annually and elevates it to one of the key players in the global marketplace. Because of industry consolidation, about 90% of PET capacity in North America comes from only three suppliers (including DAK Americas).
