MSCI has more than 38 offices in 22 countries worldwide, including headquarters in New York and offices in San Francisco, Chicago, and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

  <p>
   The company's indices act as benchmarks that measure the performance of global funds. Institutional investors use the indices as research tools and as the basis for their various investment vehicles. MSCI's Performance and Risk segment is by far its largest, accounting for 87% of the company's revenue in 2012, while the company's Governance segment brought in the remaining 13%. MSCI makes the majority of its revenues (more than 75%) from annual recurring subscriptions to its products.

  <p>
   The company has consistently achieved revenue growth and positive earnings by continually expanding its relationships with investment institutions and regularly developing and enhancing its products. It has also made key acquisitions in order to complement or expand its client base and offerings.
