   Pharmaceutical company VIVUS has several therapeutic products in development to treat a variety of conditions, including metabolic and sexual health ailments. Its two commercial-stage products, obesity drug Qsymia and erectile dysfunction (ED) drug Stendra, are
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved; Stendra is also approved by the European Commission under the brand name Spedra. VIVUS commercialization strategies include selling its products through direct sales methods or through distribution partnership agreements in the US and abroad. Drug candidates in the company's pipeline include potential treatments for sleep apnea and diabetes.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sales of obesity drug Qsymia bring in some 60% of VIVUS' revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products in the US, Canada, and Europe. The US accounts for three-fourths of its total sales.

  <p>
   Vivus markets its products through partnerships with other companies. For example, it has a commercial agreement with Menarini Group to commercialize Stendra in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and another agreement with Sanofi to commercialize the product in the Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's customers include Menarini (which represents of 25% of total revenue),
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (21% of revenue), and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses and sales promotion costs, which went toward the marketing of Qsymia, totaled $12.6 million in 2015 -- up from $10.1 million in 2014 but down from $26.1 million in 2013.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Vivus, which began generating product revenues in 2012, has had fluctuating earnings since then. In 2015 revenue fell 16% to $95 million despite higher product sales; this was primarily due to a drop in license and milestone revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has incurred losses every year since its inception due to R&amp;D and commercialization expenses; it expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. Net loss increased 15% to $93 million in 2015 as selling, general, and administrative expenses declined. As of the end of 2015, its accumulated deficit totaled $836.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, operating cash outflow decreased 22% to $46 million.

  <p>
   Like all drug development companies, VIVUS' success depends on its ability to move its product candidates successfully through clinical trial and commercialization launch stages. It utilizes marketing partners to help it commercialize any approved drugs and is on the lookout for clinical stage candidates it can license or acquire.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also seeking approval for additional considerations for Qysimia in the area of obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes. It has partnered with the
   <company id="40302">
    Mayo Clinic
   </company>
   to launch the Smart Changes Program, which provides online support for patients as they pursue sustained weight loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company reduced its workforce by 13% and cut its Qsymia sales territories in efforts to achieve neutral or positive operating cash flows.

   Virgil Place came up with the idea for MUSE (Medicated Urethral System for Erection) while doing research at ALZA, which nixed its development. He formed VIVUS in 1991 to pursue the concept, joining his patent with a similar one by Swedish doctor Nils Kock. VIVUS in 1995 got FDA approval to treat impotence transurethrally with alprostadil. (VIVUS' competitors sell injectable versions of the already-approved drug.) MUSE's launch was successful, creating product shortages and difficulties scaling up production.
  </p>
  <p>
   VIVUS' 1997 ad campaign about impotence featuring actor Gavin MacLeod was a hit, but things soured in 1998 when NBC refused to air a commercial during the Super Bowl, and an FDA complaint forced VIVUS to pull its TV ads. The company reinforced its consumer marketing by tripling its sales force targeting doctors.
  </p>
  <p>
   MUSE was OK'd in several non-US markets and VIVUS signed distribution pacts with such firms as
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson's
   </company>
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceutica
   </company>
   . Then the blue pill hit the fan: VIVUS watched its market presence decline steadily after rival
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer's
   </company>
   successful launch of Viagra in 1998. Another key distribution pact effectively ended due to the merger that formed
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After a major reorganization, in 2000 VIVUS signed a distribution pact with
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for MUSE in several major markets. VIVUS ended the Abbott agreement in 2002 and found a new partner in Swedish drugmaker Meda.
