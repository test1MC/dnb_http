   Sunovion is determined to help people breathe easy and sleep properly, among other things. The pharmaceutical company focuses its drug development efforts in two main therapeutic categories: respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Among its marketed products are asthma drug Xopenex, insomnia therapy Lunesta, schizophrenia treatment Latuda, and Brovana, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment. Sunovion markets its products to primary care physicians and some specialists in the US. Sunovion is a subsidiary of Japanese firm

   .

  <p>
   The company's portfolio of brands includes Aptiom, Amnaris, Latuda, Lunesta, Xopenex, Brovana, Zetonna, and Alvesco. It also has drugs in testing phase for such ailments as binge eating disorder.

   To ensure its long-term success, Sunovion develops new drugs (and improves on already-marketed ones) in its focus areas of respiratory disease and CNS disorders. Drug candidates in the works include possible treatments for depression and anxiety. The FDA in 2015 approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Aptiom as a monotherapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. In 2014 Sunovion partnered with Afraxis to leverage the enhanced spin platform the company developed as a way to speed Sunovion's preclinical CNS drug discovery process.

   Also that year, the firm sold certain rights to its Xopenex Inhalation Solution for $45 million; it retained rights to sell Xopenex HFA Inhalation Aerosol, a different formulation of the product.

   In October 2016 Sunovian acquired Toronto-based Cynapsus Therapeutics for $624 million. The addition of Cynapsus, which is developing a treatment for complications from Parkinson's disease, expanded Sunovion's neurology portfolio.

  <p>
   While Sunovion traces its roots back to 1984, the company reached profitability as recently as 2005, the year it introduced Lunesta. Each year Lunesta became more important to the company's sales, and by 2009 accounted for about half of its revenue. Looking to expand Lunesta outside of North America and into Asia, Sunovion agreed to be purchased by DSP in 2009. (The company had already been pursuing regulatory approval for Lunesta in international markets through partnerships with other drugmakers.)

   Timothy Barberich founded the company as Sepracor in 1983 to separate chemical components and purify chemicals for other drugmakers. He soon realized the same technology could separate unwanted isomers from FDA-approved drugs at a fraction of the cost of developing new ones. By the mid-1990s, six drugs were undergoing human trials and Sepracor held 10 patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   To fund its activities, Sepracor in 1994 spun off some of its research operations, including part of BioSepra (drug and chemical purification) and
   <company id="17721">
    HemaSure
   </company>
   (blood purification). In 1995 it established
   <company id="100477">
    Versicor
   </company>
   (anti-infective drugs, now Vicuron Pharmaceuticals); in 1996 subsidiary SepraChem (chemical intermediates) joined with UK chemical maker Sterling Organics to form ChiRex.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Sepracor patented a component of Claritin, the world's top antihistamine, and had positive results with an improved version of asthma drug Albuterol. In 1998 Sepracor partnered with
   <company id="42133">
    Tripos
   </company>
   to improve HIV drugs; it also licensed to
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   a new version of that firm's heartburn medication Propulsid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sepracor's improved asthma drug, Xopenex, received FDA approval in 1999, but was the subject of two FDA reprimands regarding marketing claims. The next year its Claritin ICE won approval in the European Union; in 2001
   <company id="11326">
    Schering-Plough
   </company>
   won FDA approval for it (as Clarinex) in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 it inked a deal with
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   to develop Lunesta for the Japanese market. That same year, the company also in-licensed an investigational compound (Stedesa) for the treatment of epilepsy from Portuguese drug company Bial. It also agreed to let UK drug giant
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   market the drug (branded as Lunivia) in Europe and certain other international markets; however that agreement was terminated in early 2009 after European regulatory authorities denied Lunivia's approval as a new active substance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sepracor added a couple of drugs to its product lineup early in 2008, when it licensed US marketing rights to two Nycomed drugs: Omnaris nasal spray (for allergies) and Alvesco HFA (an asthma inhaler). In 2008 Sepracor acquired Oryx Pharmaceuticals (now named Sepracor Pharmaceuticals Inc., or SPI), a specialty pharma company that sells in-licensed branded drugs to Canadian hospitals and specialist physicians. The acquisition gave Sepracor a commercial base of operations in Canada from which it can launch Lunesta and Brovana upon approval by regulatory authorities there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sepracor was acquired by
   <company id="56876">
    Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma
   </company>
   (SDP) in 2009; SDP merged its other US operations into Sepracor in 2010. Later that year the parent changed the company's from Sepracor to Sunovion.
