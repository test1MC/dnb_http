   A low-cost manufacturer of copper electrical building wire and cable, Encore Wire produces NM-B cable, a sheathed cable used to wire homes, apartments, and pre-fabricated housing, and UF-B cable, an underground feeder cable for outside lighting and remote residential building connections. Its inventory of stock-keeping units include THWN-2 cable, an insulated feeder, circuit, and branch wiring for commercial and industrial buildings, and other wires like armored cable. The company sells to wholesale electrical distributors and select retail home-improvement centers. It is the only public copper building wire company in the US.

  <p>
   Encore primarily maintains its product inventory at its plant in McKinney, Texas. Additional product inventories are maintained at the warehouses of independent manufacturers' representatives located in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Norcross, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; Canton, Michigan; Edison, New Jersey; Louisville, Kentucky; Greensboro, North Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Santa Fe Springs, California; Hayward, California; and Lakeland, Florida.

  <p>
   Encore mainly provides interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing. It sells its products primarily through nearly 30 independent manufacturers' representatives located throughout US and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct in-house marketing efforts.

  <p>
   Encore's revenues fell 13% from $1.17 billion in 2014 to $1.02 in 2015. This was due to a decrease in copper wire and aluminum wire sales. Sales dollars were also driven lower primarily by decreases in average selling prices of copper and aluminum wire and by a decrease in copper wire pounds and aluminum wire pounds shipped.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, however, jumped 13% from $37 million in 2014 to $48 million in 2015 mainly due to decreased cost of goods sold and decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses. The company's operating cash flow has also steadily risen the last few years, climbing by 12% from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   A number of strengths have enabled Encore build its market share over some two decades. Among them, the company's manufacturing operations are highly automated, and production lines tightly integrated. Its low-cost, efficient production processes allow for competitive product pricing as well as prompt order fulfillment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Encore has continued to upgrade its expansive mix of products. Product offerings include color-coded commercial and residential wire and cable, and an armored cable line. These goods feature easier installation, increased accuracy, and safety, resulting in reduced operating costs for customers. Encore also takes advantage of cross-selling opportunities by buying small quantities of complementary wire products to resell along with its own lineup.

  <p>
   Industry veterans Vincent Rego and Donald Spurgin founded Encore Wire in 1989 to make wire for residential use after their previous company, Capital Wire, was bought out by Penn Central in 1988. Encore rolled through the home-building recession of the early 1990s, gathering market share along the way. The company went public in 1992.
