   Here comes the sun, little darling. The British penchant for conservatories (or sunrooms) has made Ultraframe one of the largest makers of conservatory roof systems in Europe. The company offers custom-designed conservatories for homes and businesses. It constructs them using either glass, metal, or wood in a range of styles, including Victorian, Georgian, Lantern, Orangery, and Mediterranean. Options include glass or polycarbonate roof panels, ceiling fans, decorative cresting and finials, and other features. While the company boasts its primary presence in the UK, it also operates in North America under the brand Four Seasons Sunrooms. Ultraframe was founded in 1983 and is owned by Latium Holdings.

   Since its founding, Ultraframe has installed more than 1.5 million conservatory roofs across the UK. Its products are backed by a 25-year British Board of Agr√©ment (BBA) life expectancy certificate -- Ultraframe was the first company in the industry to be granted this accreditation. The company tests its products in its own lab and test facilities and enlists the help of independent third parties, such as Wintech and the BBA, to back its data.

   In 1983 John Lancaster began making plastic windows in a barn. Before long he realized that there was a market for well-made conservatory roofing systems because existing products were apt to leak and could be difficult to incorporate with the rest of the structure. So Lancaster began making roofs. It soon became clear that keeping one (a roof) over his head wasn't going to be a problem: His company went on to record 15 straight years of growth. Not even the recession of the early 1990s could put a lid on Ultraframe's roofs. Lancaster sold a 10% stake in the company to venture capital firm

   in 1995 to raise money for additional factory space and new product development. Ultraframe went public in 1997.

   The roofer's growth continued in 1998 as the company unveiled 80 new products and formed an international division to increase overseas sales. In 1999 Ultraframe signed a deal with

    Royal Group Technologies
   </company>
   to jointly make and sell its sunroom systems in Canada, Mexico, and the US. Ultraframe acquired Royal Group's 50% stake in the joint venture in 2001 and renamed the business, Ultraframe (North America) Limited. It also bought US-based sunroom company Four Seasons Group in a deal worth about $125 million. The company sold its Ultraspan Limited subsidiary (large-span glazed structures, UK) to the unit's management team in 2002.
