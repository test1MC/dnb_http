  <p>
   The company's strategy is to grow by adding facilities through start-ups, organic growth, and acquisitions in the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 its Plastics Color unit increased its production capacity by adding a two new twin-screw extruders at its plant in Asheboro, North Carolina. The new 40-millimeter lines give the plant more flexibility, faster changeover times, tighter tolerances and reduced lead times, allowing it to produce lots ranging from 50 pounds to 2,000 pounds.
