   Rockwell Medical (formerly Rockwell Medical Technologies) specializes in hemodialysis products. The company makes hemodialysis concentrates (in liquid and dry powder form), dialysis kits, and other related products for treatment of end-stage renal disease (chronic kidney failure). Its lead Triferic drug is the only
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved iron product for dialysate delivery for the treatment of anemia in the hemodialysis patient population. The company markets and distributes its products directly to hemodialysis providers across the US, as well as through independent distributors abroad. To expand its product range Rockwell Medical is also developing new renal drug therapies.

  <p>
   Triferic (formerly known as Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate or SFP) was granted FDA approval in early 2015. In a clinical study, it was demonstrated that Triferic could significantly reduce the need for erythropoieses stimulating agents (ESAs), the most expensive drugs used in dialysis. The company is developing new brand extensions based on Triferic to treat other iron-deficiency indications, including Triferic IV, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and an oral prescription. Its generic drug Calcitrol, a vitamin D supplement, used to manage hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, was approved in 2014. The company has completed its phase III clinical trial program for SFP-3 and SFP-4.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Rockwell Medical is working on new drugs for therapies outside of the renal sector.

   The company markets its products through trade publications and journals, product literature, online, and at industry trade conferences. It targets its advertising efforts to upper management of dialysis companies and service providers, nephrologists, clinic administrators, nurses, medical directors, and purchasing personnel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rockwell Medical's dialysis concentrated products are sold to customers in the US through a distribution agreement with
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   and to international customers directly and through independent sales agents and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014,
   <company id="47015">

   accounted for 49% of total sales.

  <p>
   Revenue growth has been slow over the past four year. In 2014 revenue rose 3% to $54.2 million on higher domestic and international sales. The conversion to its higher margin CitraPure dry acid concentrate product line helped improve profit margins; CitraPure products represented 64% of gallons sold in 2014, versus 33% in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company hasn't netted a profit since 2010. In 2014 net loss decreased 56% to $21 million as research and development costs went down and interest and investment income went up. Cash flow from operations totaled $4.2 million that year, primarily due to a distribution agreement payment from Baxter and decreases in accounts payable.

   Rockwell Medical is working to grow its dialysis products business and develop high-potential drugs. Its lead branded drug Triferic was granted FDA approval in early 2015, as was its generic vitamin D analogue Calcitriol.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company seeks collaborations to license and develop its products on a global scale. It is seeking partners for the marketing of Triferic around the world and it has begun researching alternative delivery methods for the drug. In late 2014 it entered a distribution agreement with Baxter through which Baxter became the exclusive agent for sales, marketing, and distribution of Rockwell's hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products for an initial term of 10 years.
