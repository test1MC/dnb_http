  <p>
   Indoff relies on hundreds of sales partners located in the US and Mexico to peddle its products. The company's partners are given the elbow room to make local decisions regarding pricing, service levels, and product selection, as well as manage their own business and customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indoff's customers span several industries, such as distribution, healthcare, legal, education, engineering, and manufacturing, among others.
