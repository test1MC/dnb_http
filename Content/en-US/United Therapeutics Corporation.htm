   United Therapeutics hopes its products will be in vein. Its injectable drug Remodulin treats pulmonary hypertension, which affects the blood vessels between the heart and lungs; it also treats cancer and viral illnesses. The product is marketed directly and through distributors in North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region. Other hypertension treatments include Adcirca, Tyvaso, and Orenitram. The company's development pipeline includes additional treatments for cardiovascular disease, as well as various cancers, respiratory conditions, and infectious diseases. United Therapeutics has divested its cardiac monitoring division.

  <p>
   Remodulin accounted for 43% of United Therapeutics' 2014 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also developing the antibody Unituxin (formerly Ch14.18) for the treatment of neuroblastoma under an agreement with the
   <company id="110148">
    National Cancer Institute
   </company>
   . It has been accepted for review in the US and Europe. United Therapeutics has additional early stage research programs, and it regularly evaluates opportunities to license additional compounds for development.
  </p>
  <p>
   United Therapeutics holds a license agreement with Ascendis Pharma to develop a self-injectable therapeutic alternative for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients by applying Ascendis Pharma's TransCon technology platform to its treprostinil molecule. The agreement also gives United Therapeutics exclusive rights to develop prostacyclin, prostacyclin analog, and prostacyclin-related products for treating PAH using the TransCon technology, as well as rights to commercialize any products developed from the collaboration on a global basis.

  <p>
   Remodulin is approved for sale throughout North America and Europe as well as in the Asia/Pacific region. Tyvaso, Adcirca, and Orenitram are only approved in the US. The company's home country accounts for 90% of revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   United Therapeutics owns an office building near London; it serves as its European headquarters. It also owns a warehouse in Germany.

  <p>
   The company distributes Remodulin, Tyvaso, and Orenitram throughout the US and Puerto Rico through two contracted specialty distributors --

    CVS Caremark
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58258">
    Accredo Health
   </company>
   . It also distributes Remodulin in Canada through a specialty pharma wholesaler. It sells Adcirca to pharmaceutical wholesalers at a discount.

  <p>
   United Therapeutics' revenues have seen strong growth over the past five years. In 2014 revenue increased 14% to $1.3 billion as sales of Remodulin and Adcirca grew, and sales of Orenitram commenced. In general, net income has also risen (with the exception of 2013, when expenses rose). In 2014, net income nearly doubled, rising 95% to $340.1 million because of the higher revenue and lower operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell 16% to $355 million that year as more cash was used in inventories and accounts receivable.

  <p>
   The company pursues growth by developing new drugs, either through R&amp;D or in partnership with other firms. In 2015, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approved Unituxin in combination with GM-CSF, interleukin-2, and 13-cis-retinoic acid for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. In 2014, United Therapeutics formed an alliance with
   <company id="119053">
    DEKA Research &amp; Development
   </company>
   to develop a potential technology breakthrough in the subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin Injection to PAH patients.
