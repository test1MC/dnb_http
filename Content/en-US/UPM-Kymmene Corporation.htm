   UPM-Kymmene might be sawing logs, but don't accuse it of sleeping on the job. The company owns millions of acres of forest in Finland and produces publication papers, primarily magazine paper and newsprint, as well as fine paper. Other paper products include paper for sales catalogs, direct mailings, and computer printouts. UPM-Kymmene also converts paper and plastic into self-adhesive labels, barrier packs, and envelopes; creates sawn timber and plywood; and generates its own chemical pulp and electricity. The company targets its business toward printing houses, paper merchant distributors, and paper converters; it owns and operates manufacturing plants throughout the world.

  <p>
   UPM-Kymmene operates production facilities in 13 countries, but its primary market is Europe, which accounts for roughly 70% of sales. Germany, the UK, Finland, and France are its largest markets, collectively accounting for 40% of its total sales in 2014.

   UPM-Kymmene operates through several main segments. Paper, its largest and by far most lucrative segment, is comprised of its paper mills and operations that produce magazine papers, newsprint, fine papers, and specialty papers. Other business areas include: UPM Biorefining, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Paper Asia, UPM Paper ENA (Europe &amp; North America), and UPM Plywood.

  <p>
   UPM-Kymmene's net sales have seen a downward trend since 2013. It decreased by â‚¬186 million compared to 2013 primarily due to lower deliveries from its UPM Paper ENA segment and UPM Biorefining segment. Its profits increased 53% in 2014 compared to 2013 due to reduced costs and expenses and increased gains from sale investments. The company's operating cash cash flow increased by 68% compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in working capital.

   UPM-Kymmene is (literally) fueling its recovery. The company has long generated electrical power for its production facilities; it is expanding its business in merchant power generation, using hydroelectric power, nuclear energy, and renewable energy sources. The company holds equity stakes in Pohjolan Voima Oy (PVO), Finland's second largest power generator, Kemijoki Oy, a hydropower provider, and other energy generators. Moreover, the company looks to increase its own production of biofuels using the raw materials left over from its paper manufacturing.

  <p>
   Paper company Kymmene Aktiebolag was founded along Finland's River Kymi in 1873. The only problem was that two other paper companies started in the same area around the same time. Demand for raw material drove up timber prices, although competition brought paper prices down. Realizing the folly of their ways, the three companies decided to band together; Kymmene bought its two rivals in exchange for shares in the larger enterprise. Thus began the acquisitions that would grow to mark Finland's forestry industry and result in UPM-Kymmene.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company increased its forest holdings in the 1930s, but it also diversified, buying one of Finland's largest ironworks in 1933. The future Kymmene's assets were largely redirected during WWII. After the war, government price controls reduced profits, and the company stagnated until the 1960s when it began growing internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Finnish forestry industry began consolidating in earnest in the early 1980s, when there were about 20 domestic producers (by 1998 there were three). In 1982 the company bought a majority stake in electrical equipment company Stromberg to reduce the severity of industry cycles. After a series of forestry mergers, however, and the sale of Stromberg's operations, the company was renamed Kymmene Corporation in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kymmene was dethroned as Finland's largest forestry company in 1991 when Repola was formed by the merger of Rauma-Repola and United Paper Mills. However, Kymmene and Repola merged in 1996 to form Finland's largest -- and Europe's third largest -- forest company with sales of about $12.5 billion. The new company, which included a 73% stake in United Paper Mills, was named UPM-Kymmene.
