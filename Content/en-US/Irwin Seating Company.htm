   Irwin Seating has become an expert in developing seating solutions for some of the largest and most prestigious stadiums worldwide. In 2012 the company partnered with London's Blue Cube (GB) Ltd. to launch Solara and Integra beam-mount chairs. The agreement extends the use of the Integra chair, which has been in use across Europe since 2011. The products are installed in Soccercity Football Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa, and in Wembley Stadium in London. The alliance with Blue Cube allows Irwin Seating to make the chairs using its own supply chain.
