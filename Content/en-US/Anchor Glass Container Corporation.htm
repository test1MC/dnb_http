   Anchor Glass' performance is impacted by both the encroachment of competitors on its highly prized contracts with Anheuser-Busch and other beverage titans, as well as the pressure to reduce its container prices. The company locates its plants within 150 miles of its core customers in an effort to minimize transportation costs and delivery times, as well as secure long-term manufacturing contracts. Revenues also depend upon the strength of its distributors,
