  <p>
   Carl Diedrich's mother inherited a Costa Rican coffee plantation in 1916, so he literally grew up in the coffee industry. He traveled extensively from the 1940s to the 1960s, learning the art of coffee bean roasting in Italy, Yemen, and Germany. In 1966 he and his wife bought a Guatemalan coffee plantation, and in 1983 Martin Diedrich (Carl's son) opened the company's first coffee shop in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diedrich had only three locations until 1992, but it grew rapidly from that point on. The company built new California coffee shops; acquired coffee shops in Denver, Houston, and San Diego; and issued an IPO in September 1996. In 1997 the company acquired Coffee People, which included the Gloria Jean's and Coffee Plantation coffee shop brands (the Coffee Plantation shops have since closed).

   CEO Philip Hirsch resigned in 2003, and Diedrich Coffee brought in Roger Laverty, formerly of wholesale grocery chain

   </company>
   , to lead the company. In October of the following year, founder and vice chairman Martin Diedrich left the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company agreed to sell its Gloria Jean's international franchise operations for $16 million to Jireh International, the Australian master franchisee of Gloria Jean's. Diedrich finalized the sale in 2005.
