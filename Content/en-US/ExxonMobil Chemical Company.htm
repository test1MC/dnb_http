   No surprise that a subsidiary of the world's #1 oil company,
   <company id="10537">
    Exxon Mobil
   </company>
   , is among the world's top chemical companies. ExxonMobil Chemical ranks #1 or #2 in making many petrochemicals, including benzene and toluene, as well as polyolefins such as polypropylene (PP) and high-density and linear low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LLDPE, respectively). The company also is a major producer of olefins (such as ethylene and propylene, used to make polyolefins), aromatics (toluene and xylene used in paints and agrochemicals), and plastics (such as
   <company id="105559">
    thermoplastic elastomers
   </company>
   ). ExxonMobil uses its polyolefins to make films for packaging and labeling and also licenses some of its process technology. It operates globally.

  <p>
   The company has operations and customers in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. In 2012 the US accounted for 72% of the company's revenues.

   ExxonMobil Chemical ranks #1 or #2 in producing benzene, toluene, and LLDPE. Additionally it's among the top makers of HDPE (with

    CPChem
   </company>
   ), PP (behind
   <company id="104943">
    Ineos
   </company>
   ), and mixed xylenes (also behind Ineos). Overall, it is the #2 chemical company in the US and #3 worldwide (behind
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10471">
    Dow

   ). It focuses on several major industries including automotive, packaging, construction and industrial, and personal care.

   Exxon Mobil's chemical segment revenues in 2012 were $3.8 billion, 2% down on 2011. Higher margins increased revenues by $480 million, while volume and product mix effects increased revenues by $80 million. However, these gains were offset by the absence of the 2011 gain associated with the Japan restructuring, which cut revenues by $630 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemical earnings in 2012 were $1 billion, $605 million lower than in 2011.

  <p>
   ExxonMobil Chemical's strategy is to deliver operational excellence, lead its various industries in technological innovation, integrate its operations for maximum efficiency, and invest in long-terms trends that will shape industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's major production plants are integrated with its parent's refineries for cost effectiveness. Almost two-thirds of its sales come from outside the US. ExxonMobil Chemical, like much of the industry, has been expanding operations in Asia and the Middle East, where demand for petrochemicals has been growing strongly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 ExxonMobil Chemical's Singapore Chemical Plant began producing ethylene from the facility's second world-scale steam cracker. The expansion positions the Singapore petrochemical complex to serve growth markets in China, Indian and elsewhere in Asia. The new facility will nearly double global production capacity of Escorez 5000 hydrogenated tackifier (chemical compounds used in formulating adhesives to increase the stickiness of the surface of the adhesive).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company expanded its joint venture with
   <company id="53868">
    Saudi Basic Industries Corporation
   </company>
   to construct a new elastomers project at their Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company joint venture petrochemical plant. The project is expected to supply more than 400,000 metric tons of rubber, thermoplastic specialty polymers, and carbon black to serve emerging local and international markets in Asia and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also growing in the US where it can take advantage of the recent boom in the supply of natural gas liquids (a chemical building block byproduct of natural gas production). In 2013 ExxonMobil Chemical filed for permits for a multibillion-dollar expansion at its Baytown, Texas site (already the largest integrated refining-chemical producing site in the US). The project will convert ethylene from a new  steam cracker to premium polyethylene products to serve growing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 ExxonMobil Chemical invested more than $200 million to expand its Baton Rouge chemical and lubricants plants to increase capacity for synthetic lubricant base stocks manufacturing and lubricants blending, packaging, and storage.

  <p>
   In 2011 ExxonMobil Chemical opened its $90 million Shanghai Technology Center. The 100,000-square-foot facility contains advanced analytical and testing laboratory equipment and commercial-scale product processing equipment, including blown and cast film extrusion, injection molding, compounding, and packaging. The facility is ExxonMobil Chemical's third largest technology center in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   ExxonMobil Chemical signed an agreement in 2010 with Qatar Petroleum to develop a petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. It also expanded facilities in France, Japan, the Netherlands, and Singapore in 2009 and 2010.
