   Cott is sweet on its customers. The company is a leading producer of store-brand carbonated beverages. In addition to soda, Cott Corp. makes more than 200 bottled water, juices, ready-to-drink teas, and energy and sports drinks. The company produces, packages, and distributes more than 75 retailer-, licensed-, and Cott-owned brand soft drinks. It holds the #1 private-label market share in Canada, Mexico, the UK, and the US. Its customers include grocery stores, mass merchandisers, drugstores, and convenience store chains, along with beverage wholesalers. Cott operates about 60 beverage production facilities in North America and nearly 10 overseas. Its beverages are sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   The company has 62 beverage manufacturing, production, distribution, and fruit processing facilities, including 52 in North America, eight in the UK, one in Mexico, and one vertically-integrated global concentrate manufacturing facility in Columbus, Georgia. In addition, Cott has one customer service call center for its DSS business in the US.

  <p>
   The company's business operates through four reporting segments: Cott North America (45% of net sales), DSS (35%), Cott UK (18%), and All Other (2%; which includes their Mexico operating segment, Royal Crown International).

  <p>
   The company has more than 1.5 million customers (approximately 60% commercial and 40% residential).
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

   is one of its largest customers.

  <p>
   Cott posted record-setting revenues of $2.94 billion in 2015 mainly due to additional revenue from previous acquisitions. The historic growth was fueled by its DSS segment, which saw its revenues skyrocket due to a full year of revenue in 2015 compared to only two weeks of operations in 2014 included in its annual results.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company posted a net loss of $3.4 million for 2015 due to the surge in selling, general, and administrative expenses associated with its previous acquisitions.

  <p>
   Cott achieved milestone revenue totals for 2015 through the help of a flurry of acquisitions. Seeking to diversify beyond private-label soft drinks and juices and pump up its flagging sales, Cott in 2014 bought DSS Group Inc., the parent company of
   <company id="110333">
    DS Services of America
   </company>
   , a direct-to-consumer bottled water and coffee distributor, for $1.25 billion. The milestone purchase made water delivery about 25% of Cott's product offering, with soft drinks representing only about 19%, versus 30% previously.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Cott acquired Eden Springs, a home and office beverage delivery service, for €470 million. The purchase expanded Cott's water, coffee, and tea consumer delivery service capabilities and broadened its direct-to-consumer distribution network. The same year the company also picked up
   <company id="130905">
    S&amp;D Coffee
   </company>
   for $355 million, a purchase that bolstered its premium coffee and tea product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, Cott obtained Canada's largest home and office water delivery company,
   <company id="58084">
    Aquaterra
   </company>
   , for $47 million. That deal allowed Cott to become a more diversified beverage provider across multiple channels and geographies.

  <p>
   Cott was founded by Montreal clothier Harry Pencer in 1955 to import bottled and canned carbonated beverages into Québec from the US. The company then moved into bottling, capitalizing on popular new soda pop flavors such as black cherry, red raspberry, grape, and orange. From 1976 to 1991 Cott expanded into Ontario and in Canada's Atlantic provinces.
