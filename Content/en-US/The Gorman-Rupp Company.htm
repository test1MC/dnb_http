   Gorman-Rupp keeps pumping out pumps. The company, founded in 1933 by engineers J. C. Gorman and H. E. Rupp, makes a myriad of pumps and fluid controls used in construction, sewage treatment, petroleum refining, agriculture, and fire fighting, as well as for HVAC and military applications. Gorman-Rupp's pumps range in size from 1/4-inch (one gallon per minute) to 180-inch and ranging in rated capacity from less than one gallon per minute to nearly one million gallons per minute. Smaller pumps are used for dispensing soft drinks and making ice cubes, while large pumps are central to refueling aircraft and boosting low water pressure in municipal fresh-water markets.

   Gorman-Rupp owns facilities, training centers, and warehouses in Sparks, Nevada; Dallas; and Bangkok. In addition, the company leases warehouse facilities in Jebal Ali, Dubai; and Culemborg, The Netherlands. Production operations reside in US (Ohio, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Pennsylvania), Canada, Ireland, The Netherlands, and South Africa. The US accounts for nearly 70% of sales.

  <p>
   Gorman-Rupp has achieved unprecedented growth over the last few years, with revenues rising 11% from $392 million in 2013 to $435 million in 2014, a company milestone. Profits also climbed 10% from $30 million in 2013 to peak at a record-breaking $36 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was primarily due to an 13% increase in pumps and pump systems and a 1% rise in repairs of pumps and pump systems and other business. Gorman-Rupp was helped by additional sales from the municipal market driven by large volume pumps for wastewater and flood control in addition to an increase in the industrial market related to fracking. In addition, sales in the fire protection market increased $3.8 million primarily due to domestic sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash from operations decreased by $21 million to $29 million in 2014 compared to $50 million in 2013 due to recognition of deferred revenue relating to a previous project and increased accounts receivable.

   Over the last decade, Gorman-Rupp has continued to pursue new routes to market its products. The company has reached outside North America by building distributor alliances and establishing plants and warehouses in Ireland and the Netherlands to serve customers in Europe, and in Thailand to reach those in Asia.
