   The company is not only one of the world's oldest suppliers of interior leather to the automotive industry but its largest -- nearly one-third of all leather used in vehicles comes from Eagle Ottawa. Its products, such as "tipped" seat inserts, upholster a wide range of vehicle models, including luxury brands (Lexus IS-F), top-line trucks (Toyota Tundra), and mid-priced sedans (

   Accord).

   Eagle Ottawa attributes its longevity, in part, to its specialization in natural interiors coupled with fashion- and furniture-oriented materials. Moreover, its leathers can be solar treated, textured, and even embossed with a natural grain or logo, or infused with a fragrance. Services also include seat testing, sewing and perforation, and door trim wrapping and embroidery.

   Looking ahead, Eagle Ottawa is joining the wave of manufacturers going green. Its finishing processes are water-based (as opposed to solvent-based) and its leather tanning is recyclable and biodegradable (organic). The company was the first tanner to implement an on-site waste-water treatment plant.
