   Dean Foods is the nation's largest milk bottler. The company's Fresh Dairy Direct business markets fluid milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, and beverages (juices, teas, and bottled water) under more than 50 local, regional, and private-label brands, including Borden, Pet, Country Fresh, Meadow Gold, and TruMoo, a leading national flavored milk brand. Following the spinoff of most of its WhiteWave Foods business, Dean Foods still holds about 20% of WhiteWave, which makes coffee creamers (International Delight), dips, ice cream, butter, cottage cheese, and specialty dairy products. Dean Foods owns and operates a number of smaller dairy companies, including

   , and

  <p>
   Following the sale of its Morningstar Foods division and the spinoff of WhiteWave in 2013, Dean Foods was left with Fresh Dairy Direct. The company manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, including milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions, and governmental entities across the US.

  <p>
   Dean Foods rings up 99% of its sales in the US, where it operates 67 manufacturing facilities in 32 states (and distributes across all 50 states). Outside of the US, the dairy giant has operations in Europe.

   Dean Foods markets its products through advertising and other promotions, including media, coupons, trade shows, and other promotional activities. The company spent about $44.8 million on advertising in 2015, $27.5 million in 2014, and $22 million in 2013. Dean's customers include food retailers, distributors, foodservice operators, educational institutions, and governmental entities throughout the US.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

   and its subsidiaries, including Sam's Club, is Dean Foods' largest customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are sold primarily on a local or regional basis through local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by a centralized corporate sales department.

  <p>
   The company has seen a decreasing trend in net revenues over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Dean Foods' net revenues of $8.12 billion decreased by 15% compared to 2014. This decline was due to lower pricing as a result of a significant drop in dairy commodity costs, which were about 30% below prior-year levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net loss was $8.51 million, an improvement of 58% compared to 2014, due to an increase in net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $408.1 million, up 167% on 2014.

  <p>
   After diversifying into higher-margin businesses (and piling on debt in the process), Dean Foods has reversed course to get on a sounder financial footing and has become essentially a pure-play in low-margin fluid milk and traditional dairy products. Its current strategy is to build on its unique capabilities and cost reduction opportunities to create a leading positions as a low-cost fluid milk producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Dean Foods continued to focus on efforts to drive operational excellence, improve its go-to-market strategies, strengthen the company's private label business, and build and buy strong brands.

  <p>
   In 2016 the company bolstered its ice cream product line up after it acquired
   <company id="54465">
    Friendly's Ice Cream's
   </company>
   retail and manufacturing ice cream business for $155 million in cash. Prior to the acquisition, Friendly's made and distributed a variety of ice cream products; it also operates a restaurant chain in the northeastern US that was not part of the acquisition. The Friendly's brand complements Dean's line-up of ice cream brands, including Mayfield and Dean's Country Fresh.

  <p>
   Investment banker Gregg Engles formed a holding company in 1988 with other investors, including dairy industry veteran Cletes Beshears, to buy the Reddy Ice unit of Dallas-based Southland (operator of the 7-Eleven chain). The company also bought Circle K's Sparkle Ice and combined it with Reddy Ice. By 1990 it had acquired about 15 ice plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Suiza Foods when it bought Suiza Dairy in 1993 for $99 million. The Puerto Rican dairy was formed in 1942 by Hector Nevares Sr. and named for the Spanish word for "Switzerland." By 1993 it was Puerto Rico's largest dairy, controlling about 60% of the island's milk market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suiza Foods bought Florida's Velda Farms, manufacturer and distributor of milk and dairy products, in 1994. The company went public in 1996, the same year it bought Swiss Dairy (dairy products, California and Nevada) and Garrido y Compañía (coffee products, Puerto Rico).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became one of the largest players in the North American dairy industry through its acquisitions in 1997. It paid $960 million for Morningstar (Lactaid brand lactose-free milk, Second Nature brand egg substitute), which -- like Suiza Foods itself -- was a Dallas-based company formed in 1988 through a Southland divestiture. The company entered the Midwest with its $98 million purchase of Country Fresh and the Northeast with the Bernon family's Massachusetts-based group of dairy and packaging companies, including
   <company id="143506">
    Garelick Farms
   </company>
   and Franklin Plastics (packaging).
  </p>
  <p>
   Suiza Foods strengthened its presence in the southeastern US in 1998 with its $287 million acquisition of Land-O-Sun Dairies, operator of 13 fluid-dairy and ice-cream processing facilities. Also that year Suiza Foods purchased Continental Can (plastic packaging) for about $345 million and sold
   <company id="56728">
    Reddy Ice
   </company>
   to Packaged Ice for $172 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   After settling an antitrust lawsuit brought by the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   , in 1999 Suiza Foods bought dairy processors in Colorado, Ohio, and Virginia. That year Suiza Foods combined its US packaging operations with Reid Plastics to form Consolidated Containers, retaining about 40% of the new company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Suiza Foods announced it had agreed to purchase rival Dean Foods for $1.5 billion and the assumption of $1 billion worth of debt. Dean Foods had begun as Dean Evaporated Milk, founded in 1925 by Sam Dean, a Chicago evaporated-milk broker. By the mid-1930s it had moved into the fresh milk industry. The company went public in 1961 and was renamed Dean Foods in 1963.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suiza Foods completed the acquisition and took on the Dean Foods name later in 2001. The new Dean Foods bought out Dairy Farmers of  America's  interest in Suiza Dairy and merged it with the "old" Dean's fluid-dairy operations to create its internal division, Dean Dairy Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with the purchase of "old" Dean came a 36% ownership of soy milk maker
   <company id="61086">
    WhiteWave
   </company>
   , and in 2002 Dean Foods purchased the remaining 64% for approximately $189 million. By the end of the year, Dean had sold off some smaller businesses (boiled peanuts and contract hauling) and its Puerto Rico operations for $119 million in cash.
