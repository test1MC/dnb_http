   Formed in 1921 to build a better thermometer, Terumo is one of Japan's largest health care product suppliers. The firm makes and sells a wide range of general hospital products and equipment, including disposable supplies (syringes and wound dressings), blood glucose monitors, dialyzers, infusion pumps, and intravenous liquid nutrients. It also makes blood transfusion bags, as well as cardiac and vascular products such as heart-lung machines used in open heart surgery, vascular grafts, and catheters. And yes, it still makes thermometers, which are part of its consumer health care product portfolio. Terumo operates in the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It sells its products in some 160 countries.

  <p>
   Terumo operates in the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Japan accounts for the highest sales (about 40% of revenue), with the Americas following (25%). Europe comes in at around 21% of revenues while Asia and other regions make up the remainder.

  <p>
   Revenue rose 5% to ¥489.5 billion in fiscal 2015 as the group's Cardiac &amp; Vascular and Blood Management segments saw higher sales. Net income increased 13% to ¥38.5 billion due to an increase in foreign exchange gains and declines in interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell 24% to ¥73 billion as the company spent more on income taxes and for liquidation of certain businesses.

   Terumo hopes to extend its presence and introduce new products in various markets, including developed markets (Japan, North America, and Western Europe) and developing markets (Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia). In 2014 the company launched its new coronary intervention Ultimaster DES device in Europe and parts of Asia. It is also developing a new type of stent -- a drug-eluting bioresorbable scaffold -- with Arterial Remodeling Technologies in France.

   In another partnership, Terumo is working with Japan's

    Therakos
   </company>
   (for distribution in certain markets). In 2015 it extended its existing partnership with
   <company id="56016">
    Olympus Corporation
   </company>
   , which is focused on gastroenterology and urology products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is building a new research and development facility in Southern California. The facility, which will focus on coronary and peripheral interventional therapies, is expected to open in 2017.
