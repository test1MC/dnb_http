  <p>
   Monrif was founded in 1941 as Societa Anonima Prodotti Cano per l'Agricoltura. In 1966 it became Editoriale-Societa Generale Finanziaria to reflect its participation in S.A. Poligrafici Il Resto del Carlino, the company that oversaw the daily newspapers
   <i>
    La Nazione
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Il Resto del Carlino.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Based in Bologna and Florence, respectively,
   <i>
    La Nazione
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Il Resto del Carlino
   </i>
   were founded in the 1800s. (The latter title, which translates as "the change for a carlino," derives from the currency at the time. A carlino was a 10-cent coin, and a cigar cost 8 cents. When a customer bought a cigar, he was often given the newspaper as change.)
  </p>
  <p>
   From 1968 to 1976 the company was controlled by sugar firm Eridania, which was owned by the Monti Group. In 1976 Editoriale-Societa Generale Finanziaria and S.A. Poligrafici Il Resto del Carlino joined to become Poligrafici Editoriale (Editoriale). Three years later Editoriale became part of the INFI-Industriale Finanziaria group of companies; control of the company ended up with Maria Luisa Monti Riffeser.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 Editoriale bought O.T.E., publisher of Trieste's
   <i>
    Il Piccolo.
   </i>
   Two years later Editoriale took 45% of the company public in two separate offerings. Also in 1986 it bought hotel group Emiliana Grandi Alberghi (E.G.A.), and the following year it bought 50% of Societa Tipografica Tiburtina and L'Editrice Romana, publishers of Rome's
   <i>
    Il Tempo
   </i>
   daily newspaper. Cement and steel conglomerate Italmobiliare bought a 20% stake in Editoriale. In 1989 Editoriale bought a 10% stake in Axel Springer Verlag AG, which in turn bought 10% of Editoriale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Editoriale bought the 50% of Societa Tipografica Tiburtina and L'Editrice Romana it didn't already own. Soon after, O.T.E was sold to a group of financiers. In 1996 the company began publishing the daily
   <i>
    Nuovo Extra.
   </i>
   Also that year Editoriale changed its name to Monrif (a conflation of Monti Riffeser). The following year it acquired the daily
   <i>
    Il Giorno
   </i>
   when it bought Editrice Il Giorno and its publisher, Nuova Same. Monrif then agreed to sell Nuovo Same to the Seregni Group. In 1999 the company took its newspapers online with Monrif Net, and in 2000 it bought a 20% stake in Internet provider DADA. Later in 2000 Monrif's Poligrafici Editoriale subsidiary acquired French daily newspaper
   <em>
    France Soir
   </em>
   (it later sold a controlling stake).
