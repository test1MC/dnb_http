   When it comes to making pharmaceuticals for dermatological diseases, LEO Pharma gets below the surface. Founded in the early 1900s, LEO Pharma has about two dozen products on the market, many of which treat psoriasis, eczema, and skin infections. The company's other focus areas include developing and manufacturing treatments for blood clot disorders, kidney disease, and support drugs for cancer treatments. Products such as Daivobet, Innohep, and Xamiol are among its best sellers. LEO Pharma has operations in Europe, as well as in the US, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The company is wholly owned by the Leo Foundation, which is managed by members of LEO Pharma's executive team.
