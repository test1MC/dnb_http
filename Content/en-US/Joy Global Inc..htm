   subsidiary makes underground coal-mining equipment that includes armored face conveyors, roof supports, longwall shearers, and shuttle cars. Other operations make electric mining shovels, rotary blasthole drills, and other equipment used in surface open-pit mining; it also provides parts and service through its P&amp;H MinePro Services network. Joy Global in mid-2016 agreed to be acquired by

  <p>
   Joy Global in mid-2016 agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="43881">
    Komatsu America
   </company>
   for $3.7 billion. Komatsu America is a key subsidiary of Japan-based

  <p>
   Joy Global operates through two primary business segments: underground mining machinery (52% of total sales) and surface mining equipment (48%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The underground mining machinery segment has locations in Australia, China, France, South Africa, the UK, and the US; sales offices are located in India, and Poland. Surface mining equipment has locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, South Africa, and the US; sales offices are located in India, Mexico, Russia, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US represented 25% of total sales in 2016, while other countries accounted for the remainder of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's equipment is used to mine coal, copper, iron ore, oil sands, gold and other minerals. About 50% of its revenues come from thermal and metallurgical coal-mining customers. It sells its products and services directly to customers through its sales personnel and through partners such as Berkley Forge and Tool, Phillippi-Hagenbach, Bridon American Corporation, and Prodinsa Wire Rope.
  </p>

  <p>
   Joy Global's balance sheet has experienced a downward trend over the last several years. Revenues decreased 25% from $3.17 billion in 2015 to $2.37 billion in 2016. After posting a massive net loss of $1.2 billion in 2015 due to $1.3 billion in impairment charges within its in Underground segment, Joy Global recorded a smaller net loss of $58 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Underground sales fell 27% in 2016, reflecting a decrease in original equipment sales of $178 million, across all regions (led by China and Eurasia) and a decrease in service sales of $194 million primarily in Australia and China. Surface segment sales dipped by 22%, fueled by a decrease in original equipment sales of $107 million in all regions (led by Latin America) and a decrease in service sales of $161 million in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Joy Global's cash flow from operations has also decreased for three straight years, shrinking from $355 million in 2015 to $254 million in 2016. This was mostly due to expenses associated with unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>

  <p>
   Joy Global benefits from focusing on aftermarket sales and services. This capability extends the life of its installed base of (expensive) machinery through spare parts and repair services, as well as supports long-term customer relationships and a steady revenue stream. Its surface mining equipment business also offers aftermarket services for equipment made by other OEMs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To optimizing aftermarket sales and services, the company has built service centers in key mining regions -- Canada, Chile, Australia, and South Africa -- and plans to open new centers in Russia and India. The latter initiatives are anticipated to help offset some of the decline experienced in more mature domestic markets. Concurrently, it has managed to shift an increasing portion of its aftermarket revenue from one-time transactions to extended maintenance and repair contracts or machine exchange programs. The company has also introduced remote equipment monitoring systems, allowing maintenance personnel to check machines for reliability and safety, fleet status, productivity, and other performance related issues using wireless technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it is one of the largest producers of underground mining equipment, Joy Global confronts a highly cyclical marketplace driven by commodity pricing and industry consolidation. In addition, more than two-thirds of Joy Global's revenues come from coal mining customers, exposing it to public outcry over climate change and other risks.

  <p>
   Joiy Global also grows its footprint through the use of acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Montabert S.A.S. for approximately $122 million. Montabert specializes in the design, production, and distribution of hydraulic rock breakers, pneumatic equipment, drilling attachments, drifters, and related parts and tools. This acquisition expanded Joy Global's product and service capabilities for hard rock mining, tunneling, and rock excavation and further diversified its commodity and end market exposures.
