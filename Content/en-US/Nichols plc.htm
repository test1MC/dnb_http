   Nichols aims to grow organically and through acquisitions. In 2015, it purchased The Noisy Drinks Company, a maker of iced slush drinks and the UK market leader. The acquisition opens up opportunities for brand innovation, and Noisy Drinks brings with it strong supply chain capabilities. Also in 2015, Nichols acquired the Feel Good brand, a range of 100% natural still and sparkling drinks.
