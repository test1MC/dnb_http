   that faces some of the stiffest European competition. The company manufactures athletic footwear and activewear for men, women, and teens and serves as the center of European operations for its parent company.

Reebok brand veteran Paul Harrington succeeded Paul Fireman as head of the company when adidas acquired Reebok.

   Reebok has shifted its marketing strategy targets towards the fitness fanatic consumer segment - those that put fitness at the center of their lives and take part in activities such as CrossFit, with which Reebok has entered into a commercial partnership. It targets women in particular, who are engaging in weights-based fitness in increasing numbers.

   In 2015, Reebok acquired Refuel (Brand Distribution) Limited for £11 million. London-based Refuel mainly markets and distributes apparel of Mitchell &amp; Ness. In 2014, it completed the £5 million acquisition of Luta Ltd, which makes workout clothing and which aided Reebok in signing a licensing agreement with Ultimate Fighting Championship.
