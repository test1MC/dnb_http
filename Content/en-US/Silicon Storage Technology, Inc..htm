   Silicon Storage Technology (SST) is more than just flash -- it's SuperFlash. SST designs SuperFlash brand flash memory chips. Flash memory, a type of non-volatile memory that retains data even when power is lost, can be reprogrammed more quickly than other kinds of chips. SST's devices are used in PCs and computer peripherals, such as CD-ROMs; communications products, including wireless phones and modems; and consumer electronics devices, such as digital still cameras and MP3 players. The company is a subsidiary of semiconductor maker

   SST has licensed its SuperFlash technology to leading chip makers, such as

    IBM Microelectronics
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor

   To help SST grow its footprint and increase its Flash-IP product portfolio, in 2013 Microchip and SST agreed to acquire Pennsylvania-based Novocell Semiconductor, a leading supplier of non-volatile-memory intellectual property products for fabless semiconductor companies, integrated device makers, and foundries.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the deal, Novocell will become a wholly owned subsidiary of SST.

   In 2010 SST was acquired by
   <company id="16015">
    Microchip Technology
   </company>
   , a semiconductor manufacturer based in Arizona, for around $275 million in cash.

   Bing Yeh, formerly a senior R&amp;D manager at memory chip maker
   <company id="15186">
    Xicor
   </company>
   , founded Silicon Storage Technology (SST) in 1989 to develop memory devices for mobile computers. By 1992 SST was also designing flash memory chips for PC motherboards. With its manufacturing farmed out to Asian facilities owned by
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55633">
    Winbond Electronics
   </company>
   , SST became a primary supplier to manufacturers in Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   SST went public in 1995 during a semiconductor boom that strained industry production capability. The company expanded capacity the next year by outsourcing production to
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 SST created a unit to handle its growing technology licensing business. It formed a licensing agreement with
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   and began a project with SANYO, which built a wafer production line to handle increased production for SST. In 1998 SST added several firms, including IBM and
   <company id="58187">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , as licensees of its SuperFlash technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 SST formed development alliances with
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola
   </company>
   . It also acquired Linvex Technology, a privately held developer of specialty memories. In 2000
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   joined the growing list of SuperFlash licensees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 SST demonstrated its commitment to China's electronics market with an equity investment in
   <company id="132552">
    Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   and by establishing a Shanghai-based subsidiary, SST China. The same year SST added
   <company id="16681">
    ATMI
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41880">
    Oki Electric
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="132600">
    Nanya Technology
   </company>
   as SuperFlash licensees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 SST announced a major licensing agreement with NEC. With Japan moving to eliminate the use of lead by semiconductor manufacturers, the company also began offering lead-free packaging for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   It acquired about 84% of Emosyn, a maker of chips for smart cards, from Emosyn's former parent, ATMI, in 2004. That same year, SST also acquired the assets of G-Plus, a privately held designer of radio-frequency integrated circuits. ATMI sold the remaining 16% interest in Emosyn to SST in 2005. Also that year SST acquired Actrans Systems, a Taiwanese supplier of flash memory, for about $20 million in cash and stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Riley Investment Management, a hedge fund that has taken an activist investor role at several semiconductor companies, bought an equity stake of nearly 6% in SST and nominated four people to take seats on the SST board of directors.
  </p>
  <p>
   After meetings between the board and representatives of Riley Investment Management, the two sides reached a settlement agreement that saw the hedge fund withdraw its nominees and Bryant Riley was elected to the board in 2008 with management's blessing. Riley later decreased his equity stake to about 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 SST agreed to a buyout by its management and Prophet Equity. The company later took a higher offer from
   <company id="16015">
    Microchip Technology
   </company>
   , which acquired SST in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to a competing bid, Microchip Technology raised its offer for SST from $3.00 a share to $3.05 a share. The acquisition boosts Microchip's portfolio with SST's flash technology, its more than 360 patents, and its line of microcontrollers, as well as give it an entry into several new markets. Not all of SST's business units made the cut, however; Microchip sold those units that weren't up to par. SST now operates as a subsidiary of Microchip's licensing business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly before signing with Microchip Technology, SST agreed to have management and Prophet Equity, a private equity firm, acquire the company for more than $200 million and to take it private. However, after signing the agreement, SST went "shopping" for other potential buyers, entering talks with several. This came as the company responded to a dramatic slowdown in sales due to the global economic crisis. SST cut its worldwide workforce in 2008 by about 120 people, a reduction of around 17%.
