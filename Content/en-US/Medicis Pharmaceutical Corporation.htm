   ' revenues. (Medicis was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals for about $2.6 billion in 2012).

   Medicis develops products through its own R&amp;D programs and through partnerships or licensing agreements with other companies. Its wrinkle treatment Dysport was developed through a licensing agreement with
   <company id="152002">
    Ipsen
   </company>
   . Dysport was launched commercially in 2009 and today competes with
   <company id="10059">
    Allergan
   </company>
   's popular Botox therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other key partnerships include a collaboration with
   <company id="140017">
    Anacor Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to work on small molecule drugs for the treatment of acne. Medicis also has a development partnership with
   <company id="47731">
    Impax Laboratories
   </company>
   to collaborate on several dermatology products, including a next-generation version of Solodyn. Additional research partners include drugmakers Hyperion Therapeutics and Revance Therapeutics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company teamed up with
   <company id="14077">
    Mentor Worldwide LLC
   </company>
   , the US market leader in breast aesthetics, to enter certain of their non-reimbursed products into a combined physician loyalty program. The new program, called the M2VP (Medicis-Mentor Valued Partner) program, extends the offerings of Medicis' recently-launched MVP program to include the MENTOR line of breast implant products to US customers for a five-year term.

  <p>
   Jonah Shacknai, erstwhile lawyer and aide to US congressional FDA committees, founded Medicis in 1988. Later that year the company merged with Innovative Therapeutics to form Medicis Pharmaceutical.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medicis went public in 1990 and sales surged when it acquired a license to market a generic version of anti-wrinkle cream Retin-A. By 1994 acquisitions of the ESOTERICA line of products and DYNACIN acne antibiotics from SmithKline Beecham (later
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) and Schein Pharmaceuticals, respectively, led Medicis to turn a profit, and in 1995 the company moved its headquarters from New York to Arizona.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued its strategy of acquisitions and bought GenDerm, maker of the topical analgesic Zostrix; it purchased product lines including the LIDEX and SYNALAR lines of topical steroids from
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   subsidiary Syntex, as well as LOPROX and TOPICORT from Marion Roussel (now part of
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999, however, business forced Medicis to change direction, and the company sold Exorex, a joint venture with IMX Pharmaceuticals, to Bioglan Pharma, and sold most of its over-the-counter product lines to expand its prescription operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="53278">
    Ascent Pediatrics
   </company>
   in 2001, gaining a portfolio of specialty pediatric pharmaceutical products (including ORAPRED, an oral liquid steroid for asthma and other respiratory conditions), as well as a valuable foothold in the pediatrics market into which Medicis was eager to leverage certain of its own products, including LOPROX. (ORAPRED was licensed to
   <company id="59774">
    BioMarin
   </company>
   in 2004.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company formed a partnership with
   <company id="51425">
    AAIPharma
   </company>
   to develop SOLODYN, a treatment for inflammatory lesions related to severe acne vulgaris. SOLODYN was approved by the FDA in 2006, as was ZIANA, a topical acne gel developed with
   <company id="113931">
    Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 wrinkle treatment PERLANE was approved by the FDA and launched commercially. Medicis also invested in a similar product being developed by Revance Therapeutics in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medicis entered both the manufacturing field and the medical device industry through its 2008 acquisition of technology firm LipoSonix (now Medicis Technologies) for $150 million, plus possible milestone payments. The purchase added the LipoSonix body sculpting system and expanded the company's distribution network into Europe.
