   At Universal Stainless &amp; Alloy Products, even if something isn't totally finished, that's OK. The company makes both semi-finished and finished specialty steels, including stainless, tool, and alloyed steels. Universal Stainless' stainless steel products are used in end products made by the automotive, aerospace, power generation, oil and gas, and heavy equipment manufacturing and medical industries; its high-temperature steel is produced mainly for the aerospace industry. Before the products get there, however, Universal Stainless sells them to service centers, rerollers, OEMs, forgers, and wire redrawers.

  <p>
   Universal Stainless has four operating locations: the Universal Stainless &amp; Alloy Products facilities in Bridgeville and Titusville, Pennsylvania, that make specialty steel in the form of long products (ingots, blooms, billets, and bars) and flat-rolled products (slabs and plates); the Dunkirk Specialty Steel plant in Dunkirk, New York, that specializes in finished bar, rod, and wire specialty steel products; and a specialty steel manufacturing facility in North Jackson, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also performs conversion services on materials supplied by customers that lack production facilities or that are subject to capacity constraints.

   Universal Stainless' largest customer in 2014,
   <company id="42203">
    Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum
   </company>
   , accounted for 18%, 15%, and 13% of net sales in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Net sales to its five largest customers accounted for 46% of total net sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The majority of the company's  products are sold to service centers/processors rather than the ultimate end market customers.

  <p>
   In 2014 Universal Stainless' net revenues increased by 14%, reflecting a 6.6% rise in consolidated tons shipped as demand for products increased as a result of improved market conditions. The increase in both sales and sales dollars per shipped ton is primarily a result of increased base prices as well as more favorable product mix of the company's higher value added products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The product sales to targeted end markets of aerospace, power generation, and oil and gas end markets increased.  Sales to heavy equipment market decreased, primarily due to uneven buying patterns from year to year because of the many smaller customers in this end market. Premium alloy sales, which are sold primarily to the aerospace end market, increased from 5.9% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Universal Stainless' net income improved by 200% due to higher sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 55%. The net accounts receivable plus net inventory minus accounts payable increased primarily due to improved market conditions in most end markets. The net accounts receivable balances increased primarily as a result of increase in net sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Inventory levels grew due to planned increases on certain product grades as a result of higher customer activity in 2014 and anticipated improved sales levels heading into 2015. The accounts payable balance increased due to higher operating activity, the timing of vendor payments, and higher capital spending in the fourth quarter of 2014.

  <p>
   Universal Stainless' strategy is to expand its business through maintaining high standards of product quality, responding quickly to customer needs, and keeping production costs at competitive levels. The company seeks organic growth (through expanding its customer base) supported by selective complementary acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company moved forward in its plan to capture the potential of its expanded capabilities. Progress included earning important new customer certifications of Universal Stainless' products as well as numerous source approvals, especially in the aerospace market. It also added a range of new higher value products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Capital expenditures in 2014 included capital projects to add automation on the hot rolling mill in Bridgeville, debottleneck constrained operations, expand internal testing capabilities for new and core products, and streamline product flow.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company grew through an acquisition, buying Ohio-based Patriot Special Metals and RSM Reale Estate Holding for $111 million. The acquired assets included a state-of-the-art radial forge and a vacuum induction melting facility in North Jackson, Ohio. The purchase broadened Universal Stainless' production capabilities, allowing it to make higher margin products and enabling its entry into new market niches.
  </p>
  <p>
   Universal Stainless was incorporated in 1994.
