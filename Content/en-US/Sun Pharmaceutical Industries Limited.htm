   Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is one of India's brightest stars in the pharmaceutical industry. The company develops, makes, and markets generic pharmaceuticals in a variety of dosage forms (oral tablets and capsules, injectables, creams, and nasal sprays). Its products target chronic therapeutic areas including cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, psychiatry, and orthopedics. Sun Pharma also manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for other drugmakers. The company markets its products around the globe and has 25 manufacturing plants in the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

  <p>
   Sun Pharma makes and markets a large variety of formulations covering chronic and acute therapies. Its portfolio includes generics, branded generics, complex or technology-intensive products, over-the-counter (OTC) products, anti-retrovirals, APIs, and intermediates. The company's treatments span psychiatry, anti-infectives, neurology, cardiology, orthopedics, diabetology, gastroenterology, opthamology, nephrology, urology, and several other therapeutic segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its wholly owned US subsidiary Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc., Sun Pharma makes a variety of generic products including liquids, creams, and ointments at a plant in New Jersey. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. is also authorized to import narcotic raw materials and produce controlled substances at a plant in Tennessee, which allows Sun Pharmaceutical to provide a range of pain management products in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its local market, the company operates a number of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, including one through its Sun Pharmaceutical (Bangladesh) joint venture with City Overseas. Sun Pharma also has European manufacturing operations through Alkaloida Chemical Company in Hungary, which runs one of very few facilities worldwide dedicated to making controlled substances. A Canadian plant specializes in creams and ointments, while a plant in Israel makes both APIs and generics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US generics market accounts for nearly 60% of sales, and other global segments are on the rise. In 2014, Indian Branded Generics accounted for nearly a quarter of sales, international generics (excluding the US) accounted for 12%, and APIs accounted for 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sun Pharma makes and distributes both generic and private-label pharmaceuticals in the US through its Sun Pharma USA unit.

  <p>
   The firm has customers in more than 150 nations around the globe. It has manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as R&amp;D centers and a workforce representing more than 50 nationalities. Sun Pharma operates in more than 50 emerging markets, as well as six markets in Western Europe. It is also beginning to operate in Japan.
  </p>

  <p>
   For its OTC products, Sun Pharma has more than 2,500 distributors and sales representatives covering more than 100,000 outlets across India.

  <p>
   Revenue increased 12% to 30 billion rupees in 2014 due to growth in the US market (which grew by 59% and accounted for about 60% of total revenues). The Indian formulations business grew 25% that year, as did the Rest of World operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Sun Pharma reported a 28 billion rupee net loss in 2014 as expenses related to benefits and materials rose. Also that year, the company saw a cash outflow of 24 billion rupees (versus a cash inflow in 2013).

  <p>
   Sun Pharma is focused on expanding its portfolio of specialty and branded products, as well as expanding geographically. Its research and development efforts -- focused on discovering new molecules and drug delivery systems -- are conducted through its Sun Pharma Advanced Research Center (SPARC) in India. The unit develops new complex APIs and generic formulations to expand Sun Pharma's product offerings. One targeted area is first-to-market filings, where the company aims to launch the first generic version of a prescription product that is facing patent expiration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sun Pharma also partners up with other pharmaceuticals to market its products or the products of others. In 2015 it entered into a distribution agreement with AstraZeneca Pharma India for
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   's acute coronary syndrome treatment Axcer. The year before that, it entered into a licensing agreement with Merck for that firm's investigational candidate tildrakizumab for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is looking to grow in emerging markets in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. It is looking for opportunities in these markets to out-license products to partner companies. In 2016 it agreed to buy a portfolio of 14 varied prescription brands from
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   for $293 million, marking its entry into that nation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company gained US approval for its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to market a generic version of Temodar.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a consolidation effort in the US, Sun Pharma sold an Ohio manufacturing plant to Nostrum Laboratories in late 2015. In mid-2016 it agreed to sell two facilities (in Pennsylvania and Illinois), along with 15 products made at the facilities, to Frontida BioPharm. Terms for the deals were not disclosed.

  <p>
   In addition to organically developing new products and forming joint ventures, Sun Pharma pursues growth through acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired fellow Indian manufacturer
   <company id="132779">
    Ranbaxy Laboratories
   </company>
   from
   <company id="140780">
    Daiichi Sankyo
   </company>
   for $3.2 billion. That deal made Sun Pharma the fifth-largest producer of generics in the world. Later that year, the company bought US-based eye care firm
   <company id="16596">
    InSite Vision
   </company>
   for some $48 million. That deal adds to Sun Pharma's growing opthalmic operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Pharmalucence, adding that firm's sterile injectable capacity in the US. The following year, it acquired GlaxoSmithKline's Australia-based opiates business, gaining poppy manufacturing operations in Tasmania, as well as new products and inventory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sun Pharma had planned to take its majority controlled subsidiary
   <company id="89531">
    Taro Pharmaceutical Industries
   </company>
   private by merging it with a Sun Pharma subsidiary in 2012; however, the plans were canceled in 2013. Taro makes dermatology and topical products in the US and Israel, as well as generic cardiovascular, psychiatric, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Sun Pharma acquired a majority stake in Taro to expand its US operations in 2010, after two years of negotiation.
