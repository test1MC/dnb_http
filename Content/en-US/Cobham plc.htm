   In 2015, sales grew 12% on prior year to £2.0 billion due to the contribution of the acquired Aeroflex business, the operations of which have been spread across Advanced Electronics and Communications and Connectivity. Both segments saw negative organic growth, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell again, down £67 million to £37.8 million as a result of an increase in administration costs relating to the Aeroflex deal. Cash from operating activities was up 13% to £189.1 million.

  <p>
   Cobham is balancing its commercial and military activities after an over-reliance on military-related sales emerged. The group is now targeting technologies that has applications in both fields, and to that end in 2014 it acquired US specialist communications equipment firm Aeroflex. However, the deal has so far been more trouble that it's worth after Asian demand stalled for the formerly Aeroflex's wireless products, and the company was hurt by difficulties in oil and gas industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Cobham hived off its to advanced composites business to UK firm Meggitt for $200 million.

  <p>
   Cobham acquired US specialist communications equipment firm Aeroflex in 2014 for $1.5 billion, the largest acquisition in the company's history by a significant margin. The acquisition is hoped to diversify Cobham's customer base and product suite.

  <p>
   Alan Cobham joined the British Army in 1914 and eventually became an aviator and flying instructor. After the war he made a number of long-distance route-proving flights to India, South America, and Australia. (He was knighted by King George V after his triumphant Australian trip.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1920s, Cobham formed the Flying Circus. The circus' stunt fliers barnstormed around the country to increase the public's awareness of aviation, offering airplane rides to the more adventurous spectators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerial refueling was used experimentally and in stunts since the early 1920s, but no one had tried to create a system for ordinary commercial use. Cobham began Flight Refueling Ltd. (FRL) in 1934 to achieve that goal. When WWII broke out, the company's airfield was commandeered for military use. The war also increased interest in aerial refueling. After Germany fell, the UK sought to transfer a number of its heavy bombers to assist in the war on Japan. These bombers didn't have the range to strike Japan from bases in Australia or China, so FRL was commissioned to equip 600 Lancaster bombers as fuelers for some 600 Lincoln bombers. However, successful Allied island assaults won back islands closer to Japan and made the conversions unnecessary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cold War fueled business for the company when the USSR closed off Berlin in 1948 and the Berlin Airlift (Operation Plainfare) became the beleaguered city's lifeline. FRL transported the lion's share of the city's oil, heating fuel, and gasoline needs in its tankers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Around the same time, Peter Macgregor, the company's head designer, devised an aerial refueling system that was still used by military aircraft decades later. While increasing its expertise in air-to-air refueling, the company became involved in aircraft conversion and aeronautic components and systems through natural growth and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, at the time operating as FR Group, acquired Stanley Aviation (aircraft handling and maintenance equipment) in 1981. Four years later FR Aviation was formed to provide flight-training services for the UK's military. In 1987 the company bought
   <company id="12159">
    Moog
   </company>
   's Carleton Group, which made pneumatic equipment. FR Group acquired Sargent Fletcher, its main US air-to-air refueling rival -- and the leader in helicopter air-to-air refueling -- in 1994. That year marked the centennial of its founder's birth and FR Group was renamed Cobham.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cobham bought Westwind Air Bearings (air bearing spindles) and two ground-based satellite antennae systems makers in 1995. The next year Cobham picked up the ML Group's aerospace and marine division, which added weapon-carriage and -release systems and safety survival equipment to its offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Cobham added another niche player, US-based Conax, a maker of emergency oxygen systems, electro-explosive actuated devices, and gas storage release systems. Cobham bought the aircraft radome division of
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   in 2000. Late in the year the company also bought BAE's power and controls (actuation equipment and starter motors) for about $93 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Cobham acquired South Africa-based Omnipless (Proprietary) Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary Omnipless Antenna Systems (Proprietary) Limited, a company that designs, manufactures, and sells microwave flat panel steerable antennas for use in mobile satellite communications. Late in the year it formed Bournemouth Aviation Services (large commercial aircraft maintenance) with Singapore Technologies Aerospace.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cobham spent almost $300 million on 13 acquisitions in 2003. The company also sold its Westwind Air Bearing subsidiary, a maker of spindles and DC motors and drivers, for about $37 million. In 2004 the Airtanker consortium, in which Cobham had a 25% stake, was selected by the UK Ministry of Defence for the future strategic tanker aircraft (FSTA).
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2004 Cobham enhanced its Life Support segment with the acquisition of US-based H. Koch &amp; Sons (restraint systems, survival kits, and emergency lighting) for about $50 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Cobham purchased the REMEC Defense and Space subsidiary of
   <company id="47594">
    REMEC Inc
   </company>
   . for $260 million. REMEC Defense was integrated with Cobham's Chelton microwave business. The same year the Chelton business also purchased Vector Fields, a maker of software used to design electromagnetic equipment. Also in 2005 the company sold its Fluid Systems products division, which made products to treat specialist fluids and gases used in non-airborne applications, to
   <company id="90276">
    Meggitt PLC
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Cobham sold its Draeger Aerospace GmbH subsidiary (aircraft oxygen system components) to
   <company id="11620">
    BE Aerospace
   </company>
   for about $80 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Cobham subsidiary Cobham Defense Electronic Systems Corporation acquired the Surveillance and Attack business of
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   's US-based operations,
   <company id="109919">
    BAE Systems, Inc.
   </company>
   , for about $240 million. Surveillance and Attack (renamed Sensor and Antenna Systems, Lansdale) makes broadband, high-power transmitters and radio frequency systems for military aircraft. The acquisition fuels Cobham's expansion into the defense electronics attack market. Cobham also picked up
   <company id="117277">
    SPARTA, Inc.
   </company>
   , a provider of engineering, scientific, and technical services, primarily for the defense industry, for just over $400 million. (It agreed to sell SPARTA to
   <company id="43065">
    Parsons Corporation
   </company>
   for $350 million in October 2011).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2009 Cobham picked up Argotek for $36 million. Argotek, which was rolled into SPARTA, provides information assurance engineering services to the US goverment and is a part of the nation's Comprehensive National Cyber Initiative. Other acquisitions that year included the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business of
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   (formerly Tyco Electronics) for $427 million in cash. The deal netted the aerospace and defense business of Tyco's
   <company id="112667">
    M/A-Com
   </company>
   subsidiary, which subsequently opened the door for Cobham to win business from
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   . Cobham however did not keep the commercial business,
   <company id="162454">
    M/A-Com Technology Solutions
   </company>
   , nor M/A-Com's pedestal and forklift-mounted radio-frequency identification (RFID) product line.
