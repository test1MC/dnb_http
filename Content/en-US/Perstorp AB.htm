  <p>
   Chemist William Wendt founded Perstorp AB (known at the time as Stensmolla Kemiska Tekniska Industri) in 1881 in Perstorp, Sweden. While Wendt's father wanted him to farm, Wendt chose instead to produce acetic acid, charcoal, wood alcohol, and tar. A creative engineer, Wendt soon developed a method of making acetic acid from beech wood (his father owned beech forests).
  </p>
  <p>
   Wendt built a plant after receiving funds from his uncle when the funding from his father, who had financed his earlier projects, ended. In 1883 Wendt was commercially producing acetic acid. He changed the name of the company to Skånska Ättikfabriken.
  </p>
  <p>
   The business soon outgrew its original supply source -- the Wendt family forests -- and the company had to buy beech wood from other forest owners. To make cash payments for beech wood, Wendt took his product to Chicago's World's Fair of 1893 and hawked the advantages of his acetic acid made from wood. He stressed that his product was cheaper than alcohol-produced vinegar, lasted up to 10 times longer, and had a smoother taste. Since his product was often used to make pickles, Wendt soon became known as "the cucumbers' friend and protector."
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1895 Wendt's father died and left him the family's forests. As wood became more scarce, Wendt decided to diversify and began producing creosote as well. By 1905 creosote production had created enough profits to fund the construction of a plant to make methanol and formalin. The company sold formalin (formaldehyde) primarily as a disinfectant in the pre-WWI period. Later the company used formalin as a base for many different products, including foundry abrasives, impregnated paper, and molding compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1940s the company used funds generated from its charcoal operations to fund development of polyalcohols and specialty chemicals used to produce resins. Perstorp introduced decorative laminate to the Swedish market during the 1950s. As its laminate took off, the company shut down a parquet-flooring plant to increase laminate production. By the mid-1950s, the company had become the world's largest exporter of laminate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overcapacity in the European laminate market in the mid-1960s caused Perstorp (given its current name in 1966) to compensate by cutting prices and closing plants. The company shifted its focus toward fire-proof, decorative laminate for the shipping industry and industrial-grade laminate for the electronics industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perstorp listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1970 and began acquiring companies. In need of additional capital to fund its rapid growth, Perstorp listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1983. The next year the company introduced one of its most successful laminate products -- Pergo. The company continued to grow throughout the remainder of the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s Perstorp made major investments in chemicals and flooring companies. It also picked up a number of medical and biotechnology companies such as Selbourne Biological Services (NZ) Ltd. In order to focus on the specialty chemicals sector, the company spun off Perbio Science (biotechnology and medical technology) to shareholders in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   A deal with Industri Kapital, a leveraged buyout firm, to buy Pergo for $1.1 billion fell through in 2000, but was cinched in 2001. As part of the deal, Perstorp spun off its flooring unit,
   <company id="106201">
    Pergo AB
   </company>
   . At the same time, Perstorp was combined with Neste Oxo. The firm had originally planned to combine the new Perstorp with
   <company id="91016">
    Kemira Oyj
   </company>
   and
   <company id="106113">
    Dynea Oy
   </company>
   , but that merger fell through when the Finnish government decided not to sell its controlling stake in Kemira to Industri Kapital because of domestic resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Perstorp sold its Vyncolit N.V. and Vyncolit North America units to Japan-based Sumitomo Bakelite Co. for about $109 million. The sale was part of the company's strategy to focus on its core operations, specialty chemicals. Also as part of that strategy, the company sold its compounds business in 2005 to Raytor Holding, which was majority-owned by former Perstorp Materials Technology division president Anders Lundin.
