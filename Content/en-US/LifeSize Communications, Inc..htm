   Logitech and Lifesize agreed to separate in 2015. Logitech wanted to focus on its core products and Lifesize believed it could accelerate growth as an independent company. It began its new life with a $17.5 million capital infusion from venture firms

   . Logitech maintained ownership of about one-third of Lifesize.

   Lifesize switched gears in 2014, moving from offering higher cost, hardware-based teleconferencing systems to systems based in the cloud that offer high-definition video over plug-and-play cameras and phones. The system is managed through cloud-based software. The change in product offerings came in the face competition from Skype,
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's Facetime, and
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   Hangouts. Cloud-based video conferencing offers lower cost and greater flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   While margins might be less on the sale of its cloud-based hardware and software than the on-premise systems, the lower cost expands Lifesize's market to companies that might be be able to afford them. While it can still go after larger companies with resources for video conferencing equipment, it can pursue the higher number of smaller businesses with multiple locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite video conferencing's long presence in the workplace, Lifesize still devotes some of its marketing scope to educating customers about the benefits of the service.

   Lifesize was acquired by Switzerland-based Logitech for $405 million in cash. The Swiss company, which moved into PC-based video communication and videoconferencing services with its 2008 acquisition of SightSpeed, used the purchase of LifeSize to extend the functionality of its video communications products beyond the office desktop and the conference room, pushing HD-quality video communication into home offices and mobile computing. While mostly known for making computer mice and keyboards, Logitech has diversified its product lines into other areas of consumer electronics technology.
