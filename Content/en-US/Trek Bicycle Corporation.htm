   Trek Bicycle's mission is to build the best bikes in the world. The company is a top designer and maker of high-end bikes, which it sells through independent specialty bicycle shops worldwide. Trek makes mountain, road, town, children's, tandem, police, and BMX bikes under brands Trek, Gary Fisher, and Bontrager. It also makes electric-assist bikes that allow riders to go farther and faster, as well as eco-designed bikes made using low-impact manufacturing and recycled parts. Trek customers pay top dollar for innovations in racing geometry, smooth suspensions, and custom paint. In addition to high-performance bicycles, the company sells technical gear and clothing.

   Trek Bicycle designs and develops its bikes either at its worldwide headquarters in Waterloo, Wisconsin, or at its European design facility in the Netherlands. The manufacturing of its bikes takes place in the US and Asia (under Trek oversight), with select town bikes assembled in Hartmansdorff, Germany.

  <p>
   Trek Bicycle was founded in a Wisconsin barn in 1976 by the late Richard Burke. His son John continues to run the company.

   Trek Bicycle was founded in 1976 by Richard Burke, president of appliance distributor Roth, and Bevill Hogg, owner of a chain of bike stores. They got $25,000 in seed money from Roth's parent company, Intrepid, to start building bikes by hand in a Waterloo, Wisconsin barn. The bike operation targeted the prestige market from the beginning. Success came quickly, and Trek Bicycle expanded its distribution and increased its production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm introduced its first mountain bike line in 1983, the first bonded-aluminum road bike -- the Trek 2000 -- in 1985, and a carbon fiber road bike in 1986. The lightweight Trek 2000 was greeted enthusiastically by serious riders, but its popularity brought about production problems that led to Hogg's departure from the company in 1986. Burke, who had held an advisory role, took over day-to-day operations and presided over the company's return to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid a US bike industry slump in the early 1990s, Trek Bicycle focused on overseas sales and overcame European snobbery toward American bikes. It also moved into accessories and began manufacturing helmets in 1993. That year the company bought Gary Fisher Mountain Bike, founded by the inventor of the mountain bike. Trek Bicycle bought out two more mountain biking competitors (Bontrager and Klein) in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intrepid, Trek Bicycle's parent company, changed its name to Trek in the latter half of the 1990s as the company divested itself of its non-biking businesses. In 1997 Burke's son, John, became president of the bike company. To increase production efficiency, Trek Bicycle stopped bonding its aluminum bikes in 1998, adopting the more common practice of welding them.

   In 1999 American cyclist Lance Armstrong rode a Trek to victory in the Tour de France. He repeated the feat in 2000, 2001, and 2002, becoming the only American to win the race more than three times; he continued his streak, eventually winning seven consecutive titles. Armstrong was later striped of those wins after a long investigation by cycling and anti-doping organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June of 2002, the company's president was appointed to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Seeking to further boost its European presence, the company purchased the bike division of Villiger, a diversified Swiss company, later that year. The purchase included bicycle factories in Switzerland and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Richard Burke died in 2008 from complications from heart surgery. Also that year, its relationship with Volkswagen of America ended.
