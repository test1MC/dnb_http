   Angus Industries makes maneuvering heavy mobile equipment a little easier and more comfortable for those at the controls. The company is a leading designer and manufacturer in North America of custom cabs and stations for operators of construction, agriculture, forestry, material handling, mining, and military mobile equipment. The Angus engineering team works closely with customers on product design and testing to make everything from cabs for small utility equipment to large earthmovers. It also makes complementary products like engine doors, boom components, and frames. Founded in 1969, Angus was acquired by

   in late 2011 for $180 million.

  <p>
   As a result of the acquisition, Angus Industries now operates as a standalone business segment called Engineered Cabs in Worthington Industries' portfolio. Engineered Cabs includes the Angus-Palm, Angus Engineering, and ACT brands. The deal gave Worthington a new set of products, services, and manufacturing operations, as well as increased presence in the construction, agriculture, and mining industries.
