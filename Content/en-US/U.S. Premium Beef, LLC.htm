   From&#160;ranch to plate, U.S. Premium Beef (USPB) is making money. USPB buys cattle from producers' ranches in 36 states, through the&#160;feedlots, and sends them&#160;off to its&#160;subsidiary beef processor
   <company id="136288">
    National Beef Packing Co.
   </company>
   (NBPC). From there, some of the company's better steaks head to the Kansas City Steak Company, a foodservice distributor that it partially owns, which&#160;supplies&#160;high-end steakhouses and restaurants.&#160;The rest of its&#160;value-added and branded beef is boxed and sold to food retailers and foodservice distributors throughout the US. Founded in 1997, the company operates a&#160;mail-order business for its products.
   <company id="10893">
    Leucadia National Corporation
   </company>
   acquired a 79% stake in NBPC in 2011 and, as a result, USPB.

   U.S. Premium Beef became the sole owner of&#160;National Beef Packing in 2003. Previously it was known as Farmland National Beef and was a joint venture between U.S. Premium Beef and agricultural cooperative
   <company id="40149">
    Farmland Industries
   </company>
   . When beset with debt and bankruptcy woes, in 2003 Farmland Industries sold its share to USPB for $232 million.

        <p>
   Originally a beef-producer cooperative,&#160;U.S. Premium&#160;chose to become a limited liability company in 2004 but continues to pay patronage dividends to its members.

        <p>
   National introduced its NatureWell brand in 2005, which is made ready for store shelves without the use of antibiotics or hormones in the final 120 days of processing. In 2006 National acquired California-based
