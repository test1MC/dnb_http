   Agence France-Presse (AFP), the world's oldest international news agency, transmits millions of words in six languages every day. It covers the news with some 1,300 journalists and photographers, around the clock and around the world -- offering text, graphics, and an archive of seven million photos. In addition, the company offers business news covering European and Asia/Pacific financial markets. AFP has more than 200 bureaus organized around five regions with headquarters in Paris; Washington, DC; Hong Kong; Nicosia, Cyprus; and Montevideo, Uruguay. The agency also has an additional office location in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

   AFP serves thousands of broadcasters, publishers, and businesses worldwide. Its bureaus cover 150 countries, with 80 nationalities represented among its 2,260 collaborators.

   The press cooperative files about 5,000 text stories in six languages, 20 television news reports, up to 3,000 photographs, and 80 still and interactive graphics each day. Its clients include the French government, newspapers, magazines, TV and radio broadcasters, and other government and business interests. Heavily subsidized by the post-WWII French government, the agency is overseen by a board that includes both government and private representatives.

   The news operations of French media house Agence Havas were begun in 1835 by Charles-Louis Havas. The news distributor used mail coaches, couriers, carrier pigeons, and the telegraph to spread information throughout Europe. It added publicity services, and an 1857 merger with Société Générale des Annonces took the company into advertising for French and foreign papers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Havas' dual roles as publicity and news provider made the company become an increasingly powerful presence in the French media. It distributed propaganda for the French government in WWI.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the news operation split from Havas' advertising arm to form the French Information Office, which came under Nazi control. Agence France-Presse was established in 1944 when French Resistance members took control of the organization. Government subsidies effectively put the agency under control of the French government.

   In 1957 AFP head Jean Marin secured the agency's political and editorial independence with a Parliamentary decree. New statutes forbade the group to acquire shareholders or own capital, but also prohibited operating at a loss. In ensuing years Marin fought encroaching government influence -- a battle that would continue long after he left. In 1975 President Valery Giscard d'Estaing insisted Marin step down. Despite his protests that AFP was independent, Marin left after discovering that AFP subscribers on the governing board were prepared to vote against him.
  </p>
  <p>
   AFP decentralized in 1985, creating regional headquarters. In the early 1990s it launched its AFX-News financial wire joint ventures in Asia and the UK. In 1996 government representatives on AFP's board voted out agency director Lionel Fleury following AFP's coverage of antigovernment strikes. Fleury was replaced by Jean Miot.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 a government audit criticized AFP's management and operations, highlighting the agency's ambiguous status as neither a public service nor a commercial operation. In 1999 Miot was succeeded by Eric Giuily, former head of TV channel France 2. Giuily ran into opposition over proposals to raise private capital to develop the group's multimedia and Internet operations. He resigned in 2000 and was replaced by Bertrand Eveno, former head of Havas' educational publishing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company decided not to pursue the purchase of Bridge Information Systems' financial news service because of potential distribution difficulties. In early 2003 AFN announced the sale of its AFX Asia subsidiary (which provided coverage of Asia/Pacific financial markets) to Xinhua Financial Network (XFN), a Hong Kong-based financial information company.
