   Mast Therapeutics steers its R&amp;D ship towards investigational drug treatments for genetic disease and cancer. The company is focused on developing a late-stage treatment for sickle-cell disease patients. The drug aims to reduce tissue and organ damage by repairing microvascular function, and is being explored as a treatment for other inflammatory and circulatory disorders. The company also has some candidates in development to treat cancer. The firm's name reflects its focus on its MAST (molecular adhesion and sealant technology) platform. In 2017, Mast agreed to merge with Savara, which specializes in treatments for rare respiratory diseases. The combined firm, to be named Savara, will be headquartered in Austin, Texas.

  <p>
   The company's cancer candidates are improved formulations of existing treatments that aim to reduce the toxic side effects of most chemotherapies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became focused on its sickle cell candidate in 2011 after it acquired SynthRX, a pharmaceutical company active in developing Poloxamer 188, a candidate to treat sickle-cell disease. Mast Therapeutics (then known as ADVENTRX) relaunched a late-stage trial of Poloxamer 188 (now named ANX-188), which has received orphan drug status.

  <p>
   In addition to general economic difficulties effecting many biotechnology companies, Mast Therapeutics has struggled with issues such as disappointing clinical trial results and licensing disputes, leading to the reduction of more than half of its workforce and the refocusing of development programs in 2008 and 2009. In 2010 the company also made some changes to its management.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously known as ADVENTRX, in 2011 Mast rearranged its operations around its sickle cell program, which uses the MAST technology platform, and changed its name to Mast Therapeutics to reflect the new focus.

  <p>
   Mast Therapeutics' 2011 acquisition of SynthRX (and its sickle-cell disease candidate) was funded by an equity sale to RA Capital Management and other healthcare-related investors earlier in 2011, raising about $22.5 million.
