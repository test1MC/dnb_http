   Medical device maker Endologix strengthens weak arteries. The company makes endovascular systems that use stents, graft material, and catheter delivery devices to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA, weakening of the aortic wall). Its endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) products include the Endologix AFX Endovascular AAA System (AFX) and the Endologix Powerlink with Intuitrak Delivery System. Endologix sells its products in the US and some European countries through its own sales representatives, and elsewhere through more than a dozen independent distributors. The firm's products are pitched primarily to vascular surgeons, and, to a lesser extent, interventional cardiologists and radiologists.

  <p>
   The company's products and services are used by more than 1,600 hospitals and approximately 4,000 physicians in the US. More than 70% of Endologix's revenue comes from US sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   Endologix has its headquarters and manufacturing facility in California; the US contributes some 70% of revenue. It sells its products in more than 30 countries.

  <p>
   The company markets and sells its products in the US and in Western Europe (the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Monaco) through a direct sales force and a network of sales agents. It markets its EVAR products in 34 countries through 14 independent distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US, the company employed a direct sales force of 69 sales representatives and 26 clinical specialists at year-end 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endologix markets the AFX system in the US, Europe, Latin America, and other regions. Its Nellix Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System -- an endovascular sealing product -- is approved for sale in Europe and other markets and for investigational use in the US. Meanwhile, its Powerlink with Intuitrak Delivery System is sold in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its EVAS products are sold through a direct sales force, agents, and distributor channels in Europe, as well as an independent agent in New Zealand.

  <p>
   The company has seen solid revenue growth for the past five years. In 2014 revenue increased 11% to $147.6 million on growth in Europe, led by the European launch of the Nellix System. Nellix sales in the US also rose, as did sales of AFX.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, net loss doubled to $32.4 million that year as marketing and sales expenses rose. Other costs including R&amp;D, increased personnel, and facility expenses also increased, cutting into the bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell into negative territory in 2014, versus an inflow in 2013, on the higher net loss and an increase in inventories. That year the company reported a cash outflow of $26 million.

   Endologix focuses exclusively on developing and commercializing products related to the aorta.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the company's development programs stems from its acquisition of fellow medical device firm Nellix. The Nellix device is under development to treat typical cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm (known as infrarenal AAA) by sealing the aneurysm (in addition to placing a blood-flow stent). The Nellix system has been approved in Europe and the company expects

    FDA
   </company>
   approval in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company's products are used to treat infrarenal AAA, Endologix has a number of products in development to treat other aortic disorders, including conditions involving the thoracic aorta. Its Ventana system treats juxtarenal AAA and pararenal AAA conditions. In addition, the company has developed a percutaneous endovascular delivery system for its AAA devices, which allow access to the femoral artery via a needle (instead of a surgical cut).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched its VELA Proximal Endograft system, designed for the treatment of proximal aortic neck anatomies during an EVAR procedure using the AFX system. VELA is available in the US.

  <p>
   In early 2016, Endologix bought medical device maker
   <company id="163209">
    TriVascular Technologies
   </company>
   in a merger transaction valued at some $211 million. The combination of the firms, both innovators in the AAA field, will broaden sales coverage as well as capacity to provide clinical support for physicians. TriVascular makes the Ovation System, which is sold in the US and Europe.
