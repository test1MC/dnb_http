   Afton Chemical improves the substances that make things go and that make them go more smoothly. Afton manufactures additives that improve the effectiveness of fuels and lubricants for machinery, vehicles, and other equipment. The company was formed in 2004 from the additives division of parent company
   <company id="10535">
    NewMarket
   </company>
   , a holding company for Afton (its primary operating business), Ethyl, NewMarket Services, and NewMarket Development. Afton's products include fuel additives, which improve the refining process and boost the performance of gasoline and other fuels; and lubricant additives, which improve the performance, functionality, and durability of oils.
  </p>

  <p>
   Afton, which makes up the petroleum additives segment of
   <company id="10535">
    NewMarket
   </company>
   , produces almost all of the parent company's revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among Afton's products are octane boosters, a line of metalworking chemicals, performance additives, lubricants, and transmission fluids.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Afton serves customers worldwide. Its primary locations include Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, Venezuela, the UAE, the UK, and the US. The Us is the largest market (accounting for 34% of sales).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Its customers include oil companies and refineries, other specialty chemical companies, OEMs, consumers, and service dealers. Affiliated company Ethyl provides contract manufacturing services.

  <p>
   Afton's revenues dropped from $2.1 billion in 2015 to $2.0 billion in 2016, despite higher sales volumes, primarily due to unfavorable selling prices and foreign currency exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose to $243.3 million from $238.6 million in 2015, thanks to lower raw material costs, favorable impacts from the volume variance in product shipments, conversion costs, and miscellaneous costs. However, unfavorable selling price variance offset most of these favorable impacts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Afton's cash from operating activities was $353 million, compared to $268 million in 2015. The improvement included gains from deferred income tax expense, higher prepaid expenses, and increased payable and accrued expenses, and book overdrafts.

  <p>
   The company pursues business growth through geographic expansion (especially in Asia), innovation, and product launches.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its manufacturing network, in 2016 Afton expanded again in the Asia/Pacific market with the opening of a new chemical additive plant on Jurong Island, Singapore. The company invested more than $100 million in the new facility. The plant complements Afton's manufacturing facilities in the region in Suzhou, China, and another on Jurong Island that are operated by Chemical Specialties Singapore.

  <p>
   To expand its geographic reach, in 2016 the company agreed to acquire Aditivos Mexicanos (petroleum additives manufacturing, sales, and distribution) for $183 million.

  <p>
   Afton added to its metalworking fluid additives business with the 2010 acquisition of Polartech, which maintains manufacturing facilities in China, India, the UK, and the US. The purchase also helped it expand in the industrial additives market, which -- in addition to metalworking additives -- includes hydraulic fluids, grease, industrial gear fluids, and industrial specialty applications.

   Afton was formed in 2004.
