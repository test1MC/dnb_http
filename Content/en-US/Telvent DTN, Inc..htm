  <p>
   Roger Brodersen started Dataline in 1984, making the financial expertise of grain elevator and brokerage firm Scoular (for which he was COO) available to farmers. Scoular sold him the business in 1986. Renamed Data Transmission Network (DTN), the company offered livestock prices, commodity quotes, and other agricultural information. It went public in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   DTN expanded its services in the 1990s by providing foreign stock market summaries and other financial news, as well as information services for specific customers such as petroleum wholesalers, car dealerships, and golf course superintendents.
  </p>
  <p>
   DTN brought its services to the Web in 1995. Acquisitions of Knight Ridder's commodity news service subscriber base (1995) and rival Broadcast Partners (1996) helped extend its reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company lost $4 million on $149 million in revenue. Brodersen resigned from DTN in 1999 following a shake-up of its board of directors. Company president Greg Sloma replaced Brodersen as CEO. Unsatisfied with the performance of the company's stock, the new board put the company up for sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 VS&amp;A Communications Partners led a $475 million buyout of the company. The new owners split DTN into four divisions (agriculture, energy, weather, and financial services) to get a better handle on subscribers. The plan didn't help sales much; the company was still short of cash and in 2003 wound up in Chapter 11. It emerged from bankruptcy reorganization six months later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Gordon became the new company CEO in 2004. Gordon reduced head count by 16%, cut redundant departments, and embraced the Internet with a focus on selling proprietary information at a premium. In 2007 DTN acquired
   <em>
    The Progressive Farmer
   </em>
   from
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc.
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. (The magazine had operated as part of Time's
   <company id="110139">
    Southern Progress Corporation
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 DTN was acquired by Spanish information technology firm Telvent for some $243 million. The following year it was re-named Telvent DTN.
   <em>
    The Progressive Farmer
   </em>
   celebrated its 124th anniversary in 2010.
