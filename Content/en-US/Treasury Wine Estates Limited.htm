   Treasury Wine Estates' (TWE) stated purpose is to fill its vaults with good wine. TWE owns 45 wine labels, including Australia's Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindemann's, and US labels such as Beringer and Sterling. It is focused on four principal wine-growing regions across the world (Australia and New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, and Asia) where it has access to more than 14,000 planted hectares of vineyards. To boost sales of its premium and luxury brands, in 2016 TWE paid $754 million for UK-based drinks giant Diageo's wine distribution business in the US and UK.

   In early 2016 TWE owned 45 wine labels, down from around 80 in 2014, as the company has dumped its cheaper US wine labels to pursue the marketing of higher-value brands.

   German native Frederick Beringer worked for the Krug winery in Napa Valley for nearly 20 years before he and his brother Jacob purchased a site in St. Helena, California (located in the Napa Valley), in 1875. (The Victorian mansion they built there, which is pictured on the Beringer label, is open to the public.) The Beringer winery reached full-scale production in the 1880s, and the label's following grew steadily. It continued operations during Prohibition, producing sacramental wine. The Beringer brothers' descendants ran the winery until 1971, when Swiss food giant

    Nestlé
   </company>
   bought it.
  </p>
  <p>
   To build its new Wine World Estates subsidiary, Nestlé developed Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay (1976), created the Napa Ridge brand and bought Geyserville's Souverain (renamed Chateau Souverain) vineyards (1986), and established Meridian Vineyards in San Luis Obispo County (1988). In 1990 Walter Klenz became CEO. Investment groups Texas Pacific and Silverado Partners bought Wine World from Nestlé in 1996 and changed its name to Beringer Wine Estates Holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   With US wine consumption growing, Beringer broadened its wine list, reaching beyond US borders. In 1996 it added imports Campanile (Italy) and Tarapaca (Chile), and the next year it co-created the Rivefort brand in France. The company also added California wineries Chateau St. Jean (Kenwood, 1996) and Stags' Leap (Napa, 1997). Beringer went public in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company began expanding facilities for Meridian Vineyards, one of its fastest-growing labels. In 1999 the company acquired its sixth California winery, the premium wine producing St. Clement vineyards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sold one of its cheaper labels, Napa Ridge, which accounted for less than 5% of its sales, to
   <company id="107217">
    Bronco Wine
   </company>
   for about $40 million. Beringer was purchased by Foster's Brewing later that year for about $1.2 billion. That year the company agreed to buy Castello di Gabbiano, a 900-year-old Tuscan wine estate, which includes a castle built around 1100 and the surrounding land, a modern winery, and guest cottages, for an undisclosed sum; the company has imported Gabbiano wines since 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster's Americas sold its Geyserville Winery to The Coppola Companies in 2005.
