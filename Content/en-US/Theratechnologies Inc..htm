   Theratechnologies is pepped up on peptides. The Canadian company develops peptide sequences to treat endocrine and metabolic conditions such as growth hormone deficiencies. Lead drug EGRIFTA (tesamorelin for injection) is being marketed for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. Theratechnologies received US approval for EGRIFTS in 2010 and approval in Canada and Mexico in 2015. The drug is marketed solely in the US (in partnership with
   <company id="61472">
    inVentiv Health
   </company>
   ) and Canada. It is seeking to market EGRIFTA elsewhere around the world through partnerships with
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, and BL&amp;H Co.

  <p>
   Theratechnologies operates throughout North America and in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South Korea. In Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, it has a distribution and licensing agreement with
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   ; it has similar agreements to obtain regulatory approval for EGRIFTA with AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals (Europe) and BL&amp;H Co. (South Korea).
  </p>
  <p>
   Other partnerships include a master services agreement with RxCrossroads, which provides third-party logistics services for product sales in the US, and
   <company id="121777">
    McKesson Canada
   </company>
   , which provides various services related to the sale of EGRIFTA in Canada.

  <p>
   The company's revenues, which had been on the decline, rose 346% in fiscal 2015 (ended November) to C$30 million. That improvement came about as it marked its first full year of selling EGRIFTA for its own account rather than selling it
   <company id="138854">
    EMD Serono
   </company>
   for resale. A growing patient base has also provided a bump in sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Theratechnologies also turned a profit in fiscal 2015, after four years of losing money. Net income in 2015 totaled C$1.6 million, thanks primarily to the higher revenues. Operating cash flow increased to C$7 million (versus an outflow in 2014).

  <p>
   The firm's primary strategy for growth is pushing sales of EGRIFTA in the US and Canada and expanding its customer base. It is seeking regulatory approval for the product in other markets, including Mexico and Brazil. In 2014, it terminated commercial agreements for the distribution of EGRIFTA with EMD Serono (US) and
   <company id="100520">
    Actelion
   </company>
   Pharmaceuticals Canada (Canada), allowing it to sell the product on its own behalf.
  </p>
  <p>
   Theratechnologies is also seeking additional products through acquisition and in-licensing opportunities.
