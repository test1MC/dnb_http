   It's not uncommon for chip makers in need of critical manufacturing equipment to go on the Lam. Lam Research is a top maker of the equipment used to make semiconductors. The company's products address two key steps in the chip-making process. Its market-leading plasma etch machines are used to create tiny circuitry patterns on silicon wafers. Lam also makes cleaning equipment that keeps unwanted particles from contaminating processed wafers. The company's Customer Support Business Group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance. Lam's customers include many of the world's large chip makers; customers outside the US, primarily in Asia, represent the majority of sales. The company called off its acquisition of

    KLA-Tencor
   </company>
   for about $10.6 billion due to antitrust concerns.

  <p>
   The company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Silfex supplies high-purity custom silicon components and assemblies to the solar, optics, and semiconductor markets; Peter Wolters designs and manufactures high-precision grinding, lapping, polishing, and deburring systems used in the automotive, aerospace, medical, semiconductor manufacturing, and other industries.

  <p>
   Taiwan became California-based Lam's largest market in 2016 (ended June), accounting for 25% of sales. Customers in China contributed about 20% and South Korea generated 17% of sales. Lam also does substantial business in Japan and Southeast Asia. The company has manufacturing facilities in the US (Illinois, and Ohio), South Korea, and Rendsburg, Germany.

   Lam's top customers --

    SK Hynix

   , and

   -- accounted for more than 30% of total revenue in 2016 (ended June).

  <p>
   In 2016 (ended June) sales increased 14% to $5.8 billion driven by customers investing in newer technology and adding manufacturing capacity. The strongest growth came from Korea, up 25%, and from the US, where sales increased 25%. Sales were off 2% in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lam's profit increased 40% to $944 million in 2016 (ended June) from $655 million in 2015, propelled by higher sales, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash from operating activities increased to $1.3 billion in 2016 from $785 million in 2015 on increases in operating asset and liability accounts.

   The semiconductor business is notoriously cyclical, rising and falling according to the strength of the overall economy. When the economy improves, people buy more products with semiconductors in them. That's playing out at Lam, where shipments in 2015 following a rise in 2014 on stronger customer demand for semiconductor equipment. Demand for chips for mobile and enterprise applications spurred higher shipments in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The high expense of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, however, has resulted in consolidation of manufacturers. Samsung and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   are among the few companies left that make their own products. So far, Lam has maintained a mix of sales to manufacturers such as Samsung and to contract chip makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor.
  </p>
  <p>
   A heavy investor in innovation, the company's R&amp;D expenses during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $913 million, $825 million, and $716 million, respectively, which includes spending on deposition, etch, single-wafer clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company expanded its portfolio for atomic-scale processing with the addition of atomic layer etch to its portfolio of atomic layer deposition products.

  <p>
   The acquisition of KLA-Tencor, which the companies agreed to in 2015, would have created a company with complementary products and something of a one-stop shop for companies that make semiconductors. Throughout the process, the companies struggled to persuade regulators that the deal would not harm competition in the industry. Unable to make their case to the satisfaction of regulators, Lam and KLA-Tencor called off the deal in October 2016.

  <p>
   Chinese immigrant David Lam started Lam Research in 1980 to use plasma chemistry to improve processes for making semiconductors. The company introduced its first product, AutoEtch, in 1982 and went public in 1984. David Lam left the company in 1985. Roger Emerick became Lam Research's CEO in 1982 and continued in that post until 1997, presiding over the company's growth into an industry leader.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lam Research introduced its Rainbow line of dry-etch equipment in 1987 and its Transformer Coupled Plasma technology in 1992. The company signed a development agreement in 1994 with the U.S. Display Consortium to develop equipment for making advanced circuits for flat-panel displays. Lam posted its first "gigabuck" year, with annual revenues of $1.25 billion, in fiscal 1996. Since then, the company's revenues have yo-yoed up and down in response to cyclicality in the semiconductor equipment industry.
