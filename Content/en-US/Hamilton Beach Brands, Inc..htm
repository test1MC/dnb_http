Most of HBB's products are sold through retailers and wholesale distributors in North America. With roots that trace to 1910, HBB is a subsidiary of diversified conglomerate

   HBB's operations consist primarily of administrative and sales offices and distribution centers in the US, Mexico, Canada, and China. The appliance marketer outsources manufacturing duties to third parties; in 2013 almost 100% of its products were made in China.

   HBB's sales grew 5% in 2013 versus 2012, to $547.8 million. The company credited the rise primarily to an increase in sales of new products with higher price points, mainly in the US consumer market and improved sales of commercial products, partially offset by decreases in sales overseas. Net income rose 18% over the same period, to $25.1 million, on rising operating profit and lower interest expense as a result of lower levels of borrowing in 2013 versus 2012. HBB has posted several consecutive years of rising sales, and profits.

   The company is fueling sales in part through new licensing agreements. The Sub-Zero Group is one of HBB's newest partners. In May 2014, the maker of high-end kitchen appliances under the Sub-Zero and wolf brands signed a multiyear agreement with HBB that entitles it to produce a line of premium countertop appliances and kitchen tools under the Wolf Gourmet name. The new line is expected to launch in spring 2015. HBB also partners with Melitta to produce branded coffee and hot beverage appliances. Among other deals, HBB supplies Wal-Mart with GE-branded kitchen electric and garment care products under a licensing agreement the retail behemoth has with GE. HBB touts the

   ), and private-label products to certain customers in North America. HBB also licenses its trademark for use on a select number of compact refrigerators, microwaves, cookware, and vacuums.
  </p>
  <p>
   To bolster its position in the small appliance market, HBB spent $8.1 million on product design and development in 2013, up from an average of about $7.5 million in recent years. Most new products in recent years have sported bright colors and retro-inspired designs previously associated with more upscale appliance brands.
