   NxStage Medical helps patients suffering from end-stage renal disease. The medical device firm operates through three segments: System One, In-Center, and Services. The System One segment features NxStage Medical's lead product, the System One portable hemodialysis machine, which can be used by patients at home or by professionals in a hospital setting. The device is also marketed to hospitals for critical care and to dialysis clinics that want to create or expand their services to home-based patients. The In-Center segment sells NxStage Medical's blood tubing sets and needles to dialysis clinics primarily through distributor relationships, while the Services segment comprises the company's kidney dialysis centers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Its System One segment, the largest, representing about three-fourths of NxStage Medical's total revenue, sells and rents the System One and PureFlow SL dialysis systems as well as disposable products. Typically, customers rent the System One equipment, but NxStage Medical's two largest customers --
   <company id="47015">
    DaVita
   </company>
   and
   <company id="161006">
    Fresenius
   </company>
   -- purchase the product. Together, the two companies (which represent about 60% of the US dialysis market) account for more than half of the System One segment's income.
  </p>
  <p>
   The In-Center segment (about 20% of total revenue) is highly concentrated with just a few major buyers. The division sells blood tubing sets and needles to customers in independent dialysis clinics as well as dialysis chains. NxStage Medical's two largest distributors in this segment are
   <company id="46904">
    Henry Schein
   </company>
   and
   <company id="90906">
    Gambro
   </company>
   . Revenues from those two companies account for about 65% of the segment's income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the smaller Services segment provides dialysis services at the company's Kidney Care centers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Substantially all of NxStage's sales are generated in the US, however, it has formed several distribution agreements with international partners for the sale of the System One in Europe and the Middle East. Patients in some 25 countries have been treated with the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   NxStage has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Germany, and Italy.

  <p>
   The company sells its products and services to three markets -- home, critical care (both part of the System One segment), and in-center.

  <p>
   After several years of revenue growth, NxStage's revenue jumped 11% to $336.1 million in 2015, primarily due to higher sales for the System One segment, which benefited from growth in the home and critical care markets, both in the US and abroad. The In-Center segment's revenue dropped due to lower needle sales (as the result of the expiration of the needle purchase agreement with DaVita in late 2014). This was partially offset by higher tubing and needle sales to other customers. The Services segment rose dramatically thanks to recently opened Kidney Care dialysis centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even with growing revenue, the company has been reporting net losses, but it's going in the right direction. In 2015 net loss improved by 36% to $15.3 million due to higher sales. At the end of 2015, the company had an accumulated deficit of $402.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations more than doubled that year to $10.5 million.

  <p>
   The company expects that future demand for its kidney products and services will continue to gain strength. It hopes to boost its international sales by expanding its presence in countries where it already operates, as well as by entering partnerships with firms that have a presence in additional markets. Additionally, NxStage plans to launch three new systems over the next three years: a next-generation hemodialysis system, a peritoneal dialysis system, and a next-generation critical care system.
  </p>
  <p>
   NxStage is hoping agreements such as those it has with Henry Schein and Gambro Renal will help it finally reach profitability. Since its inception in 1998, NxStage has never recorded a profit; it had a total accumulated deficit of $402.8 million at the end of 2015. However, in recent years it has improved its operating margins and cash flow, particularly in its System One segment. Improved margins can be attributed to stronger sales and lower overall costs as a result of streamlining efforts and improvements made to its manufacturing infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also begun opening NxStage Kidney Care dialysis centers that directly treat patients with end-stage renal disease; it now has about 20 centers in operation. These facilities are designed to support at-home treatments with NxStage technologies. For the company itself, profits from product sales are expected to offset losses related to the opening of these centers.
