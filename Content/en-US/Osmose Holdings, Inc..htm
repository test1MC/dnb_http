   In 2013 Osmose Utilities Services introduced Pole Wrap CB, a  preservative bandage designed to protect wood utility poles from decay in the critical area where a pole is in contact with the ground.

   In 2012 this unit launched O-Calc Pro structural analysis software for utility poles.

   Osmose was founded as the Osmose Wood Preserving Co. of America, Inc. in 1934 to promote a wood preservation process and formula invented by Dr. Carl Schmittutz in Germany in the early 1930s.
