  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Novelis' net sales increased by 14% due to higher sales from Asia and South America (reflecting an increase in average aluminum prices and higher shipments of can and automotive products).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income grew by 42% compared to 2014 due to higher sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $98 million as the result of a change in inventories and accounts receivable.

  <p>
   The company's strategy is to be the top aluminum rolled products company in the world by focusing on capturing growth in the beverage can market, as well as the automotive and electronics markets. Novelis seeks to increase its production capacity through making capital investments in its high-growth and emerging markets, particularly in Asia and South America; finding and eliminating bottlenecks in its production and operations; and increasing its sustainability by utilizing an increased amount of recycled material in its products. The company set a goal of using 80%-recycled metal in its rolling operations by 2020. As part of its strategy for growth, the company may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, or strategic alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novelis is focused on managing its costs by pursuing a standardization of its core operations globally. It has implemented numerous restructuring initiatives, including the shutdown or sale of facilities, staff rationalization and other activities, all of which have led to significant cost savings that will benefit Novelis for years to come.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal year 2015, the company sold its consumer foil operations in North America. Additionally, it took steps to exit certain non-core operations in Brazil, including ceasing operations at the smelter in Ouro Preto, Brazil and selling certain hydroelectric facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Novelis opened an aluminum automotive heat treatment line in Nachterstedt, Germany, to serve European and global automotive customers. Located adjacent to Novelis' existing rolling mill and the world's largest aluminum recycling center, the $85 million investment will increase production capacity by 120,000 metric tons of automotive sheet annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Novelis opened two new aggregation centers, serving areas in and around London and the South East. The opening of the centers is in line with Novelis' strategy to augment its existing network of used aluminum can suppliers and reach its ambitious target of achieving 80% recycled content by 2020. The addition of these two new delivery points will make it easier for the company's suppliers to deliver high-quality aluminum locally.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Novelis sold its North American consumer foil products business to Reynolds Consumer Products LLC for $33.75 million. That year Novelis sold three foil and packaging plants in Europe to focus on North American operations for the auto market. It picked up $34 million for the transaction and began investing in its auto production lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company added new lines in Brazil, Italy, and Germany to keep up with aluminum demand in those markets.
