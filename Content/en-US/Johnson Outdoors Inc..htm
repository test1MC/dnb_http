   Johnson Outdoors keeps sports buffs from staying indoors. The company makes, markets, and&#160;sells camping and outdoor equipment (such as Jetboil cooking systems and Eureka! tents and backpacks). It also focuses on supplying equipment for water activities&#160;with its&#160;diving gear (Scubapro and Uwatec masks, fins, snorkels, and tanks), trolling motors (Minn Kota), fish finders (Humminbird), autopilot systems (Navicontrol), and watercraft (Old Town canoes,&#160;Necky kayaks). With GPS technologies&#160;and electric boat motors, Johnson Outdoors' marine electronics unit generates about&#160;55% of the firm's sales. The Johnson family, including CEO Helen Johnson-Leipold,&#160;controls the company.

        <p>
   The US is Johnson Outdoors' largest market, representing about three-quarters of its sales. Other markets include Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Basin.

        <p>
   The company has an extensive reach, with production and marketing operations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Its largest business segment is Marine Electronics, which logs 85% of its sales in North America. The company's Diving and Watercraft segments account for about 20% and 15% of sales, respectively. Outdoor equipment, primarily under the Eureka camping brand, and Silva field compasses and digital instruments brand&#160;brings in nearly 10%.

   Johnson Outdoors sells its products to major retailers, outdoor specialty stores (
   <company id="59471">
    Cabela's
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59470">
    Bass Pro Shops
   </company>
   ), and catalog and online merchants. It&#160;also provides boat motors and other products for original equipment manufacturers of boat brands, such as Tracker, Skeeter, and Ranger.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's consumer marketing and promotion activities include: product placements on fishing-related TV shows; print advertising and editorial coverage in outdoor, general interest, and sport magazines; professional angler and tournament sponsorships; packaging and point-of-purchase materials, and offers to increase consumer appeal and sales; branded websites; social media networks; and online promotions. Advertising and promotions expense in fiscal&#160;2012 totaled $21,745 vs. $22,338 the prior year.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Johnson Outdoors' fiscal 2012 (ends September) sales increased by about 1% vs. the prior year, while net income plunged 69%. The uptick in sales was driven primarily by the Marine Electronics business (up 4%)&#160;in the US, where the rising economy is&#160;spurring demand for its Minn Kota and Humminbird brands. By comparison, sales by its Watercraft unit inched up nearly 1% , while Diving and Outdoor Equipment saw their sales fall. Poor performance by the Outdoor Equipment and Diving segments, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses, put the squeeze on profits in fiscal 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   Fiscal 2012 marked the fourth year of improving sales for Johnson Outdoors, though its sales remain below their pre-recession high.

        <p>
   To&#160;shore up its business, Johnson Outdoors&#160;is acquiring&#160;brands to boost sales. The company in late 2012 acquired New Hampshire-based Jetboil, a maker of outdoor cooking systems, for about $16,000, to add to its existing Eureka! and Silva outdoor gear brands. In 2011 Johnson Outdoors expanded its&#160;marine electronics lineup with the purchase of LakeMaster brand high-definition lake charts. Also, in 2012 the company extended its Humminbird brand to deep water navigation systems, resulting in the discontinuation of the Geonav brand.

        <p>
   Cleaning products maker S.C. Johnson &amp; Son (Johnson Wax) set up subsidiary Johnson Diversified in 1970, which then began acquiring and developing a number of leisure products companies worldwide. Renamed Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA), the unit was taken public in 1987. By decade's end JWA had emerged as the #1 maker of electric fishing-boat motors. The company went on a 19-company buying spree between 1989 and 1991, a growth strategy that led to declining earnings.
  </p>
        <p>
   As sporting goods retailers consolidated in the mid-1990s, with fewer companies accumulating more buying power, manufacturers were forced to keep prices competitive. Ronald Whitaker became president and CEO in 1996 and reorganized the company, expanding product classifications from three (fishing/marine, camping, and diving) to five and assigning a manager to each. JWA also reduced inventory, taking an $11 million charge. It bought small manufacturers to expand its product offerings.
  </p>
        <p>
   JWA dumped Plastimo, its unprofitable European marine division, in 1997. It also expanded its watercraft division, buying Ocean Kayak (1997), Plastiques (1997, Dimension kayaks), Leisure Life Limited (1998, recreational boats), and Necky Kayaks and Escape Sailboat (1999). Whitaker resigned in 1999, and Samuel Johnson's daughter Helen Johnson-Leipold, a former JWA executive, rejoined the company from S.C. Johnson as chairman and CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 JWA changed its name to Johnson Outdoors to better reflect its core business. Johnson Outdoors also sold its fishing business to Berkley (Pure Fishing) for $34.5 million that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 the company acquired Fibrekraft Manufacturers, a New Zealand-based maker of paddles and other watercraft accessories, to accelerate growth in international markets. Also that year Johnson Outdoors won a hefty government contract to make extreme weather tents. Samuel Johnson was named the 2001 National Ernst &amp; Young Master Entrepreneur Of The Year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2002 Johnson Outdoors sold its Jack Wolfskin subsidiary for $62.9 million to
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   , a global private investment firm.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired sonar and video viewing equipment maker Techsonic Industries from
   <company id="12375">
    Teleflex
   </company>
   in May 2004. The purchase added the Humminbird brand to Johnson's marine electronics line. A significant decline in military tent sales in early 2005 led the company to eliminate more than 70 positions (5% of Johnson Outdoors' workforce) at its plant in Binghamton, New York.
  </p>
        <p>
   Refocused on growth, Johnson Outdoors in late 2006 added Scotland-based Lendal Paddles to its paddle sports portfolio. In April 2007 the company acquired the German diving&#160;equipment company Seemann Sub from owners Robert and Ella Stoss for about $9 million. Also that year Johnson Outdoors purchased Italy's Geonav, which makes chart plotters, marine autopilots, VHF radios, and fish finders, for nearly $6 million.
