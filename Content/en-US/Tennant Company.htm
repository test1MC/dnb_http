   Tennant's tenet is "keep it clean." The company is one of the world's leading manufacturers of industrial floor maintenance equipment. It makes specialty surface coatings and cleaning machines, including extractors, scrubbers, sweepers, and vacuums. Parts and supplies are also offered, along with maintenance and repair services. Its products feature its ec-H2O technology and clean up surfaces at airports, factories, offices, parking garages, stadiums, supermarkets, warehouses, and other high-traffic areas. Brand names include Alfa, Tennant, Green Machines, Nobles, and Orbio. Tennant operates in the Americas, Asia/Pacific, and EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa).

   Tennant's market reach is fueled through both direct sales channels planted in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, and distribution partnerships in more than 80 countries. Its major markets include the Americas (69% of total sales), EMEA (20%), and the Asia/Pacific (11%).
  </p>
  <p>
   It has manufacturing operations in Minneapolis; Holland, Michigan; Louisville, Kentucky; Uden, The Netherlands; the UK; SÃ£o Paulo; and Shanghai.

  <p>
   Tennant has achieved significant growth over the years, with revenues jumping 9% from $752 million in 2013 to a record-setting $822 million in 2014. Its profits climbed 26% from $40 million in 2013 to $51 million in 2014, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was driven by a 11% spike in sales from the Americas, a 12% surge from equipment sales, and a 17% rise from its specialty services coatings segment. It also experienced higher product sales from scrubbers equipped with ec-H2O technology and sweepers, and continued growth in its other geographical segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tennan's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the course of the last five years. After declining the previous year, it increased to $60 million in 2013 due to lower contributions made from its pension plan. It remained at around $60 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Tennant is also shoring up revenue by focusing on previously overlooked demand, such as commercial contract cleaning -- a sector less impacted by the sluggish economy. Additionally, Tennant grows its business by continually rolling out new products. In the last couple of years, Tennant has launched its ec-water (an electrically converted water tool used with rider scrubbers), FaST Foam Scrubbing Technology, and a Centurion brand street sweeper.

  <p>
   Irish immigrant George Tennant founded Tennant Company in 1870 to make wooden architectural products, such as hardwood flooring. The company was formally incorporated in 1909. In 1932 a high school janitor demonstrated a homemade floor scourer powered by a washing machine motor. The company was sold on the idea, and by 1940 Tennant was focusing its manufacturing efforts on floor care machines and floor sealers. Seven years later a Tennant engineer invented the first vacuumized power industrial sweeper, a product that revolutionized industrial floor maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tennant went public in 1969. Over the course of its history, Tennant's cleaning products have scoured such famous places as the White House, Grand Central Station, Yankee Stadium, and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia.
