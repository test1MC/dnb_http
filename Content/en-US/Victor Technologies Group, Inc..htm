   Victor Technologies has a hold on men of steel (and other metals). The company makes cutting and welding equipment used in fabricating (cutting, joining, and reinforcing) metal. Victor sells gas (air and oxy-fuel) torches and related products to OEMs as well as construction and foundry customers, in such industries as aerospace, oil and gas, and shipbuilding. Its lineup includes arc accessories (automatic welding guns), plasma power systems, and various welders, sold under the Cigweld, Victor, Stoody, Thermal Dynamics, and other brands. Victor was acquired by
   <company id="58103">
    Colfax Corporation
   </company>
   in 2014.

   After being owned by private equity group
   <company id="129400">
    Irving Place Capital
   </company>
   since 2010, Victor was acquired by pumps and valves maker
   <company id="58103">
    Colfax Corporation
   </company>
   in April 2014 for $947 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Victor sells its products to 3,300 distributors located in over 50 countries. Specific distributors include
   <company id="10044">
    Airgas
   </company>
   (11% of sales) and
   <company id="111633">
    Praxair
   </company>
   . It has international operations located in Australia, Canada, China, England, Italy, Malaysia and Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Americas is the company's largest market, representing nearly 70% of its total sales. Another major market includes the Asia/Pacific (nearly 25%).

  <p>

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />

  <p>
   Victor's revenues dipped by 2% from $496 million in 2012 to $487 million in 2013. The declines were driven by a 14% drop in sales from the Asia/Pacific region. Other declines were experienced by the welding equipment (12%), filler metals and hard-facing alloys (5%), and carbon arc gouging products (3%) segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company saw marginal 3% profit growth from $21.6 million in 2012 to $22.3 million in 2013 due to a decline in cost of goods. Victor was also helped by an income tax provision which included deferred US income tax expenses recorded on certain foreign earnings in addition to the foreign taxes payable currently on those earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Victor has seen its cash flow from operations skyrocket from $7 million in 2011 to $47 million in 2013. The company attributes the spike in 2013 to efforts made to reduce inventory levels at year-end and higher accruals for incentive compensation and rebates.

  <p>
   Victor expands its business by opening new offices in select markets. In 2013 it formed Victor Technologies GmbH, a subsidiary located in Neuwied‐Gladbach in the Rheinland‐Pfalz region of Germany. The opening of an office in Germany allowed it to accelerate its expansion into central  Europe and better support its current distributor base in Germany. Victor also launched its West Lebanon Design Center, a facility dedicated for plasma cutting and arc welding technologies, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another move to improve its position in Europe, the company in 2013 acquired Gas-Arc Group Ltd, a manufacturer of gas control equipment based in the UK, for $40 million. The acquisition strengthened its position as a leader in the global high purity and medical gas control market.
