   GOJO Industries wants to go where other forms of good hygiene haven't. The company makes hand cleaners for professional and consumer use for clients such as automotive, foodservice, education, government, and health care facilities. GOJO's product dispensers are seen in many public restrooms, as well. The firm also provides a line of health care products under the PROVON brand name. GOJO's waterless hand sanitizer, PURELL, is sold through retail channels. The company sells its products worldwide and operates offices in Brazil, Japan, the UK, and the US, among other countries. Privately held GOJO is named after its heavy-duty hand cleaner, which was formulated by co-founder Jerome Lippman.

   GOJO serves both the professional and consumer markets, selling its products to healthcare facilities, educational institutions, foodservice operators, and automotive shops, among other venues. PURELL is available through retailers. The company sells its products through the likes of

   To strengthen its business internationally, GOJO in 2014 acquired Laboratoires Prodene Klint, based in France. Prodene Klint specializes in making and marketing professional hygiene, cosmetics, and disinfectant products.

   The company's online tools allows manufacturing and automotive hand soap customers to determine the best locations for handwashing, conditioning, and sanitizing products in their plants and shops. In 2014, GOJO launched the 'Be Well Network' loyalty program to reward its consumers for healthy hand hygiene habits and encourage them to spread the word to others about how to reduce the risk of illness and infection.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 GOJO rolled out the GOJO CXT Counter Mount Dispensing System, a line of all-metal counter mount hand soap dispensers. The company also launched the PURELL E3-rated line of hand sanitizers, which offers customers a no-rinse product that meets strict guidelines. In the product's development, GOJO ensured that the line meets guidelines for several regulating entities, such as NSF International and the

    USDA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To this end, GOJO aims to ink lucrative agreements with companies that supply healthcare facilities with their ubiquitous sanitizers. GOJO in 2013, as part of this push, entered a contract with HealthPRO, a 260-member group purchasing organization that represents more than 800 hospitals. The contract provides its membership with the full line of PURELL Hand Sanitizers and GOJO and PROVON hand hygiene and skin care products, including eco-friendly certified PURELL Advanced Hand Rub.

  <p>
   The increasing prevalence of hand sanitizers at home and in places of work has positioned GOJO to benefit financially from its straightforward portfolio of hand-cleaning items. Indeed, the threat of the H1N1 virus, or Swine Flu, in 2009 spurred sales of GOJO's products and caused factories where its sanitizers are made to operate nonstop. The unprecedented demand for quick turnaround orders required GOJO to install additional equipment and raise its production capacity through 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Positioning itself to pick up more sales, the company re-acquired the PURELL brand from
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   in late 2010. It had marketed PURELL under a license with Johnson &amp; Johnson since 2006. (GOJO invented the waterless hand sanitizer for foodservice and health care professionals in 1988, and in 2004 sold the brand to Pfizer's Warner-Lambert, which was acquired two years later by Johnson &amp; Johnson.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of its focus on sanitation, the healthcare industry in 2011 sought GOJO to aid in hand-hygiene monitoring. GOJO, with its SMARTLINK Series Dispensers, and California-based AeroScout, which offers Wi-Fi RFID technology, together provide healthcare organizations with compliance monitoring of hand-sanitizing. When a caregiver enters or exits a patient's room and dispenses soap or gel, a message is sent via the hospital's Wi-Fi network that identifies the caregiver and records the time and location.
  </p>
  <p>
   GOJO was founded in 1946 by Goldie and Jerry Lippman.
