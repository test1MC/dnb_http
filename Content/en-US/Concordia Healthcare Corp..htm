Its branded products include Kapvay (used for the treatment of ADHD), Ulesfia Lotion (head lice), Orapred ODT (pulmonary diseases such as asthma), and Zonegran (seizures). The company also markets orphan drugs through its Orphan Drug Division, currently consisting of Photofrin for the treatment of certain rare forms of cancer, which is currently undergoing testing. Concordia operates out of facilities in Oakville, Ontario; through subsidiaries, it also maintains a presence through facilities in Bridgetown, Barbados; London; and Mumbai, India. The company was formed in late 2012.
