   While bigger chip makers fight over your PC and mobile phone, Microchip Technology has embedded itself in your car, your copier, and even your wallet. The semiconductor maker offers a variety of embedded devices, including eight-bit microcontrollers (it's one of the top makers of them worldwide); specialty memory products such as electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs); and KEELOQ brand code-hopping devices used in keyless locks, garage door openers, and smart cards. Its chips are used by tens of thousands of customers in the automotive, consumer, industrial, office automation, and telecommunications markets. Microchip gets about 80% of sales from customers outside the US.

  <p>
   Microchip Technology's product line includes microcontrollers (about 65% of sales), which offers a broad family of proprietary general purpose microcontroller products marketed under the PIC brand; Analog, Interface and Mixed Signal Products (23% of sales) which consists of several families with more than 1,100 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management, RF Linear drivers, USB, ethernet, and wireless products; Memory Products (about 6% of sales) consists of serial electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (referred to as Serial EEPROMs), Serial Flash memories, Parallel Flash memories and Serial SRAM memories; and Technology Licensing (4% of sales) includes license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of its SuperFlash embedded flash and Smartbits one time programmable NVM technologies.

  <p>
   The company has three manufacturing plants in the US (two in Arizona and one in Oregon) and one in Thailand. In addition, it outsources a significant portion of its wafer needs from contract manufacturers, or foundries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales offices are located throughout the world. Sales operations in the Americas (the US, Canada, and Central and South America) and Europe support much of design for products shipped for Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The percentage of sales attributable to Asia has increased as more customers have moved their manufacturing operations to the region, generating 59% of sales. Customers in Europe and the Americas each account about one-fifth of sales.

  <p>
   Microchip Technology uses both a direct sales force and distributors to sell its products worldwide. In 2015 (year-end March), 51% of its business went through distributors and 49% was sold directly.

  <p>
   Net sales increased 11% to a record $2.1 billion in 2015 (year-end March), driven by increase market share, results from acquisitions, and the general strength in the semiconductor industry. Microchip Technology is consistently profitable, but profit skidded 26% lower in 2015 to $369 million. The company had higher amortization expenses for acquired intangible assets and it experienced a loss on retirement of convertible debentures in 2015. Cash flow from operations increased 7% to $721 million.

   The company's stated goal is to provide specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications, such as consumer, automotive, industrial, office automation and telecommunications. Its strategic focus is on the embedded control market, which includes microcontrollers, high-performance analog, interface and mixed-signal devices, power management and thermal management devices, connectivity devices, interface devices, Serial EEPROMs, SuperFlash memory products, and its patented KeeLoq security devices and Flash IP solutions. Unlike many chip makers, Microchip doesn't experience significant fluctuations in average selling prices, particularly in its microcontroller and analog and interface groups where a large proportion of products are considered proprietary.

  <p>
   Microchip started 2016 with a deal to buy microcontroller competitor
   <company id="14420">
    Atmel
   </company>
   for $3.6 billion. Microchip aced out
   <company id="101549">
    Dialog
   </company>
   whose $4.6 billion offer for Atmel declined as Atmel's shares loss value in the intervening months. The deal deepens Microchip's product portfolio and provides both companies with more resources with which to withstand the increasingly competitive semiconductor environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Microchip maintained its one-acquisition-a-year pace when it purchased
   <company id="42319">
    Micrel Inc.
   </company>
   for about $840 million. Micrel makes semiconductor products for power management and timing and communications. Its customers are mainly in industrial, automotive, and communications markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it paid almost $235 million for
   <company id="14843">
    Supertex
   </company>
   , which makes mixed-signal ICs from its foundry in California. Supertex will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip Technology. The prior year it bought EqcoLogic, a Belgian fabless semiconductor company that designs equalizer and coaxial transceiver products and technologies for automotive and industrial applications.

   Investment firm
   <company id="43429">
    Sequoia Capital
   </company>
   acquired a washed-up semiconductor subsidiary from
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   in 1989. Sequoia executive Steve Sanghi, a veteran of
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , was tapped to head the operation, Microchip Technology. Sanghi instituted a bare-bones operating budget and broadened the company's focus beyond low-cost memory products to include more profitable embedded microcontrollers. By 1992 Microchip turned a small profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Microchip acquired the rights to KEELOQ secure data transmission products, developed by South Africa's Nanoteq Ltd. The following year the company introduced its own line of secure data transmission products and its first flash memory microcontrollers. In 1997 Microchip unveiled the world's smallest erasable read-only memory, to be used in devices such as keyless entries, dimmers, and thermostats. In 1998 Microchip settled litigation with
   <company id="54577">
    ROHM
   </company>
   , whose Exel Microelectronics unit was an original KEELOQ licensee; ROHM surrendered its licensing rights to the technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Streamlining around its more cost-effective manufacturing operations, Microchip in 1999 closed a wafer fabrication plant (or fab) and a test facility. In 2001 the company beefed up its analog product line by acquiring
   <company id="44081">
    TelCom Semiconductor
   </company>
   , a maker of chips for wireless phones.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Microchip paid $54 million in cash for privately held PowerSmart, a
   <company id="14674">
    Duracell
   </company>
   spinoff that made embedded controllers and battery sensors. Also that year the company acquired a large wafer fab in Oregon from
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu
   </company>
   for about $180 million in cash. Microchip launched a new e-commerce Web site in 2003.
