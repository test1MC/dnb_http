   AUDI, sometimes called the

   Bavarian car maker, is a subsidiary of fellow German car company
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen.
   </company>
   AUDI manufactures luxury automobiles with a lineup including its A-series cars and Q5 and Q7 SUVs. Other models include the TTS Roadster, TT Coupe, the S4, and an all-wheel-drive A6 allroad quattro wagon. The company also makes armor-plated security vehicles. Audi Financial Services provides financing for leasing and purchasing vehicles, offers an Audi

   , which makes the extravagant Murciélago and Gallardo, is an AUDI subsidiary. AUDI gets about three-quarters of its sales in Europe.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The storied history of AUDI dates back to 1899 when one of Carl Benz's engineers, August Horch, founded August Horch &amp; Cie in Cologne, Germany. Horch began to implement his own innovations and carve his own niche in the German auto industry. His first cars had front-mounted engines and used lighter alloys than were typical of the time. His mechanical innovations kept the company on the leading edge of the auto market, and a succession of victories in vaunted European car races earned Horch cars the nickname "Conqueror of the Alps." Horch's cars not only climbed the Alps, but the daunting heights of Germany's auto industry as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   An unexpected tumble occurred when Horch, like Henry Ford before him, was driven out of the company that he had founded. Ousted by shareholders, Horch immediately set up a new firm. Widespread and rampant inflation made merging the next logical step, so in 1932 Auto Union was born. It consisted of DKW (small cars), Wanderer (mid-market vehicles), Horch (luxury), and AUDI (touring cars). The group adopted the name AUDI, a Latinized version of Horch's first name, and it developed the four interlocking rings trademark that adorns AUDI autos.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII put the company in utter freefall. In 1939 the last car rolled off the production line, and soon after bombs began to fall in droves. After the war what remained of AUDI's facilities went to the Russians, who had little interest in automobiles. A group of senior AUDI managers, however, began to assemble the company anew in West Germany. Starting slowly through the replacement parts industry, they found financing, and the company re-emerged as an automaker in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though reborn, the company could not survive alone in the globalizing automobile market. It was purchased by
   <company id="41231">
    Daimler-Benz
   </company>
   in 1958. Disparities in design philosophies and Daimler-Benz's luxury direction made this a bad union, however, and in 1964 Volkswagen bought a majority stake in AUDI. The company thrived under Volkswagen as AUDI's cars grew in popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, due in large part to the introduction of its all-wheel-drive quattro coupe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1980s proved to be more than just a bump in the road for AUDI. A 1986
   <i>

   report focused on claims that the AUDI 5000 brake system caused a dangerous "sudden acceleration." The reports were widely disputed, but AUDI was dealt a major blow. Its US sales slumped, dropping almost 20% (to 56,000 cars sold) in the mid-1980s, and resale prices for the AUDI 5000 model plummeted.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's reputation was bolstered in 1990 when judgments in New York courts favored two AUDI dealers who had been sued by Alice Weinstein, founder of the AUDI Victims Network. (Weinstein had sued for $5 million in damages when she was injured in her 1982 AUDI 5000.) AUDI's popularity was also buoyed in the mid-1990s by the introduction of its hot-selling A6 sedan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 AUDI bought exotic sports car maker Lamborghini (cars start at $185,000) for a cool $110 million -- a move that revealed Volkswagen's strategy of offering cars for every taste. Also that year AUDI acquired UK-based Cosworth engineering, manufacturing, and casting units from Vickers and established COSWORTH TECHNOLOGY LIMITED.
  </p>
  <p>
   AUDI unveiled a new quattro model, its entry into the popular SUV category, in 2000. The next year AUDI announced plans to extend all of its product lines in China as competitors

   , DaimlerChrysler (now

   ), and
   <company id="137886">
    Volvo
   </company>
   were moving to introduce more models and/or to build factories in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 AUDI's Lamborghini division rolled out the Murciélago -- the long-anticipated replacement for the Diablo. Before debuting the Murciélago, Lamborghini had not introduced a new model in more than a decade. The following year the AUDI brand group debuted the Lamborghini Gallardo.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core business, AUDI sold its high-performance engine subsidiary COSWORTH TECHNOLOGY to
   <company id="92206">
    Mahle GmbH
   </company>
   of Germany late in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   To capture new customer segments, the company introduced 17 new models in 2008, including the A3 Cabriolet and the A4 Avant; the Q5 crossover performance SUV premiered in 2009. It also released the seven-speed S tronic with dual-clutch.
