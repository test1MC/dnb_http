   STMicroelectronics (ST) is one of the world's largest semiconductor companies; it competes with
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   to be the top maker of analog chips. ST makes many types of discrete devices (such as transistors and diodes) and integrated circuits (ICs), including microcontrollers, memory chips, and application-specific ICs. It sells to manufacturers in the telecommunications, computer, consumer electronics, industrial, and automotive markets. Clients have included
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="43932">
    Bosch
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   . STMicroelectronics gets most of its sales outside Europe.

   SGS-THOMSON was formed through the 1987 merger of SGS Microelettronica, a state-owned Italian chip maker, and the nonmilitary electronics arm of Thomson-CSF (now
   <company id="90847">
    Thales
   </company>
   ). Included in the deal were two US operations: SGS Semiconductor in Phoenix and Texas-based Thomson Components-Mostek (acquired by Thomson in 1986 from
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Microelettronica was part of
   <company id="92969">
    Leonardo - Finmeccanica
   </company>
   , formed in 1948 as the engineering subsidiary of the (now liquidated) Italian state industrial holding company
   <company id="41090">
    IRI
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson SA got its start shortly before the turn of the century, when a group of French businessmen acquired patents from
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   predecessor Thomson-Houston Electric and created Compagnie Fran√ßaise Thomson-Houston to produce power generation equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both Thomson and Microelettronica were struggling at the time of their merger. Pasquale Pistorio, a Motorola veteran who became head of SGS in 1980, was named president of the company. To jump-start the organization, he closed and sold factories, trimmed management, and shifted jobs to the Mediterranean and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   SGS-THOMSON lost $300 million in its first two years of operation, made a small profit in 1989, then stumbled again as recession spread across Europe. To secure the company's market presence, Pistorio began making acquisitions and forging alliances with major chip buyers such as Alcatel (now
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   . By 1993 SGS-THOMSON had become the world's #1 maker of erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs). Profits soared to $160 million, and the company bought Tag Semiconductors, a maker of low-cost chips, from US conglomerate
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   . SGS-THOMSON went public in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson sold off its stake in the company in 1997 and SGS-THOMSON changed its name to STMicroelectronics (ST) in 1998. The company formed development deals with
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   (for advanced chip manufacturing processes) in 1997 and with
   <company id="52289">
    Mitsubishi
   </company>
   (for flash memory chips) in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 ST bought
   <company id="12515">
    Adaptec
   </company>
   's Peripheral Technology Solutions group, which made chips for disk drives; Vision Group, a developer of image sensors; and Arithmos, a maker of ICs for digital displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 ST acquired the Canada-based semiconductor fabrication operations of
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel Networks
   </company>
   for about $100 million. The deal included a six-year supply agreement worth at least $2 billion. The following year, though, ST announced that a sluggish chip industry would lead it to close the former Nortel fab as part of an overall reduction in its capital spending; ST later closed a fab in California as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company announced that it planned to sell its small PC graphics chip business. Later that year ST bought
   <company id="104311">
    Alcatel Microelectronics
   </company>
   from French telecom giant Alcatel for about $345 million. In a related transaction, ST resold Alcatel's mixed-signal chip business to AMI Semiconductor (the operating unit of
   <company id="106505">
    AMIS Holdings
   </company>
   , now part of
   <company id="60890">
    ON Semiconductor
   </company>
   ). In 2004 the company spun off
   <company id="138359">
    UPEK
   </company>
   , a supplier of fingerprint scanners and other biometric authentication equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pistorio retired in 2005; company veteran Carlo Bozotti was designated as his successor. That year ST decided to exit the DSL chip business, a market it entered when it acquired Alcatel Microelectronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its position in SoC design and in the $1.5 billion market for digital TV chips, ST in 2008 acquired
   <company id="57705">
    Genesis Microchip
   </company>
   for around $336 million in cash. Genesis was among the leading vendors of video chips for flat-panel displays and digital TVs. Genesis became part of ST's Home Entertainment &amp; Displays Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   ST reorganized its product groups at the beginning of 2007. Among the moves,
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   and ST combined their flash memory businesses into a stand-alone company named
   <company id="159411">
    Numonyx
   </company>
   in 2008. ST sold its flash memory assets to the new company, including its NAND flash joint venture and NOR flash resources. ST received an equity stake of nearly 49% in Numonyx and $364 million in cash and notes. It transferred its Chinese joint venture with memory chip maker
   <company id="57841">
    Hynix
   </company>
   to Numonyx that year.
   <company id="128276">
    Francisco Partners
   </company>
   invested $150 million in the new venture, taking an equity stake of about 6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   ST then moved on to forming another joint venture in 2008, this one with archrival
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   . The two European chip makers combined their wireless semiconductor operations into a JV with 7,500-plus employees. ST owned 80% of the JV company, ST-NXP Wireless, and paid $1.55 billion to NXP as part of the transaction.
