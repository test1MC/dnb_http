   WellPet's Old Mother Hubbard gives her poor (and rich) dogs a lot more than empty promises about non-existent bones. The pet food manufacturer's flagship brands are Old Mother Hubbard, Wellness, Eagle Pack, and Holistic Select. Its lines of dry food, wet food, and treats are made using deboned meats (also free of hormones and steroids), as well as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. WellPet's products are sold through pet specialty stores and major retailers the likes of

   and

    Whole Foods
   </company>
   across the US and Canada. WellPet was formed in 2009 through the merger of Old Mother Hubbard and Eagle Pack Pet Foods, another top provider of holistic pet food.

   WellPet regularly rolls out new products. In 2014 it's focused on two new pet foods trends: superfoods and unique protein pairings. To this end, the company launched a superfood protein bar for dogs and a dual-layered wet cat food with pate topped with meaty morsels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2013 the company launched a gourmet, hand-packed cat food -- Signature Selects -- under its Wellness line. The cat food is grain-free and is available in shredded, chunky, and flaked styles.

   To keep up with demand, the company works to maintain equipment and boost production capacity when necessary. WellPet completed the first phase of a $20 million expansion project in 2012 at its plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, which was originally built in 1976. The effort, which doubled the plant's production capacity and upgraded its onsite quality and safety laboratory, has allowed WellPet to make its Wellness line there to add to production of its Eagle Pack and Holistic Select brand.
