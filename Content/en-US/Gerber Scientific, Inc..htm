  <p>
   Born in Austria, Joseph Gerber (known as the "Thomas Edison of the apparel industry") came to the US in 1940 at age 16 after being imprisoned by the Nazis. While in college in 1945, he invented the Gerber Variable Scale, similar to a slide rule, which quickly solved graphical numerical calculations. That year Gerber borrowed $3,000 and started Gerber Scientific Instrument to sell his device. He later added drafting and design calculators. The company focused on automated design and production after going public in 1961.
  </p>
  <p>
   A digital drafting machine invented by Gerber became the basis of many of the company's products. In the 1960s he replaced the pen, first with a knife that could cut fabric and then with a beam of light, making automated production of printed circuit boards possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 Gerber Scientific offered laser imaging devices, and six years later it founded its optical subsidiary. Joseph Gerber died in 1996. The next year the company introduced technologies for making printing-press plates directly from computer data. By 1998 the company had given up on its computer-to-plate technology and sold the unit. That year Gerber Scientific expanded its graphics operations in Europe by acquiring Spandex PLC for $183 million. It also bought Coburn Optical Industries to boost its optical business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm expanded into China in 1999 with the formation of Shanghai Gerber Technology Service. The joint venture with Shanghai Xuhui Foreign Trade Co. provided parts and related services to customers throughout China.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a restructuring in 2000, Gerber Scientific merged its sign-making and specialty graphics businesses. The following year the company and venture capital firm Next Generation Ventures launched startup SignStorey, which made electronic retail displays. After evaluating alternatives, Gerber Scientific announced in 2001 that the optical business would remain part of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company implemented a shared-services program, Gerber Scientific Operations (GSO), to reduce costs across the organization. The following year, the company set out to slash debt and improve efficiencies across its businesses; it consolidated its Gerber Technology and Gerber Scientific Products Plants in Tolland, Connecticut.
  </p>
  <p>
   For its part, Spandex relocated its headquarters to Brussels in 2004, and it combined its Australian and New Zealand operations. The subsidiary also integrated its supply chain operations with GSO. Together, these moves helped Gerber make significant strides toward improving its financial condition. Between 2003 and 2005, Gerber managed to reduce its debt by more than $80 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005, the company implemented a new product development process, dubbed "NPD," as part of its operational re-engineering plan. It was designed to help inject new life into the company suite of products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   SignStorey was acquired in 2007 by
   <company id="12435">
    CBS
   </company>
   for $71.5 million in cash and was renamed CBS Outernet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerber Scientific's strategy has included acquiring businesses that expand its portfolio and market share. In 2008 it purchased
   <company id="118613">
    Virtek Vision International
   </company>
   , an industrial laser manufacturer based in Canada. Virtek's products complement Gerber Scientific's slate of apparel and flexible materials. As part of the acquisition, Gerber Scientific also netted FOBA Technology + Services, a laser marking and engraving business unit of Virtek. Gerber Scientific however sold FOBA in 2009 to ALLTEC Angewandte Laserlicht Technogie, a unit of Videojet Technologies. The marking and engraving unit was regarded as peripheral to the company's needs; a gain from the sale was used to reduce Gerber Scientific's debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Gerber Scientific boosted its closet options by acquiring Yunique Solutions. The deal merges Gerber Scientific's CAD/CAM and product lifecycle management (PLM) software with Yunique's PLM lineup, creating an enhanced portfolio with which to court the apparel/retail industry. Internally, Gerber Technology also widened its traditional business in CAD/CAM for the "rag trade" to product lifecycle management (PLM) and product data management (PDM) software and systems for a variety of industries. PLM and PDM basically offer a cradle-to-grave framework for products, encompassing design, prototyping, manufacturing, and maintenance.
