   3A Composites USA is a big supporter of the arts; graphic arts, that is. A manufacturer of lightweight composite materials, the company makes aluminum composite panels and extrusions, heavy-duty foam boards, and PVC boards used to create 2-D and 3-D graphic arts signs and displays (i.e. kiosks, large decorative props displayed at events, detailed replicas of statues, buildings, and other structures). It sells its products under the FiberMate, Fome-Cor, Sintra, Gator, Dibond, and Profiles brands and distributes its products across the Americas. 3A Composites USA is a subsidiary of

        <p>
            <company id="161606">
    3A Composites
   </company>
   contributed about 90% of its parent company's total revenues in 2012 (about 29% of which came from its American operations). 3A Composites' revenues decreased by 3% due to the unfavorable global economic environment, but revenues derived from the American segment increased by 5%.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company pursues market expansion through product innovation, although moves to expand existing retail sales areas with new display products made only sluggish headway due to low US GDP growth.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014 3A Composites USA launched the SMART-X graphic display board, the first heavy-duty 100% recyclable foam board available in the Americas.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year 3A Composites USA introduced FiberMat recyclable rigid print media (wood fiber manufactured into a high-density fiberboard) at the 2013 ISA International Sign Expo. It also launched the Fome-Cor Bright White graphic display board (the brightest whitest surface available to create graphics) at the Specialty Printing and Imaging 2013 SGIA Expo.
  </p>
        <p>
   Consolidating its team of business managers, marketing, sales, and administrative functions from the graphic display, architectural, construction, and industry and transportation market segments, in 2012 the company moved its administrative headquarters from Mooresville, North Carolina to its existing facilities in Statesville, North Carolina.
