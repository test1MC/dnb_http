   Soup boils down to
   <em>
    M'm! M'm! Money!
   </em>
   at the world's #1 soup maker Campbell Soup. The company's most popular selections among its  extensive soup portfolio in the US include chicken noodle, tomato, and cream of mushroom. Campbell also makes many other simple foods, snacks, and beverages, including SpaghettiOs canned pasta, Pace picante sauce, V8 beverages, Aussie favorite Arnott's biscuits, and
   <company id="112552">
    Pepperidge Farm
   </company>
   baked goods (including those popular tiny Goldfish crackers). Newer products for the soup company include Garden Fresh Gourmet salsas and dips, and
   <company id="129605">
    Bolthouse Farms
   </company>
   carrots and organic baby foods. Campbell sells its products worldwide.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company principal brands, including Arnott's, Bolthouse Farms, Campbell's, Goldfish, Kjeldsens, Pace, Pepperidge Farm, Plum Organics, Prego, Swanson, and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. In addition, some of the company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.
  </p>
        <p>
   Campbell operates in three segments: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.
  </p>
        <p>
   Americas Simple Meals and Beverages (55% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2016) includes the retail and food service businesses in the US, Canada, and Latin America.
  </p>
        <p>
   Global Biscuits and Snacks segment (32%) includes Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in US retail, Arnott's biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific, and Kelsen cookies globally. The segment also includes the simple meals and shelf-stable beverages business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Campbell Fresh segment (13%) includes Bolthouse Farms fresh carrots, carrot ingredients, refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus, dips and tortilla chips, and the US refrigerated soup business.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company operates more than 25 manufacturing facilities in the US and elsewhere. The US is Campbell's largest market, accounting for 81% of its sales in FY2016. Australia accounted for 7% of sales, while other countries contributed the rest. Campbell has executive offices in Norwalk, Connecticut; Bakersfield, Santa Monica, and Emeryville, California; East Brunswick, New Jersey; Toronto, Canada; Nørre Snede, Denmark; Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; and North Strathfield, Australia.

        <p>
   Campbell's established simple meals, snacks and healthy beverages businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. The company's businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future.
  </p>
        <p>
            <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   is Campbell's largest customer, accounting for 20% of sales in FY2016. Its five other largest customers accounted for another 40% of its sales during the year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Campbell has been decreasing its advertising spend in recent years, though it pledged to spend a larger percentage of its marketing efforts on digital marketing and e-commerce channels while decreasing its television spend in 2016. Overall, the company spent $397 million on advertising in FY2016, up from $385 million in fiscal 2015, and $411 million in fiscal 2014.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In fiscal 2016, the company's net revenue decreased by 1% to $7.96 billion due to a decrease in revenue from the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and Global Biscuits and Snacks segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   The revenue from the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment dropped due to declines in soup and V8 beverages driven by marketing execution issues on Campbell's Chunky soups, partially offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces, Plum products, and Pace Mexican sauces.
  </p>
        <p>
   Global Biscuits and Snacks revenue declined due to a 4% negative impact from currency translation.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2016, Campbell's net income decreased by 18.5% to $563 million due to lower net sales, an increase in other expenses (related to a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit) and higher administrative expenses (related to increased losses on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments; higher costs from the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost savings initiatives; inflation and higher incentive compensation costs).
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2016, the company's operating cash inflow increased by 24% to $1.46 billion compared to $1.18 billion in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements (primarily inventories).
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Campbell in 2015 took a number of steps to strengthen its established business lines, launching more than 200 new products during the year to meet consumers' changing tastes, preferences, and needs. The company spent $124 million on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products in fiscal 2016, up from $117 million in in fiscal 2015, and $122 million in 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   In its American soup and simple meals business, the company expects to improve performance by enhancing product quality and elevating its marketing and brand-building efforts. It also looks to introduce new soup and simple meal products responsive to consumers' desire for indulgent or premium foods; their increasing appetite for ethnic and regional cuisines; and their growing interest in quick and easy home-cooking solutions. To this end in late 2015, the company leveraged its partnership with top US coffee brewer brand
   <company id="45721">
    Keurig Green Mountain
   </company>
   by launching its new line of Campbell's K-Cup Soups. Addressing changing consumer tastes, the company has also been reducing the salt and preservatives content of its foods across some of its best-selling brands, including its iconic tomato soup, along with V8, Healthy Request, Chunky, and Goldfish products. Challenged in quality and sales by rival General Mills' Progresso-brand soups, Campbell has enhanced the taste of its products by adding more vegetables to its vegetable soup and making its cream soups creamier.
  </p>
        <p>
   For its shelf-stable beverage business, the company will target health-conscious adults with its V8 branded beverages and households with children with its V8 Splash branded beverages. Pepperidge Farm will remain focused on building the Goldfish cracker brand, maintaining the momentum of its fresh bakery portfolio, and revitalizing its adult savory crackers business. The company will also continue its efforts to reinvigorate its businesses in Australia, focusing on Arnott's biscuits.
  </p>
        <p>
   Beyond the US, Campbell hopes to boost its production and sales presence abroad, moving into fast-growing markets in Asia and Latin America through acquisitions and strategic alliances. With China having one of the world's highest rates of per-capita soup consumption, Campbell has been focusing its efforts on the Guangdong province and Shanghai.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is also focusing on boosting its global biscuits and snacks brands in Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Campbell has targeted long-term organic net sales growth of 1% to 3%.
  </p>
        <p>
   It has also taken steps to close and/or sell unproductive operations. In fiscal 2014, the company and its joint venture partner
   <company id="41796">
    Swire Pacific Limited
   </company>
   restructured manufacturing and streamline operations for the joint venture's soup and broth business in China, closing its soup production plant in Xiamen. That year Campbell also closed plants in Aiken, South Carolina, and Villagran, Mexico.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also continues to selectively acquire food companies that complement its product lines.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In June 2015, Campbell continued its plan to diversify beyond soup into "faster-growing categories" by buying salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet for $231 million. Garden Fresh Gourmet, which is also a top maker of hummus, dips, and tortilla chips, generated $100 million in net sales in 2014.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Campbell Soup Company began in Camden, New Jersey, in 1869 as a canning and preserving business founded by icebox maker Abram Anderson and fruit merchant Joseph Campbell. Anderson left in 1876 and Arthur Dorrance took his place. The Dorrance family assumed control after Campbell retired in 1894.
  </p>
        <p>
   Arthur's nephew, John Dorrance, joined Campbell in 1897. The young chemist soon found a way to condense soup by eliminating most of its water. Without the heavy bulk of water-filled cans, distribution was cheaper; Campbell products quickly spread.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1904 the firm introduced the Campbell Kids characters. Entering the California market in 1911, Campbell became one of the first US companies to achieve national distribution of a food brand. It bought Franco-American, the first American soup maker, in 1915.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's ubiquity in American kitchens made its soup can an American icon (consider Andy Warhol's celebrated 1960 print) and brought great wealth to the Dorrance family.
  </p>
        <p>
   With a reputation for conservative management, Campbell began to diversify, acquiring V8 juice (1948), Swanson (1955), Pepperidge Farm (1961), Godiva Chocolatier (33% in 1966, full ownership in 1974), Vlasic pickles (1978), and Mrs. Paul's seafood (1982). It introduced Prego spaghetti sauce and LeMenu frozen dinners in the early 1980s.
  </p>
        <p>
   Much of Campbell's sales growth in the 1990s came not from unit sales but from increasing its prices. In 1993 it took a $300 million restructuring charge, and over the next two years it sold poor performers at home and abroad. John Sr.'s grandson, Bennett Dorrance, took up the role of vice chairman in 1993, becoming the first family member to take a senior executive position in 10 years.
  </p>
        <p>
   Two years later Campbell paid $1.1 billion for Pace Foods (picante sauce) and acquired Fresh Start Bakeries (buns and muffins for
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   ) and Homepride (popular cooking sauce in the UK).
  </p>
        <p>
   As part of its international expansion, in 1996 the firm acquired Erasco, a top German soup maker, and Cheong Chan, a food manufacturer in Malaysia. However, back at home it sold Mrs. Paul's. In 1997 Campbell sold its Marie's salad dressing operations and bought
   <company id="41774">
    Groupe Danone's
   </company>
   Liebig (France's leading wet-soup brand). Also that year Dale Morrison, a relative newcomer to the firm, succeeded David Johnson as president and CEO. To reduce costs and focus on other core segments, in 1998 Campbell spun off Swanson frozen foods and Vlasic pickles into
   <company id="56069">
    Vlasic Foods International
   </company>
   . (Vlasic later filed bankruptcy and was snapped up in a leveraged buyout.) In 1999 Campbell redesigned its soup can labels, altering an American icon.
  </p>
        <p>
   Morrison resigned abruptly as president and CEO in 2000; Johnson returned to the helm during the search for a permanent chief. In early 2001 Douglas Conant, previously of Nabisco Foods, joined Campbell as president and CEO. A fresh plan was introduced to spend up to $600 million on marketing, product development, and quality upgrades (at the expense of shareholder dividends). In 2001 Campbell also bought the Batchelors, Royco, and Heisse Tasse brands of soup, as well as the OXO brand of stock cubes, from
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   for about $900 million. The deal made Campbell the leading soup maker in Europe. In 2003 Campbell bought Snack Foods Limited, a leading snack food maker in Australia, and Irish dry soup maker Erin Foods from
   <company id="92185">
    Greencore
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Campbell reorganized its North American business in 2004 into the following units: US Soup, Sauces, and Beverages; Campbell Away From Home, and Canada, Mexico, and Latin America; Pepperidge Farm; and Godiva Worldwide. (In response to dietary trends, the company announced that year that it was removing all trans-fatty acids from its Pepperidge Farm breads.) The company retired the Franco-American brand in 2004; products that carried the brand (most notably SpaghettiOs) now bear the Campbell brand. Also that year company chairman George M. Sherman retired and was replaced by Harvey Golub.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 Campbell sold its UK and Irish businesses to
   <company id="117846">
    Premier Foods
   </company>
   for about $870 million. Brands involved in the sale included Homepride sauces, OXO stock cubes, and Batchelors, McDonnells, and Erin soups.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012, the company purchased
   <company id="129605">
    Bolthouse Farms
   </company>
   for about $1.55 billion from
   <company id="98988">
    Madison Dearborn Partners
   </company>
   . Bolthouse, known for selling fresh carrots, beverages, and salad dressings, was expected to further fuel Campbell's US beverage division, which had benefited from the rising popularity of the V8 juice brand.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2013, Campbell expanded its access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico for its beverages, soups, broths, and sauces after it signed a deal with Grupo Jumex and Conservas La Costeñato. That year it also sold its European simple meals business, closing facilities in Belgium, France, Germany, and Sweden.
  </p>
        <p>
   In August 2013, the soup giant acquired the Denmark-based baked snack maker Kelsen Group for $325 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In June 2013 it bought Plum Organics, one of the top brands of organic baby food in the US. The company makes organic foods and snacks for babies, toddlers, and children, a fast-growing premium food category. It hoped the purchase would bring a new generation of consumers to Campbell.
