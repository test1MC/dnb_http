   There's a reason why the product's name is Gatorade. The drink was invented during the 1960s by
   <company id="40488">
    University of Florida
   </company>
   doctors to help hydrate the university's football team -- The Gators. The debut lemon-lime-flavored drink has grown to become one of the top sports drinks in the US. The company has continued to create new beverages, including its vitamin-enhanced Propel Fitness Water. Its G series offers a line of beverages called G Prime 01, G Perform 02, and G Recover 03, designed to meet the fluid and nutrient needs of collegiate and professional athletes before, during, and after practice, training, or competition. It also offers energy shakes and bars. Gatorade is owned by

   Gatorade is part of the PepsiCo Americas Beverages segment (PAB) of its parent company. PAB generated 32% of Pepsi's total $66 billion in 2013 sales, but the segment experienced a 2% drop in sales versus 2012, to $21.1 billion. The company blamed volume declines. Sales fell by 5% in the previous annual comparison.

   In 2014 PepsiCo discontinued Gatorade Naturals and G2 Naturals saying they did not resonate with its core consumers. The line had limited distribution to select
   <company id="10952">
    Whole Foods
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10864">
    Kroger
   </company>
   supermarkets. PepsiCo has faced legal challenges over its use of the word "natural" and in 2013 settled a lawsuit by removing "all natural" from its Naked line of juice drinks. However, Gatorade Natural, which was made with sea salt, was not the subject of any litigation. In 2013 Gatorade stopped using brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient in citrus versions of the sports drink amid concern about possible health effects.
