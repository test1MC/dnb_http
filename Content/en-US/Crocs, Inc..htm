   Crocs has taken a bite out of the footwear industry. The company's shoe collection has grown by leaps and bounds from its ubiquitous colorful slip-on shoe to mainstream fashion. Branded as Crocs, its shoes are made of proprietary closed-cell resin and designed for men, women, and children; its collection includes 300-plus four-season footwear styles. Jibbitz are their decorative add-on charms. The company sells its products in more than 90 countries, operating distribution centers worldwide and manufacturing plants in Mexico and Italy. Crocs sells through retailers, such as

   Crocs has worked in recent years to transform its brand from what Crocs calls its clog silhouette to an all-season footwear brand. It's also looking at licensing to further diversify its revenue. The company's products fall into four categories: Core-Comfort, Active, Casual, and Style. The footwear maker partners with the likes of
   <company id="11603">
    Disney

   ,
   <company id="42835">
    Marvel
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="143020">
    Viacom
   </company>
   to sell Crocs-licensed shoes and Jibbitz-branded shoe charms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moderated the pace of its retail expansion in 2015 with a focus on outlet and kiosk locations. It halted the expansion of its retail channel and is now focusing on the long-term profitability of current locations. Crocs opened 70 company-operated stores, half of which were outlet or low investment kiosk/store-in-store locations. It also closed 104 company-operated stores, 20 of which were identified in its initial restructuring plan.

  <p>
   Although Crocs posted record-setting revenues of $1.2 billion in 2014, it suffered its first net loss in five years for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue growth in 2014 was primarily due to a 3% spike in global footwear unit sales driven by improved year-over-year performance across its wholesale and Internet channels. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.35 per unit, or 2%, in average footwear selling price.
  </p>
  <p>
   The $5 million net loss for 2014 was mainly due to the presence of restructuring charges related to strategic plans for its long-term growth. These charges included severance costs, retail store closure costs, and a write-downs of obsolete inventory related to an exited business line.

  <p>
   To reach into the accessories and sports businesses, Crocs looks for add-on products (such as its purchase of Jibbitz) and technologies. Buying EXO Italia, maker of ethylene vinyl acetate-based finished products, has given Crocs the tools to compete in the popular performance footwear market against rivals the likes of
