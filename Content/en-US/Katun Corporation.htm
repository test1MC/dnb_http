   Katun wants you to exercise your options -- to not buy OEM parts. The company designs and makes alternative parts and supplies for copiers, printers, and fax machines. Other sales come from toner cartridges, drums, and rollers. Also included among Katun's more than 6,000 products are ink jet cartridges, thermal ribbons, ball bearings, and tools -- many for products made by companies such as
   <company id="41862">
    Canon

   ,
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="42390">
    Ricoh
   </company>
   . Katun (Mayan for "a period of 20 years") sells its wares to about 14,000 office equipment dealers and distributors in about 140 countries. It also markets products through catalogs and the Internet. Founded in 1979, the company is owned by equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners (MCP).

   The company has become one of the world's top providers of OEM-compatible imaging supplies, photoreceptors, and parts for copiers, printers, and other imaging equipment. In recent years, Katun has focused on expanding its selection for color copiers and multi-function devices. In 2013 it introduced several new toner and drum products for use in

   , and

   applications.

   Katun also works to expand its business through domestic and global partnerships. In 2013 the company partnered with Compass Sales Solutions, which specializes in sales opportunity management software, to make Katun's consumable product line and prices available to Compass customers through their MPS Pricebook. In 2011 it began providing high-quality color toners to Sweden through an alliance with Scandi-Toner, a top distributor in Sweden's office products market. Additionally, Katun launched a mobile version of its online catalog in 2013. Located at m.katun.com, it's synched with Katun's desktop version.

   After waiting until the economy showed signs of a turnaround, Katun in 2010 purchased the toner cartridge business of
   <company id="40698">
    Media Sciences International
   </company>
   . The acquisition has allowed Katun to boost its product development capabilities in the growing color printer category. As part of the deal, Katun became the exclusive master distributor of the Media Sciences ink stick line.
