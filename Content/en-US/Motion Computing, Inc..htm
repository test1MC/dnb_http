   Motion Computing serves those who are on the move -- literally. The company designs and sells tablet PCs, as well as mobile accessories such as keyboards, docking stations, storage drives, cases, and power supplies, for the healthcare, retail, government, construction, and manufacturing industries, among others. For example, its dashboard-mounted computers are used by police officers and EMS drivers. Motion Computing also offers a line of semi-rugged tablet computers aimed at mobile workforce sectors such as construction and field services. Its products are sold directly, as well as through an extensive network of software vendors, resellers, and distributors.

   Strategy Since struggling with weak sales and financial performance in the late 2000s, Motion Computing has tried to build momentum by expanding the functionality of its product line to include more wireless broadband connectivity (enabled in 2011 through a deal with mobile carrier
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint Nextel
   </company>
   ) for its tablet PCs. In 2013 it launched new image sharing and documentation software, an asset and inventory management UHF RFID reader, workflow-enabling accessories, and the latest generation of Motion F5 and C5-series rugged tablets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also continues to develop its product line. In early 2014 it teamed up with UK-based Becrypt to develop a new portfolio of PC tablets for healthcare, police, and emergency services personnel. Becryp'st DISK Protect encryption software will be incorporated into Motion Computing's F5te and J3600 models.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has also sought new partnerships to get its brand out in front of more potential customers. In 2013 it joined geographic imaging systems provider

    ESRI
   </company>
   to provide location-based services to mobile workforces.
