   Across the Western US, black top roads that give a smooth ride and roofs that don't leak are the direct beneficiaries of Paramount Petroleum, a company for which the production of asphalt is paramount. The company, which was founded in the 1930s and owned by

   </company>
   , manufactures, produces, and distributes asphalt products. Its core operations are a 54,000 barrel-per-day refinery (the largest and most efficient asphalt refinery in the state) located in Paramount, California and a 35,000 barrels per day refinery in Long Beach, California. It produces and transports jet fuel, diesel fuel, and gasoline to terminals and other refineries in Southern California.
