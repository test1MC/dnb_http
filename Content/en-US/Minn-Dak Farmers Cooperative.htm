   Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative serves sugar beet growers in the Red River Valley of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Headquartered in Wahpeton, North Dakota, the co-op processes its sugar beets into sugar as well as products the likes of molasses and beet pulp pellets (used in animal feed). Minn-Dak's products are then marketed through agents worldwide. The co-op's Minn-Dak Yeast segment produces fresh bakers' yeast. The cooperative is owned by its farmer/members, which consist of a group of some 500 sugar beet growers. Founded in 1972, its customers include industrial users, including confectioners, breakfast-cereal manufacturers, and bakeries.
