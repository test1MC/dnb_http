   If only Teledyne LeCroy made an instrument to analyze signals exchanged between the sexes. The company (formerly LeCroy) makes high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes under the WaveAce, WaveExpert, WaveJet, WaveMaster, WavePro, WaveRunner, and WaveSurfer brand names that capture electronic signals, convert them to digital form, and perform measurements and analysis. Teledyne LeCroy makes such other products as protocol analyzers, arbitrary waveform generators, and logic analyzers. It also provides support, maintenance, and recalibration services. LeCroy was acquired by
   <company id="61246">
    Teledyne Technologies
   </company>
   in a 2012 transaction valued at around $291 million.

  <p>
   More than two-thirds of sales come from outside of the Americas. Teledyne LeCroy has facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. Products are sold through a direct sales force, distributors, and manufacturers' sales representatives.

   Teledyne LeCroy's oscilloscopes are used to make sophisticated electronic measurements by design engineers and researchers in the automotive, telecommunications, computers, aerospace, military, and electronics markets, among others.

  <p>
   In all, the company's product development efforts have resulted in more than 120 patents. It is now focusing development on serial data standard testing, a market that includes Fibre Channel and USB.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certain parts needed for Teledyne LeCroy products are available only from single-source suppliers. The company depends on IBM and

   to make specific integrated circuits that are vital to its product designs.

  <p>
   Walter LeCroy, Jr. started the business as LeCroy Research Systems Corp. in 1964 to make signal analyzers and other instruments for high-energy physics (HEP) research. In 1983 the company began developing digital oscilloscopes, which convert electronic signals emitted from electrical devices to digital form for measurement and analysis. Two years later the firm introduced its first digital oscilloscope.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the company suffering losses, electronic design automation executive Lutz Henckels took over as CEO in 1993 and streamlined the company's oscilloscopes into a single line, the 9300 series, before introducing the LC line three years later. He also de-emphasized HEP products due to decreasing demand that followed government cutbacks in research spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 LeCroy went public. Two years later the company introduced a computer network analyzer, its first special-purpose oscilloscope. Weak sales in Asia led LeCroy to cut its workforce in 1998 and contributed to a loss for that fiscal year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 board member Charles Dickinson replaced LeCroy as chairman; LeCroy became honorary chairman. To boost operating efficiencies, the company in 1999 restructured by cutting additional jobs and streamlining its operations but it wasn't enough to avoid another year of fiscal loss. LeCroy sold its network analyzer business in 2000 to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Lightspeed Electronics in 2001 to add microwave signal technology to its repertoire. The next year COO Tom Reslewic succeeded Henckels as CEO. In 2004 LeCroy acquired
   <company id="101889">
    Computer Access Technology Corporation
   </company>
   (CATC) -- a maker of equipment used to test and monitor communications connections -- for about $80 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   After two years of litigation over patents held by rival
   <company id="11444">
    Tektronix
   </company>
   , LeCroy and Tek reached a legal settlement in 2005. LeCroy paid Tek $1 million as part of the settlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company once distributed analog oscilloscopes made by Iwatsu Electric in North America and Europe. In 2006 Iwatsu and LeCroy reached a legal settlement that saw LeCroy purchase Iwatsu's ViewGo scope product and technology (which the company repackaged as WaveJet) and Iwatsu agree to not competing with LeCroy for 10 years, in exchange for $3.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2006 LeCroy acquired Catalyst Enterprises, a manufacturer of data bus analysis and emulation tools for advanced serial data communications, for $30 million in cash and a $3.5 million note. The purchase added to the instrument maker's portfolio of serial data protocol analyzers. Catalyst Enterprises was integrated into the company's Protocol Solutions Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year LeCroy agreed to have TOYO Corporation distribute LeCroy's full product line of protocol analyzers, protocol exercisers, error injectors, and associated accessories in Japan. TOYO previously provided service support for LeCroy's protocol test products in Japan for 10 years. TOYO also distributed protocol test equipment for Catalyst Enterprises in Japan prior to Catalyst's acquisition by LeCroy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charles Dickinson retired from the company's board of directors in 2008, after 10 years on the board. Allyn Woodward, another 10-year veteran of the LeCroy board, was elected to succeed him as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 LeCroy was acquired by Teledyne in a deal valued at about $291 million. The acquisition was part of an effort by Teledyne to broaden its portfolio of analytical instruments and gain the ability to commercialize its Indium Phosphide (InP) technology and mixed-signal design capabilities. LeCroy was renamed Teledyne LeCroy as part of the transaction.
