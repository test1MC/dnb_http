   This company wants to deliver something besides pizza for dinner. GrubHub is an online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders. Its platform processed more than 135,000 combined meals in 2013. The GrubHub technology gives diners a 'direct line' into the kitchen of a restaurant, cutting out the middle man for phone orders. GrubHub's target market is independent restaurants that want to generate more takeout orders while keeping advertising costs low. Diners simply search for restaurants, order directly through the GrubHub website or mobile app, and then wait for the doorbell to ring. The company went public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company's revenue has been increasing significantly year-over-year. In fiscal 2013 the company generated revenue of $137.1 million, a 67% increase compared to fiscal 2012. The revenue growth in recent years has been driven primarily by increasing adoption of the GrubHub platform by restaurants and diners. GrubHub's net income was $6.7 million in fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   The company is hoping to cash in on the proliferation of mobile phones and other devices that has taken place in recent years. Orders placed on mobile devices increased from approximately 20% of GrubHub's consumer orders during 2011 to almost 45% by the end of 2013.

  <p>
   In August 2013 GrubHub merged with the Seamless Platform. The merger enabled the company to expand its two-sided network to serve more restaurants. The deal also reduced marketing expenses.
