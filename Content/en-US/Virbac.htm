   Virbac wants to keep your pet healthy. Established in 1968 by French vet Pierre-Richard Dick, Virbac provides biological and pharmaceutical products for veterinary and animal health use and is one of the 10 biggest veterinary pharmaceutical companies in the world. Products include vaccines, flea treatments, wormers, and antibiotics for animals. With some 20 subsidiaries (including US-based

   </company>
   ), the company's products are sold in more than 100 countries. Virbac's companion animal segment (dogs, cats, horses) represents about 60% of the company's sales, while its food-producing animal segment (cows, chickens, cattle) brings in the rest. The founding Dick family owns about 50% of the company.

  <p>
   Based in France, Virbac's biggest market is Europe (excluding France), accounting for more than 25% of sales. France alone accounts for about 20%. The company has production sites in nine countries and research and development centers on five continents.

   Virbac's largest business segment is companion animals, accounting for about 60% of its total sales. Pet food is a growing and important business for the firm as well. Other activities focus on ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) and swine. Virbac produces vaccines to support pig farming and breeding. Aquaculture is another focus for vaccine development.

   Virbac reported revenue of €736.1 million ($1 billion) in 2013, a 6% increase versus the prior year. (Revenue increased 10.5% at constant exchange rates.) The company's operating profit rose 7% over the same period to about €105 million ($145 million). Acquisitions made in 2012 in Chile and New Zealand helped boost sales, as did organic growth, which was strong in the second half of the year. A dearth of significant new products launched in 2013 depressed growth in Europe and the US.

  <p>
   Although the company's products sell well in Europe, it plans to integrate into the North American and Asian markets in the future. Indeed, Asia, Pacific, and Latin America are expected to remain growth drivers for Virbac in 2014, while growth in the Northern Hemisphere should be relatively moderate in 2014 before accelerating in 2015. The company is poised to launch of a wave of important new products in Europe, which should however have a rather limited impact in 2014 as they are essentially planned in the second part of the year. In the US, with the re-introduction of Iverhart Plus on the market being expected in the second semester, growth of the business globally should remain modest and then rebound in 2015.

  <p>
   In November 2012, Virbac acquired a majority stake in Centrovet, a leader in the animal health market in Chile. The purchase enabled Virbac to become a key player in products used for protection and treatment in aquaculture breeding. In December 2012, the company purchased the manufacturing and marketing rights for the animal health supplement Multimin in Australia and New Zealand.
