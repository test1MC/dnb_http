   Emerson Radio is tuned to the crowd that thinks a new television or microwave oven shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. The company designs, imports, sells, and licenses housewares and audio and video products under the Emerson, H.H. Scott, and Olevia brand names. Its products are sold primarily by mass merchants in the US. (
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   account for more than 85% of the company's sales.) Emerson's products include microwave ovens, compact refrigerators, wine openers and coolers, clock radios, televisions, and other audio and video products. Its products are sourced from foreign suppliers, primarily in China. Emerson Radio was founded in 1948.

  <p>
   Victor Emerson, an early radio inventor and a contemporary of Thomas Edison, founded his company in 1912. It experienced brief, but unwanted, publicity in the early 1950s because it had employed Soviet spy Julius Rosenberg during WWII. National Union Electric bought Emerson's company in 1965 and sold the Emerson name in 1975 to Major Electronics, which changed its name to Emerson Radio two years later. During the consumer electronics boom of the 1980s, Emerson's portion of the US VCR and microwave oven markets topped 10%. In 1985 it acquired hi-fi maker H.H. Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
   After slumping sales and a proxy fight, Emerson reorganized under Chapter 11 in 1993. Fidenas International, a Bahamas-based investment group controlled by Geoffrey Jurick, paid $75 million for 60% of the new company the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Emerson struck a royalty arrangement with supplier Otake Trading to make Emerson video products and sell them to
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   for three years. Emerson lost a bidding war for speaker maker International Jensen in 1996, instead investing in
   <company id="14652">
    Sport Supply Group
   </company>
   (SSG). Blaming a drop in video sales on the Otake deal, the firm switched to
   <company id="57856">
    Daewoo Electronics
   </company>
   for video manufacturing the following year. It also made agreements to sell Emerson products internationally with such companies as Cargill International (1997), World Wide One (1997), and WW Mexicana (1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   Emerson made a licensing deal with Tel-Sound Electronics in 1998 for telephone products. Also in 1998
   <company id="104234">
    Oaktree Capital Management
   </company>
   offered nearly $15 million for Jurick's stake, but the deal was blocked by a suit filed by a former Fidenas partner. In 2000 Emerson expanded a licensing agreement with Funai. The new agreement allowed the Japanese company to also use the Emerson name on its digital TV products. In 2001 Emerson upped its stake in SSG to just over 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2003 Emerson replaced its successful Hello Kitty product line with its proprietary Girl Power branded product line. The following March, Emerson signed a license agreement with Nickelodeon to license the Nickelodeon name, trademark and logo, along with several of Nickelodeon's trademarks and logos. That agreement ended at the end of 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company sold its 53% share of
   <company id="14652">
    Sport Supply Group
   </company>
   for $32 million to
   <company id="101407">
    Collegiate Pacific
   </company>
   . Emerson made the move as part of a plan to focus on its core business of designing consumer electronics. The following year, Jurick passed the chairman and CEO titles of Emerson to Adrian Ma, the owner of an investment company that bought most of Jurick's Emerson stock. Jurick remained with the firm as its president until July 2007, when he took on the role of consultant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Christopher Ho was named chairman of Emerson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emerson added another value-priced product to its portfolio in May 2009 when it purchased Olevia trademarks, licensing rights, and intellectual property from Syntax-Brillian Corporation. Olevia-brand TVs are a top 10 brand in US market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2011 Emerson's license agreement with
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   was terminated. The agreement had allowed the company to develop and market products that were compatible with
   <company id="12644">
    iPod
   </company>
   audio and video devices.
