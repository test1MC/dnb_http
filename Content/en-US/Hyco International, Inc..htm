   ) have in common? They both keep moving with a little help from Hyco International, a leading maker of hydraulic cylinders used by OEMs in construction, material handling, waste handing, and agricultural equipment. The company's customers, some of which are also competitors, also include

  <p>
   Hyco has identified a number of key strategies aimed at growth and increased profitability. The company wants to capture more business from existing customers, especially those with in-house hydraulic cylinder manufacturing capability.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time the company wants to increase sales to regional heavy equipment component distributors to gain more OEM customers as well as a strengthened presence in the hydraulic cylinder replacement market. Hyco is also keeping its eye out for acquisition opportunities -- including the hydraulic cylinder manufacturing operations of some OEMs.
