   When Shiloh Industries draws a blank, it's a good thing. The company produces stampings, modular assemblies, and steel and welded blanks for the automotive, heating and air-conditioning, and lawn and garden equipment industries. It also makes tools and assembly equipment for its own use and to sell to OEMs and other suppliers. Shiloh's largest customer is
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   , accounting for about 20% of sales. Other customers include
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   (15% of sales), and
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   , as well as home appliance manufacturers, construction companies, and steel producers. The company traces its roots back to 1950 when it was founded as Shiloh Tool &amp; Die Manufacturing.

   In the stamping process, steel is formed into three-dimensional parts as it passes through dies (patterns) in a stamping press. For the automotive and light and heavy truck markets, the stampings made by Shiloh Industries are used in heat shields, mufflers, seat frames, structural rails, and other structural body components. Shiloh also makes engineered welded blanks (two or more steel sheets welded together) and steel blanks (flat steel cut into two-dimensional shapes). The blanks are used primarily for exterior steel panels such as doors, frames, and hoods.

   The company operates 12 manufacturing plants in the US and one in Mexico. It also has sales and technical centers in Canton, Michigan and Valley City, Ohio; other offices are located in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

   The success of Shiloh Industries is linked to the success of North American auto manufacturers, who realized an overall industry production increase of 5% in 2013. Shiloh's revenues followed suit and shot up 20% in 2013 to $700 million. Profits also grew 60% to $21 million. Cash provided from operating activities grew to $38 million in 2013, primarily due to the increased revenue base.

   In 2014 subsidiary Shiloh Die Cast Midwest planned to inject new capital and expand its two facilities in Indiana to support increased demand from automakers for advanced lightweighting technologies. As a part of the expansion, it planned to invest about $8 million to renovate and add new equipment to two separate manufacturing sites in Indiana -- a 120,000 sq.-ft. plant in Auburn and a 106,000 sq.-ft. plant in Pierceton. The renovations are scheduled to be complete by 2016.

   In 2013 the company bought Contech Castings, a provider of high-pressure aluminum die cast parts. The prior year it bought Albany-Chicago Company, LLC, which makes fully machined and complex aluminum die cast components.

   In 2012 it also bought

        <p>
   Dominick Fanello founded the company in 1950 as Shiloh Tool &amp; Die Manufacturing; in 1954 Fanello became chairman and CEO. In the early 1960s the business expanded into blanking and stamping operations. Shiloh formed a joint venture in 1977 with MTD Products (power equipment) to develop additional steel-processing capabilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   Shiloh went public in 1993. Seeking to expand beyond northeastern Ohio, it formed a joint venture with Shiloh of Michigan and Rouge Steel in 1995 to produce engineered steel blanks in Romulus, Michigan. That year 32-year Shiloh veteran Robert Grissinger replaced Fanello as CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Shiloh expanded into the automotive tool and stamping business, buying Michigan-based Greenfield Die &amp; Manufacturing. Automakers began to outsource more products, and in 1997 Shiloh earmarked $60 million for improvements that included adding new equipment and expanding its welding capacity and warehouse space. It then formed a joint venture with Bing Steel to make steel blanks for cars. Also that year Shiloh bought Michigan steel processor C&amp;H Design.
  </p>
        <p>
   Fiscal 1998 brought a 23% dip in Shiloh's income, in part from the GM strike, increased tool and die competition, falling prices for engineered scrap steel, and the company's difficulty in assimilating acquisitions. Shiloh became more vertically integrated by buying the automotive unit of its majority stockholder, MTD Products (later MTD Holdings), in 1999. The company also built a plant in Mexico to serve GM operations there. That year former GM executive John Falcon became CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   Shiloh sold its Canton Tool &amp; Die, Valley City Steel, and Utica Tool &amp; Die subsidiaries in 2000 to concentrate on its automotive operations. The next year the company penned a joint product development agreement with Pullman Industries to offer larger and stronger assemblies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2002 Theodore Zampetis replaced Jack Falcon as CEO. That year Valley City Steel LLC, which was 49%-owned by Shiloh, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection through its controlling owner, Viking Steel, LLC. The following year Shiloh returned to profitability despite lower production in the North American automobile and light truck sectors.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was later charged with "constructive fraudulent conveyance" by the bankrupt estate of Valley City Steel, which was subsequently awarded almost $5 million in damages. The case, which was tried by the US District Court, was based on Valley City Steel's claim that Shiloh's part of the transaction -- to receive over $12 million plus 49% of Valley City Steel LLC -- had not left Valley City Steel enough capital to continue operations. The verdict does not mean that Shiloh intended to defraud, rather that the circumstances of the transaction were not fair. Shiloh appealed the verdict in 2007.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2012 Ramzi Y. Hermiz was introduced as the company's newest CEO.
