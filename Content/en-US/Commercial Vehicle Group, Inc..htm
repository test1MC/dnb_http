   CB radio lingo might have gone the way of mood rings, but Commercial Vehicle Group (CVG) is still a trucker's good buddy. The company makes components for the cabs of heavy-duty trucks that help keep drivers comfortable and safe. Products include static and suspension seat systems, interior trim (instrument panels, door panels, headliners), mirrors, wiper systems, and controls and switches. Its customers have included heavy-duty truck manufacturers such as
   <company id="41854">
    AB Volvo
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14354">
    PACCAR
   </company>
   . Besides truck manufacturers, CVG sells its products to the fleet maintenance aftermarket and makers of buses, military vehicles, and agricultural, mining, and construction equipment, among others.

    AB Volvo

   ,
   <company id="58357">

  <p>
   CVG's revenues have fluctuated over the years; after rising in 2014, revenues dipped by 2% to fall to $825 million in 2015. Its profits remained consistent from 2014 to 2015, hovering around the $7 million mark for both years. The company's operating cash flow absolutely skyrocketed by 481% from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to a massive reduction in the investment in working capital.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was driven by a 14% drop in global construction and agriculture sales. This was fueled by decreases in OEM construction, aftermarket, automotive, and other market revenues. In addition, revenues were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange translations.

  <p>
   The cyclical demand for heavy duty Class 8 trucks (along with CVG's products) is driven by the industrial sector and the overall health of the economy. (Looking ahead, North American Class 8 production levels are expected to increase from 248,000 in 2013, peak at 290,000 in 2015, decline to 270,000 in 2017, and increase to 285,000 in 2018.) CVG believes the demand for new Class 8 vehicles will be driven by several factors, including growth in freight volumes and the replacement of aging vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   CVG expects the market for products in Europe to grow moderately in 2016. Although it expects a continued contraction in Asia-Pacific in the short term, the region is also a key market in its organic growth strategy, with opportunities for the long term.
