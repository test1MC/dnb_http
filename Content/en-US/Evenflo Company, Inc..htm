   The infant and juvenile products marker in 2012 sold its worldwide feeding business to
   <company id="95079">
    Kimberly-Clark de México
   </company>
   . The divestiture did not include Evenflo's Ameda breast pump business, which it later sold later to Platinum Products Holding. Both deals have enabled Evenflo to focus exclusively on its portfolio of leading infant and travel gear brands: Evenflo, ExerSaucer, Snugli, and Gerry. Proceeds from the selloffs are funding its growth and innovation.

   To that end, Evenflo entered the stationary jumper category with the launch of ExerSaucer Jump &amp; Learn in 2012.

   The company announced in 2012 that all its car and booster seats sold in Canada were in compliance with Transport Canada's booster seat and restraint system regulations. A spate of recalls in its industry had Evenflo concerned about and tightening up its safety stance with a Safety Made Easier section on its website. The move was in response to recalls, such as its Evenflo Maestro Combination Booster Seat in 2010 and in recent years its Evenflo Majestic High Chairs, Evenflo Happy Camper play yard, and the Evenflo Envision high chair.
