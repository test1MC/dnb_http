   No bore, Boar's Head Provisions is more of an inspired ham. Under the Boar's Head brand name, the company makes specialty meats, cheeses, and condiments and markets them to restaurants, grocers, and delis across the US. Its products, many of which are certified by the
   <company id="126875">
    American Heart Association
   </company>
   , are distributed through a network of refrigerated trucks owned by sister business Frank Brunckhorst Co. Boar's Head operates in Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. Launched in 1905, company founder Frank Brunckhorst first peddled cooked hams (made by other companies) by horse-drawn wagon to family-owned grocers and delicatessens in New York. Boar's Head is owned and led by his descendants.
