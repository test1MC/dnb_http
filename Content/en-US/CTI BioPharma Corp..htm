   CTI Biopharma (formerly Cell Therapeutics) is a toxic avenger. The firm creates more effective and less toxic treatments for various forms of cancer. CTI is developing a number of cancer-fighting compounds, including Pixuvri (pixantrone), a treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumorous cancers, and Opaxio (paclitaxel poliglumex) for ovarian and brain cancers. CTI also focuses on research and development projects including a Phase 3 clinical trial of Pacritinib, a myelofibrosis treatment. The company's Systems Medicine subsidiary is working on a potential sarcoma-fighter called brostallicin. Other subsidiaries include Aequus Biopharma, and CTI Life Sciences.

  <p>
   The company's primary candidates are Pixuvri and Pacritinib (for which it has a collaboration with
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   ). An earlier stage candidate, tosedostat, is an oral aminopeptidase inhibitor that has shown results in patients with acute myeloid leukemia; it is in Phase 2 trials.

   Headquartered in Seattle, CTI Biopharma has offices in London and Milan. The company has a commercial presence in Europe: Pixuvri is available in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.

   After an absence of revenue in 2012, revenues rose in 2013 and 2014. In the latter year, revenue spiked 73% to $60 million on a 64% increase in licensing and contract revenue due to a $20 million milestone payment from Baxter.
  </p>
  <p>
   CTI Biopharma has incurred net losses since its inception and it expects to generate losses for the next few years as it focuses on R&amp;D costs for Pixuvri, Pacritinib, Opaxio, and tosedostat. Net loss more than doubled to $93 million in 2014 on expenses related to the late-stage Pacritinib program, trials for Pixuvri, and the acquisition of certain assets of Chroma late that year. Foreign exchange rates also impacted earnings. At the end of 2014, the company had accumulated debt of $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, operating cash outflow increased to approximately $39 million.

   The company is primarily focused on commercializing Pixuvri (used on the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) in the European Union, and conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of Pacritinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis. It also intends to evaluate additional collaborations to accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of its candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   CTI Biopharma bolstered its efforts in the field of blood-related cancers and disorders in 2012 by securing worldwide rights to Pacritinib from drug developer S*BIO in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $30 million, plus potential future milestone and royalty payments. Pacritinib is an oral kinase inhibitor (a compound that works to block certain disease-causing enzymes) that has orphan drug (fast-track development) designations in the US and Europe for bone marrow disease myelofibrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Chroma Therapeutics terminated its co-development and license agreement related to the tosedostat compound. CTI Biopharma acquired all of Chroma's right, title, and interest in tosedostat and related assets. In addition to saving future milestone payments to Chroma, the deal gave CTI Biopharma an exclusive worldwide license for tosedostat from

   -approved Zevalin, a radioimmunotherapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, through RIT Oncology, a joint venture with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. However, it sold its interest in RIT Oncology to Spectrum for $18 million in 2009; the sale allowed CTI to focus on gaining FDA approval for its key development candidates.
