   Westell Technologies knows the value of the great outdoors for communication service providers. The company makes outside plant equipment used by telecommunications providers for digital transmission, remote monitoring, power distribution and other functions that link customer locations with central office facilities. Its products include outdoor passively cooled equipment enclosures, mountings, and fuse panels. The company also provides services such as design, assembly, and testing. It generates most of its sales from major US telecommunications service providers.

  <p>
   Westell is organized into three segments. Its largest, Westell, includes indoor and outdoor cabinets, enclosures, and mountings; power distribution products; copper/fiber connectivity panels; managed Ethernet switches for utility and industrial networks; and a host of other cell site optimization and outside plant network products. The Kentrox segment designs and markets intelligent site management products and services, which provide management and control of generators, environmental systems, antenna systems, and other devices. CSI, which accounts for less than 5% of revenue, makes and sells products that enable wireless connectivity for cellular and public safety coverage.

  <p>
   Westell generates about 90% of its sales from the US; the rest comes from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and in Latin America.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 (ended March), Westell reported $102 million in revenue, up some 160% from the prior year and its highest revenue total since 2011 when it began selling some of its primary subsidiaries. The growth is a result of new acquisitions, primarily Kentrox and to a lesser degree CSI, although the company saw strength in its traditional Westell segment as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was $5 million in 2014, up from a loss of $44 million in 2013 when Westell was hit with an income tax expense of nearly $30 million. The positive change in net income also resulted in net cash provided by operations of about $1.5 million compared to net cashed used in operations of $12 million the prior year.

  <p>
   In 2011 Westell sold most of its customer networking assets to
   <company id="102262">
    NETGEAR
   </company>
   for about $34 million in cash. The sale included the unit's high-speed Internet networking products, used by telephone companies to enable voice, data, video, and other streaming over existing copper and fiber-optic lines. After the sale to NETGEAR, the company sold its ConferencePlus subsidiary to audio and Web conferencing services provider Arkadin.

  <p>
   Westell acquired Ohio-based Kentrox in April 2013 and New Hampshire-based Cellular Specialties, Inc. (CSI) in March 2014. The two purchases, which together cost about $70 million, fit Westell's strategy using acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies to create a comprehensive portfolio of offerings.
