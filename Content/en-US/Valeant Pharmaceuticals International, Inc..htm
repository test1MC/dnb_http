   Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (formerly Biovail) is Canada's largest publicly traded drugmaker. The multinational specialty pharmaceutical company specializes in developing, manufacturing, and marketing neurological and dermatological treatments, with a portfolio of branded prescription, branded generic, and OTC products. Products in its dermatology segment include genital herpes treatment Zovirax and acne treatment Acanya, while products in its neurology segment include antidepressant Wellbutrin XL. Valeant acquired
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch + Lomb
   </company>
   in 2013 to establish a strong presence in ophthalmology as well.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to the core areas of central nervous system, dermatology, and ophthalmology, Valeant has prescription offerings for cardiovascular and metabolic ailments. Valeant also has a handful of off-patent branded drugs, which it continues to sell but does not actively promote. These drugs include Cardizem CD (a controlled-release version of Cardizem), anxiety drug Ativan, and hypertension medication Vasotec. In addition to branded drugs, Valeant makes generic formulations, some of them generic versions of its own brands (one strategy for lessening the impact when those drugs go off-patent).
  </p>
  <p>
   Its acquisition of Bausch + Lomb significantly enhanced the company's eye care and ophthalmic offerings to include contact lenses, lens care solutions, vitamins and drops, and surgical equipment.

  <p>
   With manufacturing sites in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Poland, product sales are made around the world. The US market (including Puerto Rico) accounts for more than 55% of Valeant's annual revenues. The company has significant specialty and OTC medicine offerings in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as a growing presence selling branded, generic, and OTC offerings in portions of Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Africa.

  <p>
   Valeant sells its products through direct sales representatives in the US and Canada, as well as through marketing partnerships and distributors in the US and international markets. For instance, Valeant sells top-selling neurology drug Wellbutrin XL in the US, while
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   sells the product in international markets. Customers include wholesale drug distributors, hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies. Valeant's marketing programs often include direct mailings, trade magazine ads, and event exhibits and sponsorships.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Valeant's strategy is to acquire, develop, and commercialize new products through partnerships especially in the areas of neurology and dermatology. Neurological products under development include medications for depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and pain, as well as an epilepsy drug being researched through a partnership with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   . The company is looking to broaden its lineup especially as some of its older offerings, such as Wellbutrin XL (an extended-release version of
   <company id="41781">
    GSK
   </company>
   's antidepressant Wellbutrin) and Ultram ER (a long-acting version of
   <company id="10824">
    J&amp;J's
   </company>
   chronic pain drug Ultram), face increasing levels of generic competition as their patents expire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valeant has made about 50 acquisitions of companies and assets since 2008. Its acquisition footprint is diverse, with several purchases in the US, Canada, Brazil, Russia, and Australia. The company tends to mix larger acquisitions with smaller ones in order to beef up its portfolio of treatments for central nervous system and skin diseases. However, the company has come under fire for buying companies and then hiking the prices of its newly acquired drugs. Valeant is the subject of investigations by a number of agencies including the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing criticism over its pricing practices and laden with some $31 billion in debt, the company has been trying to get back into the public's (and investors') good graces. In mid-2016 it announced plans to reorganize as well as a renewed focus on improving patients' lives; it will break into three primary business segments centered around its Bausch &amp; Lomb operations, branded products, and other products such as its Obagi skin care treatments. Other recent moves include naming a new CEO and selling non-core assets including commercialization rights to angiodema drug Ruconest. In early 2017 the company agreed to sell skincare brands CeraVe, acneFree, and AMBI to
   <company id="41772">
    L'Or√©al
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion; it also announced the sale of its Dendreon cancer business (acquired in 2015 for $300 million) to Sanpower Group for $819.9 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In terms of larger acquisitions, Valeant completed an $8.7 billion deal ($4.5 billion in cash and $4.2 billion in debt) to acquire
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch + Lomb
   </company>
   in 2013. The deal gives Valeant a leading position in the ophthalmology market and boosts its operations in the medical device industry. Valeant aims to leverage the brand in emerging markets; its existing eye care products and pharmaceuticals are being merged into the Bausch + Lomb division following the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company significantly strengthened its position in dermatology when it acquired US-based
   <company id="15556">
    Medicis Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   for $2.6 billion in December 2012. The Medicis deal gives Valeant a formidable lineup of acne, aesthetic injectable, and antiviral products, and it builds upon prior acquisitions of Dermik and Ortho in 2011 to cement Valeant's position as a leader in US dermatology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valeant's aggressive acquisition strategy has brought some failures along with successes, including a $5.7 billion attempt to acquire fellow neurological drugmaker
   <company id="14307">
    Cephalon
   </company>
   in 2011 and two unsolicited offers ($314 million and $360 million) for ophthalmic therapies maker
   <company id="100609">
    ISTA Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   One of Valeant's largest transactions occurred in 2010 when the company, then named Biovail, acquired the former
   <company id="10763">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   entity for some $3.3 billion. The combined entity took on the current Valeant name.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, in 2015 Valeant completed its largest-yet deal when it bought US-based gastrointestinal specialist
   <company id="102759">
    Salix
   </company>
   in a $10.1 billion transaction. The acquisition combines Salix's franchise with Valeant's growing portfolio of specialty treatments and is expected to yield more than $500 million in cost savings annually. Later that year, the company struck a deal to acquire Sprout Pharmaceuticals for $1 billion. The deal was announced just a couple of days after Sprout was granted
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for the first-ever women's libido drug Addyi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Valeant bought microsurgical equipment maker
   <company id="46351">
    Synergetics USA
   </company>
   in a move to grow its Bausch + Lomb operations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2010 the company, then named Biovail Corporation, acquired the former
   <company id="10763">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $3.3 billion and took on the Valeant name. The purchase widened its neurological offerings, as well as its dermatology and over-the-counter (OTC) lines and its international distribution network. Both companies were already undergoing restructuring efforts to focus on core offerings, and the new Valeant further cut operational expenses through post-merger integration efforts, including a 25% reduction of the combined workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valeant and Biovail combined operations in a reverse-merger transaction that aimed to enhance shareholder value and widen product offerings. Valeant had historically been focused on developing improved versions of existing drugs using its oral drug-delivery technologies; however, due to increased competition in the drug-delivery technologies marketplace, the company began shifting its focus to proprietary CNS therapies. Both Ultram ER and Cardizem LA (a long-acting version of Sanofi's blood pressure therapy Cardizem) started facing competition from generic versions in 2009 and 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The combined company retained the Biovail headquarters in Canada, as well as the Biovail corporate structure, but Michael Pearson, CEO of the old Valeant, took the reins of the new Valeant (replacing former Biovail CEO Bill Wells).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to meeting growth targets, the company's name change to Valeant following the merger could also signify a desire to disassociate itself with some past troubles associated with the Biovail name. While operating as Biovail, the company and some of its former executives were charged with accounting fraud in 2008 by the SEC, which claimed that the company misled investors over earnings and losses. The company paid a fine to settle the SEC charges; it also paid fines to settle similar allegations from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), a Canadian regulatory body, in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Biovail founder Eugene Melnyk was one of the charged executives who left the company during the investigations. After the company began restructuring efforts to focus on CNS operations, Melnyk (who was then the company's largest shareholder with about 18% of stock) fought against the new plan and waged an unsuccessful proxy fight aimed at returning the company to its original focus on difficult-to-manufacture generics and brand extensions. In 2010 Melnyk gave up his fight and sold off his holdings in the company he had founded.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valeant (then named Biovail) bought the US marketing rights for top selling neurology drug Wellbutrin XL back from GSK in 2009, reversing its previous strategy of solely relying on partnerships to sell its drugs in the US. (GSK continued to handle international marketing of the drug.) The $510 million asset purchase fed the company's strategy of focusing on CNS therapies, and the firm hoped that off-patent sales of Wellbutrin XL would generate significant cash to support its R&amp;D programs. The deal also gave Valeant the right to produce an authorized generic version of Wellbutrin XL. The company also launched its new depression therapy, Aplenzin, through a marketing arrangement with French drugmaker
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2009 Valeant acquired the worldwide rights to the entire portfolio of tetrabenazine products (including international Xenazine rights) from
   <company id="134652">
    Cambridge Laboratories
   </company>
   for $230 million. It also gained several early stage CNS drug development programs through the deal, including a tetrabenazine program for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. The company netted more CNS drugs in 2010 with the purchase of certain compounds from
   <company id="45418">
    Cortex Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Valeant sold its noncore contract research division to Lambda Therapeutic Research for $6 million.
