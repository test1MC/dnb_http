   While many of its aluminum products may be lightweight, Arconic (formerly Alcoa Inc.) is anything but. Its products include industrial gas turbine, oil and gas equipment, aerospace and automotive components, and sheet aluminum for beverage cans. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. In 2016 Alcoa Inc. separated into two public companies, Arconic (a value-added company making high-end aluminum products) and an upstream company -- Alcoa Corp., one of the world's top producers of alumina (aluminum's principal ingredient from bauxite) and aluminum.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Before the 2016 breakup, Alcoa Inc. was a global company operating in 30 countries, doing more than half of its business in the US; Australia, and Spain made up its largest international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had operations in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, China, France, Germany, Greenland, Guinea, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Suriname, Switzerland, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, the US, and Vietnam.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Before the spinoff, Alcoa Inc. had five reportable segments: Alumina, Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products, Primary Metals, and Transportation and Construction Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alcoa's upstream refinery system included the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. More than half of Alcoa's alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered Products and Solutions (Alcoa's downstream operations) produces titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; forgings and fasteners; aluminum wheels; seamless rolled rings; and nickel alloys. These products are used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, and power generation markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Primary Metals produced primary aluminum used by Alcoa's fabricating businesses and sold to external customers, aluminum traders, and commodity markets. This segment included aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power, and aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Global Rolled Products (Alcoa's midstream operations) produced and sold aluminum plate and sheet. It also produced foil at one plant in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transportation and Construction Solutions (Alcoa's downstream operations) produced integrated aluminum structural systems, architectural extrusions, and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels used in nonresidential building and construction and commercial transportation end markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aluminum (primary and fabricated) and alumina accounted for 80% of Alcoa's 2015 revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Alumina is mainly sold directly to smelter customers or industrial chemical producers. Some third-party sales are done though agents, alumina traders, and distributors. The company sells Engineered Products and Solutions products directly to customers and through distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transportation and Construction Solutions' hard alloy extrusions products (for aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and industrial products markets) are also sold directly to customers and through distributors as well as by agents and alumina traders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Primary Metals segment manages aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment's third-party sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Global Rolled Products produces rigid container sheet, which is sold to the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. It also makes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, and building and construction markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Alcoa Inc.'s net revenues decreased by 6% due to the absence of sales related to capacity that was closed in midstream and upstream operations, lower average realized price for aluminum in both the upstream and midstream operations and for alumina in the upstream operations, and lower energy sales as a result of a drop in pricing and unfavorable foreign currency movements.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company reported a net loss of $322 million (compared to net income of $268 million in 2014) mainly due to lower net revenues, an increase in provision for income taxes (due to a higher amount of discrete income tax charges and  nondeductible items), and the presence of impairment of goodwill, related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 operating cash flow decreased by 5%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As prices for alumina and aluminum continue to be low, Alcoa Inc. was trying to soften the blow of declining prices by growing its downstream and engineering businesses. For example, it developed a new, higher-strength wheel alloy (MagnaForce) for next generation wheels, and has launched a more corrosion-resistant, environmentally friendly Dura-Bright EVO surface treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was focusing on the aerospace industry and on its Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) division, which makes aerospace components. Specific objectives of Alcoa Inc. for long-term investment strategy included reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities and achieving risk factor diversification across the balance of the asset portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alcoa Inc. has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company separated into two independent, publicly traded companies. One (Alcoa Corp.) comprises the Alumina and Primary Metals segments and the other company (Arconic) is made up of the Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   To pay down debt, in 2017 Arconic sold 23.4 million of the Alcoa shares it received when the companies split up (or about 60% of its total stake) for $890 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2016 the company agreed to sell its 20% stake in the operator of an Australian natural gas pipeline for about $154 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company sold assets in Russia, including a rolling mill located in Belaya Kalitva (to a wholly owned subsidiary of Stupino Titanium) for $30 million. That year it moved Wheel and Transportation Products and Building and Construction businesses to form a new Transportation and Construction Solutions group.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet growing demand in both the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets, the company has initiated expansion projects. In 2014 Alcoa completed a $300 million expansion at its Davenport, Iowa, facility dedicated to supplying aluminum sheet products to the automotive industry. It also opened the world's largest aluminum-lithium plant in Lafayette, Indiana, where it produces advanced, third-generation aluminum-lithium alloys for the aerospace industry. (Aircraft makers are increasingly turning to lighter and stronger aluminum-lithium alloys, which are less expensive than titanium and composites).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Alcoa opened its expanded wheel-manufacturing plant in Hungary to enable Alcoa to meet growing European demand for its lightweight, durable, low-maintenance aluminum truck wheels.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the divestiture side of the ledger, in 2014 the company announced it will permanently close the remaining two potlines at its Massena East smelter in New York and permanently close its Point Henry aluminum smelter and two rolling mills in Australia as well as its Portovesme primary aluminum smelter, both due to high costs. That year it also sold its aluminum rod plant in Bécancour, Quebec; its 50.3% ownership stake in the Mt. Holly smelter located in Goose Creek, South Carolina; and three rolling mills located in Spain (Alicante and Amorebieta) and France (Castelsarrasin) to a subsidiary of Atlas Holdings LLC. To save costs, in 2014 Alcoa also sold its ownership stake in the Jamalco bauxite mining and alumina refining joint venture in Jamaica.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To expand Alcoa Inc.'s range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials (primarily related to the aerospace end market), in 2015 the company acquired
   <company id="11662">
    RTI International Metals
   </company>
   , a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace, defense, energy, and medical device markets, in a $870 million deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also bought Germany-based aluminum and titanium castings maker TITAL (which has $100 million in annual sales) for $204 million. This acquisition expands Alcoa's existing aluminum-casting capacity and increases its capacity for advanced jet engine components made of titanium, while establishing its titanium-casting capabilities in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major expansion of its downstream manufacturing activities, in 2014 Alcoa acquired UK-based aerospace-component maker
   <company id="159516">
    Firth Rixson
   </company>
   for $2.85 billion. This acquisition strengthens Alcoa's robust aerospace portfolio and positions the company to capture greater profitable growth from its expanding value-add business. The transaction doubles Alcoa's average revenue content on high-growth engine programs. Accelerating Alcoa's transformation to a multimaterial enterprise, the acquisition increases its offerings made of nickel-based superalloys, titanium, stainless steel, and advanced aluminum alloys, produced using the most advanced isothermal forging technology and ring production capabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1886 two chemists, one in France and one in the US, simultaneously discovered an inexpensive process for aluminum production. The American, Charles Hall, pursued commercial applications. Two years later, with an investor group led by Captain Alfred Hunt, Hall formed the Pittsburgh Reduction Company. Its first salesman, Arthur Davis, secured an initial order for 2,000 cooking pots.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1889 the Mellon Bank loaned the company $4,000. In 1891 the firm recapitalized with the Mellon family holding 12% of the stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Davis led the business after Hunt died in 1899 and stayed on until 1957 (he died in 1962 at age 95). The company introduced aluminum foil (1910) and found applications for aluminum in new products such as airplanes and cars. It became the Aluminum Company of America in 1907.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of WWI, Alcoa had integrated backward into bauxite mining and forward into end-use production. By the 1920s the Mellons had raised their stake to 33%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The government and Alcoa had debated antitrust issues in court for years since the smelting patent expired in 1912. Finally, a 1946 federal ruling forced the company to sell many operations built during WWII, as well as its Canadian subsidiary (Alcan).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the competitive aluminum industry of the 1960s, Alcoa's lower-cost production helped it seize market share, especially in beverage cans. In the 1970s Alcoa began offering engineered products such as aerospace components, and in the 1980s it invested in research, acquisitions, and plant modernization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul O'Neill (former president of
   <company id="10800">
    International Paper
   </company>
   ) arrived as CEO in 1987 and shifted the company's focus back to aluminum. Sales and earnings set records the next two years but plunged afterward, reflecting a weak global economy and record-low aluminum prices. Then the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to a worldwide glut as Russian exports soared.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Alcoa cut its production as part of a two-year accord with Western and Russian producers. That year the company agreed to pool its alumina and chemical operations with Australia's Western Mining Corp.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alcoa formed a joint venture with Shanghai Aluminum Fabrication Plant in China. The company expanded in Europe in 1996, acquiring Italy's state-run aluminum business, followed by the purchase of Inespal, Spain's state-run aluminum operations, in 1998. Alcoa also bought #3 US aluminum producer
   <l1>
    Alumax
   </l1>
   for $3.8 billion in 1998, but only after divesting its cast-plate operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Known by the nickname "Alcoa" since the late 1920s, the company adopted that as its official name in 1999. O'Neill retired as CEO in 1999; COO Alain Belda succeeded him. Later that year Alcoa bought the 50% of aluminum auto parts maker A-CMI that it did not already own from
   <company id="10384">
    Hayes Lemmerz International
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Alcoa bought aluminum extrusion maker Excel Extrusions from Noranda (now called
   <company id="54118">
    Falconbridge
   </company>
   ) and paid $4.5 billion for
   <l2>
    Reynolds Metals
   </l2>
   after agreeing to divest some assets -- including all of Reynolds' alumina refineries -- to satisfy regulators. The same month Alcoa acquired Cordant Technologies. Alcoa also assumed Cordant's 85% ownership of Howmet International (castings) as a result of the transaction -- and later acquired the remainder of Howmet. Late in 2000 President-elect George W. Bush named Alcoa's chairman Paul O'Neill to be treasury secretary. (O'Neill subsequently resigned the post in December 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Alcoa sold its majority stake in the Worsley alumina refinery (Australia) to
   <company id="41757">
    BHP Billiton
   </company>
   in 2001 for about $1.5 billion as part of its refinery divestments. Treasury Secretary O'Neill completed the sale of his more than $90 million worth of Alcoa stock and options in June. In late November Alcoa and BHP Billiton combined their North American metals distribution businesses to create
   <company id="104163">
    Integris Metals
   </company>
   -- a joint venture with revenues of about $1.5 billion. (The two subsequently sold the JV to
   <company id="10786">
    Ryerson
   </company>
   in 2005.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Alcoa and Russia's
   <company id="61816">
    VSMPO-AVISMA
   </company>
   , the world′s largest manufacturer of titanium ingots and forged products, agreed to join forces to meet growing demand for high-end titanium and aluminum products for aircraft manufacturers worldwide. The joint venture combines Alcoa's expertise in manufacturing value-add products with VSMPO-AVISMA's leadership in titanium production to manufacture high-end aerospace goods, such as landing gear and forged wing components, at Alcoa's plant in Samara.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Alcoa completed the expansion of aluminum lithium capacity at its Kitts Green facility in the UK to serve the growing demand for the company's 3rd-generation aluminum lithium alloys. Alcoa projects its aluminum lithium revenues will quadruple by 2020 to nearly $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company also announced a second major North American expansion to meet the growing demand for light, durable and recyclable aluminum sheet for automotive production.
