   Follow the bouncing balls -- all the way to Finland. That's where Amer Sports makes sporting goods equipment, including balls for tennis, golf, and team sports under the
   <company id="111429">
    Wilson
   </company>
   brand. It also makes skiing and snowboarding gear and apparel (Atomic, Dynamic, Salomon), footwear, and fitness gear. In addition, the company produces wrist-top computers, compasses, diving instruments, and Precor brand home and commercial fitness equipment through its various subsidiaries. Formerly Finland's largest cigarette maker, the company sold its tobacco operations in 2004 to focus on fitness and sports equipment.

   Four Finnish technical and commercial organizations formed Amer-Tupakka Oy (Amer Tobacco) in 1950 to manufacture and market tobacco products. The four groups hoped to use the firm's profits to fund commercial and technical education and research in Finland. The company then introduced the first American-blend cigarette, called Boston. In 1961 Amer signed a deal with Philip Morris to manufacture and sell Philip Morris-brand cigarettes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tobacco profits fueled the company's diversification. During the 1960s the company entered the shipping business by purchasing three ships. (It began divesting the shipping business in the 1970s; the last ship was sold in 1981.) In 1971 Amer acquired Weilin+Goos, one of Finland's largest publishers of textbooks and encyclopedias. The company's name was changed in 1973 to Amer to reflect its expanding interests. Its first foray into sporting goods came in 1974 with its acquisition of Koho-Tuote Oy, a maker of Koho hockey sticks and gear. (Its ice hockey business was sold in 1986.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Amer Sports Corporation (then Amer Group) went public in 1977 on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984. That year the company acquired a majority stake in Korpivaara, Finland's oldest and largest automobile importer, primarily of Toyotas, Citroens, and Suzuki's. It added Finnish textile firm Marimekko in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 Amer established a sports division and purchased 80% of Jack Nicklaus' MacGregor Golf Company. Three years later it bought Wilson Sporting Goods for $200 million. Originally a division of a meat-packing firm and a producer of strings for tennis rackets and violins, Thomas Wilson spun off his namesake firm in 1916 and expanded into other sporting goods, including baseball gloves.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the 1990s unfolded, Amer's identity as a major manufacturer of sporting goods emerged. In late 1994 the company acquired Atomic, a maker of winter sports equipment, primarily alpine and cross-country skis, but also in-line skates and snowboards under the Oxygen name. Meanwhile, Amer divested its nonsports-related businesses: Marimekko in 1991, its paper division by 1994, Weilin+Goos in 1995, and the car importing businesses by 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   A dual-phase restructuring plan during 1997 and 1998 focused on introducing innovative products and streamlining operations. The underperforming MacGregor golf business was divested in late 1997. By 1999 all Amer divisions were showing a profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suunto, a maker of diving instruments, was acquired late in 1999. In 2000 Amer bought baseball and softball bat maker DeMarini and folded it into Wilson. In 2001 the company sold its telecommunications unit, Teletekno Oy, to Amer's management. The company retained a 19% share in the unit.

   In 2002 Amer bought US fitness equipment maker Precor from

   In October 2003 the company announced that its Wilson Sporting Goods subsidiary would close two golf manufacturing facilities in Tennessee by early 2004. In December, Atomic (the winter sports division of Amer) purchased bike maker

   's Volant ski business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2004 the company's Precor subsidiary purchased Fitness Products International (FPI), maker of Icarian strength training equipment for home and professional use. Soon after, Precor also acquired the content and technology divisions of ClubCom (a provider of private television network systems to health clubs) including its Cardio Theater division (fitness facility audio and video systems). The purchases have strengthened Precor's position as a full-line health club equipment supplier. The company had about 75% of Finland's tobacco market before it exited its tobacco business in 2004 to focus on sporting goods. Amer Sports sold the remaining Amer Tobacco factory property and company housing in Finland. Amer's licensing agreement with

    Philip Morris

   did not expire until 2005, but the company negotiated a deal where Philip Morris took over the Amer Tobacco trademarks along with certain equipment and inventory in March 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name from Amer Group to Amer Sports Corporation in early 2005 to reflect its strong sports equipment brand portfolio. In October the company acquired Salomon's business and brands from what was then
   <company id="92632">
    adidas-Salomon AG
   </company>
   . The acquisition increased Amer Sports' net sales by nearly a third.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired the assets of its Bulgarian ski supplier, Pamporovo Ski, which became part of Amer's Sport's new Bulgaria AOOD unit. The purchase was to help it control its ski-manufacturing costs.
