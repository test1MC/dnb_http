   Millennium Pharmaceuticals wants to be
   <i>
    the
   </i>
   drug company for the new millennium. Operating as Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company, it's a subsidiary of Japan's
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   . The company's cancer drug Velcade is approved as a treatment for multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) and mantle cell lymphoma (or MCL, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Millennium boasts more than a dozen other drug candidates in the pipeline, most of them cancer-related. Its oncology-focused sales force, in partnership with
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , markets the drug, with Millennium handling sales in the US and various J&amp;J subsidiaries handling sales in Europe and most other countries where Velcade is approved.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Takeda acquired Millennium Pharmaceuticals for $8.8 billion to gain access to Velcade and the company's pipeline of other, potentially lucrative oncology candidates. Soon after, the Japanese parent transferred all of its existing oncology research work to Millennium and rebranded the subsidiary as Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company. Since the 2008 deal, Millennium continues to operate as a stand-alone business unit and oversees Takeda's Japanese laboratories that focus on cancer research.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Millennium's reach extends to more than 90 countries, including the US, the European Union, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, through its primary product Velcade.
  </p>

  <p>
   Velcade earns annual sales of some Â¥95.1 billion. Hoping to add to its list of marketable products, Millennium is developing a pipeline of investigational small-molecule and biotechnology candidates to fight cancer cell and tumor growth. The company has proprietary programs in the field of protein homeostasis, through which healthy cells are protected from cancer-spreading agents. Certain programs inherited from Takeda seek to regulate hormones related to prostate cancer. The company has also partnered with
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   on a tumor-fighting candidate and
   <company id="105085">
    Sunesis Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to develop that company's oral selective pan-Raf kinase inhibitor through a 2011 licensing agreement. It entered a cancer research agreement with Presage Biosciences in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Millennium boasts a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="102726">
    Seattle Genetics
   </company>
   to produce antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which carry cancer drugs and target only cancer cells thereby avoiding the sickness associated with traditional chemotherapy. The companies teamed up again in 2012 with
   <company id="51340">
    Ventana Medical Systems
   </company>
   for that company to develop, make, and commercialize a molecular companion diagnostic test to identify lymphoma patients with the potential to respond to treatment with Seattle Genetics' Adcetris antibody.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Takeda received regulatory approval in the US and Europe for MLN0002, to be used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; it's undergoing Phase III clinical trials in Japan.
  </p>

  <p>
   More than 15 drug candidates are in Millennium's pipeline. They include Velcade (co-developed by Takeda and Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development), Adcertris (co-developed by Takeda and Seattle Genetics), and Leuplin, Orteronel, and Alisertib.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's late-stage inflammation candidate, vedolizumab, is a monoclonal antibody in late stage trials for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Additional inflammation programs have been transferred to other Takeda divisions, and vedolizumab will also be moved to Takeda for commercialization upon receiving marketing approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Mepact is approved in the European Union, as well as in Switzerland, Mexico, Israel, South Korea, Venezuela, Libya, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Australia, and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   To streamline their businesses, Millennium and Takeda in 2013 integrated their research and development organizations.

  <p>
   Millennium and J&amp;J partner to market Velcade. Millennium handles US sales. J&amp;J subsidiaries handle sales in Europe and most other countries where Velcade is approved.
  </p>
  <p>
   While most international marketing is handled by J&amp;J, in 2010 parent company Takeda Pharmaceutical entered a co-promotion agreement with J&amp;J subsidiary Janssen to market Velcade in the Japanese market.

  <p>
   Velcade was first approved for certain types of multiple myeloma in 2003. The drug won US approval in 2006 as a treatment for MCL patients. In 2008 it was extended to patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma.
