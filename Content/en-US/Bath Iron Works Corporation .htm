   Rub-a-dub-dub, Bath Iron Works builds some really high-tech tubs. The company, which is part of the Marine Systems group of parent company
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   , constructs surface ships for the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   . BIW is the lead designer and builder for the Arleigh Burke class AEGIS guided-missile destroyer, and is building the next-generation Zumwalt class DDG-1000 land attack destroyer and the LPD-17 amphibious assault ship. BIW's Surface Ship Support Center offers design and engineering, upgrades, logistics, manpower management, fleet services, and other support services. Among the largest private-sector employers in the state of Maine, BIW built its first ship for the US Navy, the gunboat
   <em>
    USS Machias
   </em>
   , in the 1890s.

   BIW has offices and facilities throughout the US. Its parent company General Dynamics generated more than 80% of its revenue from the US in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   In addition to the US Navy, the company also builds ships for the US Military Sealift Command and commercial customers as well. The US federal government accounted for more than 65% of General Dynamics' total revenue in fiscal 2012. Commercial customers in the US and international commercial customers accounted for the remainder of revenue.

  <p>
   To supplement its traditional work of building large destroyers, the company has been constructing

   cutters and smaller Navy ships. The Arleigh Burke class AEGIS battleship still continues as BIW's bread and butter.

  <p>
   The company's revenue decreased by about 1% in fiscal 2012 compared to the previous fiscal period, driven mainly by changes in its product offerings.
