        <p>
   The company's strategies for growth include expanding its offerings in Australia and New Zealand, where construction activities are expected to increase. Formica has discontinued less-popular products while offering innovations such as its 180fx granite slab-look countertops. It is also looking to become a greener business through environmentally conscious management of raw materials, waste, and energy.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Formica introduced Formica Envision, available in both standard grade laminate and compact structural laminate. This new line provides the architectural and design community with a durable and affordable 'blank canvas' on which to replicate artwork, photography and graphics.
  </p>
        <p>
   Formica has a partnership with leading suppliers, including North American edgebanding (used to cover the exposed sides of materials to give the appearance of a solid piece) providers, including

   and Dollken-Woodtape.

        <p>
   Formica emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004 after spending two years reorganizing and restructuring. Private equity firms

    Cerberus Capital Management
   </company>
   and
   <company id="104234">
    Oaktree Capital Management
   </company>
   sold Formica to Fletcher in 2007 for $700 million. Fletcher reported losses the following year -- largely due to Formica's performance -- a year that took its toll on construction and materials firms around the world. Formica is rebounding as demand improves, especially for its residential product lines.

        <p>
   Formica was founded in 1913 by engineers Daniel O'Conor and Herbert Faber. O'Conor's original patent was for a laminated material designed to serve the emerging electrical insulation industry. The mineral mica was commonly used at the time for electrical insulation; since the new invention worked as a substitute "for mica", the name Formica was born.
