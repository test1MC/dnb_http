   New product ideas can materialize before your very eyes, thanks to Stratasys. The company produces a range of 3D printers, materials, and production systems that are used by manufacturers to create models and prototypes as part of the new product design process. They are also used for production of finished goods in low-volume manufacturing. Stratasys additionally offers services, such as producing manufacturing tools for aerospace/defense applications and on-demand prototyping of production-grade parts. The current incarnation of Stratasys Ltd. formed in 2012 by the merger of 3D printing companies

   and Objet. The company maintains dual headquarters in Minneapolis and Rehovot, Israel.

   Stratasys generates 72% of revenue from its products and the rest from services. Besides printers, products include the consumable materials used to make objects. The company's subsidiaries include MakerBot and SolidScape. MakerBot makes several models of desktop 3D printers for various markets. SolidScape makes non-toxic thermoplastic modeling materials.
