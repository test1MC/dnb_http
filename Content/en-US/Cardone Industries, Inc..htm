   Old car parts are the new cool, thanks to Cardone Industries. The company is one of the largest remanufacturers of auto parts for the aftermarket. Cardone offers seven lines under the A1 Cardone brand: brakes (master cylinders), drivetrain parts (constant-velocity axles), electronics (ignition distributors, mass air flow sensors), fuel/air systems (intake manifolds), motors (window-lift and wiper), pumps (water and vacuum), and steering (power-steering pumps). New parts are also sold under the Cardone Select name. Cardone's eco-friendly benefits include material and energy conservation as well as landfill reduction.

   Cardone grows by adding to its product portfolio and launching new products to attract new customers. Throughout 2014 and 2015, it introduced several new products to its lineup of automotive replacement parts and remanufactured brake calipers. These included EGR valves, oil rail repair kits, removal tools, camshaft position sensors, and electronic parking brake calipers. In 2015 Cardone also launched its CARDONE Ultra Premium Calipers brand, which features an exclusive, silver coating to protect against rust and corrosion.
