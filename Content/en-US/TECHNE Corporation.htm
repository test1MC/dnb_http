   Bio-Techne (formerly TECHNE Corporation) is a biotechnology research specialist. Through subsidiaries including
   <company id="124294">
    Research and Diagnostic Systems
   </company>
   (R&amp;D Systems), Boston Biochem, BiosPacific, and Tocris, the firm makes and distributes biological research supplies used by researchers around the globe to study cellular and immune system responses. Bio-Techne's products include cytokines (purified proteins that affect cell behavior) and diagnostic reagents (including antibodies and enzymes), as well as its Quantikine assay kits that determine the amount of cytokine in a given sample. R&amp;D Systems also makes hematology controls and calibrators for blood analysis systems and sells them to equipment makers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through three reportable segments: Biotechnology, Clinical Controls, and Protein Platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bio-Techne's Biotechnology segment, which makes products used by laboratories for both drug discovery research and clinical diagnostic purposes, accounts for more than 70% of sales. Cytokines are a key product offering, as commercial and institutional researchers are increasingly using the proteins as a swift and effective means of impacting the processes of cells and tissues. Subsidiary R&amp;D Systems and its BiosPacific, Boston Biochem, and R&amp;D Systems China, as well as the R&amp;D Systems Europe (UK) unit and its Tocris and R&amp;D Systems (Germany) units, are all included in the Biotechnology segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The newest segment, established in 2014, is Protein Platforms (15% of sales). It develops and commercializes systems for protein analysis. The smallest Clinical Controls segment (13% of sales) develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for the global clinical market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Altogether, Bio-Techne sells more than 275,000 products under such brands as Novus Biologicals, Tocris Bioscience, ProteinSimple, R&amp;D Systems, BiosPacific, CLINIQA, and RNA Medical.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US market accounts for more than half of Bio-Techne's annual revenues. Europe is the second-largest region, accounting for about 30% of sales; the firm also conducts sales in Asia and other regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has operations in the US, Europe, and China.
  </p>

  <p>
   Bio-Techne sells its products through subsidiaries and third-party distributors worldwide. Its R&amp;D Systems Europe and Tocris subsidiaries handle distribution efforts abroad and have a direct presence in France, Germany, and the UK. The company is growing its Asian distribution network, which includes the R&amp;D Systems China subsidiary.

    Thermo Fisher Scientific
   </company>
   distributes Bio-Techne's R&amp;D Systems, Tocris, and Boston Biochem products in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers of the Biotechnology segment include researchers employed by pharma and biotech drug companies, as well as universities and government agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bio-Techne has been increasing its advertising expenditures, which totaled $4.1 million in fiscal 2015 (ended June). It spent $3.4 million in fiscal 2014 and $3.2 million in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue, which has been trending upward over the past five years, increased 26% to $452.2 million in fiscal 2015 (ended June). Both the Biotechnology and Clinical Controls segment saw growth that year, thanks to the recent acquisitions of Novus Biologicals and
   <company id="120779">
    Bionostics
   </company>
   , as well as through continuing organic growth. (The newly formed Protein Platforms segment was no slouch, either, contributing 15% of the company's total earnings that year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of remaining relatively flat, net income slipped a marginal 3% to $107.7 million in fiscal 2015. Despite the revenue growth, higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, as well as investments in resources and infrastructure, ended up cutting into profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 2% to $139.4 million that year as cash inflows from accounts payable more than offset the decline in net income.

  <p>
   Bio-Techne works to expand its product offerings through internal R&amp;D efforts. The firm develops hundreds of new biological proteins, antibodies, and immunoassays each year. It also develops new hematology control technologies to keep up with changing technologies and markets, as well as to provide efficient and high-quality offerings. In addition, Bio-Techne grows its offerings through acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has expanded the scope of its operations over the years by building up a collection of minority stakes in a number of drug developers and biotech companies working in complementary areas. It owns about 15% of drug developer
   <company id="139075">
    ChemoCentryx
   </company>
   , which is researching chemokines, a type of cytokine involved in immune response. Other investments have included blood filtration technology firm Hemerus Medical, diagnostics developer Nephromics, and biotechnology firm ACTGen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company launched its first Simple Plex platform member, Ella, through its new Proteins Platform segment. It rebranded the CyPlex immunoassay platform, acquired from CyVek, under the name ProteinSimple.
  </p>
  <p>
   TECHNE changed its name to Bio-Techne in 2014, bringing its various brands under one common name.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company expanded its manufacturing and distribution operations in the field of clinical in vitro diagnostics (primarily glucose and blood gas tests) through the $104 million acquisition of
   <company id="120779">
    Bionostics
   </company>
   in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, it acquired a number of firms to boost its portfolio. It bought Chinese recombinant protein manufacturer Shanghai PrimeGene Bio-Tech, gaining more than 400 new protein products; ProteinSimple, a developer of systems and consumables for protein analysis (for $300 million); Novus Holdings, which supplies antibodies and other reagents for life science research (for $60 million); and CyVek, which developed the CyPlex transformative immunoassay technology (now branded ProteinSimple).
  </p>
  <p>
   Bio-Techne continued its buying streak in 2015 with the purchase of Cliniqa Corporation, which develops and manufactures clinical controls products that focus on in vitro diagnostic devices.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   David Mundschenk founded biological products maker Research and Diagnostics Systems in 1976. In 1983 Mundschenk made a disastrous move, buying heavily indebted French hematology instrument maker Hycel. R&amp;D System's disgruntled board named Thomas Oland (at the time a consultant) CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enter TECHNE. Founded in 1981 by George Kline and Peter Peterson to pursue profitable acquisitions, it went public in 1983 and in 1985 bought R&amp;D Systems (which became an operating subsidiary of TECHNE), a sign of their confidence in Oland. TECHNE formed a biotechnology division in 1986 to produce and market human cytokines. In 1988 Kline resigned following a failed acquisition attempt by medical test kit maker Incstar.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 TECHNE bought Amgen's research reagent and diagnostic assay kit business and began selling Quantikine cytokine diagnostic kits. In 1993 it acquired what would become the company's R&amp;D Europe unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company debuted 10 new Quantikine immunoassay kits. TECHNE restructured its European research operation in 1997, pulling underperforming molecular biology products from the market and refocusing on TECHNE's core cytokine-related products. The next year TECHNE bought Genzyme's research products business (antibodies, proteins, and research kits) for about $65 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As drug and biotechnology research became growth markets in the late 1990s and early 21st century, TECHNE expanded through purchases. In 1999 it bought the reagent business and immunoassay patents of partner Cistron. The next year the firm increased its ownership in drug developer ChemoCentryx to almost 50% (reduced in 2001 to about 25% and then again in 2004 to 20%). TECHNE also acquired research and diagnostic market rights to all products developed by the firm. A similar deal was made in 2001 with functional genomics firm Discovery Genomics; that investment was not realized to TECHNE's satisfaction, so it wrote off the investment in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   It didn't wait long to fill the gap when it acquired the operations of Fortron Bio Science and Biospacific in 2005. The makers of antibodies and reagents had been partners since 1992 before they were integrated into TECHNE's R&amp;D Systems division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company set up a sales and distribution subsidiary in Shanghai to capitalize on the growing Chinese market. In 2007 TECHNE acquired minority stakes in two additional companies: diagnostics developer Nephromics and biotechnology firm ACTGen.
