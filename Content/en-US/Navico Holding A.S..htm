   It's finders keepers, not losers weepers with Navico Holding's products. The company reels in anglers with its high-tech fish finders and keeps hikers and hunters on the right track with its portable location finders. Navico is a leading maker of sonar products (also called depth finders) for sport fishing. It also makes Global Positioning System (GPS) products used by boaters, hunters, hikers, and others for terrain mapping and marking. The products, sold under its B&amp;G, Northstar, Lowrance, and Simrad brands, are distributed through wholesalers, boat dealers, and retail outlets like

   . Navico was created in 2006 with the combination of Simrad Yachting and Lowrance Electronics.

  <p>
   An avid fisherman, Carl Lowrance gained his knowledge of sonar as a flight instructor during WWII. With his wife, Velma, and sons Arlen and Darrell, he founded Lowrance Electronics in Joplin, Missouri, in 1957. The company introduced the Fish Lo-K-Tor, popularly known as the "little green box," in 1959. In 1961 Darrell became the company's president. The company moved to Tulsa in 1966, and Carl retired nine years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 the company supplied sonar systems to a fleet that scoured Scotland's Loch Ness, in vain, for the famous monster. It unveiled its first combination sonar-navigation product in 1988. That year, after Carl suffered a heart attack, he and Velma sued Darrell, alleging that their son had fraudulently cut them out of the business; the case was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired. The company added GPS products to its line in 1991 and opened a manufacturing plant in Ensenada, Mexico, in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1990s Lowrance expanded further, introducing handheld GPS products for hikers, hunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Carl Lowrance died in 1995. The company moved more manufacturing operations from Oklahoma to Mexico in efforts to lower production costs. The shift contributed to a net loss in 1997. Sagging sales and intense competition in the GPS market contributed to a loss for fiscal 1998, as well. In 1999
   <company id="13046">
    Orbital Sciences
   </company>
   agreed to acquire Lowrance in a $24 million deal to expand its GPS unit. The next year the deal was terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001
   <company id="13248">
    Cobra Electronics
   </company>
   agreed to acquire Lowrance for about $53 million, but that deal was also terminated due to Lowrance's failure to meet sales projections. Lowrance, which suffered from slipping sales due in part to its late arrival on the GPS scene, broke even in fiscal 2001, and Navico continues to develop additional GPS mapping products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Lowrance became a sponsor of the

   TV series, shown on

    The Outdoor Channel

   , FOX Sports Network, and other outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company raised around $24 million through a secondary stock offering in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lowrance Electronics was acquired in early 2006 by Simrad Yachting for about $215 million in cash. The combined companies became known as Navico Holding later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Darrell Lowrance retired as CEO in early 2007 and was succeeded by Jens-Thomas Pietralla, a former

   Mobile executive who joined the Navico Group in 2006 as COO.

   In early 2007 Navico acquired the marine electronics division of Brunswick New Technologies, picking up the MX Marine, Navman (for marine products), and Northstar brands in the deal.
