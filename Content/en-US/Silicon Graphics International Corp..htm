   About 46% of SGI's revenue comes from customers outside the US. Overall, North America and South America accounted for 54% of SGI's sales, followed by Asia/Pacific at 24% of revenue, and Europe at 20%.
  </p>

  <p>
   SGI has more than 6,500 customers, who it reaches through a direct sales force in nearly 20 countries and a network of resellers and distributors.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SGI reported its 2016 (ended June) financial results before the HP Enterprise deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 SGI had a bit of a bounce in revenue with a 2% increase to about $524 million. A 5% rise in product sales came from large strategic project wins in Europe and Asia. Services sales notched down 2% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sales rise helped reduce SGI's net loss to $11 million in 2016 from $48 million in 2015. A reduction in headcount helped reduce the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations popped into positive territory at $27 million, on decreases in accounts receivable and inventory, compared to a negative $97 million in 2015.

  <p>
   SGI is moving away from it older cloud computing business and directing its attention and resources to areas that should bring higher margins. Those areas include High Performance Computing, High Performance Data Analytics, storage, and services. The company will expand its business in several vertical markets, including weather and climate; physical sciences; life sciences; energy, aerospace and automotive; financial services; internet; and media and entertainment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those changes set the company in good stead for its acquisition by HP Enterprise, particularly in the data analytics area.

  <p>
   The company took its pre-HP form when Rackable Systems bought the assets of high-performance computer pioneer Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) for $42.5 million in cash in 2009. Rackable expanded its product line, customer base, and geographic reach with the acquisition, and the company adopted the better-known SGI brand in an effort to tap a larger global market. Uniquely for a computer maker, the company performs all of its manufacturing, assembly, and testing at a facility in the US.
