   <company id="102608">
    Vocollect
   </company>
   business. The company's products are used to automate and manage functions related to distribution, warehousing, and manufacturing. Intermec, which serves customers globally, targets the warehouse and distribution, field services, postal and courier express, and direct store delivery markets. It was acquired by
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   in late 2013.

  <p>
   Intermec was acquired by industrial conglomerate
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   in September 2013 for $600 million. Intermec will become a part of Honeywell's Scanning &amp; Mobility division, which is part of its
   <company id="129028">
    Automation and Control Solutions
   </company>
   segment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Intermec has domestic offices in Iowa, Ohip, Pennsylvania, and Washington. International locations reside in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Customers in North America make up roughly half of sales.

  <p>
   Intermec divides its operations into three segments: Intermec-branded products (67% of total sales), Intermec-branded services (18%), and voice solutions (15%).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Although the company does market products through its own sales force, it generates some three-fourths of sales via channel partners. Distributor
   <company id="42267">
    ScanSource

   accounts for 10% of total sales.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Intermec has suffered four straight years of net losses, with a loss of $283 million for 2012 marking its worst yet. Revenues also declined 7% from $848 million in 2011 to $791 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue declines in 2012 were attributed to unfavorable foreign currency translations along with a 12% dip in Intermec-branded products revenue within the EMEA region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss of $283 million for 2012 was due to large impairment of goodwill expenses (around $52 million), the company's lower market capitalization, and a significant surge in income tax expenses ($216 million in 2012 compared to $23 million in 2011).

  <p>
   Before it was acquired by Honeywell in late 2013, Intermec's was expanding its rugged mobile devices business to vertical markets with positive growth prospects within the automated identification and data collection (AIDC) industry. In addition to strengthening its sales and marketing organization, the company counted on services such as system design and activation, on-site and depot repair, and managed remote device and network services to bolster global product sales. It grew organically, but still made strategic acquisitions when the opportunities presented themselves.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Among the strategic acquisitions Intermec has made are Vocollect and Enterprise Mobile, both in 2011. It paid about $190 million for industrial voice recognition software and systems provider Vocollect in a move to expand its presence in the warehouse and distribution center space. Intermec made the Enterprise Mobile purchase to bolster its mobile business, which has focused primarily on rugged devices. Enterprise Mobile offered mobile phone lifecycle management for enterprise customers, overseeing device deployment, training, technical support, repair, and recycling for business clients. Intermec added this extended service list to those already offered by its resellers.

   rwCharles "Tex" Thornton, who headed a WWII
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   unit responsible for predicting manufacturing needs for the war effort, foresaw a growing demand for technologically advanced military products in the postwar years. In 1953 Thornton organized Electro Dynamics, borrowed $1.5 million, and bought
   <company id="10902">
    Litton Industries
   </company>
   and eight other small firms. Litton went public in 1954, and the proceeds were invested in R&amp;D and expansion. In 1958 sales topped $100 million. In 1960 Litton acquired seismic oil exploration company Western Geophysical in a move to broaden its activities beyond government defense contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Western Geophysical was started in 1933 in Los Angeles, where Henry Salvatori and his two employees built a seismic survey truck to search for underground oil reserves. Business flourished, and in 1937 Western Geophysical expanded into Canada and Italy. The company pioneered marine geophysical activity in 1938, and by 1955 it was #1 in the growing marine exploration business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Litton continued to expand. Purchases after Western Geophysical included Winchester Electronics (1963), Fitchburg Paper (1964), Royal McBee (typewriters, 1965), and Hewitt-Robbins (office equipment, 1965). Though sales passed the $2 billion mark in 1968, that year Litton experienced the first quarterly decline in its history.
  </p>
  <p>
   Litton restructured in the 1970s and 1980s to focus on its more profitable businesses: seismic exploration and airplane guidance systems. In 1987 it joined Dresser Industries (which was bought by
   <company id="10697">
    Halliburton
   </company>
   in 1998) to form Western Atlas International (oil industry services). In 1991 Western Atlas acquired Intermec, an automated data collection systems business that had pioneered bar code technology and radio-frequency (RF) data collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Litton CEO Alton Brann led the spinoff of Litton's industrial automation systems and oil field services divisions (whose revenues had more than doubled since 1987) as
   <company id="17140">
    Western Atlas
   </company>
   in 1994. Brann became CEO of the new company and launched it into a program of acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Western Atlas bought a major stake in German toolmaker Honsberg to strengthen its position in the recovering European auto manufacturing market. Two years later Western Atlas purchased mobile computing systems maker Norand, which had introduced the handheld order-entry terminal (1969), the portable bar code scanner (1971), and the computerized cash register (1972). It also acquired Swedish company United Barcode Industries and CDI's stamping, engineering, and prototyping unit. Western Atlas added these companies to its Industrial Automation Systems division, which was spun off as UNOVA later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brann assumed the top post at UNOVA. Acquisitions, including the purchase of RF identification technology from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   , and the associated integration costs led to a loss in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   To enhance its entry into the RF products market, UNOVA acquired security firm Amtech Corporation's RF identification unit in 1998. The company also bought R&amp;B Machine Tools and
   <company id="10340">
    Milacron
   </company>
   's machine tool business that year to boost its industrial automation systems. The company accused
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   of violating its battery pack and removable disk drive patents in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 UNOVA experienced continued losses and moves were initiated to try to return the company to profitability. Along with major management changes at its Intermec subsidiary, it sold its Amtech transportation systems operations, streamlined operations to cut costs, introduced lower-cost products, and worked to improve its internal processes, including customer service and order fulfillment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brann retired as chairman in 2001, and the position was filled by president and CEO Larry Brady. UNOVA announced that Japan RF Co. Ltd. (a joint venture between
   <company id="41785">
    Sharp
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi
   </company>
   ) would distribute its radio-frequency identification products in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   UNOVA merged Cincinnati Machine and Lamb Technicon in 2003 to form a subsidiary, Cincinnati Lamb. In 2004 the company discontinued its
   <company id="112138">
    Industrial Automation Systems
   </company>
   (IAS) segment and UNOVA sold Cincinnati Lamb (later renamed
   <company id="105511">
    Cincinnati Automation &amp; Test
   </company>
   ) the following year. In 2006 UNOVA took the name of its automated data collection subsidiary and became Intermec.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to reduce costs, Intermec underwent restructuring in 2008 that saw the company outsource final assembly of its products to Singapore-based
   <company id="99785">
    Venture Corporation
   </company>
   .
