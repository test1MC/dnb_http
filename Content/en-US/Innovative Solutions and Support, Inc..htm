   Pilots use products by Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) to gauge their success. The company makes flight information computers, electronic displays, and monitoring systems that measure flight information, such as airspeed, altitude, and engine and fuel data. IS&amp;S's reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM) system enables planes to fly closer together; engine and fuel displays help pilots track fuel and oil levels and other engine functions. IS&amp;S offers flat-panel displays, which take up less cockpit space than conventional displays. Customers are the

   and other government agencies, defense contractors, and commercial/corporate air carriers.

   Almost 85% of the company's sales derive from the US.

   IS&amp;S in 2013 derived 88% of its total revenues from the sale of its flat panel display system (FPDS) and 12% from the sale of air data systems and related products. About 25% of sales were generated from its engineering development services.

   IS&amp;S's business comprises large contracts to a handful of customers that primarily purchase IS&amp;S products for DoD program applications.

   accounted for nearly 40% of total sales in 2013.

   After experiencing a slump in sales in 2012, IS&amp;S saw its revenues increase 28% from $25 million to $32 million in 2013. Its profits were down 37% from $2.98 million in 2012 to $1.89 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2013 was driven by increased sales derived from product and engineering development contracts (EDC) from both domestic and international customers. The spike in product sales was due to higher shipments to customers for their upgrade and retrofit programs, while the increase in EDC sales resulted from increased activity on several EDC programs and from new EDC programs awarded during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The dip in net income for 2013 was attributed to a increase in the costs of engineering development contracts as well as an increase in tax expenses (compared to a benefit it received in 2012). IS&amp;S has also seen its operating cash flow spiral downward from $5.6 million in 2010 to a negative cash flow of $2.15 million in 2013 due to an increase in unbilled receivables for that year.

  <p>
   Looking ahead, as worldwide air travel rebounds so will demand for IS&amp;S's RVSM products, which allow for increased safety, reliability, and efficiency of cockpit performance, particularly in high-traffic regions. Via its growing slate of product functionality, IS&amp;S is positioned to benefit under the slow economic recovery from customers that opt for the less costly investment of retrofitting existing aircraft rather than purchasing a new one. As aircraft are retrofitted with flat panel displays, IS&amp;S also expects this product line to prosper as demand grows, and the revenue increase for 2013 reflects that.
