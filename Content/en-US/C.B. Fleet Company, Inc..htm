   Some of C.B. Fleet's products are tucked away in medicine cabinets worldwide for those times of need. Established as a small, family-run pharmacy in 1869 by Dr. Charles Browne Fleet, today the company makes about 100 personal health and beauty care products that are distributed to more than 60 countries globally. C.B. Fleet's products include feminine care, laxatives, oral care, skin care, and oral rehydration product lines sold under brand names Summer's Eve, Phazyme, Vera by CCS, Norforms, Clinomyn, Oliva by CCS, BioralSuero, and Casen-Fleet, among others. It also operates several subsidiaries, such as CSS (Europe), DeWitt Personal Care (the UK), and Fleet Laboratories (Asia and Latin America).

   is buying C.B. Fleet for $825 million.

  <p>
   C.B. Fleet works to grow its business organically and through acquisitions. To this end, in 2012 the company bought the Phazyme anti-gas brand in North America from
   <company id="129942">
    Prestige Brands
   </company>
   as C.B. Fleet focuses on building its portfolio of consumer healthcare products in the US and other core markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite previous acquisitions and licensing efforts, C.B. Fleet has moved to prune its portfolio of holdings that no longer fit its long-term goals. Divesting its Italian unit Bergamon S.r.l. (purchased in 1994) to
   <company id="146120">
    Omega Pharma N.V.
   </company>
   , a Belgium-based consumer healthcare firm, was part of this strategy. In 2013 C.B. Fleet inked a deal to divest its Spanish business, Laboratorios Casen Fleet, to
   <company id="91709">
    Recordati
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   C.B. Fleet markets its products through distributors. Omega Pharma distributes Fleet enema items through its Chefaro Pharma Italia S.r.l.
  </p>
  <p>
   C.B. Fleet's gastrointestinal and feminine care products typically don't lend themselves to conversation. Yet, the firm enlisted the help of a New York public relations agency to encourage moms to use social media, such as
   <company id="160756">
    Twitter
   </company>
   or
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   , to discuss the benefits of the company's Pedia-Lax Fiber Gummies dietary fiber supplement for children. C.B. Fleet's banking on the brand as being viewed as a dietary supplement, rather than a laxative, to boost children's typically fiber-poor diets.

  <p>
   The company is under the
   <company id="144161">
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   's watchful eye and has responded to the group's safety alerts in year's past. Following a late 2008 FDA alert to consumers, C.B. Fleet voluntarily recalled its Fleet Phospho-soda and Fleet Phospho-soda EZ-Prep Bowel Cleansing System. The FDA had determined that oral sodium phosphate solutions, used to prepare patients for medical procedures such as colonoscopies, should only be available by prescription.
