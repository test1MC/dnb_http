   Analogic provides evidence of things unseen (or at least hard to see) in health care and airport security. The company's data acquisition, conversion, and signal processing gear converts analog signals such as pressure, temperature, and X-rays into digital computer data. Its medical image processing systems and security imaging products are used in equipment such as CT and MRI scanners and other diagnostic screeners, as well as luggage inspection systems. The company also makes ultrasound systems under the brands BK Medical and Sonix for the surgery, anesthesia, and general imaging markets, among others. Analogic has facilities in Asia, Europe, and North America and generates more than 60% of its sales outside the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company divides its business into three segments -- Medical Imaging (57% of sales), Ultrasound (32% of sales), and Security Technology (11% of sales). Medical Imaging includes systems and subsystems for computed tomography (CT) and MRI equipment and selenium-based detectors used in mammograms. Ultrasound systems are used for urology, surgery (including robotic assisted surgery), and anesthesia applications. Its smallest revenue generator, Security Technology, makes advanced threat detecting CT systems used by airport baggage screeners worldwide. Much of its airport security products are sold to the US government through federal contracts.

  <p>
   Analogic manufactures its own products at plants in China (Shanghai), Canada (Montreal), and the US (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania). Plants in Colorado and Vancouver, Canada closed in 2013 as part of a restructuring effort.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US is Analogic's largest single market, the source of about 38% of sales. Japan contributes some 9% of sales, with Germany and The Netherlands adding 13% and 11%, respectively.

  <p>
   The company's medical imaging and security products are sold to OEMs such as
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   (13% of sales), Siemens, 12%, and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   (11%). Its ultrasound systems are sold to end-users through a direct sales force, as well as by independent sales representatives and distributors. Analogic's top 10 customers together account for nearly 61% of sales.

  <p>
   Analogic's revenue dropped 6% to $508 million in 2016 (ended July) from $540 million in 2015. Sales were off in each segment, but a $31 million decline in security sales accounted for most of the slide. The company's US revenue fell 11%, about $23 million, in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income plunged about two-thirds to $12 million in 2016 from $33 million in 2015. Besides lower revenue, the company had expenses stemming from a restructuring, the impact of currency exchange rates, and other expenses that combined to send profit downward. Cash flow from operations also dropped, reaching $33 million in 2016 compared to $39 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Analogic began a restructuring in 2016 to reduce costs and refocus the company. It moved manufacturing activities from Peabody, Massachusetts to its facility in Shanghai, China, and cut jobs to align research and development with expected customer demand in the security and detection business. The headcount reduction included a voluntary retirement program. The company took a $6 million restructuring charge in fiscal 2016 (ended July). Pre-tax savings were to be $4 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2017. In October the company had a change in leadership with a new chief executive taking the helm. One focus for the company is to expand its ultrasound expertise and technology to markets outside health care.

  <p>
   In 2016 Analogic acquired Oncura Partners Diagnostics, a provider of remote, real-time ultrasound imaging and teleconsulting services for veterinary medicine, for $19 million. Analogic wants to combine Oncura's remote imaging with Analogic's technologies to serve human healthcare markets.

  <p>
   Analogic was founded as Gordon Engineering in 1964, changing its name in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Analogic agreed to give L-3 Communications exclusive worldwide rights to market and service its KING COBRA and XLB1100 checked-baggage screening systems. L-3 was previously marketing Analogic's EXACT/eXaminer 3DX 6000 system for detecting explosives in checked baggage.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year Analogic acquired Copley Controls Corp. for nearly $77 million in cash. Copley makes gradient amplifiers for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment and precision motion control systems. Matthew Lorber, the founder, president, and CEO of Copley Controls, was also a founder of
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices
   </company>
   , an archrival to Analogic.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009, due to worsening global economic conditions, the company restructured its operations including a 15% reduction of its workforce and consolidation of office facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder and chairman emeritus Bernard Gordon, whose engineering work won him a US National Medal of Technology in 1986, left the Analogic board in mid-2009. He has served as chairman of Neurologica Corp., a developer of imaging equipment for neurological scanning applications, since 2004.
