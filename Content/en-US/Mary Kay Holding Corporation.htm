   Mary Kay relies on its independent sales consultants and new products to drive sales. In fall 2013, the company launched a new line of color cosmetics, called Mary Kay At Play, targeted at younger women. The new line, which includes four new colors for eyes and lips, is slated for expansion in 2014. Mary Kay has also launched an eCatalog mobile app aimed at younger glued-to-their-smartphones buyers.

  <p>
   Ash founded the company to give women who wanted to work from home an opportunity to make their own money and support their families. In another effort to further support women, Ash established the Mary Kay Ash Charitable Foundation in 1996. The organization awards grants to help fund cancer research and provide shelter to women in the US. In 1996, founder Ash suffered a debilitating stroke and in 2001 died on Thanksgiving Day.
