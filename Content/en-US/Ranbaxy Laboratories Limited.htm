   Ranbaxy Laboratories is quite the rainmaker in India's pharmaceutical business. The company is one of India's largest drug manufacturers and a top global generics producer. Anti-infectives amoxycillin (not to be confused with the common antibiotic, amoxicillin) and ciprofloxacin, and cardio drug simvastatin are among Ranbaxy's top sellers; all come in several administration forms. The company also makes treatments for gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system disorders, as well as diabetes, pain, allergies, and HIV/AIDS. Its R&amp;D focus includes new forms of existing drugs and metabolic disease treatments. Indian pharmaceutical giant

   In addition to generic prescription drugs, Ranbaxy makes over-the-counter medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and it is expanding its presence into the generic biotech and dermatology markets. Ranbaxy boosted its dermatology holdings in 2009 when it bought India-based Ochoa Laboratories' line of dermatology and lifestyle products. Ranbaxy received about 80 products from the deal including acne treatments, sunscreen, and topical anti-fungals.

   The company's in-house R&amp;D focus is on oral delivery. It pursues inhalation and transdermal delivery treatment options with outside partners. Like most other generic pharmaceutical makers, Ranbaxy seeks to be first-to-file (FTF) when branded pharmaceuticals lose their patent protection. Being FTF is key to maintaining a leadership position in the generics industry because the first to launch the generic version of a successful drug is the first to glean the profits. Recent successful FTF launches for Ranbaxy include oxcarbazepine suspension to treat seizures, migraine treatment sumatriptan, and valacyclovir hydrochloride (generic for herpes drug Valtrex).

   Being a manufacturer of generic drugs comes with inevitable fights with the drugs original makers for the rights to the generic formulations of the drugs. In 2008, Ranbaxy won a major battle when it reached a settlement agreement from a years-long patent fight over a generic version of
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's cholesterol reducing giant (and the world's best-selling drug) Lipitor. The agreement allowing Ranbaxy to introduce a generic version of Lipitor in the US market as of November 30, 2011. Though the launch of Ranbaxy's generic Lipitor version (known as atorvastatin) was briefly delayed due to

   manufacturing concerns, Ranbaxy launched its generic Lipitor version in December 2011, giving the firm a needed boost in its US revenue base.

   The company has operations in about 50 countries. The bulk of its sales come from Asia, with North America being a close second. Ranbaxy is increasingly focused on maximizing its presence in what it has identified as emerging markets, such as France, Spain, Italy, and Romania. Over the past five years, Ranbaxy has grown its sales in emerging markets from about 45% of total product sales to roughly 55%.

   Along with increasing its size geographically, Ranbaxy seeks to grow through acquisitions and alliances. Since 2006, the company has formed deals with or acquired roughly a dozen companies in half a dozen countries. It has a partnership with
   <company id="11326">
    Merck &amp; Co.
   </company>
   to co-develop new anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drugs. The five-year collaboration could earn Ranbaxy more than $100 million in milestone payments for conducting phase II clinical trials on the drug candidates. Other key partnerships include

    GlaxoSmithKline

   (for anti-infectives and respiratory drugs),
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   (out-licensing for Cipro), and
   <company id="47793">
    Pharmaceutical Product Development
   </company>
   (out-licensing for cardiology drug components). The company also has a groundbreaking anti-malarial candidate (called Arterolane + PQP) in late-phase trials in India, Bangladesh and Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm has experienced decreased sales in the US marked in recent years due to a ban on imports of some 30 generics sourced to two Ranbaxy facilities in India, including certain acne, epilepsy, nerve, and antibiotic products. The ban was imposed in 2008 by the FDA, which stated that the company violated FDA good manufacturing process guidelines. The FDA did not find any contamination in the medications, but nonetheless banned the products from the US market until the facilities ware brought up to good manufacturing standards. Steps toward ending the ban were made in late 2011 when the FDA and Ranbaxy entered into a consent decree. As part of the decree, Ranbaxy committed to complying with current good manufacturing practices and strengthening its procedures and policies; it also set aside $500 million in anticipated fines.

  <p>
   Following a
   <company id="150279">
    US Justice Department
   </company>
   investigation, in 2013 Ranbaxy pled guilty to felony charges related to drug safety and agreed to pay the $500 million in criminal and civil fines. The company admitted to improper manufacturing, storage, and testing procedures, as well as to making fraudulent statements to the FDA about drug testing procedures.
