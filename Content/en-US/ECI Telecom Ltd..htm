  <p>
   ECI Telecom was founded as Electronics Corp. of Israel (ECI) in 1961. The company originally made commercial radio and television receivers and communications equipment for the military. The Israeli air force used ECI's equipment to scramble voice transmissions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company shifted more toward commercial markets and away from military contracts during the 1970s. In 1979 ECI beat Bell Laboratories to market with an analog multiplexer that doubled the transmission capacity of telephone lines. ECI went public in 1982. The next year the German postal service (Germany's telecom services provider until 1989 when it split and
   <company id="43401">
    Deutsche Telekom
   </company>
   was formed) began using ECI's doublers in East Germany because new line allocation was not allowed east of the Berlin Wall.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to ECI Telecom in 1985. Driven by sales of new digital multiplexers that increased the capacity of copper long-distance phone lines, ECI's sales grew at a rate of more than 30% every year between 1985 and 1990, but profits fell as it poured money into R&amp;D. The investment in new technology paid off as the company grabbed market share from larger competitors including
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As telecom networks in the most industrialized regions sought new digital technologies, ECI continued to sell its analog long-distance products to customers in Asia and South America. It also developed access equipment to increase the efficiency of local phone networks. It signed a deal in 1992 with Deutsche Telekom to provide DIGILOOP access multiplexers again to a post-Cold War, technology-starved eastern Germany. ECI's sales of access products grew nearly 90% from 1993 to 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought US-based Telematics International in 1993 to boost its data transmission expertise and gain a foothold in North America. ECI added technology for providing phone service over cable lines when it acquired a stake in Israeli startup Telegate in 1994. Also that year the company began to install fiber-optic transmission gear -- developed with Deutsche Telekom -- in China, Europe, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   ECI boosted sales in Asia and furthered its penetration into Europe in 1995 and 1996. In 1998 ECI acquired Israel-based rival Tadiran Telecommunications from Israel's largest holding company,
   <company id="41141">
    Koor Industries
   </company>
   . Koor, which owned stakes in both companies, oversaw the deal; the buy pushed ECI's sales over the $1 billion mark.
  </p>
  <p>
   ECI in 1999 discontinued its data networking and Internet unit, which resold
   <company id="42501">
    Newbridge Networks
   </company>
   (now part of Alcatel) equipment, and its automotive parts operations to focus on core businesses. Also that year the company spun off subsidiary ECtel to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 ECI split its existing divisions into five subsidiaries -- Inovia (broadband access), Lightscape Networks (optical networks), ECI Telecom-NGTS (transport networks), Enavis (communications network management), and InnoWave (fixed wireless). The company used layoffs that year to boost profits and sold its private branch exchange (PBX) division. Also in 2001 chairman Kolber stepped down and named the former chairman of
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel Networks'
   </company>
   UK subsidiary, David Ball, as his successor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with labor union disputes, a depressed telecom equipment market, and distribution difficulties, ECI followed its reorganization into five subsidiaries with the layoff of 20% of its employees to remedy disappointing returns in 2002. The next year, ECI acquired NexVerse and combined it with the operations of NGTS; the new company was called
   <company id="105330">
    Veraz Networks
   </company>
   . Also in 2003, David Ball stepped down as chairman; vice chairman Shlomo Dovrat was named as his replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 ECI acquired Laurel Networks for $88 million. Laurel became the
   <company id="113773">
    ECI Telecom Data Networking Division
   </company>
   . In 2007 ECI merged its data networking and optical networks divisions to form a Transport Networking Division (TND).
  </p>
  <p>
   ECI was acquired in 2007 by private investors Swarth Group and
   <company id="155442">
    Ashmore Group
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion in cash. The company's restructuring efforts continued following the transaction; later that year ECI merged TND with its Broadband Access Division (BBA) to form its Networking Solutions Division (NSD).
