   FibroGen is out to generate breakthroughs in drug discovery. The private drug development company is focused on developing and commercializing treatments for inflammatory, oncology, and autoimmune conditions. It also develops and sells recombinant human collagen and gelatin products, which are used in a number of pharmaceutical, medical, and consumer processes such as drug stabilization. FibroGen has several proprietary products in clinical development, including biotechnology (protein-based) and traditional pharmaceutical (chemical-based) candidates.

  <p>
   FibroGen has major operating facilities in the US (San Francisco) and Finland (Helsinki). The European location focuses on gelatin and collagen development.

  <p>
   The biotechnology company is focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic agents for treatment of fibrosis, anemia, cancer, and other serious unmet medical needs. FibroGen's FG-3019 monoclonal antibody is in clinical development for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other proliferative diseases, including pancreatic cancer and liver fibrosis. Roxadustat (FG-4592) is in phase 3 development, which is a small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase, for the treatment of anemia. FG-2216 is another orally administered, erythropoietic small molecule drug in development for the treatment of anemia which is also in phase 2 development for treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease. FibroGen is also currently pursuing the use of proprietary recombinant human type III collagens in synthetic corneas for treatment of corneal blindness.
  </p>
  <p>
   FibroGen is the only producer of highly purified, fully characterized recombinant human collagens and gelatins intended to replace similar animal- or human-derived materials currently used in a variety of medical, pharmaceutical, and consumer applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary FibroGen Europe, headquartered in Helsinki, develops and commercializes recombinant collagens and gelatins for the European market.
  </p>
  <p>
   FibroGen has sold its products to more than 100 institutions.

  <p>
   FibroGen's focus market is connective tissue growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor biology, and recombinant human collagens and gelatins. A major therapeutic platform at FibroGen is based on using small molecules to selectively harness and direct certain beneficial aspects of the body's hypoxia-inducible factor system for clinical benefit. FibroGen is also focused on blocking the activity of connective tissue growth factor to treat a variety of diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its research and development programs provide fodder for new product launches. Areas of research include potential treatments for anemia, inflammation, kidney disease, and cancer. One lead candidate is under development to treat pulmonary fibrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm also occasionally forms licensing or collaboration agreements with other pharma companies to further its research efforts. FibroGen has a late-stage anemia candidate in development through a partnership with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma.
   </company>
   Historical collaborations have included a tag-up with
   <company id="15015">
    Medarex
   </company>
   on antibody candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 FibroGen entered an exclusive licensing agreement with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   that provides AstraZeneca development and commercialization rights to roxadustat (FG-4592) for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Astellas Pharma has licensed from FibroGen certain rights to FG-4592/ASP1517 in Japan, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, and South Africa. That year the companies initiated the FG-4592 Phase III development program for the US, initiated Phase III trials in China (with anticipated regulatory filings in China in 2015 and in the US in 2017). In 2013 FibroGen received $50 million from Astellas Pharma for the initiation of the Phase III program.
