  <p>
   Responding to the resurgence of the US auto manufacturing industry, in 2013 ADAC Plastics completed a $18 million expansion of its Muskegon paint facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   With this new upgrade complete, the company announced plans to decommission its painting facility in the Port City Industrial Park by the end of 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   During the late-2000's economic downturn of the automotive industry in the US, VAST helped mitigate the losses for ADAC Plastics by generating revenues outside of North America, especially in developing vehicle manufacturing markets such as Asia and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company started as A-Line Plastics in 1972. It became ADAC Plastics in 1975.
