   Delivering more bang for a lot more buck, electronics manufacturer Bang &amp; Olufsen has made a name for itself in the high-end audio/video industry. Known better as B&amp;O, it sells its high-tech televisions, telephones, DVD players, loudspeakers, digital music players, and other items in more than 100 countries (the UK and Denmark are its largest markets) worldwide. The speaker maker operates more than 1,000 outlets worldwide. Its manufacturing is outsourced and products are finished at facilities in Denmark and the Czech Republic. B&amp;O's futuristic designs have landed its products in the permanent collection of New York's

   . B&amp;O was founded in 1925 by engineers Svend Olufsen and Peter Bang.

   Seeking to make the perfect radio, two engineering school buddies, Svend Olufsen and Peter Bang, borrowed family money and founded Bang &amp; Olufsen (B&amp;O) in an attic in1925. They sold only 10 units of their first radio, mostly to friends. However the radio's eliminator (a device enabling the radio to receive power from a socket) was a breakthrough and was sold successfully as a separate product. B&amp;O finally made another radio four years later and throughout the 1930s produced radio receivers, electrodynamic loudspeakers, amplifiers, gramophones, and sound equipment for filmmakers -- all with a design influence from Germany's Bauhaus School, which has shaped B&amp;O products ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII, company engineers designed a portable radio transmitter for the Danish resistance movement (many B&amp;O employees were members). In response, a pro-Nazi group bombed the factory in 1945. The factory was rebuilt, but the war created a supply shortage of radio tubes; B&amp;O adapted by making other products, including electric shavers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1950 B&amp;O made the first Danish TV. In 1964 the company produced a radio using small transistors instead of large tubes -- leading to radical changes in radio design. Its Beosystem 1200, introduced in 1969, was added to New York's Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection in 1972. (The company was given a full exhibition in 1978.)
  </p>
  <p>
   B&amp;O entered international markets and began setting up franchises in the early 1980s. In 1986 subsidiaries Bang &amp; Olufsen Diax and Bang &amp; Olufsen Telecom were formed to develop digital technology and enter the phone market. (Diax is now owned by

   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company established subsidiary Bang &amp; Olufsen Technology in 1989 to develop new business ventures. (In 1999 the unit was renamed Bang &amp; Olufsen Medicom to focus on developing medical tools.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 EVP Anders Knutsen was named CEO, and two years later the slumping company restructured by outsourcing some operations. Also in 1993 B&amp;O introduced a lower-priced sound system to target a larger market. The company had rebounded by 1996 and was recording record profits. Through a partnership with Visteon, B&amp;O entered the car audio market in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Knutsen retired in July 2001; former LEGO executive Torben SÃ¸rensen took over as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the firm's reputation for design was recognized once again when Bang &amp; Olufsen's chief designer of more than 20 years, David Lewis, was awarded the Danish Design Council's Annual Award.
