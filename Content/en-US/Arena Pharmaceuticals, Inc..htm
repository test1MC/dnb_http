   Arena Pharmaceuticals is working to put weight loss on the map. The company is focused on developing biopharmaceutical treatments for cardiovascular, central nervous system, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. Its first commercial product, Belviq (lorcaserin), assists in weight loss and maintenance in obese patients and patients with type 2 diabetes; the drug is marketed by
   <company id="110266">
    Eisai
   </company>
   in the US. In 2015 Belviq was approved for weight management in South Korea. Arena supports its operations with income from R&amp;D partnerships and licensing agreements. From its manufacturing facility in Switzerland, Arena also earns a portion of its revenues as a contract manufacturer for another pharmaceutical company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Arena funds some of its research efforts through a third-party manufacturing agreement with Siegfried Ltd. The company manufactures products for Siegfried, as well as its own Belviq offering, at its Swiss manufacturing facility. It plans to produce any other future commercial products there as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toll manufacturing revenues are solely attributable to Siegfried. The Siegfried contract accounted for 4% of revenues in 2014, down from 40% in 2011 as the company experienced a higher level of income from Eisai, its Belviq development partner. Revenue from the Eisai partnership accounted for 50% of sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's advanced-stage candidate pipeline includes ralinepag for vascular diseases, APD334 for autoimmune diseases, APD371 for pain and fibrotic diseases, and temanogrel for thrombotic diseases. Arena also has numerous programs under earlier stages of development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its collaborations with Eisai and Ildong, the company has partnerships with CY Biotech (in Taiwan) and
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
   </company>
   (in Israel).
  </p>

  <p>
   Arena has its headquarters in San Diego, California, and a manufacturing plant in Zofingen, Switzerland.

  <p>
   While Arena manufactures its sole commercial product (Belviq), Japanese drugmaker
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   has exclusive rights to market the drug in the US market, as well as other countries in North and South America. Eisai plans to launch the drug in Canada, Mexico, and other countries following regulatory approval. Another partner, Ildong Pharmaceutical, received approval in South Korea in 2015.

  <p>
   Like many drug development companies, Arena's revenues fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount it earns through collaboration agreements. For instance, revenue spiked 195% to $81 million in 2013, primarily due to a $65 million milestone payment from Eisai. However, revenue dropped 54% to $37 million in 2014 in the absence of the Eisai payment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Development firms also typically operate in the red as R&amp;D expenses outweigh earnings, and Arena has incurred net losses since its inception in 1997. The company doesn't expect to report a profit until it has established several successful commercial products. In 2014 net loss increased by 211% to $60 million due to the lower revenue. Operating cash outflow rose to $101 million, versus $73 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Arena's energies are focused on bringing its drug candidates to commercialization stages. Its hopes were realized when its lorcaserin candidate, Belviq, was approved in 2012. The drug was developed through a partnership with
   <company id="110266">
    Eisai Inc.
   </company>
   (the US division of Japanese drugmaker Eisai). Eisai is working to expand the drug's availability into additional markets in North and South America, and partner Ildong received approval in South Korea in 2015. Arena is pursuing the formation of additional partnerships to develop and market the drug for additional commercial markets; it added CY Biotech in Taiwan during 2013 and Teva in Israel in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, sales of Belviq have not met the company's expectations and, in 2016, Arena announced plans to cut 73% of its workforce. The move is intended to save on operating costs as the firm works to develop its pipeline of drugs. In 2017 Arena agreed to sell the global commercialization rights, manufacturing rights, and certain IP assets to Eisai for $23 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other candidates in clinical and preclinical research stages include potential treatments for hypertension, pain, and autoimmune conditions, as well as additional diabetes drug candidates. All of the company's candidates are oral drug formulations that target responses in certain protein receptors that mediate cell-to-cell communications. Some of these programs are also conducted through partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Arena entered into a development, marketing, and supply agreement with Riovant for nelotanserin, its internally discovered inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor. Through the deal, Roivant gained exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin.

  <p>
   Prior to the drug's approval in 2012, the FDA delayed approval of Belviq by requesting more data in 2010; Arena then narrowed its R&amp;D programs to focus on core projects (including Belviq), and controlled internal expenses through restructuring measures, including a 25% workforce reduction.
