   PTC Therapeutics has some real GEMS in its pipeline. The firm uses a proprietary technology called GEMS to screen for small molecules that modulate post-transcriptional control mechanisms, which regulate protein synthesis and thereby offer potential control over certain diseases. PTC is targeting these mechanisms to develop oral drugs designed to treat various genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and cancers. Lead drug candidate ataluren (Translarna) is licensed in Europe and South Korea for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; it is also being tested for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Candidates in earlier stages of development address spinal muscular atrophy, chemo-resistant cancers, and HIV.

  <p>
   In addition to ataluren, PTC's candidate pipeline includes BMI1 PTC596 (which targets tumor stem cell populations) and RG7800 and RG7916 (for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy).

   PTC is based in New Jersey and has its international headquarters in Dublin. It sells its products in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, and Slovakia.

  <p>
   Like any other pharmaceutical company developing new drugs, PTC Therapeutics has yet to generate much revenue. In 2014 and 2015, the company made its first revenue from product sales, thanks to the launch of Translarna in Europe. In fact, product sales accounted for more than 90% of revenue in 2015. That year, total revenue grew 46% to $36.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, PTC still operates at a loss, and in 2015 its net loss rose 82% to $170.4 million on increased research and development and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2015, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $593 million.

   Collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies and charities and health foundations are key to the company's strategic efforts. It is developing a cancer drug with a financial award from the UK's

    Wellcome Trust
   </company>
   and has an alliance with
   <company id="41787">
    Roche

   (spinal muscular atrophy treatments). Other partners have included

    Merck

   , and

   </company>
   , as well as the
   <company id="109420">
    Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
   </company>
   and the Spinal Muscular Dystrophy Association. The company is also researching additional possible indications for Translarna, including cystic fibrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, PTC Therapeutics announced that it would cut 18% of its workforce to help manage costs. The move followed a setback for the firm, which received a Refuse to File letter from the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   for Translarna, delaying the drug's US approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company fared better in early 2017 when the FDA granted RG7916 orphan drug designation for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. That designation opens the doors for grant funding for further clinical trials, as well as tax advantages and seven years of market exclusivity in the US if the drug is approved.
