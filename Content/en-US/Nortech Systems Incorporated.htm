   Nortech has invested in 2014 and 2015 to expand its manufacturing capabilities that will boost its international sales. It added significant space to its facility in Monterrey, Mexico, where the company has operated for 14 years. It began work in 2016 at a 27,000-sq.ft. facility in Suzhou China. The facilities allow Nortech to provide service from product concept and engineering to manufacturing and aftermarket.

  <p>
   The company said it would close its manufacturing facility in Augusta, Wisconsin by the end of 2016 because of slowing business from defense contractors.
