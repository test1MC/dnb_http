   With security and terrorism still in the forefront of many, Cross Match should not have a problem finding a market for its products. The company has launched a number of new products and extended existing product lines over the last couple of years. In 2013 it launched SEEK Avenger, a handheld mobile credential reader. The year before, it introduced its WEBS web-enabled biometric software application and its first ten-print scanner with touchscreen and wet/dry finger capture.

   In 2013 Cross Match formed Cross Match Ventures, an entity focused on the licensing and commercialization of emerging technology products within the biometric and identity management spheres. It partners with other companies to bring these products to the market and attract additional revenue.

  <p>
   To achieve a deeper penetration in Europe, in 2014 Cross Match opened a new sales office in Reading, west of London, in order to serve the UK and other countries in Europe.
