   Desk jockeys can ride Herman Miller's products all the way up the corporate ladder and home again. A top US maker of office furniture, it's known for developing designs for corporate, government, home office, leisure, and health care environments. Herman Miller's products include ergonomic devices, filing and storage systems, freestanding furniture, seating, textiles, and wooden casegoods. It makes products in the US, UK, and China and sells them worldwide through its sales staff and dealer network, as well as through independent dealers and online. The US government is Herman Miller's #1 customer.

  <p>
   The US accounts for about three-fourths of Herman Miller's overall sales. The remaining quarter comes from international revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herman Miller operates through subsidiaries located in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, and India.

  <p>
   The furniture maker cut its advertising spending by half, to $1 million, in 2015. It spent some $2 million on advertising programs each year since 2012.

   In 2016 (ended May) Herman Miller posted its highest revenue, $2.26 billion, in company history, up 5.7% from 2015's $2.1 billion. The company gained sales in each business and geographic segment in 2016 from 2015. Sales were particularly strong in North America and in the health care market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit jumped 40% higher to about $137 million in 2016 from $97.5 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow also increased, rising to about $210 million in 2016 from $168 million in 2015.

   (DWR) in 2014 for $154 million in cash. (The CEO and president of DWR owns equal portions of the remaining shares and has continued to run the company from Stamford.) The purchase furthers Herman Miller's aim of realizing its strategy for diversified growth and establishing itself as a premier lifestyle brand.

   In 2016 (ended May) Herman Miller initiated projects designed to pushed sales higher. It provided more training to employees about its products and refined its sales deployment, including aligning efforts around health care, government, and education. Its research and development studies pushed out products across its products line and more products are in the pipeline. The company has opened or will open new showrooms that showcase smart office products in major cities in the US. Internally, Herman Miller has invested in technology to streamline its operations as well as improve efforts to customize furniture to customers' specifications.

  <p>
   In 1923 Herman Miller lent his son-in-law, D. J. De Pree, enough money to buy Star Furniture, started in 1905 in Zeeland, Michigan. (De Pree renamed the furniture maker after Miller.) Designer Gilbert Rohde led Herman Miller's transformation from traditional to more modern styles in the 1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rohde designed the company's first office component line, the Executive Office Group (introduced in 1942). Rohde died two years later, and in 1946 George Nelson was named Herman Miller's design director. Nelson brought in a number of notable designers, including Charles Eames and Isamu Noguchi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout its history, the company has maintained a reputation for being open to suggestions and comments from its workers. This policy dates back to De Pree's learning that one of his millwrights who had died had also been a poet; De Pree began to value his employees for their innate talents rather than just for the work they did for him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herman Miller grew, largely unimpeded by national competitors, except for neighboring

   </company>
   . In 1950 the company adopted the Scanlon plan, an employee participation plan that included bonuses based on helpful participation, such as cost-cutting suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
   De Pree retired in 1962 and was succeeded by his son, Hugh. Two years later Herman Miller introduced the Action Office, a collection of panels, work surfaces, and storage units that could be moved about to create custom-designed work spaces within an open-plan office; this line has been the company mainstay ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm, which went public in 1970, introduced its Ergon ergonomic chair in 1976. Hugh retired in 1980 and was succeeded by his brother Max, who capped executive salaries at 20 times the average wage of factory-line workers. Max became chairman in 1988 and resigned from day-to-day management duties to pursue teaching opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Max's successor, 33-year company veteran Richard Ruch, began restructuring to sharpen Herman Miller's focus. Then the commercial real estate market collapsed and, with it, the need for new office furnishings. Earnings tumbled in 1991 and 1992. Ruch retired in 1992 to become vice chairman and was succeeded by first-ever company outsider Kermit Campbell.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Herman Miller acquired German furniture company Geneal. Earnings plummeted in 1995 and chairman Campbell was forced out. Despite his commitment to its traditionally employee-friendly corporate culture, CEO Michael Volkema led Herman Miller in a shake-up, cutting 180 jobs and closing underperforming plants. The company introduced its cubicle systems office furniture unit, Miller SQA ("simple, quick, and affordable"), in 1995.

   formed a joint venture in 1997 to provide integrated office furniture and carpeting systems for commercial clients. The next year the company became the first major office furniture maker to target customers over the Internet. Herman Miller acquired wood furniture maker Geiger Brickel in 1999. The company launched a low-cost line of office furniture, dubbed RED, aimed at fledgling Internet-oriented firms in late 2000, shortly before the bubble burst for Web startups.
  </p>
  <p>
   A slowdown in the US economy prompted cut after cut in 2001; by March 2002 the company had eliminated some 3,900 positions (or 37% of its workforce). The company also phased out its SQA and RED lines that year amid slowing sales; in 2003 it consolidated two of its manufacturing sites (Holland, Michigan and Canton, Georgia) into existing facilities. President and COO Brian Walker succeeded Volkema as CEO in 2004. Volkema remains as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its investments in furniture manufacturing, Herman Miller has developed an interest in energy management. Its Convia subsidiary offers programmable electrical distribution components. In 2009 Wiremold, a leading producer of electrical wiring systems, penned an agreement to have Convia's controls used in its units.
