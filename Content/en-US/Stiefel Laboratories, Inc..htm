   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (GSK) company, aims to soothe the skin and scalp. The company provides prescription and consumer products to treat a variety of dermatological ailments. Its portfolio of prescribed products include Bactroban for bacterial skin infections, Dermovate for conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, and Duac for the treatment of acne. Stiefel also makes over-the-counter remedies for dry skin (Physiogel, Oilatum) and suncare (Ansolar, Sunmax), among others. The company, which was founded in 1847, markets it products in more than 130 countries.

  <p>
   Making acquisitions has been part of the company's strategy for expansion both before and after it was acquired by GSK in 2009. In 2012 Stiefel acquired global marketing rights to Toctino, an oral treatment for severe chronic hand eczema, in a deal worth up to Â£196 million ($290 million), from Swiss drugmaker Basilea Pharmaceutical. Also that year, it gained development and commercialization rights in most global markets to an anti-inflammatory agent (WBI-1001) from Welichem Biotech in a deal worth up to about C$50 million ($48.5 million). The agent is in clinical development for treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

  <p>
   Besides acquisitions, Stiefel fuels growth of its own operations and, by extension, GSK's dermatolgy sales by launching products in new markets. The company conducts its own laboratory research including chemical analysis, methods development, formulation development (topical and oral), and small scale drug production. The company also grows its roster of products by forming partnerships with companies that can help facilitate its research and development efforts and provide it with in-licensing opportunities.
