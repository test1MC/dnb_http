   Derrick D'Andrade and brothers Paul and Gary Walker founded Surface Mount Technology Centre (SMT Centre) in 1985. Before starting the company, both Walkers were managers for Brock Electronics, while D'Andrade was an engineer with Motorola's Canadian subsidiary. SMT Centre assembled printed circuit boards for equipment manufacturers, including computer makers
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   . Soldering components to boards' surfaces, rather than attaching them through holes, emerged as a cheaper and faster assembly method and addressed the computer industry's growing need for smaller components.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded in the late 1990s as demand for contract assembly services increased. SMT Centre established operations in California in 1995 and bought Radian Electronics the next year. It acquired facilities from contract manufacturer Ogden Atlantic Design in North Carolina in 1997 and in Ireland in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 SMT Centre bought Denver-based Hi-Tech Manufacturing and the combined company changed its name to SMTC Manufacturing Corporation. Later that year the company purchased from
   <company id="11660">
    Zenith Electronics
   </company>
   a Mexican facility that manufactured set-top boxes and satellite receivers, along with a distribution center in Texas. SMTC became a supplier to Zenith's Network Systems unit as part of the deal. It also bought W.F. Wood, a Boston-based precision sheet-metal fabricator and systems integrator.
  </p>
  <p>
   SMTC went public in 2000 as SMTC Corporation. Later that year the company bought Wisconsin-based Pensar (engineering, design, and manufacturing) and Ireland-based Qualtron Teoranta (custom cable and harness interconnects). Declining orders led SMTC to cut 1,100 jobs toward the end of that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company opened a plant in Massachusetts, but the loss of Motorola and
   <company id="57215">
    Carrier Access
   </company>
   as customers caused SMTC to close its Colorado plant a few months later. In 2002 the company closed one of its two plants in Ireland. The following year SMTC closed its remaining manufacturing facility in Ireland, closed plants in North Carolina and Texas, and sold its plant in Wisconsin. In 2004 the company's subsidiary in Texas filed for Chapter 7 liquidation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leitch Technology International, a subsidiary of
   <company id="47797">
    Leitch Technology
   </company>
   , signed a manufacturing services agreement with SMTC in 2005, estimated to be worth $20 million a year. Also that year the company decided to separate the posts of chairman and CEO, naming Wayne McLeod (former CEO of
   <company id="54171">
    CCL Industries
   </company>
   ) as its chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company expanded its presence in Silicon Valley by naming Carl Munio as VP/GM of SMTC San Jose. Munio previously worked for
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14943">
    SBE
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 SMTC appointed directors Alex Walker and Claude Germain co-CEOs, following the retirement of president and CEO John Caldwell. Chairman Wayne McLeod also retired that year and was replaced by director David Sandberg.
