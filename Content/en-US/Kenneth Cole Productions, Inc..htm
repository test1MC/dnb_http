  <p>
   In 2016 Kenneth Cole announced plans to shutter the majority of its stores and almost exclusively sell its products online. By the summer of 2017, all 63 Kenneth Cole outlet stores will be closed, leaving only two full-price stores; one in New York and another in Arlington, Virginia. The move is a new business model for Kenneth Cole, which has recently faced increased competition from other similarly positioned brands. The company is now focused on online spending increases without the high costs associated with maintaining and staffing a traditional brick-and-mortar operation. Its growth strategy is also focused on growing its brand through all social media channels.

  <p>
   Mr. Kenneth Cole, the son of a shoemaker (and son-in-law of former New York governor Mario Cuomo), worked for his father's company, El Greco (Candie's), before starting his own footwear firm in 1982. The company's first store opened in New York City in 1984. The next year Kenneth Cole debuted the first in a series of socially conscious advertisements for which the company has become known. One print ad read, "Buy one less pair of shoes and donate the money to AIDS research."
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced Unlisted footwear in 1988 and handbags in 1990. In 1992 Kenneth Cole began making private-label shoes and leather goods for retailers such as Sears and JCPenney. The company went public two years later and introduced its Kenneth Cole Reaction brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadening its product line in earnest, Kenneth Cole added shoes for children and a line of men's tailored clothing (pairing up with
   <company id="10711">
    Hartmarx
   </company>
   ) in 1997. That year, non-shoe goods sales finally caught up with shoe sales. Kenneth Cole expanded internationally in 1997 and 1998, opening stores in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. The company also expanded its presence in urban locations and in Canada in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the firm joined with apparel manufacturer Paul Davril to introduce a line of men's sportswear. In 1999 Kenneth Cole formed an alliance with
   <company id="13977">
    Liz Claiborne
   </company>
   (which took a small stake in the company) to make women's and children's apparel. In 2000 the company opened a flagship store on New York's Fifth Avenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Kenneth Cole inked a licensing deal under which
   <company id="105243">
    LVMH
   </company>
   would make and distribute Kenneth Cole fragrances and body products under the Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, and Unlisted brands. Also in 2001 Kenneth Cole opened its first Reaction store, in the Big Apple. That year the company cut 10% of its corporate workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Kenneth Cole seemed to be signing licensing agreements left and right. First it signed a wholesale apparel and retail distribution licensing agreement in Australia. Shortly thereafter another licensing agreement gave the company a presence in the Middle East. In addition Kenneth Cole teamed up with Candie's, now
   <company id="16933">
    Iconix Brand Group
   </company>
   , signing a licensing agreement for its Bongo brand of footwear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Kenneth Cole made an agreement with a European distributor to distribute men's and women's footwear to certain European countries. At the end of 2004 Liz Claiborne decided not to renew its licensing agreement with the company, citing strategy considerations as its reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 the company debuted its Tribeca brand. Designed to target young, trendy shoppers in the department store channel, its women's footwear line (ranging in price from $45 to $75) hit stores in 2004. Tribeca's men's footwear made its first appearance in the fall of 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2008 Jill Granoff, previously an executive with
   <company id="13977">
    Liz Claiborne
   </company>
   , joined the company as CEO. She succeeded Cole who remained chairman and Chief Creative Officer. Granoff left the company in February 2011. In June vice chairman and ex-president Paul Blum assumed the role of CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's past merger talks with brand management company Iconix Brand Group came to a close in 2011. Iconix is run by Cole's brother Neil. Its portfolio of brands include Candies, Mossimo, Peanuts, Cannon, Waverly, among many others. Kenneth Cole was first reported to be considering a sale to Iconix in September 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kenneth Cole hoped to boost its future revenue further through its strategic alliance with
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   . The company inked a deal with the department store retailer in 2010 to launch a new men's sportswear collection under the Kenneth Cole Reaction label. As part of the agreement, Macy's is the exclusive department store retailer for the line in the US and its territories
