   Mark Wahlberg's underwear and Brooke Shields' implied lack thereof made everyone aware of Calvins. From its men's briefs to its haute couture, Calvin Klein is known for clothing, as well as fragrances and accessories, that are all about attitude. It designs all products and makes its ready-to-wear collection of women's and men's clothing; most of its profit comes from licensing the Calvin Klein name for items such as shoes, jeans, underwear, hosiery, watches, bedding, tabletop products, and furniture. Calvin Klein owns or licenses namesake stores worldwide. The company was founded in 1968 by Barry Schwartz and designer Calvin Klein, owners of the business for 36 years before selling to clothing maker

   The US is New York-based Calvin Klein's largest market, accounting for about 60% of its annual sales. Europe contributes about a quarter of the company's total. Calvin Klein retail stores are located primarily in premium outlet centers in the US and Canada.

        <p>
   Calvin Klein's operations are divided into two businesses: More than 60% of sales are generated through Calvin Klein Apparel, which comprises the company's dress furnishings and men's sportswear businesses, and Calvin Klein's 115 retail and outlet stores. Remaining sales are attributable to Calvin Klein Licensing, which generates strong earnings by managing licensing agreements with third parties, as well as the men's and women's wholesale apparel and New York City retail flagship businesses. Calvin Klein has about 50 licensing and other arrangements across the three Calvin Klein brands.

   Beyond the wardrobe, Calvin Klein has boosted its selection of home furnishings. The designer has launched two designer furniture lines under the names Calvin Klein and The curator collection by Calvin Klein Home. The Calvin Klein line is sold exclusively through select Macy's stores, and The curator collection is found at fine furniture retailers in the US. The lines are produced under a licensing agreement with manufacturers Alexandre International and Shayne Industries. Calvin Klein's foray into furniture supports its strategy of extending its home lifestyle products.

        <p>
   In fiscal 2013 (ended January) Calvin Klein Licensing rang up $425 million in sales, while Calvin Klein Apparel brought in $750 million. Overall, worldwide retail sales of products sold under the Calvin Klein brands were approximately $7.6 billion fiscal 2013.

   In the decade since PVH acquired Calvin Klein, it has expanded the brand's global reach, particularly in Asia, and transformed Calvin Klein into a global brand powerhouse with annual sales approaching $8 billion. One of the keys to Calvin Klein's success is that it maintains creative control over its product design, development, operations, and advertising, created by an in-house advertising agency, CRK Advertising. A key to future success is PVH's 2013 acquisition of its largest licensee for Calvin Klein products
   <company id="12180">
    Warnaco
   </company>
   . By reuniting the Calvin Klein brand under one owner, PVH gained complete direct global control of the brand image and commercial decisions for the two largest Calvin Klein apparel categories: jeans and underwear. This allows the company to better coordinate product design, merchandising, supply chain, and retail distribution and marketing, and strengthen the brand's global potential. The $2.9 billion purchase fundamentally transformed Calvin Klein's structure from a licensing model, relying on the work of outside companies, to an operating model.

        <p>
   After five years designing for other Seventh Avenue fashion houses, Calvin Klein went out on his own in 1968, bankrolled with $10,000 from childhood friend Barry Schwartz, who handled the business. That year a Bonwit Teller executive stumbled into Klein's small showroom, leading to a $50,000 order. Klein expanded from coats into sportswear in 1970. Schwartz, realizing that coats only sold during one season, helped the company expand into the more lucrative sportswear market by only selling coats to buyers who also bought the other line.

   Nurturing the aura of exclusivity, Calvin Klein kept his outlets few. The designer's look became so influential by 1975 that
   <i>
    Vogue
   </i>
   was calling it "a definitive picture of the American look." Klein introduced his designer jeans in a self-directed commercial in 1980. He paid 15-year-old Brooke Shields $500,000 to suggest that she was pantiless beneath her Calvins. Sales of designer jeans peaked in 1982. In the early 1980s the company introduced gender-bending boxer shorts for women, complete with a fly. In an effort to increase profits, Calvin Klein purchased its jeanswear licensee, Puritan Fashions, for $60 million in 1983. Two years later Klein touted his first fragrance, Obsession, with a slew of ads featuring nude models.

   The company signed a pact with
   <company id="44122">
    Marchon Eyewear
   </company>
   in 1991 to make Calvin Klein eyewear (rolled out in 1992). Pal David Geffen bailed the company out of $62 million in junk bond debt (stemming from the Puritan purchase) in 1992 and helped Klein license his underwear business to Warnaco. The company also licensed apparel manufacturer Designer Holdings for jeans. In the early 1990s Klein benefited when the youth market suddenly turned on to his clothes. The youthful resurgence also led the designer to shift down from the kind of exclusive fashions sold at Bergdorf Goodman to a more casual, universal look.

   Calvin Klein hired

   veteran Gabriella Forte as president and COO in 1994; she was instrumental in giving the Calvin Klein name a strong global licensing presence. Also in 1994 the company opened its first retail store in Tokyo. The next year Calvin Klein introduced its home collection (including blankets, pillows, towels, and rugs) in department stores. In 1997 Warnaco bought Designer Holdings.

   In the mid-1990s Calvin Klein drew criticism for using models who looked anorexic, underage, and drugged. New advertising in 1998 focused on a more wholesome lifestyle, with healthier looking models in outdoor settings. But it didn't take the firm long to wind up back in the hot seat when it used children in an underwear campaign, which was withdrawn in 1999.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 1999, after Forte announced she was leaving, Calvin Klein began shopping for a merger or buyout. The company took itself off the market in 2000. Calvin Klein later filed suit against Warnaco, accusing it of selling full-price merchandise in discount outlets. Warnaco fired back with a lawsuit of its own. The companies announced a settlement moments before their trial was due to begin in 2001.

   In 2001 Calvin Klein cut 10% of its headquarters staff and shut down its CK mid-priced sportswear division in the US (the last business manufactured by the company itself). In 2002 the company said it might buy back its CK Calvin Klein Jeans license and Calvin Klein Underwear business from Warnaco.

   Late 2002 brought the announcement of plans on the part of Phillips-Van Heusen (later renamed
   <company id="11183">

   </company>
   ) to acquire Calvin Klein, a deal which was sealed in early 2003. Calvin Klein himself remained on as creative director, while Barry Schwartz left the company concurrent with its sale.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2008, Tom Murray, who had served as president and COO of the company for six years, was named CEO and president.
