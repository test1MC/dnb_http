   Spectrum Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology firm focused on anti-cancer therapies. It markets injectable Fusilev (levoleucovorin) for use by osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer) and colorectal cancer patients; the drug reduces the toxic effects of a certain type of chemotherapy. Spectrum also sells Zevalin (ibritumomab), a treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Marqibo for leukemia; and Beleodaq and Folotyn for peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In addition, the company has other oncology and urology therapeutic drug candidates in research and development stages, partially through licensing agreements or collaborative partnerships with other drugmakers.

  <p>
   Spectrum does not have its own manufacturing facilities; its production operations are outsourced to third-party contract manufacturers. Spectrum also uses a third-party logistics provider to distribute its products to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products in Spectrum's pipeline include Captisol-enabled Melphalan (which aids in multiple myeloma transplant setting), anti-cancer agent Apaziquone, and SPI-2012 (for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced low white blood cell counts).
  </p>
  <p>
   Fusilev accounts for some 60% of Spectrum's revenues.

  <p>
   The company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada. It has R&amp;D locations in the US, Canada, and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for 95% of revenue in 2014.

  <p>
   The company has been expanding its sales force as it has added products. It markets and sells through a direct sales force in the US and through distributors in Europe and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key customers include Oncology Supply (40% of sales) and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (32% of sales).

  <p>
   After revenues peaked at $268 million in 2012, they fell the following year due to factors including the abatement of a previously existing shortage of the generic version of Fusilev. Revenue recovered somewhat in 2014, rising 20% to $187 million on higher sales of Fusilev and Marqibo (which launched in mid-2013). This increase was partially offset by a decline in license fees and service revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has piggy-backed on revenue trends over the past five years. In 2014 net loss declined to $45 million due to the higher revenue and a decline in provisions for income taxes. Despite that improvement, Spectrum reported an increase in operating cash outflow to $3.6 million that year.

   As it has done, with some degree of success, Spectrum intends to continuing purchasing companies with late-stage development drugs as well as feeding its own R&amp;D pipeline. It also pursues approval for other uses of its key products and seeks out-licensing opportunities. In 2014, it executed such an agreement with CASI Pharmaceuticals, granting CASI the exclusive rights to distribute Zevalin, Marquibo, and phase 3 candidate C-E Melphalan in China. In another deal, it gave distribution rights for Zevalin in India to
   <company id="103484">
    Dr. Reddy's Laboratories
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Spectrum executed an in-license agreement with Hanmi Pharmaceutical in which it gained worldwide rights (excluding Korea and China) for the distribution of Hamni's phase 2 candidate Poziotinib.

   Also that year, Spectrum acquired the exclusive global development and commercialization rights to Captisol-Enabled Melphalan from
