   Where else can you find a company that makes components for both air conditioners and X-ray machines? Kimball Electronics, a contract electronics manufacturer, makes printed circuit boards and electronic assemblies, along with design, engineering, prototyping, testing, and packaging. It makes electronics for the automotive industry (infotainment systems), as well as the medical (MRI equipment), industrial (portable tool chargers), and public safety (thermal imaging systems) sectors. Formerly a subsidiary of
   <company id="13903">
    Kimball International
   </company>
   , Kimball Electronics was spun off by its parent as a publicly traded company in 2015.

  <p>
   Kimball International moved to split up the two companies based on their two disparate business lines. Kimball International makes office furniture, a completely different business from contract electronics manufacturing.

  <p>
   The company's electronic manufacturing services business contributed about 58% of sales in 2014; the remaining 42% comes from its furniture business.

  <p>
   Kimball Electronics targets customers in the automotive, industrial, medical, and public safety sectors. By focusing on serving vertical markets, the company is able to keep its costs low and quality high by being involved in the product lifecycle from design and prototype production through volume manufacturing and repair. Design and manufacturing teams work directly with customers' teams, and part of Kimball's strategy involves keeping up with regulatory, compliance, and industry certifications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also offers certain less common contract manufacturing services, including reliability testing, transfer of work (moving production from in-house or another supplier to a Kimball facility), and relationship management. The latter involves hiring and locating a business manager close to the customer's geographic location to manage the product from design through manufacturing, as well as assigning a program manager who is paired with members of the customer's production team.

   Indiana-based Kimball Electronics operates facilities and showrooms in about a dozen states and the District of Columbia. The company boasts manufacturing plants in China, Mexico, Poland, Thailand, and the US (in Florida and Indiana). Combined, they span more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing space. Its small assembly facility in Fremont, California, shut down in 2012. The US accounted for 70% of Kimball Electronics' 2014 sales.

   Overall sales increased 7% in fiscal 2014 (ended June) to $1.3 billion driven by a 9% net sales increase in the furniture segment along with a 5% increase from its EMS segment. Kimball Electronics, meanwhile, posted profits of $33.5 million in 2014 compared to $19.9 million in 2013, driven by rising sales and $5.7 million in other general income (which was absent in 2013). Indeed, during the reporting period the company logged $69.9 million in cash flow, compared to $63.9 million in cash generated in 2013.
