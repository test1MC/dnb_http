    Varsity Brands

   in 2011 for about $250 million joined two leaders in providing complementary products to the educational market, as both cater to US high schools and colleges. Varsity Brands, the world's largest maker and distributor of cheerleading uniforms and accessories, is the cornerstone of the school spirit industry, operates instruction camps in the US for cheerleading and dance teams, and produces cheerleading competitions. As part of the transaction, smaller supplier Varsity Brands operates independently under Herff Jones's umbrella and maintains its Memphis, Dallas, and Los Angeles offices.
