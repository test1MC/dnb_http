   Dukane aids the visual aid industry through its lineup of visual technology products. Its Audio Visual division manufactures video projectors, cameras, screens, and flat-panel (LCD) monitors. The lineup is sold to customers looking for visual aids for use in business, government, school, and church venues. Dukane's Intelligent Assembly Solutions supplies ultrasonic microprocessor-controlled joining equipment, for plastics, metal, as well as food processing assembly. This division courts big assembly operations, such as automotive, aerospace, and appliance, as well as smaller operations like electronics and toys. Founded in 1922 by J. McWilliams "Mac" Stone Sr., Dukane was acquired in an MBO in 2005.

  <p>
   Dukane makes audio visual presentation products, and ultrasonic thermal and friction assembly systems. The company operates through two divisions: Audio Visual Products Division and Intelligent Assembly Solutions Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultrasonic technology is beneficial in a number of industries, not just for plastics assembly. The process can bond, slit, and seal materials -- whether they are plastic, non-ferrous metal, or food. This "green" technology is considered cost effective, as well as environmentally friendly, as it does not use fasteners, glues, or solvents. Ultrasonic metal welding, also called "cold welding," does not melt two pieces together; instead, it uses high-frequency vibrations to move two parts together, which results in the mixing of metal atoms. The activated metal atoms cause a metallurgical bond, or solid-state weld. Dukane markets this technology in its products using trade names such as Ultracom, Dynamic Process Controller (DPC), and IPC.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to ultrasonic fabric/film, plastic, and metal welding, the company offers ultrasonic food processing, which involves a vibrating knife that does not stick or deform food. Because blades can function virtually frictionless, line efficiency is improved not only by increased speed, but because operations do not have to be stopped to clean the cutters.

  <p>
   The company targets the medical and biomedical, automotive, fabric and film, aerospace, appliance, packaging, food, toys, telecommunications, military, electronic, textile, and other plastics related industries. Dukane sells its products through its dealers nationwide, such as Camcor, Sound Media of Idaho, Online Technologies, Elite Solutions, and TapeWorks Texas.

  <p>
   Dukane has grown through aggressively developing and launching new products and services that target niche markets. The company is banking on continued growth of its European customer base and has expanded its facilities in the Czech Republic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Audio Visual division, which markets its products under such brand names as ImagePro, Starfire, and SunSplash, has reinvented itself into a one-stop-shop for dealers; it offers almost every technology that a classroom would need to be on the educational forefront. Introductions include interactive whiteboards, wireless Bluetooth tablets and media control systems, and document cameras.
