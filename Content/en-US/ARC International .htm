   Where did the fairy godmother get Cinderella's slippers? Perhaps from ARC International, the world's #1 crystal and glassware maker. The company makes a variety of products, from mass-produced tableware and professional cookware to upscale stemware and luxury items. Its brands include Arcoroc, Luminarc, Chef &amp; Sommelier, and Cristal d'Arques Paris, and they are sold through department stores, supermarkets, and specialty retailers in more than 160 countries. It also serves commercial customers (such as industrialists, traders, and semi-finished and finished goods manufacturers). Founded in the French town of Arques in 1825, ARC International has been owned by the Durand family since 1916.
