   An industrial wonder in the Land Down Under, Caltex Australia is the island continent's top oil refining and marketing company, with about a 30% share of the retail fuel market. It is engaged in the refining, distribution, and marketing of fuels and lubricants across the country, and oversees a network of 2,000 Caltex and Ampol branded gas stations. Caltex Australia's two refineries have a combined capacity of 35 million liters per day. The company also owns and operates 11 coastal storage terminals, lubricant blending plants, a petroleum products pipeline, and a fleet of fuel trucks. In early 2015

   It sources the supply of both crude oil and refined products on the international market and refines crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, base oil for lubricants, and many specialty products such as petroleum gas and bitumen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caltex Australia's two refinery complexes are Kurnell (located on the southern shore of Botany Bay near Sydney) and Lytton (at the mouth of the Brisbane River, near Brisbane). The combined annual production at the Kurnell and Lytton refineries breaks down as 50% gasoline, 30% diesel, and 15% jet fuel. The remainder of the production consists of fuel oil, waxes and lubricants, bitumen, sulfur, LPG and other gasses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's marketing activities ranges from retail service stations operations to equity and non-equity resellers and direct sales to corporate customers. Caltex Australia supplies products via a network of pipelines, terminals, depots, and the company-owned and contracted transport fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Caltex Australia had 496 Star convenience stores, 795 Service stations, 81 depots, 42 rail cars, and 252 road tankers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Petrol (gasoline) accounted for 30%  the company's total revenues in 2014; diesel 30%; and jet fuel, 10%.

   Caltex Australia sources the supply of both crude oil and refined products on the international market and refines crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, along with small amounts of fuel oil and specialty products, liquid gas petroleum and other gases. The company buys and sells products and schedules product movements to meet marketing sales and the company's broad distribution capabilities encompass pipelines, terminals, depots and both a company and contracted transportation fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Marketing segment promotes and sells Caltex Australia fuels, lubricants, specialty products and convenience store goods through a national network of Caltex, Caltex Woolworths, and
   <company id="153720">
    Ampol
   </company>
   branded service stations, as well as through company owned and non-equity resellers and direct sales to corporate customers. Caltex Star Mart, StarCard, StarCash, Vortex Premium, Bio E10 Unleaded, Havoline, and Delo are leading sub-brands, each with significant  and growing market shares in their respective product categories.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, Caltex Australia's net revenues decreased by 20% due to lower fuel sales volumes and the decline in crude prices, which resulted in lower sales revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total refinery production in 2014 of all products was 10.2 billion liters compared with 11.4 billion liters in 2013, reflecting the closure of the Kurnell refinery and its conversion to terminal operations in October 2014 which impacted revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caltex Australia's overall transport fuel sales volumes grew 3%. Retail diesel margins have continued to grow strongly, driven by the premium diesel product, Vortex Diesel, and as a result of growth in the diesel vehicle market. Diesel fuel volumes increased approximately 6%, driven by premium fuels growth which increased approximately 49%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall petrol volumes decreased approximately 1%, in line with the market. However, premium petrol sales volumes continue to grow, with Vortex Premium Unleaded sales volumes increasing by 4%. Jet fuel volumes grew by 3%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty products fell in 2014, mainly driven by the sale of the bitumen business in 2013. Lubricants volumes and margins also declined in a competitive market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Caltex Australia's net income decreased by 96% due to the loss from inventory driven by the significant decline in crude oil prices and net finance cost increased due to higher unwinding of discount on long term provisions as the result of changes in the predicted spending and pattern and a decrease in the government bond rate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash inflow increased by 9% due to higher fuel margins and sales volumes in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company intends to accelerate strategic growth initiatives in order to deliver on its target of delivering top quartile total shareholder returns. Caltex Australia's focus for the short term is to remain the outright leader in transport fuels in Australia. In support of this, short term priorities include the optimization of the entire value chain from product sourcing to customer, underpinned by the growth of its product sourcing requirements via Ampol Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lytton refinery will continue to focus on capturing further operational and margin improvements. (A major maintenance program required the refinery to shut down for seven weeks in 2015).
  </p>
  <p>
   It will also continue to expand its retail network, leveraging core capabilities of retailing, supply chain management, and infrastructure services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upgrading its infrastructure, in 2014 the company shut down of the last of Kurnell refinery's process units and opend the new Kurnell terminal, now Australia's largest transport fuels terminal.
