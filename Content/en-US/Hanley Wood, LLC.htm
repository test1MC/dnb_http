   The company is working to expand its business and portfolio of services through acquisitions. In 2013 Hanley Wood entered a strategic partnership with the US Green Building Council whereby Hanley Wood acquired the group's Greenbuild International Conference and Expo. Also in 2013 Hanley Wood purchased Metrostudy, one of the nation's top providers of primary and secondary market information to the housing and related industries. The move further strengthens the company's commitment to providing customers with actionable information, tools, and knowledge. Hanley Wood intends to fold Metrostudy into its Market Intelligence business while retaining the Metrostudy brand name.
