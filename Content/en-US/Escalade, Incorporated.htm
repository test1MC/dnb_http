   Escalade isn't in the business of making high-end SUVs, but rather helping customers get their game on as the world's largest producer of tables for table tennis under the Ping-Pong, STIGA, Prince, and Head brands. Its other sporting goods include pool tables, hockey and soccer tables, play systems, archery, darts, and fitness equipment. Products are sold under the Goalrilla, Silverback, Minnesota Fats, USWeight, and Woodplay names, as well as private labels. Escalade operates through half a dozen manufacturing and distribution facilities across North America.

  <p>
   Escalade has seen its revenues fluctuate during the past five years. After declining in 2014, revenues climbed by 13% during 2015. The growth was attributed to the introduction of new products, expansion of product distribution, acquisitions, and increased investment in consumer marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits, however dipped by 2% mainly due to a higher ratio of cost of products sold over revenue during 2015. Cash flow from operations has also fluctuated over the years; after rising in 2014, cash flow fell by 20% in 2015 due to changes in accounts receivable.

  <p>
   The company has been working to increase revenue by developing and rolling out new products, expanding its product distribution, divesting non-core operations, and acquiring new companies. In 2014 it sold its former Information Security &amp; Print Finishing segment, which made and marketed data shredders, paper trimmers, and folding machines sold worldwide under several names (Intimus, Paper Monster, Martin Yale) and private labels.
