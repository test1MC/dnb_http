   OneView lets its customers build shops in the cloud and view its shoppers from on high. The OneView Digital Store Platform -- the company's only product -- is a ready-made e-commerce platform, that provides its associates with a single view of the customer, orders, inventory, detailed product information and reviews. The company makes its money from software licensing, related consulting, and support and other services, and its customers are mostly large and mid-sized companies. The majority of its sales come from the US and the UK. OneView was reverse acquired by London-based consumer electronics-cum-investment firm Armour Group in 2015.

  <p>
   The formerly Armour Group sold off its Home and Hong Kong consumer electronics businesses to AHE 100 Limited in 2014, and carried out a reverse takeover of Boston-based OneView in 2015, assuming its name in the process.

  <p>
   The company makes all its money from its OneView Digital Store Platform, with sales split between software sales (19% of revenue), related consulting (76%), and support and other services (5%). Its five solutions are One View of the Customer Journey, Point of Sale, Inventory Management, Promotions Engine, and Omnichannel Framework.

  <p>
   The UK-based company makes nearly half its sales from its home country. The US is its second largest market at some 40% of sales, followed by the Netherlands (12%), Germany (1%), and Canada and other countries.

  <p>
   OneView sells its Digital Store concept to large and medium-sized retailers both directly as well as via strategic partnerships with SAP/Hybris and IBM.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's network of partners includes independent software vendors, system integrators, implementation specialists, and hardware providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   OneView's revenue is largely undiversified, with 90% of revenue coming from three customers.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, revenue climbed 37% to $8.1 million due to business won from five large retailers. Digital store revenue climbed from $3.3 million to $7.8 million -- a 136% increase. OneView is currently loss-making as costs outstrip revenue, and saw an outflow of $3.1 million versus $2.5 million. A large chunk of the loss related to the Armour Group reverse acquisition, accounting for which loss reduced to $1.2 million. R&amp;D expenses also increased by $1.1 million for the year. Cash outflow from operating activities was 15% higher in fiscal 2016 than prior year, at $2.8 million.

  <p>
   OneView is still in its relative infancy, and operating losses reflect intensive R&amp;D efforts and rapid scaling-up of operations.

  <p>
   The company integrated its Inventory Management solution with
