   Crown Holdings wants to pop a top on profits. The company is a leading global manufacturer of consumer packaging; steel and aluminum food and beverage cans and related packaging are Crown's primary lines. Its portfolio includes aerosol cans, and various metal vacuum closures marketed under brands Liftoff, SuperEnd, and Easylift, as well as specialty packaging, such as novelty containers and industrial cans. Crown also supplies can-making equipment and parts. Its roster of customers has included

  <p>
   Crown operates 150 plants in 47 countries, with about 75% of net sales coming from outside the US.

  <p>
   Crown's performance is driven by an unwavering focus to build segment income worldwide; it therefore segments its business along geographic lines. Its main divisions comprise the Americas, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Crown is fighting back with heavy investments in international markets, particularly those promising urban growth, such as Latin America, Asia, and South and Central Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company believes that technological innovation will help mitigate for usual risks and cycles. Not happy to just make containers the same old way, Crown Holdings operates research, development, and engineering centers in the US and the UK. Its mission is to design cost-efficient manufacturing processes, reduce material content while maintaining freshness, and develop new products with the application of new technologies. Some of its innovative closures include Orbit Closure (all-metal vacuum closure for glass jars), SuperEnd (metal ends using reduced material), and Easylift food ends (improved tab access).

  <p>
   Crown markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staffs. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by its local facilities. Its top 10 global customers collectively represented 33% of its overall revenue in 2015.

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $9.1 billion in 2014, Crown saw its revenues dip 4% to $8.8 billion in 2015 due to decreases across the majority of its segments. The revenue declines were attributed to unfavorable foreign currency translations and the loss of a key customer within its North American Food segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, Crown's net income increased 2% from $386 million to $393 million mainly due to a reduction in restructuring expenses and a decrease in the cost of products sold. The company's operating cash flow has also steadily surged the last several years, jumping 5% from $912 million in 2014 to $956 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Crown grows its businesses in specific international growth markets while improving its operations and results in more mature markets through disciplined pricing and improvements in manufacturing and productivity. However, with international expansion, Crown, like its rivals, risks exposure to unfavorable foreign-currency exchange rates of the euro, pound sterling, and Canadian dollar, as well as cyclical consumer spending on food and beverages. Its net sales are also impacted by the rise or decrease in the cost of aluminum and steel, which is passed on to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is specifically targeting Asia/Pacific as a region ripe with growth opportunities. In 2015 Crown began construction on a third new plant in Cambodia.

  <p>
   Crown has been earning additional revenue in key markets through the use of acquisitions. Looking to Europe, in 2014 Crown purchased Spain-based Mivisa, the largest food can producer in both the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco. Primarily serving the vegetable, fruit, fish and meat segments, Mivisa has 10 manufacturing facilities, including six in Spain and one in Morocco. Mivisa was purchased for $1.7 billion, and the deal helped Crown to achieve a revenue milestone of $9.1 billion in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2015, Crown acquired EMPAQUE, a leading Mexican manufacturer of aluminum cans and ends, bottle caps and glass bottles for the beverage industry. Crown purchased EMPAQUE from
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken N.V.
   </company>
   , in a cash transaction valued at $1.23 billion. The acquisition enhanced Crown's strategic position in beverage cans, both regionally and globally. As a result of the deal, Crown is now the second-largest beverage can producer in North America, supplying over 24 billion units annually to a balanced portfolio of beer and soft drink customers.

  <p>
   Formed as Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. (CC&amp;S) of Baltimore in 1892, the company was consolidated into its present form in 1927 when it merged with New Process Cork and New York Patents. The next year CC&amp;S expanded overseas and formed Crown Cork International. In 1936 CC&amp;S acquired Acme Can and benefited from the movement at the time from home canning to processed canning. A decade later, the company launched its new product in 1946 -- the first aerosol can.
