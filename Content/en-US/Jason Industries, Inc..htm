   Jason continues to grow and has acquired more than a dozen companies since 2000. When it comes to making acquisitions, the company seeks market leading businesses that are diverse in their product offerings. The company looks for acquisitions that can provide strong cash flow and demonstrate entrepreneurial leadership.

  <p>
   Jason was founded in 1985 and went public two years later. The company was taken private in 2000 through a management-led buyout. Saw Mill Capital and Falcon Investment Advisors pledged more than $100 million in late 2010 in new capital for Jason to finance acquisitions.

   Vincent Martin and Mark Train started Jason in 1986 when their employer, AMCA International, decided to sell several of its smaller businesses to focus on core operations. The pair put together an investment group that paid $53 million in an LBO for three units: Janesville Products (fiber padding), Jackson Buff (buffing wheels and compounds), and Osborn Manufacturing (industrial power brushes). They came up with the name Jason by taking letters from the three divisions' names.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its founding, Jason added more than a dozen companies to its fold, including Milsco Manufacturing (a supplier of seats for Harley-Davidson motorcycles since the 1930s) in 1995, Canadian buffing and compound firm Buller Buff (1997), and British industrial brush maker Brushes International (1998). In 1998 Jason sold its power generation business (which accounted for nearly a third of its 1997 sales) to a management-led group for an undisclosed sum. In 1999 Jason bought
   <company id="17213">
    Lear
   </company>
   's UK automotive insulation business and Sealeze Corporation (US), a maker of strip brushes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Martin and Train concluded in 2000 that high-tech stocks were drawing a disproportionate share of investor interest and that small-cap manufacturing companies like Jason had little reason to remain public. That year the co-founders led a group of senior managers who took the company private in a deal worth about $335 million.
