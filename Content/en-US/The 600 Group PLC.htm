   The 600 Group can think of hundreds of reasons to re-tool your business. The company ranks as the largest machine tool maker and distributor in the UK. It operates through four business units: machine tools; precision engineered components; mechanical handling and waste management equipment; and laser marking systems. Offerings range from metal turning machines to traditional and computer numerical controlled (CNC) lathes, power chucks and tool holding equipment, industrial lasers, and cranes. The lineup is sold via a global distribution network under the Colchester-Harrison and Clausing brands, Electrox, and other labels. The 600 Group's dozen locations dot Australia, South Africa, Europe, and North America.

  <p>
   The 600 Group operates through two business segments. Its Machine Tools and Precision Engineered segment (79% of net sales) designs and develops metal cutting machine tools sold under the brands Colchester and Harrison, along with precision engineering components under the brands Pratt Burnerd and Gamet. Its Laser marking segment (21%) provides a wide range of industrial marking and product identification systems to manufacturing industries.

  <p>
   The 600 Group's revenues climbed from 2013 to 2014 due to increases from both segments, primarily due to previous acquisitions. The company also experienced growth from the North American market in 2014.

  <p>
   The company plans to generate organic revenue growth through market development along with help from its distribution base throughout Europe and Asia (especially South East Asia emphasizing on the Thailand, Philippines and Malaysian markets). The company is also looking for available acquisitions within in North America.
