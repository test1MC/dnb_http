   Material Sciences Corporation, known as MSC, makes engineered materials, as well as coated steel and electro-galvanized steel products. MSC has two primary product segments: acoustical (anti-noise and vibration products, including the trademarked Quiet Steel reduced vibration metal) and coated (decorative and protective metal coatings). The company's products are used by the appliance, automotive, building systems, computer, construction, furniture, HVAC, lighting, and telecommunications industries. Automobile manufacturers are among the company's largest clients. MSC gets most of its sales in the US.

        <p>
   The company has operations in the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, South Korea, Malaysia, and China. In 2013 it generated 87% of its total sales from the US.

        <p>
   MSC's two primary product segments - acoustical (anti-noise and vibration products) and coated (decorative and protective metal coatings) - historically have each generated half of the company's sales. However, in 2013 acoustical saw its revenues grow to account for 61% of total sales, while coated accounted for 39%.

        <p>
   MSC markets its products primarily via its own sales force. In select markets it uses agents and licensees. Its top customers included
   <company id="12969">
    U.S. Steel
   </company>
   (16% of sales),
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   (20%), and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   (8%) during 2013. Customers within the transportation industry accounted for 87% of its net sales in 2013.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   MSC has seen its revenue slowly decline over the last few years. Revenue in fiscal 2013 (ended February) dropped 12% from $137 million in 2012 to $121 million in 2013. The company's profits also plunged by 68% from $28 million in 2012 to $9 million in 2013 as a result of higher expenses associated with product development.
  </p>
        <p>
   The revenue downfall for 2013 was driven by a 31% decline in sales from its coated segment and a 13% decline within the US. MSC also saw fuel tank sales decline primarily due to lower sales from
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   as the auto giant continued its conversion of certain vehicles to plastic fuel tanks.

        <p>
   MSC is expanding its geographic presence by creating alliances and working with partners in other countries. The company partnered with Luxembourg-based
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   to expand its acoustical material offerings, namely its Quiet Steel product line. The relationship has continued to give MCS avenues for new customers and opportunities in the European market.
  </p>
        <p>
   MSC also partners with third parties in North America and Southeast Asia for additional product manufacturing purposes. The company holds a majority stake in a joint venture with Tekno in South America; the business sells and produces acoustical/thermal products. It also produces its electronic and automotive brake products in Asia through a company in Malaysia. Its Quiet Steel line and other laminate products are produced in South Korea per an agreement with Korea-based Hae Won Steel.
