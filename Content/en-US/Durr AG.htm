   Dürr wants to paint your wagon -- your station wagon, that is. It operates in five segments: paint and assembly systems for the automotive industry; application technology for the automatic application of paint as well as sealants and adhesives; measuring and process systems (engaged in balancing and cleaning systems as well as testing and filling technology); clean technology -- exhaust-air purification systems and energy-efficiency technology; and wood processing systems for the woodworking industry. Most of the company's services are targeted at the automotive industry, which accounts for 65% of sales. Dürr operates in 28 countries and gets more than 40% of its revenues from Europe.

  <p>
   What was to become a major automotive and industrial company began as a simple tin business in the 19th century. In 1895 Paul Dürr, then only 24 years old, set up shop as a tinsmith in Cannstatt, Germany. Dürr initially built small-scale orders such as stove pipes, gutters, and roofs. His reputation got a boost, however, in 1911 when he built a roof for the Stuttgart Art Gallery, which earned Dürr the distinction of being Tinsmith Master to the Royal Court of Wurttemburg.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dürr was radically changed by WWI. Rampant inflation hit the company hard, and its number of employees dwindled to seven. Paul Dürr's son, Otto, took the helm in 1932 and led the company in the development of sheet-metal products. As sheet metal nudged out cast iron in popularity, Dürr found itself in a position to supply containers, machine tool tables, and other products. Otto Dürr also established an engineering office for overseeing the production of more complex sheet-metal products.
  </p>
  <p>
   While WWI almost ended the company, WWII caused it to blossom. Germany called on Dürr to produce materials for the war effort; many of the items were vehicle parts that needed to be primed for the factories. This was Dürr's first exposure to surface treatment, a service that would become core to its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dürr enlisted Hubert Schilling as head technician, and in 1950, after hearing Schilling's ideas and gathering information in the US on new methods for surface treatment, Dürr began to use chemicals to treat surfaces. A new factory was established for spray treating wheels for Daimler-Benz, Bosch, and other companies. Dürr also won a lucrative contract from Ford to spray treat vehicles at its car-painting plant in Cologne.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1964 Dürr opened its first international subsidiary through a major order from Volkswagen's Brazilian operation. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Dürr worked to establish itself in the auto markets of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the US. In 1968 Dürr began operating in the exhaust and wastewater-purification industries, both natural extensions of its treatment processes. Taking the processing idea a step further, Dürr founded its automation and conveyor systems business in 1978, giving it the ability to provide wire-to-wire services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 Dürr went public, listing its shares on both the Frankfurt and Stuttgart stock exchanges. It began the 1990s by winning the German Industry Prize for Innovation (its second win); the award honored Dürr's reduced-emission spray-painting methods. In the 1990s Dürr expanded geographically. It opened Dürr Automation in the US and established Shindurr, a joint venture with Shinhang, in South Korea (1995).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1990s Dürr bought Premier Manufacturing Services (US) and a stake in Alstom Automation, an acquisition that gave Dürr the opportunity to bolster its business in France. Dürr began helping Daimler-Benz build its new paint shop, intended to provide coatings for Daimler's C-, SL-, SLK-, and CLK cars, in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dürr restructured in 2000, with the holding company Dürr AG directing the business of its five units: paint systems, automation, environmental, industrial cleaning and power train equipment, and engineering services. Seeking to reduce its dependence on its painting systems, the group acquired Carl Schenck AG, a manufacturer of measuring equipment for the automotive industry in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Dürr increased its ownership of the former Alstom Automation (now Dürr AIS S.A.), the French paint system supplier, to 100%. In 2001 the group shifted its environmental operations to its paint systems unit, and the following year it reorganized its divisions again into paint systems, final assembly systems, services, Ecoclean, and measuring systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Dürr announced a structural reorganization, combining its paint systems and final assembly systems into one department, and its Ecoclean and measuring systems into another. German machinery manufacturer
   <company id="91235">
    Voith
   </company>
   took over the company's service division. Dürr sold its Development Test Systems (DTS) business unit, which produced test systems for vehicle engine and transmission tests, to
   <company id="102285">
    HORIBA
   </company>
   for €27 million. Schenck Pegasus and its affiliates were the most affected businesses in the transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2005 the company sold its Measuring and Process Technologies business unit to
   <company id="133633">
    HgCapital
   </company>
   , a private equity firm, for about €205 million (around $243 million). The move allowed Dürr to focus on its core business in the automotive industry, and to complete its financial restructuring. The company's Premier unit, which provided maintenance and cleaning services to its auto industry customers, was also sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Stephan Rojahn later announced his departure from the company; he was replaced by Ralf Dieter at the end of 2005. In the same announcement Rojahn disclosed the company's plans to cut about 800 jobs, most of which were from the company's North American workforce as a result of the aforementioned reorganization.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is making big profits on small, economical cars. Small, more fuel-efficient cars are the trend -- 40% of European automotive sales are economy cars -- and production is up. Dürr's assembly technology is keyed to small car production, especially in new geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company-wide financial plan in 2007 and 2008  made the business processes leaner and more flexible, and more prepared for the economic downswing. Good news is, Dürr responded immediately to the decrease in orders with plans to reduce production capacities in France and the US, and to cut about 500 jobs.
