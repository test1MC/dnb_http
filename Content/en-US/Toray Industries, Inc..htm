   Toray Industries, through a string of some 255 subsidiaries and affiliates, sews together a diversified enterprise producing a swath of advanced materials. Its chemists create a slew of fibers, textiles, films, resins, chemicals, plastics, and other engineered components. Business is divided among six segments: Fibers &amp; Textiles, Plastics &amp; Chemicals, IT-related Products, Carbon Fiber Composite Materials, Environment &amp; Engineering, and Life Science &amp; Other. Core businesses, Fibers &amp; Textiles and Plastics &amp; Chemicals, churn out materials for apparel to parts for vehicles and aircraft. Other offerings include contact lenses and semiconductor circuit materials.

  <p>
   Tokyo-based Toray rings up 50% of its sales in Japan. The company's global business spans more than 25 countries and regions in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas (the US, Mexico, and Brazil). Beyond Japan, the rest of Asia (including China) accounts for 35% of sales.

  <p>
   Toray enjoyed record-high net sales and profits during 2016 due to increases across all segments with the exception of Life Science. Overseas, despite being affected by a slowdown in demand in Europe and sluggish domestic demand in China, the company's textile subsidiaries in China and Southeast Asia generated additional sales that were fueled by a shift towards high value-added products. In addition, shipments for automotive applications such as airbag fabric and interior materials were strong and demand for hygiene products in Southeast Asia and India was higher.

  <p>
   Toray aims to capture the expected surge in demand for carbon fiber and is devoting about 1 trillion yen ($8.86 billion) to capital investments and acquisitions over the three years starting in fiscal 2017. The company holds the world's leading market share in carbon fiber, a material which is 10 times stronger than steel yet weighs only one-fourth as much. Toray predicts the global market for carbon fiber-reinforced resins will triple between the years 2014 and 2025. The demand for carbon fiber is expected to surge for use in aircraft and automobiles, as it boosts fuel efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, the company is increasing its production capacity in the Republic of Korea as it expects continued growth in the hybrid electric and electric vehicle market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Toray intends to increase production of air-bag fabrics and materials for disposable diapers, which are growing more popular in Asia.
