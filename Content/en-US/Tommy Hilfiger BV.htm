   Teenage clotheshorse Tommy Hilfiger once bought trendy clothes in New York City then resold them from the trunk of his car in his hometown of Elmira, New York. In 1969, while a senior in high school, he opened a boutique. By the mid-1970s Hilfiger had seven stores in upstate New York operating under The People's Place name. Hilfiger designed items for the shops, but the chain went bankrupt during the recession of the late 1970s. He briefly designed jeans for

   in the early 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hilfiger launched an independent menswear collection in 1984 as a licensee of Murjani International, headed by Mohan Murjani (who also backed Gloria Vanderbilt). The line received a good bit of notoriety from a 1985 ad campaign that called Hilfiger one of "the four great American designers for men" along with

   ,

    Perry Ellis
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="44248">
    Calvin Klein
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Eventually outgrowing Murjani, in 1989 Hilfiger partnered with Joel Horowitz, Lawrence Stroll, and Hong Kong-based manufacturer Silas Chou, part of one of Hong Kong's most established textile and apparel families. Hilfiger retained control of design. Their company, Tommy Hilfiger, went public in 1992.

   in 1994 wearing a rugby shirt emblazoned with a Tommy Hilfiger logo. Much of the sales increase was credited to fans of the artist (and other Hilfiger-clad musicians) who loyally outfitted themselves head-to-toe in Tommy Hilfiger. Horowitz, Hilfiger COO, moved up to the CEO spot that year. In 1995 the company licensed sister company Pepe Jeans USA to make and distribute its jeans and womenswear in the US. The women's clothing line debuted the next year, as did a line of men's athletic shoes through licensee

   .

   In 1997 Tommy Hilfiger opened its first flagship store in Beverly Hills, California, and a small store in London. The following year the company added licensing agreements for women's hosiery and home furnishings; it also began offering men's dress shoes and women's shoes through Stride Rite. In addition, in 1998 the company purchased its Canadian distributor and Pepe Jeans USA, which held the license for womenswear and jeans. The deal gave Hilfiger, chairman Chou, Horowitz, and director Stroll (who together controlled the affiliates) nearly 20% in Tommy Hilfiger. Stroll was also named co-chairman that year.

   Tommy Hilfiger began targeting older women in late 1998, offering designer-priced suits and other conservative clothing sans his flashy logo. The company also reached a deal with

   to market a line of cosmetics.

   agreed in 1999 to pay $6.4 million to settle a claim it was selling counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger merchandise. In early 2000, after the stock had lost two-thirds of its value in six months, the company scrapped plans for its upscale women's label and began considering acquisitions to bolster its share price. It later closed its London flagship store. In 2001 Tommy Hilfiger closed its remaining flagship store in Beverly Hills. To penetrate selected markets not served by its department store distribution, the company announced plans in mid-2001 to open around 35 new stores by the middle of 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tommy Hilfiger bought its European licensee, T.H. International, in July 2001 for $200 million. In October 2002 namesake founder Tommy Hilfiger was named chairman (later honorary chairman), replacing longtime founding chairman Silas Chou.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Tommy Hilfiger returned to his original backer, Murjani Group, to seal plans for expansion into India with free-standing stores. Six stores opened that year. (Conversely, Hilfiger began closing about 35 underperforming stores, starting with three in the Los Angeles area.) Murjani bought the master license that year to open Tommy Hilfiger stores and distribute the namesake merchandise in India. Also in 2004 THC introduced H Hilfiger, a more upscale apparel line targeted at 30- to 45-year-old men and women, though the brand did not catch on as quickly as the company had anticipated. In an effort to further expand its upscale image, THC purchased (late the same year) ownership of the trademarks and related licenses and fashion lines of notable
   <company id="93472">

   </company>
   designer Karl Lagerfeld. Ginny Hilfiger (Tommy's younger sister) left the company in late 2004 to spend more time with her family.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 the company enlisted the branding expertise of Mike Toth (of Toth Brand Imaging) -- who worked with Tommy Hilfiger for seven years in the '90s and developed a campaign that boosted the brand's popularity that decade -- to refuel its brand in time for fall 2006. Later in the year THG's Tommy Hilfiger Licensing Inc. began licensing the development, manufacture, and distribution of branded swimwear to RAJ Manufacturing, of Tustin, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Apax Partners purchased THG in early 2006 in a deal valued at some $1.6 billion. In mid-2006 THG said it planned to discontinue the Karl Lagerfeld line, sold mostly to department stores. THG shuttered the Paris-based Lagerfeld Gallery, which had bowed in 1998 as a showcase for the designer. The higher-priced Lagerfeld Collection was discontinued, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Apax's direction, the company was divided into four independently run business units, consisting of a focus on the US, Canada, Europe, and the Far East. To better focus on its US operations, THG pared down its operations into what it is today. It sold its global sourcing subsidiary to Hong Kong's
   <company id="101769">

   </company>
   for about $248 million. The 2007 deal included THG's offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. It also sold its Asia-Pacific unit to

   and Harvey Nichols store operator
   <company id="104953">
    Dickson Concepts
   </company>
   in 2006 for some $50.8 million. The deal included 89 Tommy Hilfiger stores operating in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore, and Malaysia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2009 Hilfiger discontinued its licensing deal for men's and women's shoes with
   <company id="11409">
    Stride Rite
   </company>
   . In September of that same year, THG opened a flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
