   As you make your way over the hill and beyond, Joerns Healthcare (formerly Joerns RecoverCare) may take on greater importance to you. The company manufactures and rents beds, furnishings, repositioning equipment, and wound management products for the long-term care industry, including hospitals and nursing homes. Some of its brands include the Dolphin line of advanced therapeutic surfaces, the P.R.O. line of hybrid surfaces, and the UltraCare brand of health care bed frames. Joerns sells and rents its products and offers design and equipment services throughout North America and Europe. The firm was founded as Joerns Brothers Furniture in 1889. It merged with RecoverCare in 2016.

   Profound changes in the long-term care marketplace in recent years, including changes to reimbursement and the growth of nursing home and skilled nursing alternatives, have created a more complex and demanding set of clientele for Joerns. To meet these complexities, Joerns provides consulting and design services to health care providers. These include services to help health care providers mitigate risk by implementing safety equipment and furniture; online resources to help with the identification, prevention, and treatment of chronic wounds (such as those caused by diabetes) to improve clinical outcomes; and interior design services for everything from senior living homes to acute care facilities.

   In 2014, the company launched ClimateCare, a mattress cover system providing micro-climate management.

   It took some time, but the company that brothers Charles, Paul, and Frederick Joerns founded eventually shifted its focus from upscale residential furniture (through the late 1950s) to furnishings for dorms and then to furniture designed for the health care sector after metal engineering came into its mix.
