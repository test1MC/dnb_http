   In 1981 real estate developer Donald Anderson and electrical engineer Lane Garrett formed Photocomm, Inc. to market solar power products and take advantage of the federal alternative energy tax credit. The company survived an industry shakeout when the tax credit expired in 1985. In 1988 ARCO Solar veteran Robert Kauffman became CEO and took Photocomm public.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="57858">
    Westinghouse
   </company>
   invested $1 million in the company in 1990, and Photocomm soon acquired Solar Wind Energy and Solar SignAge. New World Power invested $2 million in Photocomm in 1993, and Westinghouse began selling its holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Photocomm supplied a $3.6 million system for the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake, California, in 1995; it also bought Sunelco (mail-order solar electric systems). In 1996 Photocomm bought Solarjack (solar-powered water pumps). That year Coors family-controlled ACX Technologies, through subsidiary Golden Technologies, bought New World Power's stake in Photocomm.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Coors replaced Kauffman as president and CEO and proceeded to integrate Photocomm's operations with another ACX Technologies solar power subsidiary, Golden Genesis. Photocomm began doing business as Golden Genesis in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the late 1990s the company suffered annual losses, which it attributed in part to reorganization-related charges. In 1998 Coors stepped down as president and CEO, and VP Michael Davis replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="43608">
    Kyocera International
   </company>
   acquired Golden Genesis in 1999 and changed its name to Kyocera Solar. In 2000 the Japanese government accused Kyocera Solar of illegally receiving government subsidies and suspended it for three years from acting as an agent installing solar battery products. That year Davis left the company and Kyocera veteran Douglas Allday replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Kyocera Solar introduced its MyGen (My Generation) rooftop-mounted generation systems for homes and small businesses. In 2002 the company sold its Sunelco catalog business to Sunelco division manager Tom Bishop; it also sold its Kyocera Solar Argentina unit to division manager Fernando Salgado. Steven Hill, another Kyocera veteran, replaced Douglas Allday as Kyocera Solar's president in early 2004.
