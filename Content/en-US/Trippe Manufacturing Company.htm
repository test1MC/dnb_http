   Trippe Manufacturing trips the light fantastic by selling protection from power trips. Doing business as Tripp Lite, the privately owned company makes more than 3,000 products used to protect, power, and connect electronic equipment. Its surge suppressors guard against surges, spikes, and over-voltages that can damage personal computers and other electronic equipment. The company's uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems provide battery backup power, while its inverters are used to power laptops and other products when other power sources are not available. Tripp Lite products also include power strips, cables and connectors, laptop accessories, and power-management software.
