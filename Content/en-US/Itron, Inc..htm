   Itron aims to make meter-reading a desk job. The company is a global supplier of metering products and services for electric, natural gas, and water utilities. Itron makes radio- and telephone-based automatic meter-reading (AMR) systems, handheld meter-reading computers, smart meters, and meter data acquisition and analysis software, in addition to traditional standard (manual-read) meters. Its systems are installed at about 8,000 utilities across 100 countries. The company also provides consulting, project management, and outsourcing services. Customers have included

   Itron has steadily expanded its advanced and smart meter businesses, which have increasingly accounted for a larger portion of units deployed. Advanced metering (which offers data transmission only) and smart metering (transmit and receive) contracts are driving international growth for the company. Smart meters are based on the company's OpenWay technology platform. Despite this growth, sales of traditional meters still overshadow the modern alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itron's operations are divided into three business lines: Electricity, Gas, and Water (heat and water meters). Electricity is the largest of the three, accounting for 40% of sales, while gas and water each have about 30%.

  <p>
   North America, which accounts for 46% of Itron's sales, is the company's biggest market. The EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) has caught up, generated 43% in 2013. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for the other 11%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Washington-based Itron has about 17 manufacturing facilities and 75 administration and sales offices around the world.

  <p>
   Itron uses a direct sales force for its largest clients and indirect sales channels (such as distributors and partners) for smaller utilities. The company's top 10 customers account for nearly 20% of sales, though no one customer accounts for more than 10%.

   Itron reported $1.97illion in sales in 2013, an 1% increase versus the prior year, and halting a two-year streak of falling sales for the metering company. Itron lost money for the second straight year in 2014, though the $23 million loss was less than the $149 loss reported in 2013. The company's gas and water segments grew in 2014, but electricity waned with a 5% drop in revenue. The smaller loss was attributed to lower operating costs the company achieved as part of a restructuring effort begun in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations perked up in 2014 to $133 million from $105 million in 2013.

  <p>
   The company began a restructuring effort, dubbed the 2014 Projects, which include consolidation of facilities and reduction of its work force. The new structure is to align Itron's global operations with markets where profits can be made. The company looks for annual savings of $40 million with the restructuring, which began in late 2104 and is expected to conclude by 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2014 effort continued one begun in 2013 when Itron reorganized, splitting its Energy segment into Electricity and Gas to allow each business line to develop its own go-to-market strategy, prioritize its marketing and product development requirements, and focus on strategic investment. The company is working to both improve its existing technology and to innovate in the areas of electricity, natural gas, water, heat meters, sensing and control devices, data collection software, and other areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides consolidations and cuts, Itron is introducing new services and products. In 2014, it announced Itron Total Services, a managed service that combines aspects of metering, communications, data management, and analytics into a package that can be tailored to customers' needs. With the service customers can have Itron run their smart grid or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Itorn also put into play the Itron Riva platform, which offers intelligence embedded in devices at the edge of the network and adaptive communications capabilities that enable dynamic switching between communications protocols. The company is banking on Itron Riva to anchor its efforts of connecting devices arrayed in smart cities and the Internet of Things.

   Itron was formed by a group of engineers in 1977 with financial backing from utility Washington Water Power (now
   <company id="11609">
    Avista
   </company>
   ). In 1992 Itron acquired EnScan, a maker of mobile automatic meter reading (AMR) systems. The company went public in 1993. During 1994 and 1995 it installed the largest AMR system in the world for the Public Service Company of Colorado (now
   <company id="54197">
    New Century Energies
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   It has grown over the years with contracts with big utilities and some acquisitions. The move toward smart meters has advanced in fits and starts reflected in Itron's fluctuating revenue and profits and losses.
