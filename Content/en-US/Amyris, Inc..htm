   Amyris Biotechnologies&#160;is engineering&#160;yeast&#160;in the hopes to rise&#160;above the world's dependence on petroleum by creating alternative fuels. The company has developed a process that uses genetically modified molecules from yeast to create biofuels and other renewable chemicals as an alternative to petroleum products. Amyris uses fermented&#160;yeast from Brazilian sugarcane to produce Biofene,&#160;a chemical that&#160;can replace petroleum as the basis for&#160;such products as&#160;detergent, cosmetics, perfume, industrial lubricants, and fuel. The company has operations in the US and in Brazil through a joint venture with sugar giant Grupo São Martinho.

   Amyris operates in the Brazil and the US.

   Amyris' subsidiaries include Amyris Brasil S.A., a majority-owned Brazilian company through Amyrid conducts its Brazilian operations for the manufacture and trade of&#160;its products, and Amyris Fuels, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary through which the company is building its US fuels distribution capabilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amyris Fuels, LLC imports biofuels from Brazil into the US. Amyris Fuels imports ethanol from other manufacturers in order to establish relationships with US trading partners. Once Amyris' own biofuel is ready for market, the company plans to integrate it into&#160;its distribution network.

   The company's revenues increased by 83% in 2011 as a result of an increase in product sales. Revenues from product sales&#160;grew by $61.2 million to $129.8 million primarily from sales of ethanol and reformulated ethanol-blended gasoline purchased from third parties, resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price per gallon and an increase in gallons sold due to stronger&#160;demand from existing customers. It also saw&#160;an increase of $5.5 million in grants and collaborations revenues as the result of higher revenues generated from collaborative research.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, Amyris' net loss increased by 117% in 2011 due to higher research and development expenses increase as&#160;a result of an $11.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses associated with headcount growth and higher stock-based compensation, and an increase in outside consulting expenses and higher overhead costs.&#160;Sales, general, and administrative expenses&#160;grew primarily as a result of increased personnel-related expenses of $24.1 million, higher consulting fees of $8.4 million, and higher professional fees of $2 million associated with an increase in legal and auditing fees.

        <p>
   The company's&#160;strategy is to commercialize in select specialty chemical markets in order to&#160;generate revenues&#160;with current production process efficiencies; leverage its technology platforms to improve efficiencies; focus on Brazilian sugar cane as its primary raw material; and keep its production facilities simple and scalable. Amyris' focus is commercialization and production of a single molecule, Biofene and its derivatives, for use in a range of specialty chemical applications within the cosmetics, lubricants, flavors and fragrances, polymers, consumer products, and transportation fuels markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   To support its growth strategy, in 2012 the company realigned its senior leadership in preparation to&#160;ramp up production. In 2010 Amyris formed a joint venture with Usina São Martinho, one of the largest sugar and ethanol producers in Brazil, to construct and operate the first commercial plant&#160;to make Amyris renewable products.

   Amyris has agreements with Brazilian sugar and ethanol producers
   <company id="58878">
    Bunge Limited
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="157540">
    Cosan
   </company>
   , and Açúcar Guarani (a subsidiary of
   <company id="103723">
    Tereos
   </company>
   ) to explore producing plant-based fuels and specialty chemicals. Producing Biofene instead of ethanol from fermented sugarcane won't require a major overhaul to the companies' production process. Amyris plans to utilize the companies' already-established production plants and&#160;ethanol producers to&#160;expand its product base and adapt to demand (or lack thereof) in the ethanol market.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has also negotiated development and commercialization agreements with an affiliate of
   <company id="12393">
    Total SA
   </company>
   , initially focusing on renewable lubricants and jet fuel, and with

   and

    Givaudan
   </company>
   , global flavors and fragrances companies firms, focusing on a key ingredients for the flavors and fragrances market.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amyris went public in&#160;2010, raising&#160;$86 million.&#160;It used proceeds from its IPO to convert an ethanol plant in Brazil into a production plant.

        <p>
   Amyris was initially created to develop strains of yeast into a new treatment for malaria. CTO Dr. Neil Renninger was earning his Ph.D. from the
   <company id="129240">
    University of California Berkeley
   </company>
   when his work was funded by a grant from the
   <company id="59159">
    Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation
   </company>
   and Amyris was born. The malarial technology was licensed to
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   in 2008,&#160;after Amyris' research grew into biofuel.
