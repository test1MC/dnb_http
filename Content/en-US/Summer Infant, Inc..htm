   Summer Infant makes products for infants and children that can be used in any season. Through its operating subsidiaries, Summer Infant develops and markets health and safety, and wellness products for children from birth to 3 years old mostly under the Summer Infant and Born Free brand names. Some of its products include booster seats, audio and video monitors, bed rails, safety gates, bedding, and durable bath items. Most of its products are manufactured in Asia (primarily China) and Israel. The company earns the majority of its revenue from the North American market, selling through retailers such as

   Rhode Island-based Summer Infant rings up more than 90% of its sales in North America. The remainder originate in the UK and other countries. Summer Infant operates offices and warehouses in the US, Canada, and the UK.

  <p>
   The company's 1,100-plus products are sold through a direct global sales force, manufacturers' representatives, distributors, and via e-commerce. Summer's top seven customers contributed about 78% of sales in 2013, versus 81% is 2012.

   The juvenile-products maker reported sales of $208.2 million in 2013, a decline of 16% versus the prior year, and posted a loss of $2.8 million. The company attributed its double-digit sales decline to the termination of its licensing arrangements with
   <company id="52644">
    Carters
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11603">
    Disney
   </company>
   , to better focus on building its own Summer and Born Free branded products. Also, sales of baby monitors declined due to increased competition and lower sales with a major retail customer. The drop off in sales reversed three consecutive years of significant growth -- thanks to an expanded product assortment -- during which sales increased from $153.5 million in 2009 to $247.2 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Summer Infant was unprofitable in 2013, the $2.8 million loss represented a strong rebound from the prior year's loss of more than $65 million.

  <p>
   Since its inception, the company has pursued a product-centric growth strategy that emphasizes the development of new product lines and selling more of its existing products in new retail environments. Summer Infant looks to add new products, such as car seats and strollers, to its existing categories. Expanding through acquisitions has also been key to its growth strategy. Indeed, in 2013 the company launched its new 3D Lite stroller, acquired the Little Looster potty training step stool, and launched its new Baby Link WiFi series of video monitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Summer Infant sales have grown steadily -- even through the global economic downturn -- which hit the firm's core US market especially hard. Child care products proved to be relatively resistant to the tough economic times -- market analysts suggest that consumers view many items in the category as necessities for their growing little ones. The company keeps expenditures under control by using third-party manufacturers, most of whom are based in Asia, to produce goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also hopes to eventually move into new geographic markets, such as Japan, Mexico, and Australia.

  <p>
   In June 2013, Summer Infant acquired Little Looster, LLC, a designer and manufacturer of the Little Looster potty training step stool, for $100,000 in cash and an ongoing royalty payment. In September 2013, the juvenile products maker purchased Pink Magnolia, LLC, a designer and maker of a nursing light product to assist breast feeding mothers known as the "Nighty Night Nursing Light."
