   More than a century after Kao affixed a lunar logo to its name, Japanese consumers still think the company's products hang the moon. Kao (pronounced "cow") is Japan's #1 maker of personal care, laundry, and cleaning products. Its brand names include Attack (a top laundry detergent in Japan), Bioré (skin care), Family Kyukyutto (dishwashing detergent), Asience (shampoo), Laurier (sanitary napkins), Merries (disposable diapers), and ALBLANC (cosmetics). The company also manufactures Healthya brand beverages (green tea and water), cooking oils and fatty chemicals, printer and copier toner products, and plastics used in products such as athletic shoe soles.

   Tomiro Nagase founded the Kao Soap Company in 1887; shortly afterward, he began selling bars under the motto, "A Clean Nation Prospers." Kao's longtime rivalry with Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) was foreshadowed when it adopted a moon trademark in 1890 strikingly similar to the one chosen by P&amp;G eight years earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kao moved into detergents in the 1940s. In the 1960s the company struck upon an idea that would vertically integrate it and set it apart from other consumer products manufacturers: It set up a network of wholesale distributors ("hansha") who sell only Kao products. The hansha system improved distribution time and cut costs by eliminating middlemen.
  </p>

   Yoshio Maruta, one of several chemical engineers to run Kao, took over as president in 1971. Maruta presented himself as more Buddhist scholar than corporate honcho; during his 19 years at the top, he gave the company a wider vision through his emphasis on creativity and his insistence on an active learning environment. To encourage sharing of ideas, the company used open conference rooms for meetings and anyone interested could attend and participate in any meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Maruta, Kao launched a string of successful products in new areas in the 1980s. In 1982 the company introduced its Sofina cosmetics line, emphasizing the line's scientific basis in a break from traditional beauty products marketing. The next year its Super Merries diapers (with a new design that reduced diaper rash) trounced P&amp;G's Pampers in Japan. Its popular Attack laundry detergent (the first concentrated laundry soap) led the market within six months of its 1987 debut.

   Seeking a way to enter the US market, Kao bought the Andrew Jergens skin care company -- based in Cincinnati, as is P&amp;G -- in 1988. (It also purchased a chemical company to supply the materials to make Jergens' products.) P&amp;G and Unilever braced themselves for the new competition, but Kao didn't deliver, releasing products like fizzy bath tablets that didn't sell well in a nation of shower-takers. In 1989 it bought a 75% interest in Goldwell, a German maker of hair care and beauty products sold through hair stylists. (By 1994 Kao owned all of Goldwell, which is now called Kao Professional Salon Services.)

   In the mid-1980s Kao built a name for itself in the floppy disk market and became the top producer of 3.5-in. floppy disks in North America by 1990. However, competition crowded the field and drove the price of disks down. In 1997 the company stopped production of floppy disks in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemical engineer Takuya Goto took over as president that year. Kao looked to other Asian markets and the US for potential consumers and found a willing audience in the US for its Bioré face strips. In 1998 Kao purchased Bausch &amp; Lomb's skin care business, gaining the Curel and Soft Sense lotion brands.

   In 2000 Kao established a joint venture with Novartis to make baby foods and over-the-counter drugs such as stomach medicines and other pain relief drugs. In 2001 Kao lost out on its offer for

   to P&amp;G. Also in 2001 it formed a joint venture with Archer Daniels Midland to produce an anti-obesity diacylglycerol oil (used in margarine, cooking oil, salad dressing, and mayonnaise) and in 2002 began marketing it in the US under the brand name Enova. That year Kao dissolved its OTC-medicine-manufacturing joint venture with Novartis and renamed its Sofina cosmetics brand Prestige Cosmetics. Additionally in 2002 Kao acquired John Frieda Professional Hair Care through Andrew Jergens. (Andrew Jergens became Kao Brands in 2004.)

   In 2004 Goto became chairman and Motoki Ozaki was promoted from president of the Global Fabric and Home Care division to president and CEO. The same year Kao broke off talks to purchase Kanebo.

   In 2008 the company sold its fatty amine business to Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, a unit of
