   Seres is serious about balancing bacteria populations in the human body. Seres Therapeutics specializes in microbiome therapeutics, which help restore health to persons whose have an unhealthy (or dysbiotic) microbiome ecology of microorganisms. It is developing biologic drugs to treat metabolic, inflammatory, and infectious diseases, primarily in the colon; its lead drug candidate is SER-109 for the treatment of large-intestine inflammation. Its products are in early-stage development, including other candidates such as SER-262 (to prevent recurrence of inflammation), SER 287 (to treat inflammatory bowel disease), and SER-155 (to treat enteric pathogens). Seres Therapeutics went public in mid-2015.

  <p>
   The company raised $133.8 million in its initial public offering, significantly more than the $90 million it anticipated raising. It will use the proceeds to further develop lead candidate SER-109 and continue research on its other three primary candidates. Remaining funds will be used for general and corporate purposes as well as future R&amp;D efforts. Seres is also exploring acquisitions of other firms, technologies, and assets.

   Seres is taking the probiotic yogurt craze to a whole new level. Microbiome therapeutics is a relatively new field that seeks to find a balance between the body and its gut flora, or bacteria. The company calls the class of drugs it is developing "Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics;" they are designed to repair the function of an unhealthy ecology of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The basic premise is that by introducing dozens of bacterial species by way of a healthy donor's fecal matter, the microbiome can return to a state of healthy balance.

   In addition to researching treatments for infections and inflammations of the colon, Seres is conducting research into metabolic diseases and infections related to antibiotic use and chemotherapy.

   Seres leases its headquarters and an R&amp;D facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also leases a pilot manufacturing facility, where it conducts process development and scale-up activities, in Cambridge. It plans to either expand its current manufacturing site of build additional facilities.

   If the company's products are approved in the US, Seres plans to commercialize them with its own specialty sales force of 100 or fewer representatives. It plans to target physicians specializing in gastrointestinal and infectious diseases. Beyond the US, it will seek collaborations with third parties to distribute and market its therapies.

  <p>
   Because Seres has not yet commercialized any of its drug candidates, it has yet to earn revenues or make a profit. It has incurred significant losses since its 2010 inception and is expected to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. At the end of March, 2015, it had some $35.8 million in debt.

   Lead candidate SER-109 is a treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis (CDI), an inflammation of the large intestine that causes infectious diarrhea and sometimes leads to death. It is one of the most urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial threats in the US, and is the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections (surpassing
   <em>
    Staphylococcus aureus
   </em>
   ). The company believes that, due to the widespread use of antibiotics, CDI is a growing global threat. SER-109, which may prove to be a suitable alternative to treating with CDI with yet more antibiotics, would then be a first-in-field drug. It plans to commercialize the treatment in the US and, with collaborators, in international market. Seres is also working to develop its other three primary candidates and discover new microbiome therapeutics candidates.
