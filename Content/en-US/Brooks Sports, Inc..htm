   Countering the usual dash for cash through hype and celebrity sponsorships, Brooks Sports takes a more soleful approach to building its name. The company makes running, cross-training, and walking footwear, apparel, and accessories for men, women, and kids under the Brooks and Moving Comfort brands. Products are sold by sporting goods retailers and athletic footwear stores in more than 60 countries as well as on Brooks' website. The company markets its gear primarily through runners' magazines and by sponsoring low-profile but respected members of the running community, eschewing mass TV advertising used by such rivals as

   Brooks sells its products through dealers in the US and abroad, as well as through its own website and those operated by other online dealers. The company boasts a market share of nearly 12% in the performance running category, behind market leader

   (40%), and

   Brooks marked its 100th year by reaching $500 million in revenue (on a rolling 12-month basis as of April 2014). The athletic shoemaker has been posting double-digit sales gains in recent years. In 2013 its sales increased 17% versus 2012, after posting gains of 34% in each of the previous two years. Sales in Europe (up 27% year over year) outperformed the US (UP 16%). Brooks also reported strong growth in its apparel business, which grew 16% year over year, driven by new products.

   Brooks' aim is to become the next $1 billion brand in running. To stay on top of the performance running category, Brooks invests heavily in R&amp;D. In 2012 the shoemaker unveiled the second generation of its PureProject line, including an all-new shoe, the PureDrift. The lightest shoe in the collection, the PureDrift features a natural fit and light mesh upper.

   The athletic footwear brand has narrowed its focus in recent years to concentrate more on those who participate in running for fun than running in marathons for medals. To this end, Brooks Sports works to serve the middle market in running shoes that cost between $85 and $140. The move has allowed the manufacturer to come out on the other side of the recession relatively unscathed. Also to its benefit, the prevalence and growing number of charity runs for causes like breast cancer, leukemia, and autism has more runners participating in casual runs in place of the more elite diehard races. The ranks of runners, to boot, has been rising during the past decade and most of them are women. New runners look to popular specialty running stores, where Brooks Sports sells its running shoes, to get help from staff members in determining which shoe they need based on their gait and pronation. Private running coaches and classes typically offer discounts at these specialty shops, as well, which entices new runners to shop there. As a result of its shift in focus, the Brooks brand earned #1 market share in footwear with specialty retailers in 2011 and again in 2012.
