   If you're looking for investment advice, you might want to check the word on the street. TheStreet offers financial news, tools, and analysis, as well as community features such as online chats and message boards, on both its advertising supported flagship website TheStreet.com and on its subscription-based site RealMoney.com, which also features commentary from market experts. Its MainStreet.com site features content related to personal finance topics. Sales come from advertising and subscriber fees. The company also distributes content through syndication deals with sites such as Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, and CNN Money, and provides equity research and brokerage services to institutional clients.

   The charismatic James Cramer has worn more than a few hats (market commentator on
   <i>
    Good Morning America
   </i>
   and contributor to
   <i>
    Worth,
   </i>
   among others), a setup that has sparked questions about potential for conflicts of interest as he juggled journalist/investor roles. While writing for Dow Jones'
   <i>
    SmartMoney
   </i>
   magazine, he was inspired to create TheStreet.com. He took his vision for a financial website that provided witty, well-written content on a subscription basis to executives at Dow Jones. They liked the idea, but didn't want to give him a stake in the company, so Cramer pitched it to Martin Peretz, editor in chief and chairman of
   <i>
    The New Republic,
   </i>
   who had helped set Cramer up in the hedge-fund business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pair launched TheStreet.com in 1996; the fledgling company attracted advertisers such as American Express, IBM, and MCI. The following year it struck an industry coup by signing with ABC to provide financial news for the broadcaster's new website. At the close of 1997,
   <i>
    Barron's
   </i>
   included TheStreet.com on its list of top 10 investment websites.
  </p>
  <p>
   LEXIS-NEXIS veteran Kevin English was named president and CEO of the company in late 1998; he added the chairman title in early 1999. Their relationship growing increasingly acrimonious, Cramer and Peretz gave up running day-to-day operations (they remained directors, with Cramer an active contributor to the site).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 The New York Times Company invested $15 million in TheStreet.com, and the two set up a joint news operation (only to end it in late 2000). The company went public in May 1999. English later resigned as chairman and CEO; board member Fred Wilson took the chairman title, while former president and COO Thomas Clarke was named CEO. TheStreet.com also bought public offering information service ipoPros.com and branched into television with the debut of weekly investing program
   <i>
    TheStreet.com
   </i>
   on the FOX News Channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2000 the company launched a UK version of its site (which it sold later that year) and it signed a partnership agreement with News Digital Media (a unit of News Corp.) to expand news coverage and offer sports scores. Its partnership with FOX News went sour that year (FOX objected to Cramer's touting of TheStreet.com's stock on the air), leading to the end of
   <i>
    TheStreet.com
   </i>
   program and a breach of contract lawsuit. (The parties later settled the suit: TheStreet.com donated $10,000 to charity in FOX's name and agreed not to produce another television program until mid-2001.)
  </p>
  <p>
   With a difficult market for subscription-based content, TheStreet.com recast its flagship site as a free, ad-supported venture and launched RealMoney.com for its subscription-only content. The company also inked content deals with online financial network ON24 and book publisher Doubleday. In late 2000 the company acquired SmartPortfolio.com, an e-mail financial newsletter business. However, online ad revenue failed to stem the tide of losses and TheStreet.com was forced to lay off about 20% of its staff.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 editor-in-chief Dave Kansas, who had been with TheStreet.com since its beginning, resigned. He was replaced by
   <i>
    SmartMoney
   </i>
   editor David Morrow. Also that year CEO Clarke added chair to his title. Wilson remained on the company's board of directors. (He later left the board.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year COO James Lonergan was also named president. Also in 2002 TheStreet.com established a subsidiary, Independent Research Group (IRG Research), a proprietary equity research firm and broker-dealer for institutional clients. IRG, which began earning revenue in the form of commissions in 2003, made up the non-publishing operations of TheStreet.com and accounted for about 12% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 TheStreet.com hired New York investment bank
   <company id="51026">
    Allen &amp; Co.
   </company>
   to consider other strategic options for the company. The company discontinued IRG in 2005. The following year it discontinued its strategic alternative review process.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Weiss Ratings in 2006 from the Weiss Group and subsequently rebranded it TheStreet.com Ratings. The service provided independent ratings and evaluations of stocks, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and financial institutions such as insurers, healthcare providers, and banks. Also that year it launched online video network
   <em>
    TheStreet.com TV
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company purchased
   <company id="138277">
    Corsis Technology Services
   </company>
   , a provider of software and services for advertisers, marketers, and content publishers, for about $20 million. The deal was valuable in adding Corsis'
   <company id="60119">
    Promotions.com
   </company>
   (online promotions) into TheStreet.com fold. Other 2007 highlights include the purchases of Stockpickr.com and Bankers Financial Products Corp. (owner of BankingMyWay.com and Rate-Watch.com), and the launch of mobile.thestreet.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched a site redesign in 2008, using proceeds from a $55 million cash infusion made by
   <company id="100055">
    Technology Crossover Ventures
   </company>
   in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   TheStreet attempted to revitalize its leadership by separating the roles of chairman and chief executive. In 2008 it named co-founder James Cramer chairman, allowing Clarke, who formerly held both positions, to focus more on the CEO job during the economic downturn. However, Clarke left the company after failing to turn the business around. Daryl Otte was appointed CEO of the company in 2009. Otte had been an executive at
   <company id="101573">
    Ziff Davis
   </company>
   . TheStreet.com cut its workforce by 8% in 2009. At the end of that year, it sold its online marketing subsidiary Promotions.com for a meager $3.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company launched new mobile service TheStreet.mobi and new premium subscription service
   <em>
    Options Profits
   </em>
   (options-trading insight). Also that year it acquired a small mobile and interactive marketing company Kikucall, for about $1.75 million, in order to enhance its digital offerings. TheStreet sold Weiss Ratings (independent ratings and evaluations) back to the Weiss Group in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Private equity firm executive Christopher Marshall replaced Cramer as chairman in 2011. Later that year the company dropped the ".com".
