  <p>
   This can of worms was opened in 1848 when wholesaler Hypolite Worms lent his name to a company that began importing coal from England to France. Worms and other shareholders formed a limited partnership, Worms &amp; Cie, with Worms at the helm -- his descendants would lead for nearly 150 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   As France's demand for coal increased, Worms &amp; Cie grew. The company launched a shipping operation in 1856, and soon shipping became its main business. International expansion followed in 1869 when the company opened an office in Egypt. Hypolite Worms' nephew, Henri Goudchaux, continued to build up the shipping business. Following the industrial shift from coal to petroleum, in 1892 Worms &amp; Cie added the sale of the new fuel to its business through its ports in North Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hypolite Worms' grandson, also named Hypolite, assumed control and expanded the company beyond shipping, to include shipbuilding (1916), banking services (1928), and oceanic petroleum transportation. Worms &amp; Cie also provided investment capital to French businesses and began investing in insurance companies (1949).
  </p>
  <p>
   Postwar reconstruction during the 1950s led the company to expand its industrial financing of factories. Its banking business branched out to include real estate leasing in the mid-1960s. As its financial businesses grew, Worms &amp; Cie exited the shipbuilding business in 1966 but kept up its other maritime activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s Worms &amp; Cie gradually invested in companies as diverse as Dior, General Biscuit, and sugar producer Saint Louis, but banking had become its primary business. Nicholas Clive Worms, a fourth-generation family member, stepped up to lead the company in the early 1980s. When the government nationalized Banque Worms in 1982 (it became a subsidiary of a state-controlled insurer), the company was undeterred, and it formed another bank, Demachy Worms &amp; Cie, by the end of the decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Worms &amp; Cie's insurance businesses merged to form Athena Assurances in 1989 and grew to prominence. The company's investments were honed down to controlling shares in Saint Louis and Arjo Wiggins Appleton, a specialty paper manufacturing company with facilities in France and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The families, which held the company in limited partnership for nearly 150 years, chose to take it public in 1996. The move left the company vulnerable to a hostile takeover attempt in 1997 by French entrepreneur Francois Pinault, who was eyeing the Athena business. The company managed to fend off Pinault's advances only through the intervention of two longtime shareholders: Ifil, the holding company for the Fiat-owning Agnelli family; and insurance group Assurances Generales de France (AGF), which responded with offers of cash and stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the dust settled, AGF acquired Athena, and Worms &amp; Cie merged with Someal, a group consisting of Ifil, the founding families, and AGF. Nicholas handed leadership over to Dominique Auburtin but remained on the board. Having sold off its greatly diminished shipping and banking businesses in 1997, the company regrouped with its paper and sugar businesses at its center.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Worms &amp; Cie purchased the 60% of Arjo Wiggins Appleton that it didn't own and transferred its nearly 100% ownership of Saint Louis to Financi√®re Franklin Roosevelt in exchange for only 47% of that company's stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the worldwide paper industry downturn, Worms &amp; Cie sold its US subsidiary
   <company id="105122">
    Appleton Papers
   </company>
   in 2001 in an employee stock purchase, attempting to boost profits by unloading debt in non-core industries. In 2004, the company merged its Carbonless Europe subsidiary into ArjoWiggins' operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, Worms &amp; Cie officially became known as Sequana Capital, hoping the new name would better reflect the company's business strategy. By the end of the following year, the Agnelli family's Ifil Investments group (now
   <company id="99454">
    EXOR
   </company>
   ) reduced its ownership of Sequana Capital below 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sequana Capital sold virtually all its shares (it retained just 7%) in Permal Group to financial services firm
   <company id="10887">
    Legg Mason
   </company>
   in 2005. The next year, Sequana Capital divested its stake in SGS.
