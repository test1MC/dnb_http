   A member of the Mitsubishi
   <em>
    keiretsu
   </em>
   (set of companies with intertwining relationships and shareholdings), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) builds and supplies everything from nuclear power plants, bridges, and aircraft to engines, ships, and air conditioners to various industries and customers around the world. MHI operates through four business segments: Energy &amp; Environment, Commercial Aviation &amp; Transportation Systems, Integrated Defense &amp; Space Systems and Machinery, and Equipment &amp; Infrastructure. The company's core market is Japan, but it also does business in other parts of Asia, North America, Europe, Central and South America, Africa, and the Middle East.

   MHI operates through four reportable segments: Energy &amp; Environment, Commercial Aviation &amp; Transportation Systems, Integrated Defense &amp; Space Systems, and Machinery, Equipment &amp; Infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy &amp; Environment has expertise in the energy-related fields of thermal power, nuclear power, and renewable energy, supplying chemical plants and other industrial infrastructure elements. Commercial Aviation &amp; Transportation Systems delivers advanced land, sea, and air transportation systems, including commercial aircraft and ships and transit networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Integrated Defense &amp; Space Systems provides integrated land, sea, air, and space defense systems, including naval ships, military aircraft and helicopters, missile systems, torpedoes, rockets, and armored combat vehicles, as well as space-related services. Machinery, Equipment &amp; Infrastructure provides a wide range of equipment, including machinery, industrial plants, and social infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company is based in Tokyo, Japan, and has a presence in North America, South America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, China, Asia, Japan, and Oceania. Japan accounts for nearly 45% of its total revenue, and North America represents 20%.
  </p>

  <p>
   MHI's revenues increased marginally by 1% from 2014 to 2015, and operating income climbed by roughly 5% during that same time period. Throughout 2015, MHI experienced higher orders for thermal power generation systems and large-scale orders for chemical plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand remained strong for LNG and LPG carriers on the back of the shale gas revolution in the US in 2015. In addition, the company experienced robust demand for railway construction, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Machinery, and Equipment &amp; Infrastructure segment posted increased sales in 2015 largely due to the effect of business integration in metals machinery through the establishment of a joint venture company and the expanded scale of business in turbochargers, air-conditioning, refrigeration systems, and forklift trucks. It also experienced a spike in orders for major refurbishment work for environmental systems.

  <p>
   As the world continues to transition to a low-carbon society, MHI is trying to meet growing demand for gas turbines, especially as industrialized nations work to replace aging facilities in line with tougher environmental regulations. In more developed countries like the US, MHI is building gas and wind turbine assembly plants to expand its network of overseas production sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, MHI anticipates expanding the scale of its US business by 20% over the next 2 years, particularly in its compressor- and gas turbine-reliant segments within the categories of floating production, liquefied natural gas (LNG), plant modularization, carbon dioxide (CO2)-enhanced oil recovery, gas processing, and petrochemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017, MHI formed a dedicated Oil and Gas Division within its Houston-based subsidiary, supported by a 180,000-sq. ft. manufacturing and service facility. The new division will shorten the supply chain for US-based oil and gas clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Japan, the group's largest market by sales, MHI continues to receive orders for gas turbine combined-cycle thermal power plants to replace aging facilities.
