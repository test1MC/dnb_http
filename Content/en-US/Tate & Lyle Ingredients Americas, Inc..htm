   <company id="42402">
    Tate &amp; Lyle
   </company>
   , is one of a handful of producers that make high-fructose corn syrup -- the liquid sweetener used by virtually all soft-drink manufacturers in the world. Offering hundreds of nutritive sweeteners and industrial starches, the company is one of the largest corn refiners in the US. In addition to corn syrup, Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas manufactures sweeteners (including sucralose, the main ingredient in SPLENDA), acidulants, and animal-feed. The company also partners with bio-based materials businesses to produce such renewable products as farnesene, or Biofene.

   Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas supplies products derived from corn, including sweeteners, syrup, starches, food ingredients, savory flavors, ethanol, and animal feeds. Its parent (

   The parent company reported that in 2013 bulk corn sweeteners volumes decreased by 1% and sales decreased by 6% as the result of lower corn prices. It saw growth across all regions outside the US including (Latin America, where it continued to expand its business in the beverage and dairy segments).

  <p>
   The parent company's strategy for growth involves diversifying its portfolio of low-cost commodity base ingredients toward more value-added products. Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas boasts the company's largest corn processing plant on 430 acres in Illinois, surrounded by several supporting grain operations. The facility offers a prime opportunity to leverage the bulk ingredients business' expertise in commercial sugarcane fermentation for a range of green products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tat &amp; Lyle's strategy is to become a leading global provider of Speciality Food Ingredients through a focus on growth, using Bulk Ingredients for sustained cash generation to fuel this growth.

   Interest from development-stage enterprises has been picking up. In spring 2011 Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas inked a manufacturing deal with
   <company id="162509">
    Genomatica
   </company>
   to set aside a demonstration-scale production plant for expanding the Bio-butanediol (Bio-BDO) process. Bio-BDO, a petroleum alternative, is used in spandex, urethane foams, and thermoplastics. Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas a few months earlier, contracted with
   <company id="161729">
    Amyris
   </company>
   , another renewable products developer, to produce farnesene. Amyris will sell the farnesene directly for industrial applications or apply a finishing step to form a variety of other sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concurrently, Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas took another step away from the bulk ingredients business by selling off certain operations. In mid-2011 it completed the sale of its Fort Dodge, Iowa, corn wet mill ethanol facility to food and industrial products giant
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   for approximately $57.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded as A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company in 1898, it changed its name to Tate &amp; Lyle Ingredients Americas, LLC in 2005. The company was founded in 1898.
