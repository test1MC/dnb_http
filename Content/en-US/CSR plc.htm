   In 2009, CSR merged with
   <company id="60938">
    SiRF Technology Holdings
   </company>
   in a stock-swap transaction valued at $136 million. The deal combined CSR's Bluetooth connectivity business with SiRF's Global Positioning System (GPS) location business to create a company positioning itself to capitalize on a large and growing multi-function consumer electronics market. Previous CSR shareholders own about 73% of the combined company. SiRF's headquarters in San Jose, California, became CSR's US headquarters.

   CSR made another move in 2010 to improve its ability to address the need for increased functionality in mobile devices when it bought Belfast-based partner APT Licensing. The deal added digital audio signal compression technology to CSR's portfolio. APT specialized in streaming audio for consumer electronics such as cell phones. It had licensing agreements with
