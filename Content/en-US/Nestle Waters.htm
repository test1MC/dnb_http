  <p>
   Despite the bottled water giant's breadth of offerings and global presence, it has to be innovative to counter rising commodity costs and fluctuating currency exchange rates as well as pricing pressure from rivals and challenging economic conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Part of this has to do with improving its image in order to help protect or gain market share. Nestlé Waters is working to alleviate consumers' concern about the environmental impact of plastic bottles, which, depending on their size, can take anywhere from 450 to 1,000 years to fully biodegrade. Among the company's efforts, it has undertaken a multi-year program to reduce the weight of its packaging.

   In 2013 Pulmuone Waters, a joint venture between the company and
   <company id="161516">
    Pulmuone
   </company>
   , opened a new $53 million  bottled water factory in South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company acquired the mineral water spring Vale do Sol and its assets, located in the city of Silva Jardim. This project involves the total investment of R$ 117 million, which will warrant the sustainability and growth of Nestlé's water business in the Brazilian market, especially in the State of Rio de Janeiro where it already owns Água Mineral Petrópolis.
