   A day on the water for you is a day at the office for Marine Products. The company builds recreational powerboats, mainly though its Chaparral subsidiary. Its lineup includes fiberglass sterndrive and inboard deckboats, cruisers, and sport yachts, ranging from 18 feet to 42 feet. Marine Products also makes a line of freshwater/saltwater sport fishing boats, known for their "unsinkable hull," through subsidiary Robalo. Boats are sold to a network of about 230 independent dealers who then sell the lines to retail customers. The US generates the majority of the company's sales.

  <p>
   Headquartered at Atlanta, the company sells its products to clients in Europe, South America, Asia, Russia, the Middle East, and the US. Sales outside of the US accounted for 11% of its sales in 2015.

  <p>
   Marine Products leverages a network of roughly 60 Chaparral dealers, 25 Robalo dealers, and 64 dealers selling both brands throughout the US. Oversees its boats are sold through some 85 international dealers.

  <p>
   As the economy has gradually recovered, Marine Products has achieved explosive growth over the years. Its total sales increased 21% from $171 million in 2014 to $207 million in 2015. Profits also surged 60% from $9 million in 2014 to $14 million in 2015. (Both these totals represented its highest amounts in at least eight years.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2015 was primarily due to a 23% increase in the number of boats sold. Unit sales increased due to higher sales of its Robalo outboard sport fishing boats, as well as increased unit sales of its Chaparral Vortex jet boats and Suncoast outboards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its trending revenue and net income, Marine Products' operating cash flow surged by 51% from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   With a health level of cash from operations and increasing production, the company anticipates replenishing dealer inventories, now normalizing from their historic low levels. Simultaneously, it aims to enhance dealer offerings and spur retail purchases by manufacturing more models with standard features and fewer options.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marine Products has recently launched new Chaparral and Robalo models: the Chaparral H2O Sport and Fish &amp; Ski Boats and the Robalo R180 and R200. The new models are more affordable with a small number of standard features. They adhere to the company's strategy to produce lower-priced, entry level models appealing to a value-conscious consumer.
