   Like its namesake Hephaestus (Greek god of blacksmiths), Hephaestus Holdings hopes to forge a new business out of industrial technology. The company looks to invest in companies in industrial technology, whip them into shape and make them more valuable. Hephaestus starts with the premise that industrial tech companies are undervalued and that wise deals can be made. Its investments range from full control to significant stakes with which it can influence a company's strategy. The company began the investment path in 2010 when it sold its robotic automation systems. ITI Industrial Investments (UK) holds a 29% stake in Hephaestus.

  <p>
   Hephaestus reported a 78% increase in revenue, rising to £8.4 million in 2015 as it bought companies and brought them into its holding company. The company recorded a £100,000 profit in 2015, compared to a $100,000 loss in 2014.

   An example of the industrial technology Hephaestus is looking for was Flaretec Alloys &amp; Equipment and Flaretec Engineering Services, which Hephaestus acquired in 2014. Flaretec specializes in the design, build, and project management of process pipework fabrications, skid packages, pressure vessels and both fired and unfired heaters for the oil, gas and process industries. Hephaestus invested in Flaretec to build an integrated, full-service engineering and fabricating operation.

   Hephaestus added to its plan when it acquired Haycock &amp; Hague Pipework Systems Limited and a 50% stake in Zennergy UK. The combination of the three companies enables Hephaestus to offer a full scope of range of services from blind pipework fabricating and assembly of skid packages, through mechanical, electrical and control system design all the way through to process design (using in-house process IP) and final services including installation, commissioning and start-up, site services, and maintenance.
