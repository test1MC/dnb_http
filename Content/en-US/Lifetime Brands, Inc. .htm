  <p>
   Lifetime Brands rings up nearly 90% of its sales in the US. The consumer products maker has operations in China, Hong Kong, the US, and the UK.

  <p>
   While the wholesale segment accounts for about 95% of Lifetime Brands' total sales, the company does sells a limited selection of products through several branded (Pfaltzgraff, Mikasa, Lifetime Sterling, and Housewares Deals) e-commerce sites.

  <p>
   Wal-Mart Stores (including Sam's Club and ASDA stores in the UK) accounted for 16% of Lifetime Brands' net sales in 2012, making it the consumer products maker's largest customer. Historically, Wal-Mart typically generated closer to 20% of Lifetime's sales, but the world's largest retailer has cut back its ordering amid the rollout of a revised inventory management plan. (As part of the plan, Walmart stores have been displaying fewer products on their shelves.)

  <p>
   The company's sales increased nearly 10% in 2012 vs. 2011, while net income jumped 49% over the same period. (The double-digit sales increase followed an essentially flat previous annual comparison.) With 2012 sales approaching $487 million, Lifetime Brands is closing in on its all-time high of $494 million in 2007.

  <p>
   The firm has put itself back on the growth track by keeping expenses under control amid improving demand. More recently, Lifetime has begun seeking to form alliances with suppliers based outside the US to help expand its own brands' international presence. In 2012 Lifetime Brands formed a 50:50 joint venture, called Grand Venture Holdings, with China's Manweal Development Ltd. to distribute Mikasa products in China. Previously it added about $20 million to its balance sheet, thanks to its 30% ownership of and dealings with Mexican housewares distributor Grupo Vasconia.

  <p>
   Another essential element for growth is new product development and innovation. The company launched more than 3,600 new and redesigned products in 2012, and it plans to roll out another 4,000 redesigned items in 2013. Lifetime's goods are sourced from more than 400 suppliers, a majority of them located in China. Most of its sterling silver items are made in Puerto Rico.

  <p>
   In late 2012 Lifetime Brands acquired Rhode Island-based Fred and Friends, a designer and marketer of novelty housewares and other products, for $21.4 million. The purchase expanded the company's kitchenware offering to include innovative kitchen tools, tabletop accessories, party goods, and more. Around the same time it also bought Creative Tops Holdings and Creative Tops Far East Ltd. for £14.8 million ($23.7 million).
  </p>

   Adding to its collection of kitchen gadgets, Lifetime Brands in 2011 embarked on an international shopping spree, with stops in Brazil, the UK, Canada, and beyond. In December the firm acquired a 40% stake in Brazil's GS International (GSI). GSI distributes branded housewares in Brazil. A month earlier it bought Creative Tops Ltd. and its supplier Hong Kong-based Creative Tops Far East Ltd. UK-based Creative Tops is a leading wholesaler of tableware, kitchenware and giftware in England. In a previous effort to strengthen its retail reach, Lifetime Brands established a direct import company with Grupo Vasconia and two other housewares distributors in Europe and Canada in early 2011. The firms named their coalition Housewares Corporation of Asia, basing the operation in Hong Kong. Housewares Corporation targets retailers in North, Central, and South America and markets its founders' brands to retailers that prefer to work with factories directly.
