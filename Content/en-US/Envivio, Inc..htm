   You could say Envivio is the middleman between content providers and consumers of video. The company designs and sells an Internet Protocol (IP) video processing and distribution product that helps deliver high-quality content, such as broadcast and on-demand video, to audiences via PCs, TVs, laptops, and mobile devices. The software-based system runs on industry-standard hardware and consists of encoders, transcoders, network media processors, and gateways. Envivio's customers include cable TV and mobile service providers in 50 countries. It sells through a direct sales force and a global distribution network of systems integrators like telecom equipment makers. Envivio went public in 2012 and in 2015 agreed to be acquired by

   and

    Cisco

   ) to assist with sales to Tier-1 customers and to manage sales into Tier-2 and Tier-3 customers. Channel partners often act as a general contractor for network deployments and will use Envivio's products to fulfill the video infrastructure elements of a deployment.

   The company has experienced fluctuating revenues over the years. Overall sales grew 10% in fiscal 2014 to $43 million, still less than its $50 million record of 2012. The uptick in 2014 sales was driven by large orders from existing customers due to growing market acceptance of software-based products for multiscreen video processing and increased market demand. Profits were trimmed to -$12 million (down from -$17 million in 2013) after it cut operating expenses. As such, Envivio has also experienced a negative cash flow for the past two years.

  <p>
   Founded in 2000 by a small group of engineers from French telecom
   <company id="43307">
    Orange
   </company>
   , Envivio began as an inventor of video encoding technology. Much of the subsequent decade was spent on developing a software-based architecture for processing and distributing IP video to video-enabled devices at the highest quality possible. At that time Envivio's software-based approach was a novel strategy, as most existing technologies processed and distributed video via hardware products that transferred video over a fixed format to standard TVs. These hardware products generally focused on improving quality of video but didn't address the challenges of dealing with multiple formats, devices, and networks. Envivio says it designed its system with flexibility in mind to move with the changing landscape of formats, technologies, and capabilities, especially among mobile devices.
