   Pinnacle Foods Finance (PFF) holds a mouthful of big-name brands. The operating company of Pinnacle Foods, PFF company makes, markets, and distributes the
   <company id="106836">
    Birds Eye
   </company>
   frozen food line, Duncan Hines line of baking mixes and frostings, Snyder of Berlin snack foods, and other grocery brands. The company also offers food service and private-label services. Its product lines, sold predominantly through major US retailers like
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and top grocery-store chains, hold top market-share positions across several food product categories. In 2013
   <company id="162901">
    Pinnacle Foods

   became a publicly traded company.

  <p>
   The US is PFF's largest market, accounting for 97% of sales. The rest is rung up in Canada.

   The company distributes its products throughout the US and in Canada, mainly through a national broker to supermarkets and other retail food operations.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   is PFF's largest customer, typically accounting for 26% of total sales. PFF also sells through club stores, as well as private-label, military, and food service channels. Operations are supported by a product-development center, 13 US manufacturing and warehouse facilities, and more than 40 US and Canadian distribution centers.

  <p>
   PFF's brands rang up a collective $2.5 billion in sales in 2014, an essentially flat comparison (down less than 1%) with 2013, mostly on weakness in Birds Eye. Net income, however, rose by $36 million due to company cuts to its R&amp;D efforts. Cash from operations followed net income and rose slightly to $59 million due to lower depreciation and amortization expenses.

  <p>
   The 2009 acquisition of Birds Eye transformed PFF from largely a dry foods producer to a Goliath in both the frozen and shelf-stable food market segments. It picked up the US's #1 market share for both the frozen vegetable and frozen bagged meal categories. In addition to frozen veggies and single-serve frozen meals, PFF also gained Birds Eye's successful pie filling, snack, soup, and salad dressing products. Birds Eye was acquired from a holding company controlled by
   <company id="56734">
    Vestar Capital Partners
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="42633">
    Pro-Fac Cooperative
   </company>
   , and members of Birds Eye Foods' management in a $670 million deal paid for by Blackstone.
  </p>
  <p>
   PFF's growth strategy includes putting most of its resources behind its leadership brands, defined as those brands that hold the #1 or #2 spot in their categories. Leadership brands belonging to the Birds Eye Frozen division include Birds Eye, Birds Eye Viola!, Van de Kamp's, Mrs. Paul's, Hungry Man, Aunt Jemima, Lender's, and Celeste. Those under the Duncan Hines Grocery umbrella include Duncan Hines, Vlasic, Mrs. Butterworth's, Log Cabin, Armour, Nalley, Brooks, Comstock, Wilderness, Open Pit, and Bernstein's. These core brands benefit from about 80% of the company's marketing investment and the majority of its product innovation investment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focused on becoming a more efficient operator. It has consolidated all of its R&amp;D functions at a new facility at its Parsippany, New Jersey headquarters, and closed a location in Green Bay, Wisconsin. It has also consolidated production for its Wish-Bone salad dressing line, acquired in 2013, while making investments in new equipment and plant infrastructure.

   PFF toyed briefly with the idea of being acquired by fellow food producer
   <company id="162837">
    Hillshire Brands
   </company>
   in 2014 but the deal fell through.
  </p>

   In 2013 PFF purchased the Wish-Bone salad dressings business from Unilever for $575 million. The following year it agreed to buy Canadian plant-based protein manufacturer Garden Protein International for C$175 million.

   In order to raise cash to pay down its $1.2 billion in debt, in 2002 the former Aurora Foods announced it was selling of some of its frozen foods businesses, namely Van de Kamp's and Mrs. Paul's frozen seafood, Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products, Celeste frozen Pizza, and Chef's Choice frozen skillet meals to an undisclosed buyer. In 2003 the deal fell through.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2003 the
   <company id="41286">
    NYSE
   </company>
   suspended trading in and applied to the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   to delist the common stock of the former Aurora as a result of its prenegotiated bankruptcy restructuring deal with
   <company id="100559">
    J.W. Childs
   </company>
   . The stock exchange said the company failed to reach the required standards for continued listing and was operating under a recovery plan to comply with such standards. The company said it would not contest the NYSE decision and began trading on the
   <company id="125447">
    OTC Bulletin Board
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsequently, the company revised its restructuring plan with J.W. Childs whereby Aurora was combined with Pinnacle Foods Corporation (which Childs acquired from
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (then known as Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst). Dean Metropoulos, CEO of Pinnacle, became chairman and CEO of the newly created Pinnacle Foods Group. The 2004 merger of Pinnacle and Aurora added Swanson and Hungry-Man frozen dinners, Lender's bagels, Open Pit Barbecue sauces, and Vlasic pickles to the company's product list. After the merger, the company renamed itself Pinnacle Foods Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the completed merger, Aurora's St. Louis headquarters were shut down and integrated into Pinnacle's New Jersey corporate operations. In 2005 the company shut down its Erie, Pennsylvania, production plant leaving it with seven.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Pinnacle acquired the Armour foods business from
   <company id="52370">
    The Dial Corporation
   </company>
   , paying $183 million in cash. Products involved in the sale included Armour brand canned, potted, and dried meats and sausage, and Appian Way pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinnacle was acquired in 2007 by Blackstone for some $2 billion in cash and assumed debt and changed its name to Pinnacle Foods Finance. Former
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   CEO Roger Deromedi became Pinnacle's chairman. Jeffrey Ansell, a 25-year veteran of
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   , was appointed as new CEO. Prior to the Blackstone buyout, Pinnacle was jointly owned by affiliates of J.P. Morgan Partners (now known as
   <company id="153771">
    CCMP Capital Advisors
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="100559">
    J.W. Childs Associates
   </company>
   , the CDM Group, and former bondholders of Aurora Foods Inc. (CDM is an investment company controlled by Metropoulos.)
