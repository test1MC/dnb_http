   Spirax-Sarco Engineering can't run out of steam -- it's one of the world's leading makers of flowmeters, temperature and pressure controls, and steam traps for control of steam and industrial fluids. The company operates through two businesses: its Spirax-Sarco division manufactures commercial and industrial steam systems, while Watson-Marlow makes specialized peristaltic pumps that move chemicals, waste, and other fluids without contaminating either the pump or the substance being transported. Customers include the air-conditioning and heating, oil refining, chemical, pharmaceutical, plastic and rubber, food, and textile industries. A majority of its sales come from non-UK countries.

  <p>
   Spirax-Sarco is the larger of the two divisions, generating over three quarters of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in Cheltenham, UK, the company has over 75 operating units in 40-plus countries, and a direct sales presence in 55.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company serves over 100,000 customers in sectors including Food &amp; Beverage, Pharmaceutical &amp; Biopharmaceutical, Oil &amp; Petrochemical, Chemical, and Pulp &amp; Paper. Watson-Marlow pumps and tubing are widely used in the Mining &amp; Precious Metal Processing, Water &amp; Wastewater and Chemical industries
  </p>
  <p>
   Around three quarters of revenue is generated through direct sales; the remainder come from sales to distributors. Sales to original equipment manufacturers account for around 17% of the total.

   In 2015, sales took a 5% hit, coming in at £667.2 million for the year. Sales to Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell, partly as a consequence of the sale of M&amp;M International (Italy). Net income fell £3.8 million to £96.7 million, in line with the drop in sales. However, cash flow from operating activities was up 15% to £130.3 million due to changes in trade and other receivables.

  <p>
   The company is pursuing growth by tightening its sales operations (it set up a direct sales office in India), broadening its geographic reach, and improving its supply chain. In 2015, Spirax-Sarco established steam operations in Egypt and Peru, and set up Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group, which trades n Taiwan and Chile.

  <p>
   The company's Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group acquired California-based Asepco for around £7 million. Asepco designs and manufactures high purity aseptic valves and magnetic mixers intended for the bioprocessing industry. The acquisition expands Spirax-Sarco's product range.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, Spirax-Sarco also bought its Colombian distributor's (Casaval S.A.) steam distribution business for some £6.5 million.

  <p>
   In 1910 Clement Wells, an employee of London's Sanders Rehders &amp; Co. (Sarco) set up Sarco Co. Inc. in New York to make steam traps and temperature regulators. After establishing a customer base in the US, he began exporting his traps and regulators to Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the Depression exporting became impractical, and in 1932 Spirax Manufacturing Co. Ltd. started operations in London to serve European customers. The company moved to Cheltenham and acquired Wells' old company -- going under the Sarco Thermostats name -- in 1937. In 1959 the company went public as Spirax-Sarco Engineering. The circle was completed in 1983 when Spirax-Sarco Engineering acquired the original US parent company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the peristaltic-pump business in 1990 by acquiring Watson-Marlow (UK). Six years later it bought Dutch pump maker Bredel Holdings, roughly doubling the size of its pump business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Spirax-Sarco moved its Allentown, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facility to Columbia, South Carolina, to try to cut labor costs; expenses and production delays associated with the move hurt profits that fiscal year. Spirax-Sarco boosted its presence in the market for pumps used for high-precision manufacturing by acquiring Sweden-based Alitea in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spirax-Sarco agreed to supply steam system equipment to food manufacturer Patak (UK) in early 2001. The company expanded its steam business in 2002 with the acquisition of Brisbane, Australia-based Marford Feedwater Treatment (Aust.) Pty Ltd., a supplier of boiler feedwater and cooling tower chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company expanded the product manufacturing capabilities of Watson-Marlow when it acquired Netherlands-based Flexicon (which included Flexicon America). In addition to the expanded manufacturing capabilities, the move expanded the company's presence in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.
