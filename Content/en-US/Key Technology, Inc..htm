   When good french fries go bad, Key Technology can sort out the problem. The company makes food and material processing automation equipment under brand names such as Manta, Tegra, and Optyx. Its electro-optical automated inspection, sorting, and product preparation systems can be used to evaluate fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, potato chips, and other snacks. Items can be sorted by color, size, and shape to identify defective or inconsistent products for removal. The company also makes conveyor and sorting systems for the tobacco, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and coffee industries.

   Key Technology divides its operations across three main product lines: automated inspection systems (43% of total sales), process systems (37%), and parts and services (20%). In addition, the company's line solutions product line offers project management and engineering expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its five subsidiaries include Key Technology Holdings USA LLC; Key Technology Australia Pty Ltd.; Productos Key Mexicana S. de R. L. de C.V.; Key Technology (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd.; and Key Technology Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd.

  <p>
   The company markets its equipment worldwide both directly and through independent sales representatives. Its international sales offices (Key Technology B.V. and Visys N.V.) provide sales and service to European, Middle Eastern, Indian, and African customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key Technology Australia Pty Ltd. provides sales and service to customers primarily in Australia and New Zealand, and Productos Key Mexicana S. de R.L. de C.V. provides sales and service to customers in Mexico, and Central, and South America.

  <p>
   Key Technology enjoyed unprecedented growth from 2012 to 2013 as revenues jumped 19% from $115 million to peak at a record-setting $137 million. Profits also skyrocketed from $500,000 in 2012 to $4 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2013 was driven by a rise in sales across all its segments: automated inspection systems (27%), process systems (13%), and parts and service (13%). Domestic sales also jumped 18%, while international sales spiked 20%. Automated inspection systems experienced higher demand within the potato market, while process systems experienced higher demand of vibratory products in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its soaring net income for 2013 was due to a higher mix of higher margin automated inspection system sales and the product mix within automated inspection systems. It was also aided by more efficient factory utilization.

  <p>
   In order to facilitate further growth in international markets, the company is expanding its geographic foothold in regions such as Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. It also continues to pursue growth in China, which is a main consumer for the company's tobacco sorters. Additionally, Key Technology is investing in its aftermarket product lines, including parts, service, and upgrades for its existing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other growth strategies center on producing new systems for non-food applications to reduce its dependence on the food industry. Key Technology has, for instance, been expanding its soft gel and tablet sorter product offerings to its pharmaceutical customers.

  <p>
   Key Technology also grows through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it purchased Visys NV, a Belgian supplier of high-end digital sensor-based optical sorters, for $21 million. The combination of Key Technology and Visys created a more robust source of high-performance, digital sorting technologies available for the food processing and other industrial markets. Visys continues to operate in Hasselt, Belgium, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Key Technology.

  <p>
   In 1948 vegetable farmer Claude Key set up Key Equipment Co. as a vegetable processing equipment company. He sold the firm to computer components maker
   <company id="10123">
    Applied Magnetics
   </company>
   in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1982 the company introduced its automated defect-removal system, a computer-aided monitoring and food processing conveyor system for selecting and removing defective french fries. A year later an investment group led by Madsen bought Key Equipment and renamed it Key Technology. A second automated system was launched in 1987, and the next year Key Technology introduced ColorSort, a system for sorting vegetables. The company went public in 1993 and debuted its AccuScan quality monitoring system that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key Technology expanded its presence in Europe through the 1996 acquisition of Netherlands-based Superior B.V. (conveyor systems). That year the company diversified its offerings by purchasing a drug-inspection system product line from
   <company id="15516">
    ONCOR
   </company>
   . Key Technology also introduced its Tegra automated inspection system in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed Key Technology Financial Services to offer financing with GE Capital in 1997. Key Technology stumbled a bit that year when problems in its Tegra systems prompted modifications. In 1998 the company developed new Tegra applications for processing coffee beans, tobacco, spinach, and cherries.
  </p>
  <p>
   A plan to buy Allen Machinery's electronics division fell through in 2000, but Key Technology did buy Farmco (produce sorting equipment) and Advanced Machine Vision Corporation, which added machine vision companies SRC Vision (automated inspection and defect removal systems for food processing and industrial applications) and Ventek (inspection and process control systems for the plywood and wood panel industries). Key Technology later sold Ventek in 2001 to help pay down its debt of more than $20 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Key Technology's gross profit margin increased when the company improved its parts and field service operations. The following year, Thomas Madsen, chairman and CEO, retired after serving as CEO since 1982. He remained chairman until 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Key Technology formed a company called InspX with Peco Controls to make X-ray inspection systems.
