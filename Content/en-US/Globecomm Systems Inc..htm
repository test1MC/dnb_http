   Globecomm Systems provides communications networking services, as well as network infrastructure design and installation. The company's services segment, its largest, includes data, voice, and video transport; hosted mobile switching; engineering consulting; and network installation, monitoring, and maintenance. The infrastructure segment involves the design, assembly, and installation of satellite earth stations, complete uplink centers, and media broadcast centers. Globecomm also builds Internet protocol-based communications networks. It was acquired in late 2013 by investment firm Wasserstein &amp; Co.

   Globecomm reported in two segments, services and infrastructure. Services, which accounted for more than 60% of revenue, includes Managed Network Services; Application Services; Professional Services; and Lifecycle Support Services. The infrastructure segment designs, assembles, and installs ground segment systems and networks, including pre-engineered products and custom systems design and integration product lines.

  <p>
   The company, which has historically done much of its business overseas (US sales accounted for less than one-third of revenues in 2005, for example), built its domestic business up to account for more than half of sales. This was made possible by increased sales to the US government. In fiscal 2013, the US generated more than 45% of sales (down from 57% in 2012). The Middle East contributed about 30% of sales in 2013.

   Globecomm's revenue dropped to about $320 million in 2013 from about $382 million in 2012. Part of the decline was due to the US winding down military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Revenue in 2012 had been boosted by a sale of almost $13 million. Net income tumbled nearly 50% in 2013, because of lower sales. Cash flow from operations also dropped, down to about $36 million from about $48 million in 2012.

   Globecomm is moving to take advantage of changes in the technology and communications fields, particularly in its focus on machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and its role in moving big data. The company intends to move to provide higher value services to provide services for managing data and logistics. It also seeks to use its communications expertise to move from its current vertical markets -- media, wireless, maritime, enterprise, and government -- into others such as those engaged in resource extraction.

  <p>
   In 2014, Globecomm expanded its IP-based communications services signing $17 million worth of deals. It will provide high-definition digital broadcast technologies to an Asian broadcaster and to a major state university system in the US. The systems include a wide range of systems, services, and equipment.

   Although its business with US military waned along with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Globecomm extended a contract with NATO for an additional $9.6 million. The organization's Communications and Information Agency will use Globecomm's GPS-based Force Tracking System. With the system, NATO can identify positions of its personnel and other multi-national, assisting with identification of friendly forces.
