   You may not be able to say this company's name, but you've almost surely heard of some of its products. Founded in 1885, Boehringer develops, makes, and markets medications for humans and animals. Known for its over-the-counter remedies Zantac and Dulcolax, as well as prescription Flomax for enlarged prostate, it makes a host of other products as well as fine chemicals and pet medications. Prescription drugs include treatments for respiratory ailments, hypertension, HIV, and depression. Boehringer also offers cold, gastrointestinal, and pain remedies, as well as vaccines, drugs, and nutritionals for farm animals and pets. The founding Boehringer family controls the firm through parent C.H. Boehringer Sohn.

  <p>
   Sales of prescription pharmaceuticals account for the bulk of the company's revenue. Its prescription products include branded blockbuster drugs such as Flomax, hypertension treatment Micardis, Parkinson's drug Mirapex, and respiratory treatment Spiriva, as well as generic pharmaceuticals made for the US market by subsidiaries
   <company id="100385">
    Roxane Laboratories
   </company>
   and Bedford Laboratories (part of
   <company id="108892">
    Ben Venue Laboratories
   </company>
   ). It also makes stroke-prevention medication Pradaxa and Trajenta, a treatment for type 2 diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Chemicals unit makes active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates used in drugmaking. Its Biopharmaceuticals segment also provides contract manufacturing of biological products for third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boehringer's growing Animal Health segment makes vaccines and other therapies for both livestock and pets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group operates around the world with 142 affiliates and more than 47,000 employees. Since 2003, Boehringer has conducted or sponsored more than 1,370 studies (with around 1 million patients) on some 120 substances in about 100 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in about 50 countries around the world. Along with prescription drugs, the company makes over-the-counter (OTC)  products, including heartburn reliever Zantac, Dulcolax laxative, and muscle relaxer Buscopan. Europe is the largest market for the company's non-prescription products.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2013, most of the company's sales were generated in the Americas (46%), followed by Europe (30%) and Asia, Australia, and Africa (24%). Its largest markets are the US, Japan, and Germany. Europe was the group's growth leader that year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013, Prescription Medicines accounted for 77% of the company's revenue. Consumer Health Care represented 10% of earnings, while Animal Health, Biopharmaceuticals, and Industrial Customers and Other accounted for 8%, 3%, and 2%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue decreased 6% to €15.2 billion in 2013; dragging sales of micardis (of which the company lost exclusive rights to in certain markets) led to a 5% decrease in the Prescription Medicines segment that year. Consumer Health Care declined 2%, largely as a result of currency exchange rates in Japan, and Biopharmaceuticals sales fell 18% as the segment suffered weaker contract manufacturing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income grew 7% in 2013 as operating expenses (third-party R&amp;D services, etc.) declined. Meanwhile, cash flow from operations fell 16% to €351 million as a result of an increase in cash used in accounts receivable and other assets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has so far bucked the consolidation trend in the drug industry, choosing to remain independent and banking on efficient drug R&amp;D and organic growth. The strategy has produced a steady stream of successful drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoping to continue its commercial success, Boehringer Ingelheim has a wide range of drug hopefuls in clinical and preclinical development. Its development efforts focus on seven therapeutic categories: central nervous system conditions, cardiovascular disease, immune/inflammatory conditions, metabolic disease, cancer, respiratory disease, and virology. Among its key pipeline projects are lung cancer treatments Tovok and Vargatef, anticoagulant Pradaxa, and medications for hypoactive sexual desire disorder and diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company manufactures a limited number of proprietary biopharmaceuticals, it is seeking, and finding, significant growth in that area. Its Biopharmaceuticals unit is expanding its internal development of biologics and it has in-licensed technologies from smaller drug discovery firms in pursuit of that goal.
  </p>
  <p>
   For traditional pharmaceuticals, it has partnered with other firms and research organizations, including Vitae Pharmaceuticals, with which it is working on type 2 diabetes treatments. It has also agreed to buy US firm Actimis Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an asthma treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boehringer inked a deal with France's
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   in mid-2016 through which the companies will swap business units. Sanofi will get Boehringer's OTC operations, while Boehringer will gain Sanofi's
   <company id="112833">
    Merial
   </company>
   animal health business. Merial carries a number of animal health brands including Frontline, Heartgard, and Broadline; the exchange will make Boehringer the second-largest animal drug manufacturer in the world. Boehringer will also pay Sanofi an additional €4.7 billion in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   It wasn't the first agreement between Sanofi and Boehringer. In 2015 the company entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with the Paris-based firm, through which it will support production of Sanofi's biologics pipeline. In a separate partnership established in 2014, Boehringer and CureVac will collaborate to develop CureVac's CV9202 vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer. Similarly, the company is working with Hydra Biosciences to develop treatments for the treatment of central nervous system diseases and disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to withdraw from generics, Boehringer agreed to sell generics business Roxane to
   <company id="147742">
    Hikma Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $2.65 billion in 2015. As part of the transaction, Boehringer will gain a 17% stake in Hikma (which will become the sixth-largest supplier of generics in the US).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its ongoing corporate restructuring, the company announced plans to lay off 724 employees in the US in 2016. Those cuts follow another round of layoffs in 2014, which included 900 employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company received regulatory approvals for or introduced into new markets such medications as Giotrif, Pradaxa, and Striverdi, and it expanded its portfolio of gastrointestinal treatments with the launch of diarrhea medication Vaprino. Boehringer also gained European approval for three new veterinary drugs that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boehringer announced in 2014 plans to invest more than €100 million at its Dortmund, Germany, manufacturing facility to increase production of its Respimat inhaler.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Boehringer Ingelheim's foundation is in a chemical business Christian Friedrich Boehringer formed in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1817. Almost 70 years later his grandson Albert started his own factory in Ingelheim to manufacture tartaric acid salts for drug and dye makers. Boehringer Ingelheim entered the drug business directly with Albert's 1895 discovery of a process to produce lactic acid from bacteria.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company grew during the early decades of the 20th century by expanding its products to include atropine, codeine, morphine, and other drugs. The French occupation of the Rhineland in the early 1920s presented the company with the opportunity to build a second plant (near Hamburg). Albert died in 1939.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII slowed both product development and production, but the economic boom after the war allowed Boehringer to focus on developing therapies for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory diseases. It began expanding beyond Germany, focusing first on neighboring European countries by opening offices or making acquisitions, and later moving into North and South America and select Asian countries. By the 1960s the firm's holdings around the world operated fairly autonomously.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1971 Hubertus Liebrecht became chairman. During his tenure, the drug industry underwent many changes, but his bureaucratic administration made the company fall behind. While the firm focused on the emerging biotechnology field, German laws restricting biotech research prevented it from keeping pace. Boehringer partnered with such firms as
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14081">
    Isis Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to continue its work outside Germany in the 1980s. The company also grew by purchasing smaller niche firms and laboratories, as well as by opening subsidiaries in new and existing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Liebrecht's death in 1991, the company began to make up for ground lost under his autocratic reign: Boehringer began rationalizing operations in Spain, Japan, the US, and other countries in the late 1990s. It expanded operations into former Communist countries as well as into growing Asian countries, where the company suffered decreased sales due to the economic woes of the late 1990s.
