   A pioneer of the green products movement, Shaklee produced one of the first biodegradable household cleansers in 1960 and has rolled out several more since. To this end, the company has invested more than $250 million in research and development. Each year it completes more than 83,000 tests to ensure quality and publishes more than 100 scientific papers. Shaklee is also recognized as a climate-neutral company, meaning that it completely offsets its carbon dioxide emissions.

   The company plans to expand its global presence to 50 countries during the next decade. The Asia/Pacific region offers the most promise, as Shaklee generates about one-third of sales from operations in Malaysia and Japan. It has served China since 2009 by establishing a headquarters in Beijing, a service center, two production facilities, and about 20 distribution outlets. It most recently expanded to Indonesia.

   Shaklee also works to keep its portfolio of products fresh. In 2013, for instance, it rolled out Shaklee 180, a line of meal replacement shakes that contain Leucine.
