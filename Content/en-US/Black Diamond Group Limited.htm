   Black Diamond Group Limited is helping the energy industry to think outside the box. Operating through subsidiaries, the holding company rents and sells prefabricated modular structures primarily used in remote drilling, mining, and energy production sites in Canada, the US, and Australia. Subsidiary Black Diamond Structures offers dormitory-style residential accommodations for employees living at a worksite, while Black Diamond Logistics manages the lodging sites. US-based BOXX Modular manufactures wood- and steel-framed temporary structures used by government and commercial enterprises. Black Diamond Energy Services rents oilfield equipment such as tanks, pumps, water storage, and living quarters.

  <p>
   The group operates four main business segments. The Structures segment (which generated 57% of Black Diamond's total revenue in 2014) operates through Black Diamond Structures which builds the modular structures. Logistics (31% of revenue) operates through Black Diamond Logistics, which manages remote lodging facilities (mostly in Western Canada) including the Sunday Creek Lodge and the Horn River Lodge. Energy Services (8% of revenue) provides accommodation fleets for drill camps, geologist/engineer quarters and staff quarters. Finally, International (4% of revenue) provides modular structures for workforces in Australia and other locations outside of North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary BOXX Modular manufactures residential and commercial structures at a plant outside Dallas. Its products include office units, restrooms, storage units, large multi-unit office complexes, classrooms, and blast-resistant structures. It also provides structures to disaster relief sites such as emergency shelters, medical facilities, and temporary accommodations in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadly speaking, about 40% of Black Diamond's total revenue came from rental revenue in 2014, while lodging made up another 31%.

  <p>
   Black Diamond's annual revenues and profits have been rising over the past several years. The company's revenue jumped 11% to C$386.6 million ($332.4 million) during 2014 mostly thanks to a 43% jump in its lodging revenue from its Logistics segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite revenue growth in 2014, Black Diamond's net income plummeted 34% to C$35 million ($30 million) for the year due to a combination of impairment losses, provisions for guarantee on debt of an investee, and a higher share of earnings being paid to non-controlling interests. The company's operating cash levels spiked 49% to C$171 million ($147 million) during the year despite lower earnings, thanks to favorable changes in non-cash working capital related to its operating activities.
