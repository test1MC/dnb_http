   Westbury Dairies is the result of cooperatives working, well, cooperatively toward milking steady returns. The company operates as a joint venture among two of the UK's largest farmer-owned dairy co-ops,
   <company id="135444">
    First Milk
   </company>
   and Milk Link, and dairy products manufacturer
   <company id="57771">
    Arla Foods
   </company>
   . Westbury Dairies processes the farmer-members' supply of milk at what is now one of the largest, and arguably most modern, single dairy site in the country. From some 2 million liters (approximately 528,000 gallons) of raw milk, its facility produces primarily skimmed milk powder and bulk butter, some retail packet butter under Arla's own label, and cream and milk concentrate (used to make yogurt) for the food-manufacturing industry.

  <p>
   Arla Foods acquired a minority interest in Westbury Dairies in fall 2010, enabling
   <company id="135444">
    First Milk
   </company>
   and Milk Link to retain significant stakes of approximately 59% and 30%, respectively, and long-term capacity to balance the highs and lows of dairy production. In a move to cut facility operating costs during slow periods, Arla agreed to use the site's existing butter-making facility. Arla also built a new butter making and packing facility dedicated to retail products, which reduces the company's transportation costs and, as a result, its carbon footprint.

   The joint venture's positive relationship opened the door in mid-2012 for Arla Foods' parent, European dairy co-operative
   <company id="105475">
    Arla Foods amba
   </company>
   , to propose a merger with Milk Link. Their consolidation created one of the largest dairy processor in the UK, with combined revenues of more than Â£2 billion (close to $1.3 billion) on more than 3 billion liters (about 793,000 gallons) of milk processed a year -- nearly a quarter of Britain's total production.
