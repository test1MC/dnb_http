   Mylan knows you probably don't know its name, but hopes you'll appreciate the prices of its drugs. Through
   <company id="111144">
    Mylan Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   and other subsidiaries, it is one of the top global manufacturers of prescription generic drugs. Mylan's medicine cabinet holds generic versions of antibiotics, antidepressants, anti-inflammatories, and respiratory agents in a range of delivery forms. Its specialty division makes branded nebulized and injectable drugs. In addition to finished drugs, the Mylan Laboratories unit is a major producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs. It serves customers in some 145 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mylan manufactures about about 1,400 individual generic products and has the capacity to produce some 45 billion medication doses per year. The company's generic drug operations account for about 85% of annual revenues, with key product offerings in the fields of neurology, cardiovascular, anti-infective, metabolic, gastrointestinal, allergy, and respiratory medications. Key to Mylan's success in the generic drug market is its strategy of being the first to file with the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   to manufacture generic versions of popular drugs as they lose patent protection. Being first in line gives a generics manufacturer a three-month window of exclusivity, while its competitors have to wait before they can produce an equivalent product.  The India-based API manufacturing operations, as well as Mylan Laboratories' production of generic anti-retrovirals for HIV/AIDS patients, are included in the generic drug segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The remainder of revenue comes from Mylan's specialty pharmaceutical division, which is led by
   <company id="57699">
    Mylan Specialty
   </company>
   , whose best-selling product is the EpiPen Auto-Injector, used to treat severe allergic reactions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mylan operates around 40 drug manufacturing locations primarily in the US. Its Mylan Laboratories unit is based in and operates API plants in India. While the company serves customers around the globe, North America accounts for 60% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its generics business is conducted primarily in the US, Canada, Europe, India, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Brazil. It also exports generics into emerging markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mylan markets products through a direct sales force. Its customers include wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacies, institutional pharmacies, mail-order organizations, and purchasing groups. It also conducts indirect marketing efforts targeting hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacy benefit managers, government entities, and independent pharmacies. During 2014, sales to wholesale distributors
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40016">
    AmeriSourceBergen
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   accounted for 19%, 13%, and 12% of revenues, respectively. In addition, the API manufacturing division sells ingredients to other generic drug manufacturers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As Mylan has expanded its operations, and as generic drugs have grown in popularity, so have the company's revenues and profits grown over the last few years. Mylan reported a 12% increase in sales in 2014 to some $7.7 billion, which was attributed to 10% growth in the generics segment (from new product launches, acquired businesses, and third-party net revenues) and 19% growth in the specialty segment (mainly from EpiPen and Perforomist Inhalation Solution sales). An increase in third-party net sales from operations in India was largely due to significant growth in sales of the finished dosage form ARV products used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
  </p>
  <p>
   The higher revenue led to an increase in net income, which rose 49% to $929 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   After peaking in 2013, cash flow from operations fell 8% to just over $1 billion in 2014. The decline was due to a number of factors, including an increase in cash paid for accrued litigation settlements of $66.6 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A key piece of Mylan's strategy lies in conducting efficient and accurate internal research and development projects. The company's R&amp;D organization must keep its pipeline full to provide Mylan with new first-to-market opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to internal R&amp;D programs, Mylan grows through acquisitions and by forming partnerships with other drugmakers. To build its presence in Japan and grow the generics business in that country, Mylan holds a strategic, long-term partnership with
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a portfolio of more than 350 generic drugs (and more than 125 additional products in development) in Japan. Mylan's focus is on the development and manufacturing end, while Pfizer  focuses on sales and marketing; both companies share costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2015 Mylan entered into a collaboration with
   <company id="100472">
    Innoviva
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize TD-4208 for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mylan also has a partnership with Indian biotech firm Biocon to expand into the growing field of generic biotech drugs. While biologic drugs are trickier to copy and finicky to produce, they do promise splendid profits. The companies co-develop and market biologic therapies in numerous countries; in 2013 the companies expanded their agreement to include three new analog insulin products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company became the exclusive distributor of
   <company id="15080">
    Gilead Sciences
   </company>
   ' Sovaldi tablets for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in India. Mylan also has exclusivity for the distribution of Gilead's Harvoni tablets in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 rival
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   made an unsolicited $40 billion bid to acquire Mylan. In turn, Mylan made its desire to remain independent known by preemptively making its own acquisition offer for generics producer
   <company id="15492">
    Perrigo
   </company>
   . (Perrigo rejected that offer.) Either deal would have been among the largest of the year, and the combination of two generics specialists would create a giant in the field. However, Teva ultimately called off its acquisition efforts when it instead agreed to buy the generics business of
   <company id="10059">
    Allergan
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Mylan came under fire during 2016 for dramatically raising the prices of its EpiPen; the price hikes drew the ire of the public, the Department of Justice, and Congress. After making a string of acquisitions, it was also ready to shed some redundant operations to cut costs. Late that year, the company began retrenching with plans to cut some 10% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mylan has more than doubled its size over the last decade through a series of ambitious acquisitions that have helped the company expand its geographic footprint and given it the capacity to produce APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Mylan traded 21% of the company for
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   ' developed market drug business in a deal valued at $5 billion. The swap gave Mylan a medicine cabinet full of specialty and branded generics and, most importantly, a Swiss address and the relief from US taxes that comes along with it. The following year, it acquired Abbott's non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which strengthened its presence in markets including Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, the company acquired the US commercialization, marketing, and intellectual property rights related to Aspen Global's Arixtra (for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis) for $300 million; it also gained the authorized generic rights for the treatment. Mylan then bought Jai Pharma, a spin-off of female health care businesses from India's Famy Care, for $750 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2016, the company bought Swedish specialty drugmaker
   <company id="161541">
    Meda
   </company>
   in a $9.9 billion transaction. That deal takes Mylan into China, Southeast Asia, Russia, and other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 Mylan agreed to buy the rights to OTC cold remedy product line Cold-EEZE from
   <company id="55208">
    ProPhase Labs
   </company>
   for some $50 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Milan Puskar and a colleague founded Milan as a drug distributor in 1961 and shifted to vitamin manufacturing in 1965. It added generic penicillin in 1966 and tetracycline three years later. The next year Parke-Davis (now part of
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ) became the first major drug company to purchase Milan's products. Puskar left in 1972 after a management dispute, and the company changed its name to Mylan. The company went public in 1973. Chairman Roy McKnight brought Puskar back as president in 1976 when the two bought control of Mylan. In 1984 the company launched its first proprietary drug. Mylan became the #1 independent drugmaker in the US in 1985, specializing in generics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 Mylan formed research joint venture Somerset Pharmaceuticals with Circa Pharmaceuticals (later bought by
   <company id="12311">
    Watson Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ). The venture helped produce the successful anti-Parkinson's disease drug Eldepryl. The firm absorbed dermatological products maker Dow Hickam Pharmaceuticals in 1991 and drug-delivery specialist Bertek in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Puskar became chairman and CEO after McKnight died in 1993. Mylan launched cimetidine, a generic ulcer drug, in 1994, and by the following year it held 39% of the market for all new cimetidine prescriptions. Mylan got FDA approval for Etodolac, a generic version of arthritis drug Lodine, in 1997. The next year it bought Penederm, maker of topical antifungal treatment Mentax.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Mylan paid $135 million to settle price-fixing and antitrust charges relating to popular antianxiety drugs lorazepam and chlorazepate (generic versions of Ativan and Tranxene). On a happier note that year, the FDA approved the sale of Mylan's generic version of
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   's Wellbutrin antidepressant. The following year, the company's generic version of
   <company id="58089">
    Merck
   </company>
   's cholesterol drug Mevacor was approved by the FDA, and in 2002 its version of
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly's
   </company>
   Prozac won FDA approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's proposed acquisition of troubled
   <company id="55029">
    King Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   rankled investor Carl Icahn, a minority stakeholder in Mylan. In late November 2004, Icahn made a buyout offer of Mylan to end its bid to buy King. That bid became moot after asset manager Perry Corp., led by Richard Perry, increased its stake in Mylan just enough to edge out Icahn as largest shareholder. However, Icahn filed suit against the company and Perry Corp., making charges of hedging to allow Mylan to complete its acquisition of King. The scuffle between shareholders was for naught.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of February 2005, Mylan and King terminated their deal, and Perry announced plans to unload his entire near-10% stake in the company. Ichan dropped his lawsuit against Perry, and then re-set his sights on a hostile buyout of Mylan. In retaliation, the company bought back 25% of its stock and closed its Mylan Bertek division -- the branded drug unit that would have benefited most from the King Pharmaceuticals acquisition. In the end, Mylan incurred $22.9 million in expenses related to the fizzled plan during its 2005 fiscal year.
  </p>
  <p>
   With an eye on global expansion Mylan first bought 20% of Matrix Laboratories in 2006. It then secured control of 51% of the company in 2007. With 10 manufacturing facilities, Matrix was one of the largest companies in India and the world's largest supplier of the generic anti-retroviral pharmaceutical ingredients used to treat HIV/AIDS. Additionally, by having its own API producer in-house, Mylan sought to gain an edge over competitors, who must obtain their ingredients from outside manufacturers. Over the following two years Mylan slowly increased its holdings to 97% of Matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Committed to growth through big acquisitions, Mylan spent nearly $7 billion in 2007 to acquire
   <company id="133843">
    Generics (UK) Ltd.
   </company>
   from
   <company id="58089">
    Merck
   </company>
   . Mylan won out in a bidding war that included rivals
   <company id="150480">
    Actavis Group
   </company>
   and
   <company id="111935">
    Teva
   </company>
   , with the prize being a business almost twice Mylan's size. Following the acquisition, the company changed its name from Mylan Laboratories to just plain Mylan. Akin to a frog swallowing a salmon, Mylan spent the next two years digesting its catch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the acquisitions, both businesses were eventually rebranded with the Mylan name. However, Mylan kept the Matrix name for its institutional anti-retroviral franchise, serving non-governmental organizations and other alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mylan paid private-equity firm RoundTable Healthcare Partners $550 million in cash in 2010 to acquire Bioniche Pharma Holdings. Adding Bioniche increased Mylan's presence in the North American injectables market. Following the acquisition, Mylan combined Bioniche with its existing unit dose business, UDL Laboratories, to form Mylan Institutional, serving customers including group purchasing organizations, hospitals, and long-term care facilities.
