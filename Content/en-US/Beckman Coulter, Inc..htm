   The company operates in two segments: Diagnostics and Life Sciences. The Diagnostics segment has about 10,000 associates who serve the $41 billion Clinical Diagnostics market. It delivers more than 250 million tests every year, used by physicians to diagnose, treat, monitor and manage their patients. Its tests help diagnose diseases such as prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, HIV, congestive heart failure and heart attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Life Sciences Segment has about 1,800 associates who assist customers with products and services that simplify complex processes, automate procedures, and integrate work flows to accelerate breakthroughs in scientific research, medicine, and industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years, Beckman Coulter has installed more than 275,000 of its clinical diagnostic systems around the world. Along with instruments, it sells reagents and other consumable testing supplies (as well as technical support services) that provide recurring revenue over the life of a system. In addition to diagnosing diseases and medical conditions, the clinical systems are used to make decisions on how to treat a patient and to monitor the patient's treatment responses. Health care products range from single-use kits used in physician offices to high-volume laboratory processing systems for urine, blood, cellular, and molecular samples.

  <p>
   Beckman Coulter tries to stay ahead of the competition by researching and developing improved and new systems that cost-effectively perform high volumes of tests for its health care and life science clients. For instance, Beckman Coulter is investing substantial resources towards the creation of an enhanced automated molecular diagnostic (genetic testing) system that will allow for complex molecular testing in clinical labs. It also launches improved versions of its centrifuges, slide preparers, flow cytometers, and other instruments. Some of its R&amp;D efforts are conducted through partnerships with firms such as ImmunoSite (particle characterization instruments) and Vitrology (biosafety testing).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the firm is working to expand its test offerings, with a focus on the growing fields of flow cytometry, immunoassay, and molecular diagnostic products in targeted disease categories. To reduce manual review rates it launched a new hematology analyzer in 2013; it launched a pregnancy test in Europe in 2014.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to expand in the growing flow cytometry field, in 2014 the company acquired Xitogen Technologies, a flow cytometer developer based in Suzhou and Dalian in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also agreed to acquire the clinical microbiology business of
   <company id="155180">
    Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics
   </company>
   , which has an installed base of more than 6,000 instruments around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beckman Coulter acquired the HIV-monitoring flow cytometry business of ReaMetrix India in 2013.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Arnold Beckman created his first chemistry lab as a child in a shed his blacksmith father had built for him. Beckman studied chemical engineering, worked at Bell Labs (now part of Lucent Technologies), and then earned his doctorate in photochemistry in 1928 from the California Institute of Technology. In 1935, while teaching at CalTech and working as a consultant, Beckman created a special ink for the National Postage Meter Company. He formed the National Inking Appliance Company (later National Technical Laboratories), which was 90%-owned by National Postage Meter and 10%-owned by Beckman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1935 Beckman also created a device for a Southern California citrus processor that measured lemon juice acidity. Beckman's acidity, or pH, meter soon became a standard tool in chemical laboratories. In 1941 he debuted a wavelength spectrum analysis system, a forerunner of today's analytical precision and chemical analysis instruments. That year the company's sales topped $250,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became Beckman Instruments in 1950 and went public two years later. During that period the company created products for aerospace, military, and industrial markets. However, it increasingly focused on the medical and research niches, and during the 1960s it introduced glucose analyzers and protein peptide sequencers. By 1975 Beckman Instruments' annual sales neared $230 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   An 82-year-old Beckman sold his company to SmithKline in 1982, creating SmithKline Beckman. In 1988 Louis Rosso, who as president had guided Beckman's move into life sciences and diagnostics, was named CEO. SmithKline Beckman in 1989 merged with UK pharmaceuticals pioneer Beecham Group, becoming SmithKline Beecham. (That company merged with Glaxo Wellcome to become
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   plc in 2000.) Beckman, operating as a unit within SmithKline Beecham, suffered financially as a result of cuts in health care spending. SmithKline Beecham spun the company off that year as a medical and research market instrument maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   New products and cost controls returned Beckman Instruments to health. The company restructured in 1993 (taking write-offs in 1993 and 1994), then launched a buying spree. It acquired Genomyx, a maker of DNA sequencing products, in 1996. In late 1997 the company acquired Coulter, which served the same hospitals and medical offices as Beckman -- only with hematology products -- for $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wallace Coulter in 1948 discovered a new technology for blood cell analysis, dubbed the Coulter Principle. With brother Joe, an electrical engineer, Wallace (who died in 1998) began producing the Coulter Counter cell and particle analyzer. The brothers formed Coulter Electronics in 1958. Over the years the private company made tests to detect everything from colon cancer to strep throat, but it became best known for blood cell analysis diagnostic systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beckman Instruments' purchase of Coulter, which led to job cuts (13% of its workforce), caused losses for 1997. The next year the company changed its name to Beckman Coulter. John Wareham, an executive with Beckman since the early 1980s, replaced Rosso as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The addition of the Coulter product lines enabled the company to win 1999 contracts from several regional health care networks and large purchasing organizations. In 2000 the company initiated some restructuring by closing plants in Argentina, Brazil, and Hong Kong.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company underwent a restructuring, reorganizing itself into one reporting segment (it had formerly operated in two divisions: clinical diagnostics and biomedical research). Also as part of the restructuring, the firm reduced its workforce and exited some development projects, including tests for mad cow disease and sepsis.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Beckman Coulter bought Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, a maker of specialty diagnostics in the areas of reproductive endocrinology and cardiovascular risk assessment. It also acquired
   <company id="113576">
    Agencourt Bioscience
   </company>
   , a provider of genomic sequencing and nucleic acid purification services. (Agencourt was combined with Cogenics, a genomic contract research firm acquired from
   <company id="13006">
    Clinical Data
   </company>
   for $17 million in 2009, to form Beckman Coulter Genomics.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 it introduced a new system (the UniCel DxI 600 Access system) intended for midsized hospitals who want to perform more tests in-house rather than outsourcing them. Later that year it acquired the flow cytometry business of Danish diagnostics firm
   <company id="101330">
    Dako
   </company>
   , adding two high-end flow cytometry systems to its portfolio of products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company again began operating as two segments, clinical diagnostics and life science, in 2008. That year the firm launched UniCel DxI 800 system, a fully automated immunochemistry (chemical tests on immune system proteins) system for high-volume clinical laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 and 2010 Beckman Coulter took measures to streamline its operations and better use its resources; it closed certain California manufacturing plants and consolidated other facilities to cut costs and improve productivity. In 2010 chairman and CEO Scott Garrett resigned as the company continued to cut its guidance for the year amid ongoing economic weakness and increasing competitive conditions. Beckman Coulter named Robert Hurley to replace Garrett on an interim basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, when industrial automation firm Danaher acquired Beckman Coulter for some $5.8 billion plus debt, Danaher named a new executive, Tom Joyce, to oversee the Beckman Coulter operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company bought the lab-based diagnostics systems business of
   <company id="56016">
    Olympus
   </company>
   ' life sciences unit. The $800 million purchase expanded its chemistry product lines. Also in 2009 Beckman Coulter expanded its molecular diagnostics operations through the smaller purchase of gene-based research firm Cogenics for $17 million from drug developer
   <company id="13006">
    Clinical Data
   </company>
   . Cogenics was integrated with an existing subsidiary, Agencourt Bioscience, to create the new
   <company id="113576">
    Beckman Coulter Genomics
   </company>
   division, which offers genomic sequencing and DNA purification services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beckman Coulter was acquired by Danaher in 2011 for about $5.8 billion, plus the assumption of debt. Formerly a publicly traded company, Beckman Coulter is now part of Danaher's rapidly expanding life sciences and diagnostics segment, joining the Leica, AB Sciex, Radiometer, and Molecular Devices businesses, which serve medical, research, and pathology markets. The acquisition gave Beckman Coulter access to a broad range of resources in the biomedical testing arena and enhanced the breadth of services that the company is able to offer to its customers. It also allowed both companies to cross-sell laboratory equipment to their respective customer bases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Danaher moved to expand the Beckman Coulter operations when it agreed to acquire
   <company id="13592">
    IRIS International
   </company>
   for some $338 million. The purchase will add automated in-vitro diagnostic systems for body-fluid analysis to the company's offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earlier in 2012, Beckman Coulter added a line of automated flow cytrometry systems and related consumables through the acquisition of Blue Ocean Biomedical. The purchase expanded the company's line of low-complexity systems for sample preparation and analysis.
