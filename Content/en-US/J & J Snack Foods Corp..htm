   J &amp; J Snack Foods boasts&#160;freezers full of goodies. The company offers an assortment of brands, including SUPERPRETZEL soft pretzels, ICEE frozen drinks, Whole Fruit juice treats, Tio Pepe's churros, and Funnel Cake Factory funnel cakes. J &amp; J also sells snacks made under license, such as

   's CinnaPretzels&#160;and Mrs. GoodCookie pastries, as well as
   <company id="112373">

   's frozen lemonade and juice bars.&#160;Besides&#160;serving foodservice operators and retail food outlets, J &amp; J&#160;caters to&#160;consumers directly, too,&#160;through&#160;BAVARIAN PRETZEL BAKERY shops&#160;in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.&#160;Adding to its offerings,&#160;J &amp; J acquired the Patio, Hand Fulls, Villa Taliano, and other&#160;frozen snack brands from

    ConAgra Foods
   </company>
   in 2011.

   North American snacks company J &amp; J boasts warehouses and distribution centers in more than 40 states,&#160;Mexico, and Canada.&#160;The company&#160;operates manufacturing facilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia, Missouri, Florida, Ohio, and California. Through its purchase of ConAgra's frozen foods business, J &amp; J picked up production facilities in (Holly&#160;Ridge) North Carolina and (Weston) Oregon.

   J &amp; J estimates that its products are sold in up to 90% of US supermarkets.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company operates through three business segments: Food Service, Retail Supermarkets, and Frozen Beverages. Food Service products include soft pretzels, frozen juice treats and desserts, churros, dough-enrobed handheld products, and baked goods.&#160;Through its Retail Supermarkets segment, J &amp; J sells soft pretzel products - including SUPERPRETZEL, frozen juice treats, and desserts&#160;such as&#160;Luigi's Real Italian Ice, Minute Maid Juice Bars and Soft Frozen Lemonade,&#160;Whole Fruit&#160;frozen fruit bars and sorbet, ICEE Squeeze-Up Tubes, and&#160;Patio burritos. Within its Frozen Beverages unit, J &amp; J sells its products to the food service industry primarily under the names ICEE, Slush Puppie, Parrot Ice, and&#160;Arctic Blast&#160;throughout the US, Mexico, and Canada. It provides repair and maintenance service to customers for&#160;their owned equipment.

        <p>
   By regularly buying other companies, J &amp; J has expanded its existing business and extended the reach of its retail footprint.
  </p>
        <p>
   Spying an uptick in&#160;consumer interest in&#160;specialty foods, J &amp; J in 2012 acquired Kim &amp; Scott's Gourmet Pretzels. The maker of frozen, ready-to-bake pretzels has a shelf presence in
   <company id="10952">
    Whole Foods
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56161">
    Sam's Club
   </company>
   and sales of about $8 million to $10 million. To bolster growth, Kim &amp; Scott is testing potential demand&#160;for its products in new venues, including selling&#160;pretzels and sandwiches through
   <company id="106844">
    Cold Stone Creamery
   </company>
   ice-cream stores.
  </p>
        <p>
   Buying ConAgra's frozen snack brands in 2011 broadened J &amp; J's own range of consumer-facing products --&#160;with burritos, stuffed sandwiches, pizza pockets, and more --&#160;and&#160;added to&#160;its list of private-label customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The deals build upon two purchases J &amp; J completed in&#160;2010: California Churros and Parrot Ice. California Churros makes frozen churros and&#160;supplies&#160;supermarkets, delis, schools, and other foodservice operators. Parrot Ice, a frozen beverage brand sold mainly in convenience stores, was acquired out of bankruptcy and added to J &amp; J's ICEE operations.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Net sales for J &amp; J rose 12% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011, thanks to its acquisitions of ConAgra's frozen handheld business in mid-2011 and Kim &amp; Scott's gourmet Pretzels in mid-2012. The company logged a 12% increase across its Food Service segment driven by a 14% rise in sales of soft pretzels from restaurant chains, warehouse club stores, and its own customer base. Net income during the same reporting period dropped, however, due to lower gross profits from higher packaging costs and lower gross profit margins of handheld sales.

        <p>
   Through its&#160;warehouses and distribution centers in more than 40 states,&#160;Mexico, and Canada, the company is able to service customers directly. Food Service customers include snack bars and food stands in chain, department, and discount stores; malls and shopping centers; casual dining restaurants; fast food outlets; stadiums and sports arenas; leisure and theme parks; convenience stores; movie theatres; warehouse club stores; and schools, colleges, and other institutions. Its Retail Supermarket sales channel&#160;peddles frozen and prepackaged products&#160;that are&#160;purchased by consumers for home consumption.

   Shreiber bought bankrupt J &amp; J Soft Pretzel, then making about $400,000 a year in sales, for $72,100 in 1971. Sales more than quadrupled by 1975 and Shreiber began buying other regional pretzel makers (Framptom Soft Pretzel of St. Louis and Pretzel Man of Los Angeles, 1978). J &amp; J began producing new snacks in the 1980s, including churros (fried pastries) in 1981 and Super Juice fruit bars in 1984.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company went public in 1986 and the next year acquired a 38% interest in ICEE-USA. (It bought the remaining interest in 1988 and international marketing rights in 1995.) J &amp; J further expanded in the 1990s with purchases such as Bavarian Soft Pretzels and the Funnel Cake Factory in fiscal 1994, and Pretzel Gourmet (five soft pretzel stores) and Mazzone Enterprises (Italian ices and frozen desserts) in 1996 and 1997.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 a jury ruled against J &amp; J in a same-sex harassment suit, awarding a former employee $4.2 million in damages (later settled for less). That year the company bought Mama Tish's International Foods (including licensing to make Snapple Ice frozen treats) and Pretzels, Inc. (Texas Twist soft pretzels). J &amp; J gained national ICEE distribution when it acquired the controlling interest in National ICEE that same year. The next year it cut a marketing deal for ICEE with beverage giant

   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales of the company's key soft pretzel lines fell in 1998. J &amp; J closed underperforming Bavarian Pretzel Bakery and Pretzel Gourmet stores that year, and it introduced products such as frozen ready-to-bake cookie dough (Mrs. GoodCookie) and soft pretzel hot dog buns.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 J &amp; J formed an alliance with Coca-Cola's
   <company id="59937">
    The Minute Maid Company
   </company>
   to market Minute Maid and Hi-C frozen drinks. In 2000 the company had to recall about 300,000 boxes of Minute Maid juice bars due to a packaging defect. J &amp; J acquired New Jersey-based Uptown Bakeries, the primary supplier of fresh bakery products to the
   <company id="40525">
    Wawa
   </company>
   convenience store chain (about 550 stores primarily in the Northeast) in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004 J &amp; J acquired the bakery assets of bankrupt Country Home Bakers, whose brands include Country Home, Readi-Bake, and various private labels. In 2005 the company acquired Snackworks LLC (dba Bavarian Brothers), a manufacturer of soft pretzels under the Seriously Twisted!, Bavarian Brothers, and CinnaPretzel brand names.
  </p>
        <p>
   Expanding its presence into the frozen drinks market, J &amp; J acquired ICEE of Hawaii, a distributor of frozen drinks throughout the Hawaiian islands, as well as the SLUSH PUPPIE brand from Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now&#160;the bottling operations of
   <company id="103458">
    Dr Pepper Snapple Group
   </company>
   )&#160;in 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   During 2007&#160;J &amp; J acquired the assets of Hom/Ade Foods, which manufactures and distributes biscuits and dumplings under the Mary B's label and store brands; Radar, a maker of Daddy Ray's brand fig and fruit bars; and the Whole Fruit and Fruit-A-Freeze frozen fruit bar brands. It also bought the assets of an ICEE distributor in Kansas.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amid the economic downturn in the US, the company ceased acquisitions until 2010. That year it purchased the assets of California Churros, a manufacturer of frozen churros, and Parrot Ice, a supplier of frozen beverages.
