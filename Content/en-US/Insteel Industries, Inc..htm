   Insteel Industries is part of many concrete victories. The company manufactures steel welded wire reinforcement (WWR), used primarily in concrete construction materials, such as pipe (pipe mesh, building mesh, engineered structural mesh, and precast manholes), driveways, and slabs. Its prestressed concrete (PC) strand products are the spine for concrete structures, from bridges to parking garages. Insteel's customers include concrete pipe and precast and prestressed producers, distributors, and rebar fabricators. A majority of its sales come from manufacturers of non-residential concrete construction products.

  <p>
   Insteel Industries operates about 10 manufacturing facilities in the US, the company's core market.

   Insteel Industries' products consist of welded wire reinforcement and prestressed concrete strand. Welded wire reinforcement product sales accounted for 57%, and prestressed concrete strand accounted for 43% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   The company sells its products nationwide as well as into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, delivering its products primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers. Products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used in nonresidential construction; and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors. In 2015 about 70% of the company's net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30% were to distributors, rebar fabricators, and contractors

  <p>
   Insteel Industries achieved unprecedented growth in 2015, with revenues peaking 9% to a record-setting $448 million. Profits also surged 30% to reach $22 million in 2015. The growth was attributed to additional revenue from previous acquisitions and a decrease in restructuring costs.

  <p>
   Insteel Industries has achieved milestone revenue growth through the aid of acquisitions. In 2014 the company acquired the assets of PC strand business of American Spring Wire Corporation (ASW), a large North American manufacturer of valve and commercial quality spring wire located in Texas and Georgia, for $68 million. The acquisition enhanced Insteel's PC strand business in its largest and highest growth markets.

  <p>
   Howard Woltz Sr. bought a premixed concrete and concrete-block plant and formed Exposaic Industries, Inc. in 1953. Son Howard Woltz Jr. took over as chairman and president in 1958, adding welded-wire production equipment to the plant in 1975 during a shortage of wire reinforcing for its precast-concrete operations. Exposaic diversified again into industrial wire products in 1981 and went public in 1985. The company sold its precast concrete unit in 1988.
