   Shutterstock brings the online marketplace mentality to the world of digital images, illustrations,&#160;and videos. Its 35,000+ contributors have uploaded more than 19 millions bits of content perused by 550,000&#160;subscribers. The company's primary customers include&#160;marketing agencies, media organizations, and communications departments of businesses that&#160;subscribe to single downloads, a set number of images, or unlimited downloads for a month or a year; average cost per image is $3. Shutterstock's&#160;marketplace is available in 10 languages and 150 countries where its images are used for corporate communications,&#160;websites, ads, and books and other published materials. Formed in 2007,&#160;the&#160;company&#160;went public in 2012.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Going forward, Shutterstock's growth strategies include increased localization of content to meet specific ethnic and culture media requirements and pursuing new content types as they become available. It also intends to move from mostly word-of-mouth to focused marketing in order to improve its penetration of both the small-to-medium-size business segment (a majority of sales)&#160;and large agencies and enterprises.
