        <p>
   Katy primarily sells its products to janitorial/sanitary and food service distributors. These distributors supply end users, including building service contractors, restaurants, hotels, healthcare facilities, and schools. The company sells its consumer storage products through major home improvement and mass market retail outlets.
  </p>
        <p>
   The sales and marketing functions for its commercial cleaning products and supplies are handled through a combination of direct sales personnel, manufacturers' sales representatives, and wholesale distributors. The commercial distribution channels for its commercial cleaning products are highly fragmented, resulting in a large number of small customers, mainly distributors of sanitary maintenance products. Katy markets its branded plastic home storage units to mass merchant retailers in the US and Canada, handling sales and marketing for them through direct sales personnel and external representative groups. The consumer distribution channels for these products, especially the in-home products, are highly concentrated, with several large mass merchant retailers representing a significant portion of the customer base.
  </p>
        <p>
   In recent years, Katy has set aside less for advertising. Ad costs for 2012 came in at $400,000, as compared to 2011's $500,000.

        <p>
   Shuttering its container business in Norwalk, California, and divesting its Gemtex business unit caused sales to slide in 2012. Katy's revenue dropped by 17% in fiscal 2012 to $100 million from $120 million in 2011. It posted a loss of $15 million in fiscal 2012 against a profit of $5 million in fiscal 2011.

        <p>
   Katy has concentrated on restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives in recent years, as well as divesting its non-core business. In 2012, the company closed its container business unit located in Norwalk, California, and sold certain assets related to the Gemtex business unit to Sherbrooke, Quebec-based Ontario Inc. for $1 million. The Gemtex business unit made and distributed resin fiber disks and other coated abrasives for the original equipment manufacturer, automotive, industrial, and home improvement markets under the brand names Trim-Kut and Grind R. In 2013, Katy shuttered its Glit business unit in Wrens, Georgia, which was involved in making and distributing non-woven abrasive products for commercial and industrial use, as well as in supplying materials to various OEMs.
