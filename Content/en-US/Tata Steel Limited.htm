   Tata Steel is one of the largest steel makers in the world. Products include hot and cold rolled coils and sheets, galvanized sheets, tubes, wire rods, rings and bearings. Steel sales, primarily in India, account for the bulk of the company's business, although it also owns interests in coal and iron projects.

  <p>
   Total Steel's revenues from 2014 to 2015 decreased due to fewer sales from China, Europe, and Thailand. Throughout 2015, the company's bottom line was negatively affected by slow growth in China, low global steel prices, and higher pension payments at Tata Steel UK.

  <p>
   To combat stagnant growth in Europe and China, Tata Steel is entering new segment markets, restructuring its operations and cutting costs, and introducing new products to diversified markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company announced a massive consolidation and debt reduction drive to bring debt down by 10 to 15% by the end of the year. It plans to sell its long products business in Europe and is looking to identify and sell other non-performing assets (including, possibly, its UK business in Port Talbot). That year it agreed to sell its UK specialty steels business to Liberty House for Â£100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Indian operations in 2015 were adversely impacted by the regulatory uncertainties in the mining sector. For the first time in its history, Tata Steel closed several of its critical mines for varying periods. This led to supply and production disruptions that significantly impacted its cost structure.
