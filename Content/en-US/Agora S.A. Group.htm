   The political revolution in Poland paid off for Agora. The company publishes the popular Polish newspaper,
   <i>
    Gazeta Wyborcza
   </i>
   (Election Gazette). With a paid circulation of about 450,000, the newspaper was created in 1989 as a voice for the Solidarity party. Agora also publishes
   <em>
    Metro
   </em>
   , a free national daily paper. Beyond newsprint, the company operates two music radio stations, an Internet radio site, and a news radio station; it also publishes 15 magazine titles, and operates an Internet portal site. Its Art Marketing Syndicate is Poland's largest outdoor advertising firm. Agora is primarily owned by company executives and employees; its employee stock program has turned many workers into millionaires.

   A symbol for the turning point in Polish government,
   <i>
    Gazeta Wyborcza
   </i>
   was created in 1989 by Solidarity activists -- dissidents Helena Luczywo and Adam Michnik -- to support Solidarity trade union candidates in the country's first partially democratic election. (Solidarity leader Lech Walesa encouraged the newspaper's creation.) Prior to the
   <i>
    Gazeta
   </i>
   , Luczywo had run several underground dissident newspapers -- including
   <i>
    Robotnik
   </i>
   (The Worker) -- and had to hide from Communist authorities on and off for a decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Befitting a newspaper in its infancy, the publication's first home was an empty nursery school. The editor's "office" was a bathroom and reporters worked on their stories at child-sized tables and chairs. Luczywo enlisted the help of childhood friend Wanda Rapaczynski, a financial whiz who had moved to the US and was an executive at Citibank. (Rapaczynski consulted from the US until 1992 when she quit her Citibank job and moved back to Poland to run the paper.)
  </p>

   The newspaper split its ties with Walesa in 1990. (When the Solidarity party split into two, the newspaper endorsed Walesa's rival, Tadeusz Mazowiecki.) As Poland's economy became more capitalistic, the newspaper changed its slant from revolutionary to a more practical, independent focus. In 1993 Atlanta-based publishing and telecommunications firm
   <company id="40110">
    Cox Enterprises
   </company>
   bought a 12.5% share of the company. Agora branched into radio in 1996 and went public in 1999 (on both the London and Warsaw stock exchanges) to raise money for further expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having raised some $93 million, the company began building a new office complex and printing facilities. Also in 1999 the newspaper launched women's magazine supplement
   <i>
    High Heels.
   </i>
   The next year the company formed a joint arrangement with ComputerLand to form Internet Commerce Center, a company focused on building an Internet shopping mall linked to Agora's Internet portal. In 2001 Agora launched Internet portal site gazeta.pl.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Agora expanded in both existing and new business lines. The company boosted its magazine division with the acquisition of 12 magazine titles. In 2002 Agora bought a majority stake in outdoor advertising firm Art Marketing Syndicate.
