  <p>
   Over the past 60 years the company has positioned itself as a one-stop shop for customers. Southwire continues to focus on developing its core operations and product portfolio. Further, the company deepens its market presence by fostering a nationally-linked distribution network. Over the years strategic acquisitions have also fueled Southwire's growth and diversified its product portfolio.

  <p>
   Southwire grows through the use of acquisitions. In late 2016, it obtained Texas-based United Copper Industries, a manufacturer of building wire. The deal augmented Southwire's manufacturing capabilities in the company's core building wire products segment and enhanced its geographical footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   Around that same time period, Southwire also purchased Texas-based Sumner Manufacturing, a manufacturer of material lifts, jack stands, welding tools, material carts, and other tools and equipment for the construction market. That deal strengthened the company's position in the contractor equipment space and rapidly expanded its presence in the industrial supply and rental channels.
