   Nexsan makes hoarding so much easier (and cleaner). With space and energy limitations in mind, the company provides SAN, NAS, and unified hybrid storage systems for midsized businesses and mid-level deployments in larger enterprises. Its storage and archiving systems are suitable for a broad range of data, including e-mail, medical images, web content, digital video, and CAD and other reference materials. Nexsan counts 11,000 customers and sells through distributors, original equipment manufacturers, resellers, and systems integrators. In 2013 it was bought by

    Imation
   </company>
   for $115 million in cash and stock.

   Nexsan is focused on product development, working with partners to create new products and enhance existing products. In 2011 the company launched the E-series SAN system, which expanded its flexible storage capabilities. The following year Nexsan joined Veeam Software to offer an integrated product for storage and backup in cloud computing environments; it also partnered with

    Unitrends
   </company>
   on a backup and disaster recovery product.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company particularly sees hybrid storage, represented by its NST5000 product, as a top area of growth amid increased use of virtualization and cloud computing.
