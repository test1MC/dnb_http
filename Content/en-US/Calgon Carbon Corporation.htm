   Calgon wants impurities in water and air to be gone. Calgon Carbon makes activated carbons and purification systems and offers purification, separation, and concentration services to industrial process and environmental markets. It is a global leader in activated carbon, ballast water treatment, ultraviolet light disinfection, and advanced ion-exchange technologies used in the treatment of drinking water, wastewater, ballast water, air emissions, and manufacturing processes. Calgon Carbon offers carbon technologies used in more than 700 discrete market applications including air, drinking water, foods, and pharmaceuticals purification, and the removal of mercury emissions from coal-powered electrical plants.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Calgon Carbon operates in a geographically diverse array of markets. It operates 13 production plants (in Belgium, China, the UK, and the US). It also has 49 warehouses, service centers, and sales office facilities. Of these, 28 are located in the US, five in each China and Japan, two in Canada and one each in Brazil, France, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, and the UK. More than half of the company's sales come from outside the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   It operates through three segments: Activated Carbon and Service, Equipment, and Consumer. Its Activated Carbon and Service unit makes granular and powdered activated carbon to remove organic compounds from water, air, and gases. The Equipment unit designs and installs carbon adsorption systems for use at treatment sites, including equipment to control odors at waste treatment plants. Its Consumer unit makes Zorflex carbon cloth, sold to medical, military, and specialty markets.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Calgon Carbon's revenues increased by 4% in 2012 due to 43% jump in Equipment revenues driven by ultraviolet light systems, principally ballast water treatment, which rose by 71%. Consumer revenues went up by 20% thanks to higher demand for activated carbon cloths. The increases were partially offset by 0.15% decrease in the Activated Carbon and Service sales due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company posted a net income of $23.2 million in 2012 (41% down on 2011) due to higher interest expenses and restructuring charges.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Calgon Carbon's strategy is to maintain its global coverage while developing or acquiring products and services that complement its existing portfolio. It is also relying on its superior products and services to outpace rising competition from lower cost activated carbon products from Chinese manufacturers.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013, subsidiary Hyde Marine, signed a deal with Cammell Laird, the largest shipyard in the UK, to install chemical-free Hyde GUARDIAN Ballast Water Treatment System at the yard. Cammell Laird had previously been tapped by the UK government to install Hyde GUARDIAN systems onto five naval vessels.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the company had a contract to supply 2.9 million pounds of granular activated carbon (GAC) to a municipal water treatment facility in Wuxi City in China's Jiangsu Provice. It also had a GAC contract for sugar purification in India. In Latin America the company forged an alliance with an activated carbon reactivator in Mexico and planned to found a subsidiary in Brazil. In Europe the company is increasing capacity at its facility in Feluy, Belgium, which it bills as the world's largest reactivation plant. Calgon Carbon also has a leased reactivation plant in New York, as well as reactivation facilities in California and Ohio.
  </p>
        <p>
   All of the company's activated carbon manufacturing plants are in the US except for a facility in Datong, China, and all are operating at full capacity. The company expects demand for activated carbon to increase by approximately 40%, or 1 billion pounds, by 2017.

        <p>
   In 2010 the company acquired Hyde Marine, a maker of ultraviolet light technology systems for eliminating harmful organisms in marine ballast water. The company also completed its acquisitions of Zwicky Denmark and Sweden, which distributed its carbon and service products in northern Europe. In a move to consolidate its market position, that year Calgon Carbon increased its ownership of joint venture Calgon Carbon Japan from partner

   to an 80% share to take control of the operation. It acquired the rest of the venture in 2011, taking full ownership.
