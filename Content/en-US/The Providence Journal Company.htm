   The printed word is what The Providence Journal Company provides. The company publishes
   <i>
    The Providence Journal,
   </i>
   the largest daily newspaper in the Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts market with a daily circulation of about 100,000. Providence Journal Co. also publishes an electronic version of the
   <i>
    Journal
   </i>
   on its projo.com Web site, as well as
   <i>
    Rhode Island Monthly
   </i>
   magazine.
   <em>
    The Providence Journal
   </em>
   got its start as a twice-weekly newspaper in 1820 and became a daily in 1829, making it one of the nation's oldest major general-circulation dailies. The former subsidiary of
   <company id="159568">

   was sold in late 2014 to New Media Investment Group.

   The company published its first paper, the
   <i>
    Manufacturers' and Farmers' Journal, Providence and Pawtucket Advertiser,
   </i>
   in 1820. Nine years later the paper converted from a twice-weekly to a daily -- the
   <i>
    Providence Journal.
   </i>
   In 1863 the
   <i>
    Evening Bulletin
   </i>
   was added to provide news from Civil War battlefields, and in 1885 it started the
   <i>
    Providence Sunday Journal
   </i>
   and adopted the name Providence Journal Company (also known as ProJo). In 1925 the paper pioneered the use of news bureaus, increasing the range of the paper's interest to communities outside Providence.

   Providence Journal started Colony Communications in 1969 to develop cable TV systems, and in 1978 it bought its first TV station -- Philadelphia's WPHL (sold 1987). The next year Michael Metcalf, representing the third generation of Metcalfs to serve the paper, became CEO and modernized the company's printing and production processes. Publisher Stephen Hamblett took over as CEO in 1987 following the mysterious death of Metcalf (the death was ruled a biking accident, although some suspect foul play).

   In 1990 the company sold its cellular communications subsidiary to GTE and started managing the Palmer Communications cable TV operations, with nearly 260,000 subscribers. Two years later Providence Journal joined several other media companies to launch the TV Food Network (now

   </company>
   ). Also in 1993 it bought King Broadcasting's five TV stations. The company sold its cable TV systems in 1995 and bought a stake in America's Health Network. It went public in mid-1996 and received a buyout offer from Dallas-based

    Belo Corp.
   </company>
   three months later. The deal closed in early 1997; Belo later sold off the cable networks.

   In 1999 Hamblett resigned as publisher and CEO and was replaced by Howard Sutton. Tragedy struck the company in 2002 when an employee killed two co-workers at the newspaper's production plant and a third co-worker at his home, before killing himself.

   Belo spun off its newspaper operations in 2008 as a separate, publicly-traded company called
