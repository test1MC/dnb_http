   Vet Affaires wants French customers to handle their clothing affairs in affordable style. Through its around 130 stores spread across France, the company (which does business with an apostrophe in its name: "Vet'Affaires") sells affordable clothing "basics" including underwear, sleepwear, jeans, shirts and blouses, jackets, sweaters, and work overalls. It also offers accessories such as caps and belts. The company situates most of its stores on the outskirts of cities with more than 400,000 residents. Top executives Patrice and Rémy Lesguer founded Vet Affaires in 1987. The company went into receivership in 2015, and after no buyer was found, entered liquidation in 2016.
