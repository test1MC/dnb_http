   Harman International makes itself heard loud and clear. It makes high-end stereo and audio equipment for consumer and professional markets. The company makes loudspeakers, CD and DVD players, CD recorders, and amplifiers under such brands as Mark Levinson, JBL, Harman/Kardon, Revel, AKG, Infinity, Logic 7, and others. Harman's auto unit sells branded audio systems through several carmakers, including
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41889">
    Lexus
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   . About 30 million vehicles are equipped with Harman technology. Its professional unit makes audio equipment, such as monitors, amplifiers, microphones, and mixing consoles for recording studios, cinemas, touring performers, and others. Harman agreed in November 2016 to be bought by
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   for $8 billion.

  <p>
   The combination of Harman and Samsung in an $8 billion all-cash deal should benefit both companies. Samsung gets Harman's thriving automotive business as well its its other technologies for audio recording and delivery. Harman gets access to Samsung display and electronics technologies. Their combined technologies could provide a compelling set of products for connected cars and autonomous vehicles. The deal is expected to close in mid-2017.

  <p>
   Harman operates its business through four segments: Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio, Professional Solutions, and Connected Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The largest segment, Connected Car, accounting for 55% of sales in 2016 (ended June), makes and markets systems that are installed in new vehicles. Lifestyle Audio, about 31% of sales, makes car audio systems as well as home, multimedia systems, mobile speakers, and electronics. The professional segment brings in about 14% of sales with its lines of audio, lighting, video, and automation products for commercial and public locations. The newest segment, Connected Services, was established in 2015 after Harmon acquired cybersecurity firm Symphony Teleca Corp. About 10% of sales came from the segment.
  </p>

  <p>
   Automobile makers, served under both the Infotainment and Lifestyle business segments, account for about 65% of Harman's sales. The company's top customers include
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat Chrysler
   </company>
   , account for 15% of revenue,
   <company id="41758">
    BMW

   , 13%, and
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   , 12%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harman sells connected car systems to automakers who install them as original equipment in vehicles. Consumer-oriented products are sold through distributors and directly to consumers. The path to the enterprise market goes through dealers, consultants, architects, and systems integrators in the US and through a distributor network in other countries. The company reaches the entertainment market through manufacturers' representatives and distributors.

  <p>
   Harman's revenues have generally been trending upward over the past few years. Sales grew 12% to $6.9 billion in 2016 (ended June) led by strong gains in Lifestyle Audio (up 18%) and Connected Services (up 82%). Connected Car sales rose 7% while Professional Solutions sales dropped 3%. Lifestyle Audio sales were driven by expanded global distribution channels and strong demand for smart audio products in consumer audio, higher take rates, and new program launches in car audio. Net income rose for the third straight year to $361.7 million, a 5.5% rise. While sales were higher so were selling, general, and administrative expenses. Changes in accounts payable reduced cash flow from operations to $446.5 million in 2016 from $552.6 million in 2015.

  <p>
   The company is investing in growth in the lucrative automotive business by adding new audio and infotainment models and by increasing per-vehicle content with integrated systems. It has integrated such smart tools as
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   CarPlay and
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   Automotive Link within its infotainment systems. Other goals include continuing to launch new connected systems that will integrate advanced driver assistance and safety features, and introducing services through over-the-air updates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its latest technologies is the Individual Sound Zones offering, which is expected to launch in fiscal 2016. This technology will enable drivers and passengers to create personalized sonic zones within a vehicle. The company is also pushing into the entry-level and mid-range infotainment market to expand its customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harman also aims to expand its business through emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). To this end, it has appointed dedicated employees in these markets. The company is also repositioning its research and development and production capabilities, and developing distribution channels to meet the anticipated demand for its products in these markets. Sales in China rose 20% in 2016 while in India Harman has some 8,500 employees, its largest concentration, and seven software development centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Across North America, Harman is making strategic acquisitions to bolster its Professional segment and fortify its research in audio technology. A newly developed technology, Clari-Fi, helps to restore sound in digital audio files that have been forfeited during the compression process. A partnership with Lotus Engineering will develop noise management applications in automobiles. In 2014, Harman introduced its Harman Kardon Soho Wireless line of headphones. The following year it introduced the JBL Reflect Mini BT Bluetooth-compatible sport headphones.

  <p>
   In March 2016 , Harman acquired TowerSec Ltd. , a provider of automotive cyber security products that include intrusion detection and prevention systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 added video capabilities through the purchase of Southern Vision Systems Inc., a developer, manufacturer, and marketer of audio/video over internet protocol products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its software services operations, Harman acquired software engineering and integration services firm STC in 2015. That deal was intended to provide the company with additional cloud, mobility, and analytics functions to promote the development of connected automobile products. It also acquired Symphony Teleca, which provides over-the-air updates for cybersecurity services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other purchases in 2015 included certain operations of audio systems maker Bang &amp; Olufsen, software management technology firm Redband, infotainment and car audio systems maker S1nn, and online A/V specialist Southern Vision Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company bought Verto Medical Solutions (dba Yurbuds), which makes sports headphones; and AMX, which provides enterprise control and automation systems.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Feisty namesake and former chairman, the late Sidney Harman, was the backbone of the company for half a century. Harman, who died in 2011 at the age of 92, is considered a legend in the audio industry.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sidney Harman and his partner, Bernard Kardon, left their engineering jobs at a public address system company to found Harman/Kardon in 1953. The two marketed their home audio components to the general public instead of to the traditional audio buff. Their novel concept was to package amplifiers and a tuner in a single unit (called a receiver) that appealed to average consumers. Kardon cashed out in a 1956 IPO that left Harman with about 33% of the firm. Harman/Kardon acquired the respected JBL speaker business in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   Harman was also interested in internal growth. He introduced new management techniques emphasizing workers' quality of life, allowing employees to redesign their jobs and leave work after meeting production quotas. His projects, which had varying degrees of success, attracted the attention of President Carter's administration, which brought Harman on board as undersecretary of commerce in 1977. Harman sold the company to Beatrice Foods that year to avoid a conflict of interest. The company did poorly under the conglomerate, and Harman bought much of it back in 1980, taking it private. He then changed the name to Harman International Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through acquisitions, he quickly expanded the business into the auto OEM market, acquiring Essex Loudspeaker from
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   (1981), then moving into the professional audio equipment market with his purchase of Infinity (1983). In the mid-1980s Harman signed exclusive deals to supply JBL speakers to
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   (ended in 1995) and Chrysler (now
   <company id="58357">
    DaimlerChrysler
   </company>
   ), and in 1985 it bought back the Harman/Kardon trade name (Beatrice Foods had sold it to Japanese company Shin Shirasuna). The company went public again the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Harman went into a tailspin (losing $20 million, laying off 500) caused by a worldwide recession, poor auto sales, and four soured acquisitions. Harman, who had been living in Washington, DC, with his politician wife, Jane, moved back to California, site of the company's largest plant. President Donald Esters quit in 1992, and Harman set about reorganizing the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought
   <company id="116928">
    AKG
   </company>
   , a leading Austrian microphone maker, in 1993. Signaling its interest in the new digital age, Harman created a new business unit, Harman Interactive, the following year to focus on PC and home theater systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   It acquired Becker, supplier of audio systems to Mercedes, and high-end equipment manufacturer Madrigal Audio Laboratories in 1995. Harman expanded its customer base by selling to home electronics superstores and specialty stores for audiophiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later the company began supplying speakers for a
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   line of computers. In 1997 it boosted its car audio business with new agreements to supply audio systems to certain models of
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="58192">
    Hyundai
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41827">
    Peugeot
   </company>
   , and it purchased two car loudspeaker makers (
   <company id="44783">
    Oxford International
   </company>
   and Audio Electronic Systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Harman trimmed its consumer product lines from 2,000 to 200. With its sales to Asia down and European sales ailing as well, it closed plants and laid off workers in 1998. That year president Bernard Girod succeeded Harman as CEO. Also in 1998 the company created a remote control with
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   and divested several of its international distribution companies to focus on manufacturing and marketing. Harman sold its Orban broadcasting-products business in 1999, and replaced it with Crown International (maker of high-powered amplifiers) in 2000. (Crown has since ceased operations.)
