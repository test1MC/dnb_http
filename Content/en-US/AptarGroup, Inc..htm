   AptarGroup makes pump dispensers that are used for fragrances and cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, and a myriad of other personal care items. AptarGroup also makes dispensing closures for plastic-capped squeezable containers holding toiletries, and to a lesser extent, food and beverage, and household goods. The company offers aerosol valves in both continuous-spray and metered-dose options. Lines are sold under the AptarGroup subsidiary brands that produce them: Emsar, Pfeiffer, Seaquist, and Valois. AptarGroup operates on five continents, selling dispensers worldwide through an in-house sales network.

  <p>
   The company has manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. France is its largest market, contributing 31% of total sales. Other major markets include the US (27%), Germany (14%), and Italy (6%).

  <p>
   AptarGroup divides its operations between Beauty + Home (56% of total sales); Pharma (31%); and Food + Beverage (14%). The three-pronged approach is intended to better align with market applications and consumer preferences.

  <p>
   AptarGroup has more than 5,000 customers and sells its products through its own sales force. The company also employs independent representatives and distributors who sell its products as independent contractors to smaller customers and certain export markets.

  <p>
   AptarGroup achieved unprecedented growth in 2014, with revenues jumping 2% to peak at a record-setting $2.6 billion; however, revenues dropped 11% to $2.3 billion in 2015 due to decreases across all its segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beauty + Home sales fell 15% in 2015 due to negative impacts of foreign currency and declines in core sales. Core sales to the personal care, beauty and home care markets decreased due to a global market softness in all regions except Asia leading to a sales decline on a constant currency basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pharma sales also decreased in 2015 due to negative impacts of foreign currency. However, this was offset by an 8% spike in core sales, mainly due to upticks in the prescription and injectables markets led by strong demand for allergy products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits surged by 4% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense fueled by investments in new products and improvements made with the company's global enterprise resource planning system.

  <p>
   AptarGroup aims to drive sales by reaching into developing regions, particularly Eastern Europe, South America, and Asia, as well as through business acquisitions, Since its founding in the late 1940s, producing aerosol valves in the US, AptarGroup has expanded its manufacturing footprint (more than half of its product manufacturing now takes place outside of the US) and packaging components (pumps and closures).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company continued to grow in newer markets such as facial skin care and cosmetics, dish care, and hot fill sports drinks. Demand for its nasal spray pumps used on prescription and over-the-counter allergy medications has been strong over the years. It also introduced several new technologies including elegant glass stopper applicators for perfume, as well as a new custom pouch fitment featuring its dispensing closure.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 AptarGroup opened new facilities in Colombia and Brazil to better serve its customers in Latin America and position itself for future growth in the region. It also announced a project to expand its capacity in France (its largest market) to produce elastomer components for the injectables market.
