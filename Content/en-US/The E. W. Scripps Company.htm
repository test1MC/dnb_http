   You might say this media company tries to be appealing to both newspaper readers and television viewers. The E. W. Scripps Company is a venerable newspaper publisher with a portfolio of more than 15 dailies, including
   <em>
    The Commercial Appeal
   </em>
   (Memphis, Tennessee), the
   <em>
    Knoxville News Sentinel
   </em>
   (Tennessee), and the
   <em>
    Ventura County Star
   </em>
   (California). Scripps also owns about 20 local TV stations, most of which are affiliated with
   <company id="10290">
    ABC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="47376">
    NBC
   </company>
   . In addition, subsidiaries Scripps Howard News Service and United Media distribute syndicated news and other content, including columnists, editorial cartoons, and such comic strips as
   <em>
    Dilbert
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Peanuts
   </em>
   . The Scripps family controls the company through various trusts.

   The company's newspapers account for more than 55% of sales while television accounts for about a third of the business. Advertising accounts for about 70% sales.

   Like other ad-supported media businesses, E. W. Scripps struggled during the recession as advertisers reined in their spending. Its newspapers, meanwhile, are losing readers in parallel with that industry's long, slow decline. In response, the company has had to take actions to cut expenses, including wage and staff reductions at its papers.

  <p>
   Edward Willis "E. W." Scripps launched a newspaper empire in 1878 with his creation of
   <i>
    The Penny Press
   </i>
   in Cleveland. While adding to his string of inexpensive newspapers, Scripps demonstrated his fondness for economy by shunning "extras" such as toilet paper and pencils for his employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1907 Scripps gave the
   <company id="44274">
    Associated Press
   </company>
   a new rival, combining three wire services to form United Press. E. W. Scripps' health began deteriorating in the 1920s, and Roy Howard was named chairman. Howard's contribution to the burgeoning media enterprise soon was acknowledged when the company's name was changed to the Scripps Howard League. E. W. Scripps died in 1926, leaving a newspaper chain second in size only to Hearst.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1930s Scripps made a foray into radio, buying WCPO (Cincinnati) and KNOX (Knoxville, Tennessee). Roy Howard placed his son Jack in charge of Scripps' radio holdings; under Jack's leadership, Scripps branched into TV. Its first TV station, Cleveland's WEWS, began broadcasting in 1947. Scripps also made Charlie Brown a household name when it launched the
   <i>
    Peanuts
   </i>
   comic strip in 1950. By the time Charles Scripps (E. W.'s grandson) became chairman and Jack Howard was appointed president in 1953, the company had amassed 19 newspapers and a handful of radio and TV stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   United Press merged with Hearst's International News Service in 1958 to become
   <company id="47948">
    United Press International
   </company>
   (UPI). In 1963 Scripps took its broadcasting holdings public as Scripps Howard Broadcasting Company (Scripps retained controlling interest). Scripps Howard Broadcasting expanded its TV station portfolio in the 1970s and 1980s, buying KJRH (Tulsa, Oklahoma; 1971), KSHB (Kansas City; 1977), KNXV (Phoenix; 1985), WFTS (Tampa; 1986), and WXYZ (Detroit; 1986).
  </p>
  <p>
   With UPI facing mounting losses, Scripps sold the news service in 1982. Under leadership of chief executive Lawrence Leser, Scripps began streamlining, jettisoning extraneous investments and refocusing on its core business lines. In 1988 after decades of family ownership, the company went public as The E. W. Scripps Company (the Scripps family retained a controlling interest).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Scripps Howard Broadcasting merged back into E. W. Scripps Company. That year Scripps branched into cable TV when its
   <company id="125434">
    Home &amp; Garden Television
   </company>
   network went on the air. Former newspaper editor William Burleigh became CEO in 1996. Scripps' 1997 purchase of the newspaper and broadcast operations of
   <company id="16901">
    Harte-Hanks
   </company>
   marked the largest acquisition in its history. Scripps promptly traded Harte-Hanks' broadcasting operations for a controlling interest in the
   <company id="138448">
    Food Network
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Scripps sold television production unit Scripps Howard Productions in 1998. The company sold its Dallas Community Newspaper Group in 1999 and launched the
   <company id="139900">
    Do It Yourself
   </company>
   cable network and affiliated Web site later that year. In 2000 Scripps' financially struggling
   <i>
    Rocky Mountain News
   </i>
   entered into a joint operating agreement with rival
   <i>
    The Denver Post
   </i>
   (owned by
   <company id="41223">
    MediaNews
   </company>
   ). The Justice Department approved the agreement in 2001. Scripps launched cable channel Fine Living in 2002 aimed at affluent households. (Fine Living was rebranded as the
   <company id="138435">
    Cooking Channel
   </company>
   in 2010.) That year the company shuttered its Scripps Ventures fund, which invested in Internet and online commerce businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2002 the company bought a 70% stake in home shopping network company Summit America Television (owner of the
   <company id="140171">
    Shop At Home
   </company>
   cable network) for $49 million. It bought the remaining 30% of the company in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Shop At Home network came to an end in 2006 when Scripps shut down the network after several years of nothing but losses at the channel. Scripps later sold its five Shop At Home affiliate television stations to Multicultural Television Broadcasting for $170 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former chairman Charles Scripps died in 2007. At the end of that year, the company shuttered the
   <em>
    Cincinnati Post
   </em>
   , and the following year it ceased publication of
   <em>
    The Albuquerque Tribune
   </em>
   . E. W. Scripps spun off its cable TV operations as
   <company id="138273">
    Scripps Networks Interactive
   </company>
   later in 2008. It shuttered the
   <em>
    Rocky Mountain News
   </em>
   early in 2009 after attempts to sell the money-losing paper failed.
