   If you're in need of some Vitamin D, you can stand in the sunshine or visit Nature's Sunshine Products.

It makes more than 700 products, including herbal supplements (available in capsule, tablet, and liquid form) and vitamins. Nature's Sunshine Products also sells essential oils and personal care items. The company has operations and distribution agreements in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Its Synergy Worldwide multi-level marketing division sells the company's products in the US and selected Asian and European countries.

  <p>
   The company operates through two business segments. Nature's Sunshine Products (65% of 2015 sales) makes and distributes nutritional and personal care products under the eponymous brand. Synergy Worldwide, which accounts for the balance, is the company's multi-level marketing arm. Synergy Worldwide distributes its herbal products, vitamins, minerals, supplements, and personal care products through different marketing and distributor compensation plans and offers products that are sufficiently different from those under the NSP brand. Its brands include Mistica, Liquid Chlorophyll, Noni Plus, and Core Greens.

  <p>
   Nature's Sunshine Products sells its nutritional and personal care products in some 40 countries worldwide. The US is the company's largest market accounting for about 45% of sales in 2015. South Korea is the second biggest single-country market, generating 15% of revenue.

  <p>
   Nature's Sunshine Products' advertising costs have grown in recent years. The company spent $2.2 million on advertising expenses in 2015, about the same as in 2014 but about $1 million more than in the previous two years.

  <p>
   After reaching a revenue high of about $378 million in 2013, Nature's Sunshine's sales slowed in 2014 and 2015. Sales dropped to $325 million in 2015, an 11% drop from 2014. The company attributed the decrease in 2015 to fewer distributors and foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net income jumped 47% higher to about $15 million. The paid less in volume incentives in 2014 because of declines in the NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe market. It also added income from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities in 2015 fell to about $10 million from $14 million in 2014.

   In 2015 Nature's Sunshine began to streamline its operations and focus on larger, more profitable markets. The company eliminated about 100 jobs around the world and ceased its operations in Vietnam and abandoned the lease for the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herbal products are the firm's super-star sellers, accounting for about 40% the company's annual sales. Top herbal sellers include CleanStart colon cleanser, Yin Pack (a Traditional Chinese Medicine product), Cascara Sagrada for intestinal health, and the Nervous System Pack to help with stress. Nature's Sunshine's second-biggest earners are its vitamin and mineral supplements, followed by personal care products, and its nutritional drinks, homeopathic products, and powders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature's Sunshine fights its competition by offering a diverse range of products (ranging from vitamins and minerals to cookware and air and water purifiers), as well as by maintaining a vast distribution network to market its products in existing markets and to help the company enter new ones.

  <p>
   Eugene and Kristine Hughes founded Nature's Sunshine Products as Hughes Development in 1972. On the advice of a friend, Eugene had begun taking cayenne pepper for his ulcer; the couple began stuffing it in gelatin capsules to make ingestion easier and later began selling the capsules.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1976 the Hughes family, finding a healthy demand for herb capsules, incorporated the business as Amtec Industries; it went public in 1978 and was renamed Nature's Sunshine Products four years later. In 1989 the family brought in Alan Kennedy (from Avon Products) to take charge. The company formed subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the UK in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature's Sunshine targeted high-growth markets -- US Hispanics, Latin America, and the Far East. In 1994 the company formed a joint venture with Japanese drug company Tokyo Tanabe to sell herbs and nutritional products; it also began marketing in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   As demand for self-care products continued to grow in the late 1990s, the company expanded its product lines, as well as its Utah manufacturing facilities. In 2000 Nature's Sunshine expanded its production facilities to meet overseas demand but sold its subsidiary in Argentina the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature's Sunshine stock was de-listed from the NASDAQ in 2006 for failure to file regular quarterly and end-of-year statements. Around the same time, the IRS launched an audit of the company's tax returns from 2003 through 2008. The audit is ongoing and shows no signs of being wrapped up any time soon, however the company was reinstated to the NASDAQ in late 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   A separate investigation of the company's officers led to CEO Douglas Faggioli stepping down and KPMG resigning as its auditor. However, in late 2006 the company's board avowed its confidence in Faggioli and reinstated him as President and CEO. In the meantime, shareholders alleging the company committed account fraud filed a class-action lawsuit. That suit was settled in 2009 for an estimated $6 million to affected shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2010 Faggioli stepped down as president and CEO, while stating his confidence that the company had made progress towards positioning itself for future growth. Board member Michael Dean took on the CEO role, while Faggioli will remain with the company as a consultant for one year.
