    I, Robot
   </em>
   , Motoman trusts its robots to always serve humanity. Just as well, because Yaskawa America Motoman Robotics has installed almost 300,000 of them. The company makes industrial robots that weld, assemble, cut, and handle goods for manufacturers. It also offers related process controls, positioning systems, welding equipment, and operating software. Motoman and sibling

   The company plans to keep its lofty position among robot manufacturers by focusing on emerging economies, such as China, India, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand. It grows by launching new facilities in select markets in addition to strategic acquisitions. The company also plans to keep its competitive edge by designing new products, such as thin-sheet welding and handling robots that can construct lighter-weight automobiles.

   To further penetrate in Mexico, in 2013 the company opened a new facility in Queretaro, Mexico, its third location in the country. Also that year, the company acquired Agile Planet, a developer of intelligent software and hardware, to strengthen its global position in the advancement of "next generation" automation products.
