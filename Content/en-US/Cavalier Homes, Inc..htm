   Cavalier Homes builds castles for regular Joes. Through about a half-dozen plants the company makes manufactured single- and multi-section homes for the low- to medium-priced market in the south-central and south-Atlantic US; it delivers around 4,000 homes annually. Louisiana is its largest market. Cavalier Homes also makes cabinetry and laminated wallboard. The company markets its products through a network of about 50 exclusive and about 240 non-exclusive dealers, as well as one company-owned retail center.

  <p>
   Barry Donnell, son of a mobile-home dealer, and Jerry Wilson (who died in 1996) founded Cavalier in 1984. The company went public two years later. In 1992 it formed Cavalier Acceptance to provide installment financing of its homes. Cavalier has grown through acquisitions, including Homestead Homes (Georgia) in 1993. That year the company opened a production facility at its headquarters. It added manufacturing space in both Alabama and Texas in 1994 and acquired Astro Manufacturing (Pennsylvania). The company's Quality Housing Supply operation began producing laminated wallboards and distributing other components, primarily to Cavalier's operations, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cavalier opened its third Alabama factory in 1995. The next year it acquired the 73% it did not already own of Alabama manufacturer Wheel House Structures (now called Riverchase Homes). Also in 1996 Cavalier continued to expand its component-manufacturing operations through two joint ventures: cabinetmaker Ridgepoint Manufacturing and door maker Superior Door. The company acquired Texas-based Pacer Homes in 1997, and in 1998 it picked up rival prefab maker Belmont Homes. Belmont added eight manufacturing plants in three states and boosted Cavalier's revenues by about 40%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cavalier purchased seven retail locations in 1999 and opened another four retail sites that year. Charges related to the shutting down of five plants that year resulted in an 88% dip in profits. In 2000 the company's primary Belmont homes manufacturing facility in Belmont, Mississippi, was destroyed by a fire. The plant's operations were shut down in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cavalier reported losses in 2000 and 2001, mostly due to tough market conditions. The climate did not improve for Cavalier in 2002, although the company continued its efforts to adjust production by closing plants and shifting production in response to faltering demand. Cavalier created Cavalier Home Builders, LLC, that year to consolidate its manufacturing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Cavalier shuttered four manufacturing plants in Belmont, Mississippi; Cordele, Georgia; Graham, Texas; and Haleyville, Alabama. Production from the plants, which employed about 800 people, was shifted to one or more of its operating plants. The company closed fiscal 2003 with a 36% decline in revenue and a 43% decline in floor shipments from the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2003, Cavalier received notice from the New York Stock Exchange that it had fallen below the standard for continued listing and required Cavalier to submit its plan for compliance with the standards. Its proposed plan was accepted by the NYSE, and Cavalier was granted 18 months to restore compliance. Its stock remained listed on the NYSE until March 2004, when it was suspended and the company's listing was moved to the American Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cavalier participated in building single-section homes as part of FEMA's (Federal Emergency Management Agency) disaster relief for victims of the hurricanes in 2004, which provided the basis for its positive net income that year. In early 2005, Cavalier idled its home-manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
