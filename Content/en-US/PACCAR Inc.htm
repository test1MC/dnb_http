   Old PACCARs never die, they just get a new Peterbilt. PACCAR is one of the world's largest designers and manufacturers of big rig diesel trucks. Its lineup of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks includes the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF nameplates. The company also manufactures and distributes aftermarket truck parts for these brands. PACCAR's other products include Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic industrial winches. With the exception of a few company-owned branches, PACCAR's trucks and parts are sold through independent dealers.

   The company owns manufacturing plants in five US states, three countries in Europe, and a facility in each of Australia, Canada, South America, and Mexico. PACCAR Financial Services operates through three continents spanning around 20 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the European light/medium market, PACCAR competes with DAF cab-over-engine trucks assembled in the UK by Leyland. About 40% of PACCAR's revenues are generated outside the US, with nearly 25% coming from Europe.

  <p>
   PACCAR's balance sheet has made a milestone comeback after the painful effects of the recession. From 2014 to 2015, total revenue peaked at $19.1 billion, the highest in the company's history. Net income also surged 18% from $1.4 billion to a record-setting $1.6 billion during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth in 2015 was primarily due to a 1% bump in truck sales due to higher truck delievieres in both the US and Europe. Sales from the US also surged by 13% during the year. Industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the US and Canada also increased.
  </p>
  <p>
   PACCAR's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years. After declining by 11% to $2.1 billion in 2014, it jumped 20% to $2.6 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   PACCAR continues to examine business opportunities in Asia, with a primary focus on Brazil, China, and India. It completed construction of a 300,000 square-foot DAF truck assembly facility in Ponta Grossa, Brasil in late 2013 and began assembling the DAF XF for Brasil and other South American markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company expanded its range of PACCAR engines in North America with the introduction of the PACCAR MX-11 engine.

  <p>
   William Pigott founded the Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 to produce railroad cars for timber transport. Finding immediate success, Pigott began to make other kinds of railcars in 1906. When the Seattle plant burned the next year, the company moved near Renton, Washington. In 1911 Pigott renamed the company Seattle Car &amp; Foundry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1917 Seattle Car merged with the Twohy Brothers of Portland. The new company, Pacific Car &amp; Foundry, was sold to American Car &amp; Foundry in 1924. Pacific Car then diversified into bus manufacturing, structural steel fabrications, and metal technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pacific Car was in decline by 1934 when William's son Paul bought it; since then the company has remained under family management. Paul Pigott added Hofius Steel and Equipment and Tricoach, a bus manufacturer, in 1936. The company entered the truck-making business with the 1945 purchase of Seattle-based Kenworth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s Pacific Car became the industry leader in mechanical refrigerator car production. It began producing off-road, heavy trucks and acquired Peterbilt Trucks of Oakland (1958). To augment its winch business, Pacific Car bought Canada's Gearmatic in 1963.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in 1969 and changed its name to PACCAR in 1971.
