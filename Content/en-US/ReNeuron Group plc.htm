   While most of the industry is dipping its toes into stem cell research, ReNeuron is swimming in the deep end of the research pool. The firm specializes in stem cell research and development focused on therapies for neurodegenerative and other diseases. Its lead product, ReN001, is in phase 3 development as a stroke treatment. Other candidates include ReN009 as a treatment for peripheral arterial disease, and ReN003 for blindness caused by retinal disease. ReN003 is being developed with

   . ReNeuron also markets a range of cell lines and culture media for research use. Its therapies are based on two core stem cell assets, its CTX neural cell line and its human retinal progenitor cells (hRPCs).

   ReNeuron's candidates for stroke disability and critical limb ischaemia are in clinical development, while its cell-based treatment for retinitis pigmentosa (a blindness-causing disease) it about the enter the clinic in the US. The company is also working to advance a proprietary platform technology to exploit exosomes secreted by stem cells as potential candidates to treat cancer.

   Revenue rose 29% to £22,000 in 2014 due to higher royalties from non-therapeutic licensing activities and a couple of major grants received that year. One grant came from the Welsh government to help fund the establishment of a manufacturing and development facility in South Wales, while the other came from the Technology Strategy Board to help fund ReN001 phase 2 trials.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net loss in 2014 increased 11% to £7 million on higher R&amp;D costs related to clinical research, collaborations, and manufacturing expenses. Cash flow from operations remained flat at £6 million.

   The company's primary focus is making progress on the trials of its ReN001 and ReN003 candidates. It seeks collaborations and licensing agreements with other firms to explore other candidates. In early 2015 the company extended an existing research collaboration with Australia's Bentitec Biopharma after they'd received positive results in early studies of CTX-derived exosomes.

   To prepare for the commercialization of its products, the firm is planning for future manufacturing needs. In 2014 ReNeuron received a grant from the Welsh government to establish a manufacturing and development facility in South Wales.

   ReNeuron has received regulatory approval in the US to begin trials with its hRPC candidate for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa.
