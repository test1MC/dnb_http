   The people at MacDermid strive to always make a good impression. The Platform Specialty Products company makes a range of specialty chemicals used in electronics (for etching and to imprint electrical patterns on circuit boards), graphic arts (for image transfers), metal and plastics finishing, and oil and gas exploration. It markets and produces more than 5,000 proprietary chemical compounds, used for cleaning, coating, electroplating, etching, mechanical galvanizing, and rust retarding applications. MacDermid also distributes chemical supplies of other companies and produces horizontal processing equipment used in circuit board production and chemical machining.

  <p>
   The company believes it is already well-positioned for growth because its businesses benefit from global trends such as the increasing use of electronic devices, more worldwide automotive production, and increasing offshore oil production from subsea wells. It has also been focusing on expanding its geographic reach in emerging markets.

   In 2013 the company introduced a new digital flexo printing plate designed specifically for use with the UV ink, UVR (a swell-resistant ink with low dot gain and high resolution capabilities). In 2012 the printing unit also expanded its LUX Platemaking technology through the development of "LUX in-the-plate", which incorporates the flat-top dot benefits of the LUX process into the plate itself, cutting out extra steps in the platemaking process.

  <p>
   Archibald MacDermid, a maker and marketer of a brass cleaner, founded MacDermid in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1922. (Waterbury was a major center of the US brass industry.) Harold Leever joined the company as its first chemist in 1938 and became president in 1954. In 1959, 57 employees acquired the business from Archibald MacDermid.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales increasing rapidly, MacDermid went public in 1966. In 1973 the company bought Occidental Petroleum's interest in their Australian manufacturing joint venture; the deal also gave MacDermid subsidiaries in Asia and Europe. It acquired Plastron Systems (printed circuit board technologies) in 1974 and expanded into Japan in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales went flat in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Harold's son Daniel joined MacDermid in 1982 and became president and CEO in 1990. He boosted company sales through strategic acquisitions that included the printed circuit board chemical business of Olin Hunt Specialty Products (1992); Allied Kelite, the metal-finishing business of Witco (1994); and the electronics and printing division of
   <company id="10721">
    Hercules Incorporated
   </company>
   (1995).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 MacDermid was listed on the NYSE. The company introduced ViaTek, a process technology that reduces circuit board production costs. It also bought W. Canning (plating additives, UK) for $150 million. Harold retired as chairman that year and was named chairman emeritus (he died in 2001), and Daniel was named chairman in addition to his role as president and CEO. In 1999 MacDermid solidified its place in the graphic arts marketplace with the purchase of PTI Inc.'s graphics unit. The company acquired ColorSpan (digital printing systems) in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Poor performance by ColorSpan and ViaTek in 2000 hurt the company financially, forcing the layoff of nearly 100 managers in the graphic arts and metal-finishing divisions. In late 2001 the company closed some of its graphic arts and surfaces facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 MacDermid won a five-year-old multimillion-dollar product infringement lawsuit against New Hampshire-based Polyclad Laminates Inc. MacDermid bought back Citigroup Venture Capital's 14% stake in the company in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   For several years in the early part of the decade, the company was focused on growth through acquisitions and even hired a CFO, John Malfettone, who had experience in acquisitions through his past job at
   <company id="54551">
    GE Capital
   </company>
   . Although MacDermid largely accomplished its goal, many of the acquired businesses had difficulty in assimilating, and the company decided to put off further acquisitions. (As a result, Malfettone left MacDermid in 2004.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reviewed several potential purchases during 2004, but was unable to find one that met its increased standards. Still interested in adding to its portfolio in 2005, the company found an acquisition candidate that it felt had excellent growth prospects, Autotype International, a maker of specialty coated film products for electronic and printing applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the financial backing of
   <company id="110295">
    Court Square Capital Partners
   </company>
   , Leever took MacDermid private in 2007. After that, the company evaluated its core business and decided to make cuts, selling its offset printing blankets business to Sweden's
   <company id="90930">
    Trelleborg
   </company>
   in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   MacDermid filed in mid-2011 to take the company public with an IPO. The company hoped to raise about $200 million through its offering, to be used mainly for paying down its debt. MacDermid, Incorporated, was to be the chief operating entity for the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, in 2013 MacDermid withdrew its IPO filing, citing unfavorable market conditions.
