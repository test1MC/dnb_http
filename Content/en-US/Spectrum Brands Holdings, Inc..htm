   And you will know them by their trail of brands. Spectrum Brands makes and markets products sold under some of the most recognizable names in the world. They include batteries (Rayovac and
   <company id="91255">
    VARTA
   </company>
   ), pet foods and supplies (Tetra, Marineland, Dingo), personal care (
   <company id="46752">
    Remington
   </company>
   ), and garden care (Spectracide, Cutter, Hot Shot). Its small appliances unit includes such notable brands as
   <company id="11397">
    Stanley Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59234">
    George Foreman
   </company>
   , Toastmaster, and Farberware. A leader in the sale of rechargeable batteries and hearing aid batteries to manufacturers, Spectrum Brands markets its products in more than 1 million stores spanning 140 countries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates from three main divisions, the largest of which include Global Batteries &amp; Appliances, Global Pet Supplies (
   <company id="119625">
    United Pet Group
   </company>
   ), and Home &amp; Garden. The Home &amp; Garden division includes well-known insect control brands Black Flag and TAT.
  </p>
  <p>
   While best known for its general-purpose alkaline batteries, Spectrum Brands also makes hearing aid batteries (Beltone, Miracle Ear, and Starkey brands), as well as zinc carbon, nickel metal hydride, lithium, silver oxide, and coin cell (used in cameras and computer clocks) batteries. The company sells its VARTA consumer brand batteries primarily in European markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spectrum owns the IAMS and Eukanuba brands of premium pet food in Europe. (
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   owns the brands elsewhere.)

  <p>
   The majority of Spectrum's rechargeable batteries and chargers, personal care products, and lighting products are manufactured in Asia. It also has manufacturing and product development operations located in Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the US. About 45% of its total sales were from customers outside of the US in 2012.

  <p>
   After suffering two straight years of net losses, Spectrum finally generated positive net income for 2012 due to lower operating expenses. From 2011 to 2012 the company saw its revenues increase by 2% as it was helped by increased demand for its pet supply and home and garden control products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in pet supply product sales (6%) was attributed to growth in companion animal and aquatics sales, while the spike in home and garden control products sales (9%) was driven by increased household insect controls sales resulting from Black Flag acquisition and strong retail distribution gains with existing customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company bases its business strategy on consumer marketing trends, product mix, distribution network, technology, promotions and pricing, and geographic foothold. It makes acquisitions that bolster its product lines and expand its global presence.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In late 2014 the company purchased Procter &amp; Gamble's European pet food business, which operates primarily under the IAMS and Eukanuba brands. The move gives Spectrum two well-known pet brands in Europe as well as access to strong distribution for its existing brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2012 Spectrum acquired the Hardware &amp; Home Improvement Group (HHI) belonging to Stanley Black &amp; Decker for $1.4 billion. HHI is a leader in the North American market for making residential locksets, hardware for homebuilders, and faucets. The deal widened Spectrum's product diversity and solidified its relationships with key retail partners. Spectrum in 2012 also invested $50 million in cash to acquire a 56% interest in Shaser Bioscience, a privately held developer of energy-based aesthetic dermatological technology for home use devices.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Spectrum Brands traces its roots to 1906, when a trio of Wisconsin entrepreneurs created the French Battery Company. Radio and government orders during WWI galvanized the firm. Its products included Ray-O-Vac radio batteries, and the company adopted that name in the 1930s. In 1937 Ray-O-Vac patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid. Two years later it introduced the sealed dry cell battery, a vital part in mine detectors and bazookas during WWII. The advent of the transistor radio during the 1950s sparked more growth. Ray-O-Vac merged with the much larger Electric Storage Battery Co. in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost its market lead during the 1960s and 1970s, when it failed to push alkaline batteries. In 1982 husband-and-wife marketers Thomas and Judith Pyle bought the company, changed its name to Rayovac, and introduced new products such as a zinc hearing-aid battery. During the early 1990s it introduced the Workhorse fluorescent lantern. In 1995 basketball superstar Michael Jordan became the company's pitchman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Investment firm
   <company id="40463">
    Thomas H. Lee Partners
   </company>
   acquired 80% of Rayovac in 1996. David Jones, who had headed Lee's Thermoscan unit, was chosen to head the company, and he began consolidating its operations. Rayovac went public in 1997. The next year the firm entered the Chinese market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company bought the battery business of ROV -- which Rayovac had spun off in 1982 -- for $155 million, giving Rayovac rights to its own brand in every country but Brazil. ROV had more than $80 million in battery sales and factories in Latin America. In the wake of the purchase, Rayovac announced further restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jordan announced his retirement from endorsements in 2000 but said he would honor existing contracts. Following rival
   <company id="60116">
    Energizer
   </company>
   's spinoff from Ralston Purina (now
   <company id="104717">
    Nestlé Purina PetCare
   </company>
   ), Rayovac announced plans to expand in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, as part of a plan to cut costs, Rayovac closed its Honduras facility, as well as a US flashlight and lantern assembly plant, and began buying those items from outside suppliers. Also that year 8% of its global workforce lost their jobs. At the end of the year Rayovac and Jordan mutually declined to renew their contract in keeping with his 2000 decision.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Jones reported that virtually all of the company's earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 were wiped out by
   <company id="10830">
    Kmart
   </company>
   's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Kmart represented more than 6% of Rayovac's 2001 revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rayovac closed its plant in the Dominican Republic in 2002. The company acquired
   <company id="91255">
    VARTA
   </company>
   's portable battery business later that year. Restructuring in the wake of the acquisition, Rayovac closed its plant in Mexico the same month.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Rayovac introduced its 15-minute rechargeable battery system. Then it acquired electric shaver maker
   <company id="46752">
    Remington Products
   </company>
   for about $322 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Rayovac acquired 85% of Ningbo Baowang Battery, which made alkaline and heavy-duty batteries and distributed them in China. Later the same year Rayovac acquired Microlite S.A., which owned the Rayovac brand name in Brazil, for about $28 million. The transaction gave Rayovac worldwide rights to the Rayovac brand name. Also in 2004 the company moved its corporate headquarters from Madison, Wisconsin, to Atlanta.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a deal intended to further diversify its product offerings, in 2005 Spectrum bought
   <company id="60478">
    United Industries Corp.
   </company>
   , a privately held maker of lawn and garden products, for around $500 million in cash and stock. Including debt assumption, the deal had a value of about $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spectrum Brands then acquired Germany's Tetra Holding AG for approximately €415 million. Tetra was a supplier of foods, equipment, and care products for fish and reptiles, along with accessories for home aquariums and ponds. The principal selling shareholders were the
   <company id="135087">
    Triton
   </company>
   investment firm,
   <company id="90779">
    AXA Private Equity
   </company>
   , and Tetra management. Tetra was perhaps best known for its TetraMin brand of flaky food for tropical fish. Spectrum also bought Jungle Labs, a supplier of water and fish care products, including water conditioners, plant and fish foods, fish medication, and other products for aquariums and ponds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following those 2005 acquisitions, Spectrum Brands created the Global Pet segment in 2006, combining Jungle Labs, Tetra, and United Pet Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rayovac changed its name in 2005 to Spectrum Brands, using a trade name that had been employed by United Industries. The company changed its stock ticker symbol on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   from ROV to SPC as a result. Spectrum Brands kept in place the brand names for individual products, such as Remington.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year the company raised prices on its Rayovac alkaline and zinc carbon batteries by 6% to 7%. It cited increases in raw material costs for the boost, the first in around five years. Later in the year, Spectrum raised prices on a variety of consumer products, except for alkaline and heavy-duty batteries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company then agreed to sell its fertilizer technology and Canadian professional products division to
   <company id="47852">
    Agrium
   </company>
   for about $83 million. The transaction closed in 2006. The sale included two divisions of
   <company id="117110">
    Nu-Gro
   </company>
   , which United Industries acquired in 2004. Spectrum retained Nu-Gro's consumer lawn and garden business. The company used proceeds from the sale to retire debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Spectrum Brands engaged
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   to advise the company on strategic alternatives. Also that year Rayovac Batteries signed NFL quarterback Brett Favre to a two-year endorsement contract, and Remington signed former supermodel and style icon Cindy Crawford as its corporate spokesperson. A US attorney's investigation regarding quarterly statements during fiscal 2005 concluded in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Spectrum posted a big loss in fiscal 2006, following years of steady profitability, David Jones stepped down as CEO in 2007, while remaining nonexecutive chairman of the board for a short period. Vice chairman Kent Hussey, who formerly served as the company's president/COO, was tapped as CEO. In his decade as CEO, Jones presided over the company's transformation from a $400 million battery maker to a $2.5 billion diversified enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company realigned its four geography-based operating segments into three product groups: Global Batteries &amp; Personal Care, Home &amp; Garden, and Global Pet Supplies. At the same time, Spectrum Brands cut expenses at the corporate and operating levels, including the layoff of about 100 employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company put up for sale its Home &amp; Garden business, which represented about one-quarter of sales. Spectrum sold the Canadian division of its Home &amp; Garden business, which operated as Nu-Gro, to a new company formed by RoyCap Merchant Banking Group and
   <company id="104756">
    Clarke Inc.
   </company>
   The business marketed fertilizer, grass seed, controls, and ice melt under such brand names as CIL, Wilson, and Alaskan Ice Melter; it had fiscal 2006 sales of about $100 million. Spectrum used proceeds from the sale to reduce corporate debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2007 the company said it was postponing all further asset sales, citing "challenging conditions in the credit markets." Market conditions reflecting widespread problems in the subprime mortgage industry put off a number of transactions, as private equity firms were less able to float debt offerings as a result. Spectrum put in place a $225 million asset-based revolving credit facility to cover the company's liquidity needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spectrum tried to whittle down its debt in 2008 by agreeing to sell its Global Pet business to
   <company id="15385">
    Salton
   </company>
   and its Applica Pet Products subsidiary. The deal was called off, however, when Spectrum was unable to obtain the consent of its senior lenders for the transaction. Spectrum reimbursed Salton for $3 million in acquisition-related expenses, and said it would generate cash from operations of $40 million to $50 million in fiscal 2009 to help reduce its debt, which stood at approximately $2.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009, unable to contain its growing losses and ballooning debt, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. The company emerged from bankruptcy the same year under a pre-negotiated plan of reorganization that significantly reduced the company's outstanding debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having cancelled its old common stock, Spectrum issued 27 million shares of new common stock to its bondholders, as well as an additional 3 million shares to the participants in its debtor-in-possession financing. Spectrum eliminated about $840 million in debt in the reorganization.
  </p>
  <p>
   After guiding Spectrum through its financial restructuring, CEO Kent Hussey retired, but remained chairman. Co-COO David Lumley was tapped to succeed Hussey as CEO; Lumley was previously responsible for Spectrum's Global Batteries &amp; Personal Care and Home &amp; Garden businesses.
