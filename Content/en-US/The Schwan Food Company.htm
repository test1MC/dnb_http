   Pizza rounds out business at The Schwan Food Company. With well-known retail pizza brands like Tony's, Red Baron, and Freschetta, the company is one of the top frozen pizza makers in the US, alongside rival

   . But pizza dough isn't its only money-maker. Schwan's core business is fueled by a fleet of 4,500 Home Service trucks that deliver 350 frozen food products directly to the doorsteps of some 2.5 million customers. Home Service provides entrees, breakfasts, sandwiches, side dishes, snacks, ice cream, and more to homes and by mail order throughout the US mainland. Beyond the US market, Schwan sells food in Western Europe. The family of the late founder Marvin Schwan owns the company.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's business segments include Schwan's Home Service, Schwan's Consumer Brands, Global Supply Chain, and Schwan's Food Service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Home Service business, which is supported by nearly 500 sales and distribution centers and about 4,500 home-delivery vehicles nationwide, is the largest direct-to-home food provider in the US with brands Schwan's and LiveSmart.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schwan's Consumer Brands unit focuses on making fine frozen foods for sale in North American grocery stores. Brands include Red Baron, Tony's, Freschetta, Mrs. Smith's, Edwards, Pagoda Express, Bon Appétit, and Larry's.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also a big supplier to the institutional frozen-pizza market through its Schwan's Food Service operation, which boasts more than 1,800 active distributors. The group serves healthcare facilities, public and private schools and universities, chain restaurants, and convenience stores with its Freschetta, Holiday Foods, Tony's, Mrs. Smith's, Minh, Villa Prima, and Big Daddy's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the non-food arena, the company owns Bi-Phase Technologies, which is headquartered in Eagan, Minnesota. Bi-Phase designs and produces fuel-injection conversion systems that allow gasoline truck and car engines to burn alternative fuel, such as liquefied propane gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The trucks are part of Schwan's Global Supply Chain business, the manufacturing and logistics arm of the company, moving materials and products between plants and other locations. The company operates a total fleet of some 5,300 vehicles.

  <p>
   While its operations are US-centric, Schwan sells its food items in Western Europe, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its subsidiaries, Schwan operates from nearly 600 US locations, including a dozen major food production facilities located in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Texas, as well as four major refrigerated warehouses. It operates a packaging plant in Pennsylvania, which produces stamped metal and thermoformed plastic products that are used in a variety of business units and external clients. Schwan's Salina, Kansas, plant is one of the world's largest frozen pizza-manufacturing facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's Consumer Brands business has been expanding into new retail categories with its premium and Asian-style entrees and shelf-stable crusts and ice cream. As part of this effort, Schwan opened a new entree production line at its Stillwell, Oklahoma, manufacturing plant to support the Bon Appétit brand of premium entrees and its Pagoda Express Asian-style entrees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Known for its branded desserts, the company's Edwards business rolled out ice cream products in 2011 in the southeast region, where it's most popular, and Schwan's brand ice cream items in the Midwest in 2012. Despite its efforts, Schwan saw a downward trend in the frozen-food category in 2012 after having logged historic growth rates. The company's frozen bakery desserts business is a $900-million category. (Pies comprise some 61% of that total, with cakes and cheesecakes each bringing in 13%.) To this end, Schwan in 2014 expanded distribution of its Edwards frozen pie brand to the western US to give traction to the already strong eastern US food business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Within its Home Service segment, Schwan launched more than 30 new products in 2012 across multiple product categories. New items include beer-battered cod, four-cheese Penne with prosciutto, and a strawberry/banana smoothie. Indeed, new products rolled out during the past three years now account for more than 17% of the subsidiary's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schwan also leverages its distribution expertise to help other companies deliver their products.

  <p>
   The secretive company is under new management. Alfred Schwan (brother of Marvin) retired as chairman in 2009 after 15 years at the helm. He was replaced by longtime board member and former president of
   <company id="10503">
    Ecolab
   </company>
   Allan L. Schuman. The Schwan family is tight-lipped about its business, as the late founder Marvin Schwan, himself, made a point to give no interviews after 1982.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Paul Schwan bought out his partner in their dairy in 1948 and began manufacturing ice cream using his own recipes. His son, Marvin Schwan, made deliveries for the dairy for a few years. After attending a two-year college, Marvin came back in 1950 to work at the dairy full-time. Two years later he began using his delivery experience to take advantage of the increase in homes with freezers. He bought an old truck for $100 and began a rural route selling ice cream to farmers. He quickly developed a loyal customer base and expanded to two routes the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s the company diversified with two acquisitions: a prepared sandwich company and a condensed fruit juice company. A new holding company, Schwan's Sales Enterprises, was established in 1964. Schwan's began delivering pizza the next year. Paul died in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deciding that frozen pizza was not a fad, Marvin bought Kansas-based Tony's Pizza in 1970 and quickly rose to the top of the new industry. In the late 1970s Schwan's entered the commercial leasing business; it later added more leasing companies under the Lyon Financial Services umbrella (sold 2000).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the institutional-pizza market in the mid-1980s and bought out competitors Sabatasso Foods and Better Baked Pizza. Schools liked Schwan's use of their government surplus cheese to make pizzas, which the company then sold to the schools at a discount.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 the company bought two Minnesota-based food companies: Panzerotti, a stuffed pastry business, and Monthly Market, a specialty retailer that sells groceries to fund-raising groups. It also began selling its pizzas in the UK. The next year Schwan's bought Chicago Brothers Frozen Pizza, a San Diego-based company specializing in deep-dish pizza.
