   Golfing is a gal thing at Women's Golf Unlimited. A subsidiary of
   <company id="56987">
    Adams Golf
   </company>
   , the company primarily produces women's golfing equipment, including clubs, shoes, and accessories. Its clubs are marketed under the Square Two and Lady Fairway brands. Shoes and accessories are also sold under the Lady Fairway name. Founded in 1974 as Square Two Golf, the firm changed its name to Women's Golf Unlimited in 2001 when it decided to focus on the women's golfing market. (Previously, it had produced a line of clubs for men and youths.) The company's products are sold in stores in the US, Canada, and Asia. Women's Golf Unlimited terminated its registration with the SEC in 2003 and was acquired by Adams Golf in 2007.
