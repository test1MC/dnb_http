   Business is on a roll at Greencore. One of the leading sandwich and convenience foods producers, Greencore supplies food retailers, such as

   ,
   <company id="41199">
    Marks &amp; Spencer

    J Sainsbury

   ,
   <company id="90499">

   , as well as food service operators and processors in the UK, and increasingly beyond. It manufactures some 4,000 different products across seven food categories from facilities mainly in the UK and Ireland, and a few in the US. Greencore's menu includes chilled prepared meals, cakes and desserts, puddings, chilled soups and sauces, pickles, and more, usually supplied in bulk. After acquiring smaller rival

   , which later abandoned its bid.

  <p>
   Greencore Group's history is rooted in the sugar beet, which promised sugar self-sufficiency to Ireland early in the 20th century. But when industry efforts faltered, the government in 1933 stepped in and took over the fledgling Irish Sugar Plc. The government helped build new factories and develop farm research stations. Despite the challenges presented by government control and the business of agriculture, by the late 1980s the company had become profitable; it diversified with acquisitions of flour, fertilizer, margarine, and malt operations. The company was seen as one of cash-strapped Ireland's best and was selected to be its first effort in privatizing.
  </p>
  <p>
   A group of investors formed Greencore to purchase Irish Sugar, but the acquisition was a lumpy process with some sour results. The initial sale of 55% in 1991 to institutional investors was followed by successive sales spread out over two years. By the end of 1993, Greencore was fully out of the government's hands, but marked by scandal. Insider trading deals while the company was still under government control and bungled brokering led to the replacement of senior executives; the controversy helped topple Ireland's then-prime minister, Charles Haughey. Once the dust settled, Greencore still retained all of Ireland's lucrative European Union sugar quotas, but set about making a string of acquisitions to diversify beyond Ireland and sugar.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 1994 Greencore acquired Belgomalt, a Belgian malt company, and in the UK it increased its share of the Kears bakery group to 50% (it purchased the rest of Kears in 1997). David Dilger was named CEO when Gerry Murphy stepped down in 1995. In 1996 the company looked abroad to purchase a portion of US sugar maker Imperial Holly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greencore added The Williams Group (malt production and grain trading, Ireland) in 1996, and then Pauls Malt, the UK's largest malt maker, and Paramount Foods (UK pizza-crust and topping maker) in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1998 Imperial Holly was struggling -- its share value fell, and Greencore opted to reduce its investment. After further faltering, Greencore wrote off the investment during 2000 and was uninvolved when Imperial Holly declared bankruptcy in early 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greencore kneaded in Bellamy Bakeries (baked goods, UK) and the remaining 50% of Robertsons Ltd (bread, UK) in 1999. That year its Interchem subsidiary added Clarendon Agricare, an Irish agricultural chemical distributor. Acquisitions during 2000 included more bakeries and private-label foods makers, including sauces and desserts makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 Greencore secured its acquisition of convenience food maker Hazlewood Foods and promptly announced a restructuring. Despite all the diversification and new shape to the company's structure, at Greencore's February 2001 annual meeting, a lack of support for longtime chairman Bernie Cahill (largely due to Greencore's poor stock performance in recent years plus an objection to a resolution that would have exempted him from forced retirement at age 70), sealed his fate and Tony Barry was named chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greencore began selling off noncore businesses in 2001, such as James Daly (fats and margarines). It sold subsidiaries Erin Foods and William Rodgers to
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell Soup
   </company>
   in 2002. In 2003 it sold its portion of Enzafruit Worldwide Ltd (Worldwide Fruit) to Northcourt. That year it acquired the Geneviève Langlais ('Crudi') group of companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greencore exited the UK bread market in 2004 with the sale of private-label Rathbones Bakeries Limited to Finedon Mill Limited and merged its two divisions (Chilled Foods and Ambient &amp; Frozen) into one, called Convenience Foods. In anticipation of the EU sugar reform, in 2005 Greencore closed its Carlow sugar facility and began consolidation of all of its sugar operations at its Mallow site.
  </p>
  <p>
   While pizza might have seemed a tasty snack at first, in 2005 Greencore sold off its UK pizza business (it has since re-entered the pizza business, offering such pizza brands as Kiveton's Kitchen and Borgondi). The company's diversification plan paid off in 2006 when Greencore ceased sugar processing under pressure from new European Union regulations regarding sugar production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Greencore acquired a Wales mineral-water production plant belonging to
   <company id="41774">
    Danone
   </company>
   . Strengthening its foodservice operations, it also acquired the frozen cake and pastry maker, Ministry of Cake, which supplies
   <company id="89521">
    Pizza Hut
   </company>
   and
   <company id="57321">
    Hard Rock Cafe
   </company>
   locations in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company entered the US market with the acquisition of Newburyport, Massachusetts-based Home Made Brand Foods, a maker of prepared meals, salads, sandwiches, and quiches. CFO Patrick Coveney replaced David Dilger as CEO in 2008, after Dilger retired.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company sold its money-losing bottled water division to Scotland's Highland Spring for €17.5 million (about $29 million). The sale included the Scottish water facility where  accounting irregularities were uncovered last year. (An executive at the water facility had concealed costs but left the firm before the irregularities were discovered. Greencore investigated and concluded that it was an isolated incident.) The company used the proceeds of the sale to reduce its debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shedding operations in order to fund a deficit in its pension plan, Greencore in 2010 sold its malt operations to French grain processor, Axereal Union De Cooperatives Agricoles, for €116 million (about $158 million). Also in 2010 the company also sold off its Dutch-based convenience foods business, Greencore Continental, to Convenience Foods Europe. On the plus side, late in the year Greencore acquired On A Roll Sales, a maker of fresh sandwiches based near Boston, Massachusetts.
