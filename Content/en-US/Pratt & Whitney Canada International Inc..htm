   Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (P&amp;WC) gives planes a push and helicopters a lift. From its half dozen Canadian facilities, the company manufactures fixed-wing and helicopter turbofan and turboprop engines for business, general aviation, military, regional, utility, and agricultural applications. P&amp;WC also manufactures engines for industrial applications and provides maintenance and repair services. Taken together, P&amp;WC and its US-based parent

   (UTC), are among the largest makers of jet engines in the world. P&amp;WC has more than 45,000 engines in operation, and serves such customers as

   While sales in 2010 were tepid at best, the company's exchange rate foreign currency hedging programs partially mitigated the volatility in foreign currency. Looking ahead, P&amp;WC expects engine shipments to increase in 2011, believing it will return to peak production by 2015 if it stays abreast of its competition, including

   and

   , and expanding its portfolio of small to medium business jet engines to include engines for larger aircraft. The company's PW800 engine, which is designed for a larger business jet, will be put into action in the next few years. Even with P&amp;WC holding a global market share in excess of 10%, UTC continues to spur it on to gain an even larger percentage of the jet engine world of business.

   The ups and downs of the jet engine business haven't deterred P&amp;WC from investing royally in new technologies, as well as expanding its facilities. The company employs approximately 1,300 engineers, has developed 65 new engines in the last 12 years, and is planning to release 20 more in a rather short period of time. It has earmarked C$1 billion (about $969 million) to invest in research and development over the next five years for engines serving high-performance aircraft. To support this technology and increased capacity, P&amp;WC spent C$360 million (almost $349 million) to build its Mirabel Aerospace Center, which was inaugurated in fall 2010. This facility will handle the assembly and testing for the PurePower PW1524G engine to be used in

   's CSeries airliner -- Pratt &amp; Whitney is developing the engine.

   P&amp;WC activities are supported by the Canadian government, which is looking to create more jobs, as well as reinforce Canada's position as a leader in the global aerospace industry. The Ontario government is providing a C$14 million (about $13.5 million) grant to support P&amp;WC's investment of C$140 million (about $135.5 million) in electric engine technology, product innovation, and employee training. Ottawa, through the Strategic Aerospace and Defense Initiative (SADI) program, is giving approximately C$1 billion in interest free loans to the company for the development of lighter engines in the next five years.
