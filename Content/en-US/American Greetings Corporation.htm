   American Greetings has been building its sturdy house of cards for more than a century. The #2 US maker of greeting cards (behind
   <company id="40196">

   </company>
   ), the company makes American Greetings, Carlton Cards, Gibson, Recycled Paper Greetings, and pricey Papyrus brand missives. While greeting cards make up about 75% of sales, the company also produces DesignWare party goods and Plus Mark gift wrap. The company's
   <company id="60694">
    AG Interactive
   </company>
   subsidiary distributes online greeting cards and other interactive media. American Greetings' products are sold through card and stationery stores, mass merchants, and other retail outlets worldwide. American Greetings is owned and run by the family of its chairman Morry Weiss.

   In August 2013 American Greetings was taken private by its founding family in a deal that valued the company at $551 million ($19 per share). The company was acquired by the Weiss family, which includes chairman Morry Weiss. The family formerly controlled about 45% of the company's voting stock. Founded in 1906, American Greetings had been a public company since 1969.

   Cleveland-based American Greetings rings up about 70% of its sales in the US. The UK contributed more than 15% of sales.

   together represent about 30% of American Greetings' sales. The company's core business continues to rest on traditional greeting cards and other printed products, a market segment that has largely consolidated around Hallmark and American Greetings. However, technology is rapidly changing the way people communicate and interact, putting the greeting card business into competition with online social networks such as
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   and photo sharing services such as Flickr (owned by
   <company id="48043">

   ).

   The company is struggling with a decline in its core business: paper greeting cards. (Why bother to buy and mail a card when you can send birthday greetings via
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   in just seconds?) To stay relevant in the digital age, the company is focused on developing and acquiring interactive technologies and other new products to expand its offerings. AG Interactive boasts about 4 million subscribers who have unlimited access to its e-cards and ringtones. Also, in March 2014 the company launched Blown Away, a new collection of pop-up birthday cards with lights and sound.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, American Greetings continues to expand its traditional cards business through organic development and acquisitions. The company acquired UK-based specialty greeting card retailer
   <company id="102189">
    Clinton Cards
   </company>
   in 2012. The deal included about 400 stores representing approximately $315 million in annual revenues.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1906 Polish immigrant Jacob Sapirstein founded Sapirstein Greeting Card Company and began selling postcards from a horse-drawn wagon. The outbreak of WWI and the resulting separation of families helped spur demand for the company's products. The impact of the war also helped shape the company's future: After an embargo was imposed on cards produced in Germany, Sapirstein decided to begin manufacturing his own cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sapirstein's sons eventually joined the burgeoning company and, in 1940, after adopting the American Greetings Publishers name, the company's sales topped $1 million. The company incorporated as American Greetings in 1944 and went public in 1952. It introduced Hi Brows, a line of funny studio cards, in 1956 and broke ground on a 1.5 million-sq.-ft. headquarters building the same year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 Sapirstein's son, Irving Stone (all three Sapirstein sons changed their surname to Stone, a derivative of Sapirstein) was appointed president, and Jacob Sapirstein became chairman. The ubiquitous Holly Hobbie made her first appearance on greeting cards in 1967 (within a decade, she had become the world's most popular licensed female character). In 1968 American Greetings' sales exceeded $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Greetings introduced the Ziggy character in 1972 and launched Plus Mark, a maker of seasonal wrapping paper, boxed cards, and accessories six years later. Irving Stone succeeded his father as chairman and CEO in 1978, and Morry Weiss, Irving Stone's son-in-law, was appointed president.
  </p>
  <p>
   The success of Holly Hobbie licensing prompted American Greetings to create its own licensing division in 1980. In 1982 it introduced the Care Bears, licensed characters that appeared in animated films. Following the death of Jacob Sapirstein in 1987 (at age 102), Morry Weiss became chairman and CEO, and Irving Stone became founder-chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Magnivision (nonprescription reading glasses) in 1993. It ventured onto the Internet two years later, when it began offering online greeting cards. Its 1996 attempt to acquire #3 card maker
   <company id="13571">
    Gibson Greetings
   </company>
   proved unsuccessful. The company branched into supplemental educational products the following year when it unveiled its Learning Horizons product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its acquisitions of greeting card companies Camden Graphics and Hanson White in 1998 helped American Greetings double its presence in the UK. As part of an international restructuring plan, in 1999 the company shuttered a Canadian plant, eliminating 650 jobs. Later that year, in an expansion of its existing agreement with
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   , American Greetings' online unit (AmericanGreetings.com) became AOL's exclusive provider of electronic greetings. The company subsequently filed to take AmericanGreetings.com public, intending to retain a majority of the company. (It withdrew its filing the following year when the Internet market went sour.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder-chairman Irving Stone died in early 2000 at the age of 90. Also that year American Greetings paid $175 million for smaller rival Gibson Greetings, along with Gibson's stake in Egreetings Network. The company later expanded its profile in the gift wrap market through its acquisition of CPS Corporation, a supplier of gift wrap and packaging. In 2001 the company bought the remaining shares of Egreetings Network and folded the business into its online business, and later that year did the same with Excite@Home's BlueMountain.com e-mail cards unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 CEO Morry Weiss and president James Spira resigned from the management of the company. Weiss retained his chairman title and Spira remained on the board. Morry's sons, Zev and Jeffrey, became CEO and president, respectively. The next year the company changed the name of its digital unit to AG Interactive to better encompass its activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, the company sold its Magnivision unit to AAi.FosterGrant (later
   <company id="142221">
    FGX International
   </company>
   ). In late 2004 the company closed one of its plants in Tennessee and laid off 450 people. The company also purchased a stake in Hatchery LLC, a family entertainment production company (sold in 2007).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its educational products unit Learning Horizons in 2007 to a portfolio company of Evolution Capital Partners. American Greetings expanded its digital media operations with the 2007 acquisition of photo-sharing website Webshots from
   <company id="48081">
    CNET Networks
   </company>
   for $45 million. The following it purchased
   <company id="14680">
    PhotoWorks
   </company>
   for nearly $30 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company acquired the Recycled Paper Greetings line of humor cards and American Greetings acquired greeting card retailer Clinton Cards in 2012.
