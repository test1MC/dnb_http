   Active Power keeps the juices flowing. The company's UPS (uninterruptible power system) products use a flywheel that stores kinetic energy by spinning, converting the kinetic energy into electricity when power quality problems are detected. It was developed in partnership with heavy equipment maker
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   , which markets the product with its generator sets. Active Power also makes PowerHouse, a continuous power system that combines the company's flywheel UPS products with switchgear and a generator, which is sold primarily for military, utility, and data center applications. Customers in North America account for about 70% of sales.

   The company's main product segment, 75% of revenue, includes sales of CleanSource power products (UPS and DC products), CPS (UPS systems and third-party equipment, including generators and switchgear), and containerized infrastructure products for data centers. Containerized products supply power distribution, cooling, security, and fire control. The company's service segment provides site preparation, installation, maintenance, repair, and other services. The segment operates in the aftermarket as well as in the realm of direct system engineering for customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has shipped more than 4,500 flywheels around the world.

   Active Power sells products and services directly via its OEM partners, manufacturer's representatives, distributors, or strategic IT partners. Its primary OEM partner, and one of its largest customers, is
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   , which accounted for 25% of its net sales in 2015. Its primary IT partner is
   <company id="163421">
    Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company
   </company>
   , which accounted for 18% of net sales in 2015.

  <p>
   Active Power has seen its revenues fluctuate over the years. After dropping in 2014, revenues climbed by 17% to reach $57 million in 2015. The company has also posted more than eight straight years of net losses, its most recent loss being $6 million in 2015. The net losses have largely been due to high costs of maintaining product revenue over the years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2015 was fueled by a 19% uptick in product revenue stemming from an increase in MIS business that was driven by a large order from an IT channel partner. (This fluctuates depending on the partner's success and needs for modular infrastructure solutions.) Service and other revenue also increased primarily due to higher sales of spare parts.

  <p>
   Active Power focuses on mission critical IT and data center applications rather than vertical markets. To develop business overseas the company works with distributors who resell Active Power products to end users. The company has also been establishing overseas integration, assembly, and testing operations of continuous power and infrastructure products in facilities in the UK, China, and Germany.
