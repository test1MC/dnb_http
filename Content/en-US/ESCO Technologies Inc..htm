   Diversified manufacturing company ESCO Technologies focuses on three business segments: Utility Solutions (automation and communication devices for utilities), Filtration/Fluid Flow, and RF Shielding and Test. ESCO's communications equipment includes meter-reading technology and video surveillance systems used to monitor industrial applications. The company's filters are used in industrial applications, fuel systems, medical applications, and appliances. Test products include electromagnetic compatibility equipment such as antennas, probes, turntables, and calibration equipment, as well as radio-frequency shielding products.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In ESCO's Utility Solutions segment, Aclara is the industry leader in advanced metering infrastructure solutions and analytics for gas, water, and electric utilities. Doble partners with electric utilities, providing more than 5,500 companies with diagnostic test instruments, consulting and testing services, and the world's largest database of infrastructure asset test results.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building on a heritage of innovation, ESCO's Filtration/Fluid Flow segment companies -- Crissair, PTI Technologies, and VACCO Industries deliver highly engineered fluid control services an technologies for mission critical systems. The segment's markets include commercial aerospace, space and defense, satellite communications, medical, industrial, and automotive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In ESCO's RF Shielding and Test segment, the ETS Lindgren subsidiary is the world's leading supplier of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and radio frequency (RP) test facilities, as well as shielded enclosures for medical and security applications.

  <p>
   ESCO's revenues decreased by 0.8% in fiscal year 2012 due to a 9.1% decrease in utility segment revenues thanks to a $34.6 million decrease in net sales from Aclara caused by lower deliveries of Advanced Metering Infrastructure products for the New York City water project ($17.4 million), the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company gas project ($18.4 million) and the Federal Commission of Electricity electric project in Mexico ($29.6 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   Other factors included a 0.3% decrease in Test sales revenues  due to a $6 million decrease in net sales from the segment's US operations primarily driven by lower shipments of shielding for a
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   project in Florida, and a $1.3 million decrease in net sales from the segment's European operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, weaker sales elsewhere were offset by a 16.2% increase in Filtration net sales due to higher shipments of its Space products; a $6.6 million increase in net sales from its Thermoform Engineered Quality unit, mainly due to higher shipments to commercial customers; a $6.5 million increase in net sales from PTI Technologies driven by higher shipments of aerospace assemblies, elements and couplings; and a $5.5 million increase at Crissair mainly due to higher product shipments and price increases on its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   ESCO's net income decreased by 11% in fiscal year 2012 driven by lower revenues, an increase in SG&amp;A expenses due to new product development costs for additional Space product applications, additional content on Airbus platforms, and an increase in head count.

  <p>
   ESCO has been expanding its Utility Solutions business via acquisitions and investing in new products; the business accounted for 46% of the company's total revenues in fiscal year 2012. The company boosted its utility offerings in early 2013 with the acquisition of smart grid services provider Metrum Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 ESCO acquired Crissair, a Palmdale, California, maker of hydraulic, fuel and pneumatic system products for commercial and military aircraft. Crissair became part of ESCO's filtration and fluid flow business segment, and its $27 million in annual revenue is projected to double the segment's revenues. ESCO also acquired Xtensible Solutions, a leading provider of semantic-based information management and integration services. The deal boosted the company's capacity to support utilities in implementing Smart Grid technology.

  <p>
   `ESCO Electronics was formed in 1990 as a subsidiary of
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   . It was created to be a holding company for several Emerson subsidiaries, but Emerson spun it off within two months. ESCO operated in defense systems, defense electronics, filtration/fluid flow, communications/test, and other industrial and government products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of ESCO's growth in the early 1990s came from the defense sector. Its Southwest Mobile Systems won a US Army contract to provide battle tank transporters in 1992. That year ESCO bought the filtration systems unit of Textron.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the face of a shrinking defense industry, ESCO began to build up its commercial products in 1993, focusing on its areas of expertise: valves and filters, communications, test instrumentation, and motion control. In 1994 it won a US Postal Service contract for a mail-handling system and an Air Force contract for aircraft cargo loaders. The company restructured in 1995 and recorded a loss that fiscal year. It sold its Hazeltine subsidiary in 1996 to GEC-Marconi. The divestiture reduced ESCO's defense operations to two-thirds of its total sales and caused a fiscal 1997 sales dip.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthering its pursuit of the commercial market, ESCO bought plastic-filter maker Filtertek from Schawk (later renamed
   <company id="42731">
    SGK LLC
   </company>
   ) in 1997. The next year ESCO acquired Euroshield, a Finland-based maker of high-quality shielding products, and Advanced Membrane Technology, a manufacturer of filter membranes. ESCO also won a $7.5 million settlement from the US Army in a dispute over an M1000 Tank Transporter contract. In 1999 the company sold its defense-related Systems &amp; Electronics subsidiary to Engineered Support Systems for $85 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing the sale of its defense interests in 2000, ESCO sold its Rantec microwave antenna products business. The company changed its name to ESCO Technologies the same year. Also in 2000, ESCO picked up Eaton's fluid flow components business and Minnesota-based Holaday Industries, a maker of specialty measurement probes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, the company increased its presence in Europe with the acquisition of Italy-based Bea Filtri, a supplier of filtration products for pharmaceutical, food and beverage, healthcare, and petrochemical applications. In 2002 ESCO acquired the rights to the intellectual assets held by North Carolina Separations Research Technology, a provider of cross-flow filtration devices. Later that year, the company promoted Vic Richey to CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2003, ESCO acquired the assets of Austin Acoustics Systems, a provider of noise control test chambers. In April 2003, the company completed the sale of its Rantec Power Systems subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   ESCO continued divesting its noncore operations in 2004 when it sold its PTI Advanced Filtration and PTI Technologies subsidiaries to
   <company id="119753">
    domnick hunter
   </company>
   . It also sold its PTI S.p.A. subsidiary that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company bought Nexus Energy Software, which makes software used by utilities for functions such as billing, customer service, and forecasting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 ESCO acquired Hexagram, a provider of radio frequency fixed-network automatic meter reading services. Hexagram, which had contracts with some 75 utilities, had posted annual revenue has ranged between $20 million and $35 million since 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 ESCO acquired LDIC GmbH (now Doble Lemke GmbH), a diagnostic test business serving the international electric utility industry, with operations in Dresden, Germany and Rheinfelden, Switzerland.
