   The Terlato Wine Group embraces the grape from vine to wine. Owned and run by the Terlato family, the company operates both vineyards and wineries and is involved in the import, export, sales, and marketing of premium ($20 and up) wines. Several of its vineyards are located in the celebrated California wine regions: Napa Valley, Sonoma, and Santa Barbara. Flagship division Terlato Wines International markets more than 70 foreign and domestic brands of wine (including Japanese sak√©) in the US through a direct sales force and network of some 135 distributors. Customers include more than 9,000 fine restaurants and wine retailers. Terlato also has global joint venture wine operations in Australia and Italy.

   The company's growth is fueled by expansion of its portfolio of international name brands. Labels are further separated from the herd of high-end competitors by efforts to target luxury consumer niches in the US. Terlato boasts a 20% market share in wine, retailing more $20 a bottle, according to

   Terlato works to extend its geographic reach through partnerships in target markets. In 2013, for example, the firm entered long-term partnership agreements with Langley's No. 8 Gin and Tigre Blanc Vodka through which it launched a new Artisan Spirits portfolio of gin, vodka, Scotch, Cognac, tequila, and rum, among others. In 2014, Terlato began producing and marketing luxury American craft spirits through a partnership with Indiana's Heartland Distillers and began importing wines from Northern Italy's Anselmi and Rioja's Bodegas Valdemar.
