   Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) sends out mixed signals and that's a good thing. The fabless semiconductor company offers mixed-signal and analog microchips -- especially DC-to-DC converters for powering flat-panel TVs, wireless communications equipment, notebook computers, set-top boxes, and other consumer electronic devices. MPS outsources production of its chips to three silicon foundries in China. The company's products are incorporated into electronic gear from tech heavyweights such as

   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics

   , and

   . The company was founded in 1997.

  <p>
   MPS has two main business segments. Its DC-to-DC products convert and control voltages in electronics from cell phones to TVs to medical equipment. The DC-to-DC chips are monolithic in that they accounted for 90% of the company's sales in 2015. MPS's lighting control products are used to backlight LCD and LED screens. The segment was 10% of sales in 2015.

  <p>
   MPS is headquartered in San Jose, California, but most of its activities are in Asia. Production, assembly and packaging, and testing are done at facilities in China and Malaysia. The finished products don't have far to go since 90% of sales are in Asia; China is the company's biggest market with 64% of sales. MPS has sales offices in the US, Europe, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, and Japan.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells through distributors, value-added resellers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and electronic manufacturing service (EMS) companies. Sales to its largest distributor accounted for about 24% of revenue in 2015, and another distributor accounted for 10% of revenue in 2015. The MPS sales process includes working with customers in the design and use of MPS chips in their products.

  <p>
   MPS's revenue grew at a healthy rate in 2015 while net income was flat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales rose 18% in the company's DC to DC segment leading to an 18% growth rate from 2014 to 2015. It combined more unit sales with higher average sale prices to reach $333 million in revenue in 2015, compared to $282 in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, however, slipped about 1% to $35.1 million from $35.5 million. MPS increased research and development spending in 2015 and paid more taxes compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations dipped to $69.7 million in 2015 from $74 million in 2014.

  <p>
   MPS is working to diversify its customers, moving away from consumer-dependent products and to industrial, automotive, and lighting markets. It also is developing new products aimed at those markets and has signed distributor agreements. One such product is a DC-to-DC conversion technology, QSMod, that improves system efficiency, which was introduced in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPS spends about 20% of revenue on R&amp;D each year.

  <p>
   In 2014, MPS acquired Sensima Technology, a developer of magnetic sensor technologies, which will be combined with MPS technologies for automotive, industrial and cloud computing. The purchase price includes an initial cash payment of about $12 million and a subsequent cash earn-out payment of up to $9 million based on meeting performance goals.
