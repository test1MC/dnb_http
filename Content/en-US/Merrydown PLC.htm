   Since Merrydown's £36.7 million (about $70 million) acquisition in 2005, the
   <company id="133899">
    SHS Group
   </company>
   has invested in building the hard cider maker's presence in the adult soft drinks market. The group has introduced a series of exotic flavored offerings. The Merrydown Vintage line has expanded more slowly, but most recently launched a black current version.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merrydown's renaissance follows a struggle with limited resources and a declining image. Seen as old fashioned, it fended off makers premium beer and alcopop (malt sweet pre-mixed alcoholic beverages), which were winning over its core consumer, young drinkers. Merrydown weathered the challenge by expanding with Shloer, a drink that is tarter than other soft drinks. Acquired from
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   , the product was instrumental in positioning Merrydown as a takeover target by SHS Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began in 1946 with three friends who put up £100 each (about $167) to launch a drink based on apple wine and fermentation.
