   The folks at Foster Farms keep their cows and chicken separate. While
   <company id="40156">
    Foster Poultry Farms
   </company>
   tends chickens, sister company and family-owned Foster Dairy Farms of California is one of the state's largest private dairy operations. It owns and operates five dairy farms and milks more than 5,200 cows a day. Foster Dairy Farms processes some 5 million gallons of fluid milk products and more than a million gallons of ice cream each month at its processing plants. Along with retail fluid and cultured dairy products (milk, yogurt, ice cream, butter, cottage cheese, fruit juice, and more), the company produces powdered milk and bulk dairy products for foodservice operators and food manufacturers, including candy makers. Its principal brands are Crystal Creamery and its subsidiary, Humboldt Creamery. It's owned by Foster family shareholders.

  <p>
   Based in Modesto, California, Foster Dairy Farms operates three plants. It distributes milk throughout northern California from nearly a dozen branch locations. It receives milk seven days a week from its dairies and from independently owned dairies located throughout central California.

  <p>
   In addition to milking its own cows, Foster Dairy Farms purchases milk from small independent farmers. The company also owns ranches where it raises feed crops for its herds. Foster Dairy Farms operates a fleet of more than 145 refrigerated trailers, some 60 tractors, and 95 bobtail trucks. Its Crystal Creamery operation is recognized as one of California's largest processors and marketers of dairy products.

  <p>
   Taking advantage of its rival's woes, Foster Dairy Farms acquired two of its bankrupt competitors in recent years. It purchased ice cream and frozen desserts company Matterhorn Group. The 2010 deal gave Foster Dairy Farms processing plants in Sacramento, California, and Salem, Oregon, and expanded Foster's ice cream business. (In 2012, Foster Dairy Farms discontinued production at the Salem ice cream plant, however.)

  <p>
   It also bought California dairy

    Humboldt Creamery
   </company>
   out of bankruptcy for about $19.5 million in 2009. Expanding Foster's line of organic dairy products, the deal included Humboldt's Fernbridge processing plant and a frozen distribution center in Stockton.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster Dairy Farms partners with local family-owned and -operated dairies to accommodate demand for more milk.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company delivers dairy products to local stores and to its branch locations. Foster Dairy Farms still offers home delivery in selected service areas.
