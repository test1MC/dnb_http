   When profits go down the drain at Kohler, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The company makes bathroom and kitchen products -- from toilets and baths to showers and sinks -- under names including Jacob Delafon, Karat, Kohler, Kallista,

   , and Sterling. It also makes furniture under the Baker and McGuire brands and tile under the Ann Sacks brand. Lesser-known operations include Kohler's manufacturing of small engines, generators, and power supplies for both consumer and industrial applications under the Kohler and Lombardini names. Kohler also owns golf courses and resorts in Wisconsin and The Old Course Hotel Golf Resort and Spa in Scotland. The Kohler family controls the company.

  <p>
   Kohler operates through more than 50 manufacturing plants, 25 subsidiaries and affiliates, and sales offices worldwide.

   The company sells 50 different brands across four main product lines: Kitchen and Bath; Interiors (furniture and tile); Global Power (engines and generators); and Hospitality (golf resorts and spas).
  </p>
  <p>
   On the real estate front, Kohler operates a handful of spas in the US and Scotland. The spas offer massages, therapeutic water treatments, and other services, and are paired with Kohler retail stores that sell some of the same equipment and bath fixtures. The company plans to replicate the synergistic model in other markets.

   Renowned as a leader in bath and kitchen design and technology, the company continues to innovate within the industry. It has developed a digitally controlled shower system offering about two-dozen different body spray options at the touch of a button. Its Hatbox toilet combines a minimalist tankless design with powerful flushing capabilities. The company also develops eco-friendly toilet products that incorporate water-efficient design and use at least 20% less water than standard 1.6-gallon toilets. Another toilet offers touch screen user interface, a heated seat, and speakers.

  <p>
   In 1873, 29-year-old Austrian immigrant John Kohler and partner Charles Silberzahn founded Kohler &amp; Silberzahn in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. That year they purchased a small iron foundry that made agricultural products for $5,000 from Kohler's father-in-law. In 1880, two years after Silberzahn left the firm, its machine shop was destroyed by fire.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced enameled plumbing fixtures in the rebuilt factory in 1883. The design caught on, and the business sold thousands of sinks, kettles, pans, and bathtubs. By 1887, when Kohler was incorporated, enameled items accounted for 70% of sales. By 1900 the 250-person company received 98% of its sales from enameled iron products. That year, shortly after John Kohler began building new facilities near Sheboygan (which later became the company village of Kohler), he died at age 56. More trouble followed: Kohler's new plant burned down in 1901, and two of the founder's sons died -- Carl at age 24 in 1904 and Robert at age 35 in 1905.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eldest surviving son Walter built a boarding hotel to house workers and introduced other employee-benefit programs. He also set up company-paid workers' compensation before the state made it law in 1917.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1920s, when Kohler premiered colors in porcelain fixtures and added brass fittings and vitreous china toilets and washbasins to its line, it was the #3 plumbing-product company in the US. As a testament to the design quality of its products, Kohler items were displayed at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1929. The company also began developing products that would grow in importance in later decades: electric generators and small gasoline engines.
  </p>

   During the 1950s Kohler's engines virtually conquered Southeast Asia, where they were used to power boats, drive air compressors, and pump water for rice paddies in Vietnam and Thailand. Small-engine use grew in the US in the 1960s, and Kohler's motors were used in lawn mowers, construction equipment, and garden tractors.
