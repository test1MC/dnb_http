  <p>
   Momentive's strategy for long-term growth includes expanding into high-growth regions while consolidating its sales and distribution networks. It has been focusing on high-growth countries within the Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America, India, and Middle East regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also has increased its shift to high-margin specialty products to grow organically. To counteract softening demand in some of its markets, however, it has been restructuring and initiating cost-cutting measures. It proactively shifts its product mix if declines in demand occur. Momentive additionally continues to seek targeted add-on acquisitions and joint ventures. The company also believes the combination of its two main businesses will continue to provide cost savings and grow revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 its Momentive Performance Materials business unit completed a financial restructuring plan that will strengthen its financial position by reducing long-term debt and enhancing liquidity, and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
  </p>
  <p>
   Momentive expanded its forest products business in 2014 through the construction of two new formaldehyde plants in Geismar, Louisiana and Luling, Louisiana, with capacity of more than 400,000 metric tons per year. The Luling site will serve
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   by providing formaldehyde through a direct pipeline into its adjacent manufacturing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its leading market position in the global wind energy market, that year it also built an epoxy resin and curing agent production plant in Itatiba, Brazil, which will produce epoxy resins and curing agents for large diameter wind turbine blades.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Momentive expanded in Asia and Europe, too. It commissioned a new liquid silicone rubber production unit in Rayong (Thailand)  that will serve customers throughout Asia in the automotive, aerospace, energy, healthcare, and consumer products industries; in Europe it opened a new automotive glazing coating facility in Leverkusen, Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Momentive Performance Materials USA Inc., signed new distributorship agreements with three member companies of the KODA Distribution Group which will serve as authorized distributors of Momentive Performance Materials' silanes products.

  <p>
   Momentive is controlled by investment firm
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Management
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed in 2010 through the combination of entities that indirectly owned Momentive Performance Materials and Hexion Specialty Chemicals (renamed Momentive Specialty Chemicals).
  </p>
  <p>
   Momentive filed for an IPO but withdrew it in 2012. The company planned to use its anticipated $862.5 million in IPO proceeds for general corporate purposes, but cited no reason for the withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, through its subsidiaries, Momentive opened a new Global Research and Development Center and business headquarters in Bangalore to serve growing demand in India, Middle East, and Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, the company expanded its capacity in urethane additives to meet growing demand. Growing to portfolio, in 2012 Hexion bought a resin-coated proppants manufacturing plant with an annual capacity of 450 million pounds, in Shreveport, Louisiana, from CRS Proppants. Proppants are use in the fast-growing fracking segment of the oil and gas industry.
