   Brigade Electronics is a leading UK manufacturer of products that make backing (or going in reverse) for commercial or construction vehicles safer. The company makes the all-too-familiar backing alarm that emits a loud, repetitive beeping sound, but also offers quieter backing alarms that are only audible behind the vehicle. The company's assortment of camera systems lets drivers see what is behind them through a closed-circuit TV screen. Brigade's cameras, proximity sensors, reversing alarms, and recorders are used on everything from heavy trucks (lorries) and delivery vans to excavators and dump trucks.

   Brigade has a substantial growth opportunity now that many regulations require vehicles to have rear-view cameras. The company has achieved R46 compliance for numerous camera monitor systems, including the Backeye 360 Select system, all of which can be used in place of a conventional mirror for the Class V and Class VI areas.
