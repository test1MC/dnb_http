   Steel crazy after all these years, United States Steel (U.S. Steel) is North America's largest integrated steelmaker. The company operates mills throughout the US Midwest and in Slovakia. U.S. Steel makes a wide range of flat-rolled and tubular steel products, and its annual production capacity is 22 million net tons of raw steel. Its customers are primarily in the automotive, appliance, construction, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. In addition, U.S. Steel mines iron ore and procures coke, which provide the primary raw materials used in steelmaking. It is also engaged in railroad and barge operations and real estate.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, the company holds integrated steel plants, including Gary Works, East Chicago Tin, and Midwest Plant, all in Indiana. It also holds the Great Lakes Works in Michigan, Mon Valley Works and Fairless Plant in Pennslvania, and Granite City Works in Illinois. US Steel also has a steel mill and related facilities in Slovakia. In 2015 North America accounted for 80% of the company's total sales.

  <p>
   U. S. Steel has three reportable operating segments: Flat-Rolled Products , U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's North American integrated steel mills' flat rolled products include slabs, rounds, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products. It also has ore and coke production facilities in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22 million net tons (17 million tons in the United States and 5 million tons in Europe) reflecting a reduction of 2.4 million tons due to the permanent shutdown of the blast furnace and associated steelmaking operations, along with most of the flat-rolled finishing operations at Fairfield Works, during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its European operations produce and sell slabs, sheet, strip mill plate, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as heating radiators and refractory ceramic materials.
   <company id="135228">
    U.S. Steel Kosice
   </company>
   in Slovakia, produces sheet steel. Its plant in Kosice has an annual capacity of 5 million tons. In 2015 the company's European raw steel production averaged 93% of capability.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel's tubular steel operation (2.8 million tons per year), serves the energy industry primarily, providing both seamless and electric resistance welded products, commonly called oil country tubular goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also participates in joint ventures with a number of its industry competitors. They include the world's #1 steelmaker

   The majority of U. S. Steel's customers are located in North America and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel's integrated steel business serves North American customers in the service center, conversion, transportation, construction, container, and appliance and electrical markets, and European customers in the construction, service center, conversion, container, transportation, appliance and electrical, and oil, gas and petrochemical markets.

  <p>
   In 2015, the company's net sales decreased by $5.9 billion compared to 2014 due to decreased revenues from Flat-rolled and Tubular segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decrease in sales for the Flat-Rolled segment primarily reflected a decrease in shipments, which includes the deconsolidation of USSC and lower average realized prices as a result of market conditions, including high import levels, which has served to reduce shipment volumes and drastically depress both spot and contract prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The drop in Tubular segment sales reflected lower shipments as a result of decreased drilling activity and continued high import levels and lower average realized prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 U. S. Steel incurred a net loss of $1.6 billion compared to $102 million of net income incurred in 2014, due to lower sales, partially offset by decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $1.1 billion compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   U.S. Steel made a number of acquisitions in the last two decades, building up its capacity significantly. But as the global economic nightmare hit several of its target markets especially hard -- the automotive and construction industries, for example -- U.S. Steel severely curtailed production. A return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and more drilling in shale formations now help drive sales for the company's tubular operations. The recovery of the automotive industry in the US has also helped improve demand, although the construction industry remains challenging.
  </p>
  <p>
   To contend with its challenges, U.S. Steel focuses on meeting its customers' needs and requirements by developing new steel products and uses. In depressed markets, it concentrates production at certain plants and idles production at others, in response to customer demand. It continues to grow organically and invest in key projects, while reducing its reliance on coke for steelmaking by applying advanced technologies, upgrading its coke facilities, and using natural gas and pulverized coal in its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's commercial strategy is focused on providing value-added steel products, including advanced high strength steel and coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, galvanized and Galvalume sheets for construction, tin mill products for the container industry and oil country tubular goods and premium connections for the oil and gas industry, including steel for the developing North American shale oil and gas markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   U. S. Steel's raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also jettisoning assets to save costs. In 2015 U. S. Steel made a decision to permanently close the coke making operations at Granite City Works, in Granite City, Illinois. In 2014, it also announced that it would no longer pursue the development of its carbon alloy facilities at Gary Works or the expansion planned at its Keetac mining facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company's Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular reportable segments were realigned to create and deliver smarter, more innovative relationships in order to be a more customer-centric global solutions provider. That year it permanently shut down the blast furnace and associated steelmaking operations, along with most of the flat-rolled finishing operations at Fairfield Works.

  <p>
   In 2015 U.S. Steel purchased AK Steel's interest in Double Eagle Steel Coating Company .  The 700,000 ton electrolytic-galvanizing line (EGL) became part of the larger operational footprint of U. S. Steel's Great Lakes Works. The EGL increases the company's ability to provide industry leading advanced high strength steels, including Gen 3 grades under development, as well as providing high quality exposed steel for automotive body and closure applications.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   U.S. Steel was conceived through a 1901 merger of 10 steel companies that combined their furnaces, ore deposits, railroad companies, and shipping lines. The deal involved industrial pioneers Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, Elbert Gary, and J. P. Morgan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Morgan had helped organize the Federal Steel Company in 1898 and he then wanted to create a centralized trust to dominate the soaring steel market. Carnegie owned the largest US steel company at the time, Carnegie Steel, but wanted to retire.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1900 Schwab, Carnegie Steel's president, outlined the idea of the steel trust based on a merger of the Carnegie and Federal steel companies. Morgan asked Schwab to persuade Carnegie to sell his steel mills and name his price. Morgan didn't haggle when Carnegie responded that he would sell for almost half a billion dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Carnegie-Morgan combination created the world's first billion-dollar company. It produced 67% of the country's steel in its first year (its steel complex and the Indiana town where it was located were named after Gary, who was CEO until 1927).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company boomed during WWI and WWII. But its market share fell to about 30% by the 1950s, although it set new profit records in 1955. During the 1970s prospects for long-term growth in steel became dismal in light of rising costs, foreign competition, and competitive pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1982 U.S. Steel doubled its size when it bought Marathon Oil, a major integrated energy company with huge oil and gas reserves in the US and abroad. It continued to cut back its steelmaking capacity, laying off 100,000 employees, closing steel mills, and selling off assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Texas Oil &amp; Gas in 1986 and renamed itself USX Corporation to reflect the decreasing role of steel in its business. Also that year corporate raider Carl Icahn, USX's largest single shareholder, unsuccessfully tried to get the company to sell its steel operations. In 1988 USX bought 49% of Transtar, a group of rail and water transport providers. (It purchased the remaining stake in 2001, making Transtar a wholly owned subsidiary.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Stockholders in 1991 approved splitting the company into two separate entities under the USX umbrella: U.S. Steel and Marathon. During the 1990s U.S. Steel continued to close steelmaking facilities. In 1992 USX joined five other leading US steel producers in a suit against subsidized foreign steelmakers. The next year the company formed two joint ventures with Japan's Kobe Steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 U.S. Steel teamed up with rival Nucor to explore a new technology that would reduce much of the cost and pollution of the steelmaking process. The company agreed to pay $106 million in fines and improvements in 1996 to settle charges of air pollution violations involving its Indiana plant. That year blast furnace outages at two U.S. Steel plants cost the company more than $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel began upgrading several of its facilities in 1997 and 1998 and entered into a number of domestic and foreign joint ventures, including one in Slovakia and another in Mexico. Seeing prices drop in 1998 and 1999, the company cut production and joined other US steelmakers in charging rivals in Brazil, Japan, and Russia with unlawfully dumping low-priced steel in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 U.S. Steel acquired the core activities of leading central European steelmaker VSZ. The $495 million (excluding investments) deal -- U.S. Steel's first major foray into Europe -- included an agreement to invest some $700 million in VSZ's facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 USX spun off its steel operations as United States Steel Corporation; the remaining energy businesses began operating as Marathon Oil Corporation. Also that year USX-U.S. Steel and
   <company id="10210">
    Bethlehem Steel
   </company>
   announced they were in talks about possibly merging the two companies. Subsequently, USX-U.S. Steel and National Steel (U.S. subsidiary of NKK) began talks of merging its businesses. In order for the deal to close, National Steel would have to restructure its debt and the Bush administration would have to implement its plan to curtail steel imports. At the end of 2001, due to shareholder pressure USX-U.S. Steel split apart from its holding company, USX Corporation, and the steel operations unit went back to trading under its original name, United States Steel Corporation. The breakup left the company with over $1.3 billion in debt (Marathon Oil assumed $900 million of the company's debt).
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel signed an option agreement to purchase the remaining 53% of National Steel in 2002. That year U.S. Steel sold its stake in VSZ.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its pursuit to consolidate, U.S. Steel along with other US steelmakers received concessions (40% import tariffs and assistance with its huge retiree health-care costs) from the Bush administration. In March 2002 the Bush administration, on recommendations of the International Trade Commission, imposed tariffs of 8%-30%, providing temporary relief to U.S. Steel and the US steel industry. The administration rejected any retiree bailout plan and in December 2003 ended the tariffs 16 months ahead of schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 U.S. Steel made the monumental move to purchase National Steel for roughly $1.1 billion in cash, including liabilities.
   <company id="17195">
    AK Steel
   </company>
   , which had an offer of roughly $1.1 billion, vehemently challenged U.S. Steel but the deal fell through after labor negotiations with United Steelworkers of America proved unsuccessful. With the combined manufacturing capabilities of National Steel and U.S. Steel, the company's raw steel production came in at around 20 million tons of steel annually, both domestically and internationally, which made it the nation's largest steel producer until the formation of
   <company id="138179">
    Mittal Steel USA
   </company>
   in 2005. The year 2003 also saw the expansion of U.S. Steel's European businesses with the acquisition of Sartid.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel again jumped into the industrywide consolidation game in 2007, when it spent a combined $3.3 billion to buy tubular goods maker
   <company id="13982">
    Lone Star Technologies
   </company>
   and the former
   <company id="54133">
    Stelco
   </company>
   in separate deals. Lone Star Technologies was among the nation's largest makers of welded steel tubes for use in the oilfield. The acquired business complemented U.S. Steel's own product line for the energy industry, which consisted largely of seamless tubes. The Stelco deal, on the other hand, added to the company's core business. Focusing on slab products used in the flat-rolled market, Stelco raised U.S. Steel's production capacity to more than 30 million tons a year. Upon closing of the deal, U.S. Steel changed Stelco's name to
   <company id="54133">
    U.S. Steel Canada
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Although U.S. Steel agreed to maintain certain production and employment levels at the plants in Canada, it stopped operations in 2009 when demand weakened in response to the global economic slump. The Canadian government responded by taking the company to court in 2009, and a later settlement of the dispute led U.S. Steel to agree to invest $50 million in its two Canadian plants by 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   U.S. Steel Canada sold its Bar Mill and Bloom and Billet Mill at its Ontario operations to Max Aicher (North America) in 2010. Also in 2010, U.S. Steel sold the assets of its Mobile River Terminal Company and of Warrior and Gulf Navigation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company sold Oklahoma-based subsidiary Steel Coil Services to Macsteel Service Centers USA.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it exited its Serbia business (U.S. Steel Serbia) after the European economy slid significantly, and weak demand caused the company to lose more than $200 million from its Serbian operations in 2011. U.S. Steel sold the segment to the Serbian government for only $1. U.S. Steel Serbia was part of the company's U.S. Steel Europe business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 U.S. Steel also sold the non-core assets of Birmingham Southern Railroad Company and the Port Birmingham Terminal, and recognized a pretax gain of $89 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, U. S. Steel permanently shut down its iron and steel making facilities at Hamilton Works reducing U. S. Steel's North American annual raw steel capability by 2.3 million tons.
