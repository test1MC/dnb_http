   DeMet's, which produces 81 million units a year, is expanding its manufacturing facility in Big Flats, New York. The first phase, which began work in 2015, is to add 20,000 square feet. That would increase production capacity 50%. The expansion also includes a research and development lab and processing lines. Also in 201t, the company introduced Turtles Dark Almond.
