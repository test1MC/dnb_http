        <p>
   Revenue decreased by 15% in 2012 due to a drop in salt sales volumes. Salt sales volumes in 2012 decreased by 23% led by a decline in highway deicing products sales and a drop in consumer and industrial sales volumes, both due to the significantly milder than average winter weather in 2012 in the markets the company serves. In addition, Compass Minerals' experienced unprecedented preseason demand in 2011, while sales volumes in 2012 were lower from the effects of the 2011-2012 winter season which left customers with higher inventory levels and therefore, reduced the need for early fill orders in the latter half of 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income decreased by 40% in  2012 due ot lower revenues, offset by a decrease in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses primarily due to lower marketing expenses; and a decrease in interest expense due to lower average interest rates on the company's outstanding debt, resulting from the expiration of  interest rate swap agreements which fixed interest rates in the first quarter of 2011 and the refinancing of term loans in May 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   Except for revenue slumps in 2009 and 2012, company has seen an upward trend in revenues from 2008 to 2011. The revenue declines in 2009 and 2012 were primarily caused by milder than normal winter weather in North American markets.

        <p>
   To enhance Compass Minerals' deicing salt operations in Canada, subsidiary Sifto Canada acquired additional property in 2012 adjacent to the Goderich salt mine in Ontario. The C$2.8 million buy provided the company with low-cost rock salt storage capacity and additional land for increased ship-loading. Compass Minerals also expanded the mine, boosting annual production capability from 6.5 million tons to about 9  million tons.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year, the company purchased the mining rights to 100 million tons of salt reserves in the Chilean Atacama Desert. It invested $6.5 million for the rights and will pay a small per-ton production royalty to the private seller if extraction commences in the future. The new assets further diversify Compass Minerals' rock salt mineral reserves and could enhance the company's North American highway deicing business as well as its consumer and industrial business, which processes rock salt to make many of its products. The acquisition secures Compass Minerals' access to one of the lowest-cost mining regions in the Western Hemisphere. It complements its existing salt businesses and provides the potential to further expand our highway deicing service footprint.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Compass Minerals acquired Big Quill Resources, a Canadian potash producer, for $56 million. Saskatchewan-based Big Quill's high-purity sulfate of potash is used for non-agricultural specialty applications as well as  nutrients for crops and turf. The deal strengthens and grows Compass Minerals' specialty fertilizer segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Beyond its minerals operations, the company has a unique and profitable way to use up all that leftover space in their old salt mines: records storage. Subsidiary DeepStore Records Management offers records management services to businesses throughout the UK. Its primary storage facility is located 500 feet below ground in the company's 160-year-old rock salt mine in Winsford, Cheshire, and offers the only secure facility of its kind in Britain.
