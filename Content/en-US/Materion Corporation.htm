  <p>
   In 2014 Materion's net revenues decreased 3.4%. Net sales from Advanced Materials segment was down 8% due to lower metal prices, which reduced net sales by $51.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales from the Performance Alloys and Composites segment increased by 2% thanks to improved product mix and an increase in sales volume, partially offset by lower copper prices, which lowered metal pass-through prices by $3.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   International sales increased by 11% in 2014  due to strong sales growth in Asia stemming from stronger demand from the consumer electronics and telecommunications infrastructure markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Materion recorded a 111% growth in net revenues in 2014 after a declining trend in previous years. This increase was due to a decrease in research and development expenses and changes in other-net expenses primarily due to several one-time items. These included a $6.8 million favorable insurance settlement related to a precious metal theft claim, a $4 million favorable legal settlement related to its beryllium pebble facility, and a $2.4 million net gain on the sale of used equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 cash from operating activities decreased by 21% due to changes in inventory, accounts receivable, and prepaid and other current assets.

  <p>
   Materion's key strategy for growth has been to pursue niche acquisitions, primarily for its advanced material business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company aligned its reportable segments as part of strategy in 2014, allowing the company to focus its resources to drive growth across its diversified customer base, while bringing better clarity to investors. It continues to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and will invest in research and development programs seek new product compositions and designs as well as process innovations
