   It's not love for the land, but for steel and concrete that drives CMC Steel Fabricators' purpose. Doing business as CMC Construction Services, the company sells and rents construction material (forming, shoring, and tilt-up hardware) and concrete equipment to concrete installers, and to a lesser extent construction contractors. Except for a steel lineup, CMC Steel purchases its products for resale. Through its parent

   , CMC Steel stocks fabricated reinforced and structural steel, used in constructing commercial buildings, hospitals, stadiums, industrial plants, and highways, as well as dams.

  <p>
   Since its founding as Lofland Company in 1934, CMC Steel Fabricator's identity has evolved through multiple acquisitions of other steel fabrication businesses. Established by Ralph Lofland and Dave May, the company was led by May until ill health forced his retirement in 1939.
