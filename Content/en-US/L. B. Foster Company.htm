   L. B. Foster can help keep you on track whether you're riding the rails, or cruising the open road. The company manufactures new and relay rail and trackwork used in railroad and mass transit systems, as well as in industrial markets such as mining. L. B. Foster also supplies pipe coatings for oil and natural gas industries and pipe products for industrial, utility, and agricultural water wells. It taps federal, state, and local infrastructure markets, too, selling and renting steel sheet piling and earth wall systems necessary in highway and levee construction and repair. Foster's products have been used for the construction and rehabilitation of such projects as the Brooklyn Bridge and Panama Canal.

  <p>
   North America is Pittsburgh-based L. B. Foster's largest market, accounting for about 90% of annual sales. The UK represents about 4%. The company has plants in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington in the US, as well as rail technologies plants in Canada and the UK.

  <p>
   About 60% of the company's revenue is generated from rail products, including heavy and light new and used (relay) rail mainly to transit authorities, industrial customers, and and rail contractors. Its product list of rail accessories includes trackwork, track spikes, bolts, angle bars, and other products used to install or repair rail lines. The company's Construction Products business (about 30% of sales), supplies piling, fabricated products, and precast concrete buildings. Tubular and Energy Services contributes nearly 10% of sales, and include coated pipe, and threaded products.

  <p>
   The company markets its rail, construction, and tubular products directly in the US, Canada, and the UK through a sales force of about 80 people. To supplement its internal sales force, Foster relies on a network of agents across Europe, South America, and Asia to reach customers.

  <p>
   Foster's revenues climbed 2% from $598 million in 2013 to peak at a record-setting $607 million in 2014. The historic revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by increased Tubular products sales fueled by additional revenues from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits, however, plunged 12% from $29 million in 2013 to $26 million in 2014 due to higher general, selling, and administrative expenses. The spike in expenses was attributed to an increase in employee headcount and a rise in expenses related to acquisitions. In addition, Foster's operating cash flow skyrocketed by 380% from $14 million in 2013 to $67 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Looking for highway, road, and bridge construction funding, L. B. Foster has broadened its offerings with a pipe pile featuring material and transportation savings. Its lineup of precast concrete structures, used in pre-fabricated utility buildings, has also been expanded.

  <p>
   Throughout 2015 and 2014, the company made a flurry of acquisitions. The list included IOS Holdings (tubular management services), Tew Holdings (application engineering services for the rail market), Chemtec Energy Services (provider of blending, injection, and metering equipment for the oil and gas industry), and Carr Concrete Corporation (provider of pre-stressed and precast concrete products).
