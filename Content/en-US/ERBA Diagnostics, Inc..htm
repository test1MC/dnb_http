  <p>
   IVAX Diagnostics was formed when IVAX Corporation's diagnostics unit and b2bstores.com, a publicly traded company, merged in 2001. This allowed IVAX Diagnostics to become a public company without going through the IPO process.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company bought the enzyme immunoassay product line from Sigma Diagnostics, a subsidiary of chemical manufacturer
   <company id="14717">
    Sigma-Aldrich
   </company>
   , which had been IVAX's largest customer. Though it lost Sigma's business, IVAX gained direct access to Sigma's former customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teva Pharmaceuticals became the majority owner of IVAX Diagnostics when, in 2005, it acquired the company's former owner, generic drug maker
   <company id="12043">
    IVAX Corporation
   </company>
   , for $8 billion. Teva sold its stake in IVAX Diagnostics to a group of industry investors in 2008.
