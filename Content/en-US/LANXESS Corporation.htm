   LANXESS AG was spun off from
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, LANXESS opened its first US-based compounding facility for high-tech plastics, in Gastonia, North Carolina. The facility produces the company's Durethan-brand polyamide and Pocan-brand polybutylene terephthalate, which allow automotive engineers to design lighter-weight plastic parts to replace metals in cars, contributing to greater fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The company projects that global demand for such plastics will grow at an annual rate of 7% through 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 LANXESS, through a subsidiary, acquired Argentina-based Darmex SA, a leading manufacturer of release agents and curing bladders for the tire industry. The deal made its subsidiary, Rhein Chemie, a leading provider of release agents for rubber products. It also strengthened LANXESS' standing as a leading global synthetic rubber company.
