   Merrimack Pharmaceuticals takes a technological approach to fighting cancer. A biopharmaceutical company, Merrimack develops oncology drugs using its proprietary Network Biology technology, which combines biological data and computer-based modeling to discover and develop candidates. In 2015, it received US
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval and Taiwan FDA approval of ONIVYDE for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The company has four additional candidates in clinical stage development; it also has additional candidates in its pipeline in pre-clinical stages of development. It is developing in vitro and in vivo diagnostics for use with its oncology candidates. Merrimack traces its roots back to the early 1990s.

  <p>
   Merrimack is developing companion diagnostics to go with each of its products. The company owns or controls more than 20 US patents and some 120 corresponding foreign patents, as well as more than 70 pending US patents and 167 pending international patents.

  <p>
   The company has its corporate, research, and manufacturing space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Thus far, it commercializes its products in the US and Taiwan.

  <p>
   Merrimack commercializes ONIVYDE in the US through a dedicated field team; in Taiwan, PharmaEngine holds exclusive commercialization rights for the product. Elsewhere,
   <company id="163373">
    Baxalta
   </company>
   has exclusive commercialization rights for any potential indications for ONIVYDE. However, in early 2017, Merrimack agreed to sell ONIVYDE, as well as the generic cancer treatment Doxil, to France's
   <company id="152002">
    Ipsen
   </company>
   in a deal valued at up to $1.03 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company spent $1 million on advertising.

  <p>
   Prior to fiscal 2015, Merrimack only made money from licensing and collaborations with partners; however, the company launched ONIVYDE in the US and Taiwan that year, marking its first year to earn actual product revenues. The firm terminated a licensing agreement with
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , which led to a 17% decline in partnership revenues, but sales of ONIVYDE totaled $4 million. All said, revenue decreased 13% to $89 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its agreements have brought in revenue, but like many biopharmaceuticals focusing on research and development, Merrimack has never been profitable. In addition to the decline in revenue, R&amp;D expenses rose 16% in 2015; this led to a 78% increase in net loss to $148 million. As of the end of 2015 Merrimack had an accumulated deficit of $802.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also increased that year, rising 203% to $105 million.

  <p>
   Merrimack intends to eventually move into the black upon the successful commercialization in the US, Europe, and other markets of its core candidates. In 2015, it received approval in the US for ONIVYDE in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of pancreatic cancer following gemcitabine-based therapy. It also gained approval in Taiwan that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, in 2016 Merrimack cut 22% of its workforce as it sought to cut operating costs. In early 2017, it announced a major shift toward becoming a slimmer clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm. It agreed to sell ONIVYDE, as well as the generic cancer treatment Doxil, to France's
   <company id="152002">
    Ipsen
   </company>
   in a deal valued at up to $1.03 billion. It also cut its workforce by a further 80%. Going forward, Merrimack plans to focus on its MM-121, MM-141, and MM-310 oncology candidates.
