  </p>

  <p>
   Bel Fuse posted high revenue and significantly higher profit in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue rose 16% in 2015 to $567 million (a company high) on stronger sales of its power solutions and protection and connectivity solutions businesses. The company also saw strong growth -- a 40% increase -- in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit jumped 111% higher to $19.2 million in 2015 from $9.1 million. The company had lower material costs, especially for its connectivity products, which helped boost net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to about $66 million in 2015 from $22 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The electronic components industry is highly competitive, in good times and bad, and increased competition from low-cost suppliers is one factor that drives the company to lower its average selling prices for products on a regular basis. Customers pressure Bel Fuse to cut prices, and prices tend to decline rapidly over the life cycle of a product.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company invests in R&amp;D to reduce material costs and it has closed six facilities and consolidating operations into other facilities. It opened a new, more efficient Power Solutions operation in California, where researchers can work directly with manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bel Fuse sold the Network Power Systems division that was part of Power Solutions business it acquired from ABB. The company will use the $9 million from buyer Unipower to reduce debt.

   On the competitive front, Bel Fuse continues to jockey for a bigger slice of the diversified electronics OEM market, expanding its product and technology lineup and customer base through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most recently it bought divisions of major manufacturers

   ,
   <company id="40615">
    ABB

   , and
   <company id="110386">

   . In 2014 it bought the Power One Solutions business from ABB for $117 million in cash. Power One Solutions makes power conversion products from two plants in China and Slovakia. It also agreed to buy the Emerson Network Power Connectivity Solutions (ECS) business of Emerson for $98 million in cash. ECS has plants in China, the UK, and the US. In 2013 it bought the transpower magnetics business from TE Connectivity for $22.4 million in cash. Renamed TRP International, the company makes integrated connector module (ICM) products at its plant in China.
