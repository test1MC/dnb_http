   Feeling adrift? DeLorme Publishing can steer you in the right direction. A leader in map publishing, DeLorme makes maps, software, and global positioning system (GPS) products for consumers and professionals. Products include its XMap GIS (geographic information system) software, and the Earthmate GPS Receiver that displays DeLorme color topographic maps and aerial imagery via laptop, wireless device, or handheld receiver. DeLorme's Yarmouth, Maine, headquarters houses Eartha, the world's largest globe (41 ft. in diameter). David DeLorme founded the company in 1976 when he sat down at his kitchen table to create his own map of Maine's northern woods. In 2016 DeLorme was acquired by competitor
