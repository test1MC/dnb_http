   It was the best of times, it was the wurst of times: Devro is one of the world's largest sausage-casing makers. Instead of using traditional intestinal lining, Devro makes casings from animal collagen. The company's collagen casings and films are sold worldwide under the Coria, Cutisin, and Devro brands to food and meat processors to hold together ham, hot dogs, sausages, and other processed meats. The company also supplies collagen products for use in the health care, veterinary, and cosmetics industries. Devro's casings are manufactured at plants in the UK, US, Australia, and the Czech Republic.

  <p>
   Glasgow, Scotland-based Devro plc rings up over 40% of its sales in Europe. The Asia/Pacific region accounts for about 21% of annual sales, the Americas 28%, and Australia 9%. It makes sales in all continents and over 100 countries, and has sales offices in  Moscow, Auckland, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Miami.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Devro's revenue fell 1% to £230.2 million, largely a result of lower sales to Russia; the Russian and surrounding economies are negatively affected by geopolitical instability. Sales volume to Russia for the year was down 16%. Sales to Brazil, where prices are lower, were constrained by supply. Global casings volume increased, including in key markets such as Japan, North America and Southeast Asia. Sales of co-extrusion gel in North America grew further, and the acquisition of PV Industries put Devro in a strong position in the European market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income leaped 232% to £14.6 million, as operating profit was boosted by cost-saving activities. Cash from operations decreased 29% to £26.0 million.

  <p>
   The construction and launch of new plants in the US and China is the cornerstone of the footprint transformation strategy in the regions. Devro invested £50 million in a manufacturing facility in Sandy Run, North Carolina, which is equipped with the latest technology. The plant can deliver products to a customer base spanning North and Latin America, and fits into the company's plan of expanding its presence in snack sticks, and fresh and cooked sausage.
  </p>
  <p>
   As consumption of sausages and other meat products grows among Chinese consumers, China has become the world's biggest purchaser of collagen casings. The company is working to serve increasing demand for premium products in China (although the overall market is declining) by establishing a manufacturing presence in the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company took out capacity of older, less efficient technology in a plant in Scotland, putting the company in a better position to respond to market opportunities.

  <p>
   In 2015, Devro acquired Netherlands-based PV Industries, a manufacturer of collagen gel products for the meat processing industry. The acquisition gives the group access to PVI's strong technical skills base and its product portfolio. PVI has since been re-named Devro B.V.

  <p>
   In the late 1950s research scientists of diversified health care and pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson discovered that collagen could be used to make sausage casings. (They were developing a type of collagen suture.) In 1960 Johnson &amp; Johnson founded Devro, short for Development and Research Organization, to make these collagen casings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Devro opened its first sausage casings plant in New Jersey in 1963 and its second in Scotland the following year. It later opened more plants globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Charterhouse Development Capital and Johnson &amp; Johnson director Frank de Angeli led a management buyout of Devro for $173 million. (Frank de Angeli then became CEO.) The company later moved its headquarters to Scotland and went public on the London Stock Exchange in 1993. Dr. Graeme Alexander was named CEO when de Angeli retired in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996, after nearly one year of review by antitrust regulators, Devro bought Teepak International, a US competitor, for $288 million. As part of the US's FTC approval for the sale, the company sold its Devro America unit to Japan's Nitta Gelatin for $26 million. Devro also got Teepak's 56% stake in Czech casing maker Cutisin. In 1997 Devro upped its shares in Cutisin to 93%; by 2000 the company owned 96% (with the intention to gradually acquire the rest).
  </p>
  <p>
   Devro began a restructuring of its business in 1999 that led to a charge of £1.5 million in 2000. Consumers wary of newly detected bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or mad cow disease) cases in mainland Europe contributed to a 20% drop in 2000 profits. The 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, lessened consumer confidence in beef products, especially among Asians, and left the company further concerned about its bottom line. That same year Devro sold its Teepak cellulose and fibrous meat casings unit to Lake Pacific Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm.
