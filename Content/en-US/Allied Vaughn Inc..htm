   When fuzzy, second-rate multimedia copies just won't suffice, you can go see Allied Vaughn (formerly Allied Digital Technologies). The company provides video encoding, authoring, and DVD/CD replication and duplication services. Allied Vaughn's media distribution services and Web management solutions include packaging, storage, graphic arts, and fulfillment.Â The company operates from offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, and Orlando. Allied Vaughn's customers include firms in the entertainment, corporate, and education markets. In 2001 chairman and CEO Dave Willette led a team that bought most of the former Allied Digital Technologies' assets.

   Allied Film, which copied and reproduced film and video products, was founded by William Smith in 1960. In 1993 it acquired VCA/Teletronics, a videotape duplication company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hauppauge Record Manufacturing (HMG), which produced more than 100,000 vinyl records a day, was formed in 1981 by music industry veteran George Fishman. It established manufacturing units for tapes in 1983, for videos in 1985, and for CDs in 1993. Also in 1993 HMG merged with publicly traded RCL Acquisition and changed its name to HMG Digital Technologies. (RCL was created through a "blind pool" offering in 1991 to acquire a business.) Allied Film and HMG Digital merged in 1995, creating Allied Digital Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost money in 1996, due partly to a restructuring charge and a one-time signing allowance with a major customer. During fiscal 1997 Allied expanded its Orlando video duplication plant and moved to a larger multimedia facility in San Francisco; offices were added in Burbank and Irvine, California, as well as in Tampa and Miami. That year Allied acquired video duplicator Denver Dubbing Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   A management team (including then CEO John Mangini) backed by Citicorp (now
   <company id="58365">
    Citigroup
   </company>
   ), bought out the company and took it private in 1998. The next year Allied Digital acquired Minneapolis-based Vaughn Communications, a rival videotape and CD duplicator.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Allied Digital filed for bankruptcy. The following year executives from the former Vaughn Communications (led by former Vaughn Communications CEO and founder David Willette) purchased some assets of Allied Digital Technologies and re-launched the company as Allied Vaughn Inc. Willette became chairman.
