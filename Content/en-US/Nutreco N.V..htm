   Nutreco is expanding its feed additive portfolios in various regions across the globe through acquisitions and investment. In 2016, the company acquired Indianapolis-based Micronutrients USA, a leading hydroxy trace minerals company. This acquisition expands the company's specific feed additive products portfolio as well as supports premix value proposition. And in 2015, Nutreco invested €15 million in an animal nutrition plant in East Java, Indonesia with investment targeting production capacity of premixes, farm minerals and young animal feed. Trouw Nutrition, the company's animal nutriotion business in the region, will be able to strengthen market share. In the same year, Nutreco opened a premix facility in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, which produces both premixes and farm minerals.
