   In 2013, restructuring at Fujitsu resulted in the reduction of 1,500 jobs in Central Europe and Western Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. With that process complete, Fujitsu Technology Solutions looks for growth in the region. In Scandinavia, it seeks to tap demand for outsourcing and managed services businesses, especially from large multinational companies based in the region. Fujitsu has global delivery centers in India, Poland, and Portugal and it continues to build out facilities and delivery capabilities.
