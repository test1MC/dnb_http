   Cavco operates two business segments: factory-built housing, accounting for more than 90% of sales; and a finance and insurance arm, which represents the rest. Cavco's mortgage subsidiary, CountryPlace Mortgage, is an approved Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae seller and servicer offering mortgages to buyers of the company's homes. Its insurances subsidiary, Standard Casualty, provides property and casualty insurance to owners of manufactured homes. Cavco owns 51% of Fleetwood Homes (acquired in 2009).

   Cavco's fiscal 2012 (ends March) sales increased 158% vs. the prior year, while net income rose 438% over the same period. The triple-digit increase in sales was driven by an 137% increase in sales of its factory-built homes and revenue growth from its financial services segment. The acquisition of the assets of bankrupt

   in 2011 increased sales and profits in fiscal 2012. Indeed, Cavco sold 7,860 homes in fiscal 2012 vs. 4,786 in the previous year. Sales by company-owned stores increased dramatically, although independent retailers sell more than three times as many Cavco homes.

   Cavco is the second-largest manufacturer of manufactured homes in the US. It markets a variety of brands, styles, floor plans, and price ranges to appeal to a wide customer base. Cavco primarily targets the manufactured housing industry's mainstream market -- high-value homes for entry-level and move-up buyers. It also targets specialty markets such as vacation homebuyers and developers of residential subdivisions and senior living communities. Cavco is one of the nation's largest producers of HUD-code manufactured homes, which account for some 80% of the manufacturer's homes.

   The company has been successful at capitalizing on the woes of its competitors, especially during the recent deep recession, which led to consolidation of the industry. By acquiring assets of its former rivals, Cavco has added production capacity, especially for niche market opportunities. In 2009 acquired nine plants from failed competitor

   </company>
   for $22 billion. The deal included mothballed facilities in California and Texas, as well as operations in new states for Cavco: Idaho, Georgia, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia. Two years later, Cavco went shopping for another ailing competitor. It formed a new subsidiary, Fleetwood Homes, which bought the assets of bankrupt Palm Harbor for more than $83 million. The deal included Palm Harbor's construction, retail, and finance units.

   Alfred Ghelfi and partner Bob Curtis began a part-time business in 1965 making pickup truck camper shells. The business, Roadrunner Manufacturing, became Cavalier Manufacturing in 1966, incorporated in 1968, and went public in 1969. The Cavalier name was already in use, so in 1974 the company's name was changed to Cavco. After the 1970s oil crisis nearly wiped out the firm, Ghelfi bought out Curtis' share and began making mobile homes. In time Cavco began leasing movable storage buildings, but the only successful part of that business was the security container segment (the rest was sold in 1994). A mid-1980s housing market crash in Arizona spurred Cavco to enter a totally new field -- health care utilization management -- in 1987.

   In 1995 Cavco partnered with Japan's Auto Berg Enterprises to begin selling modular housing in Japan. The next year Cavco teamed up with Arizona Public Service to develop solar-powered manufactured housing, and it also sold its health care business.

    Centex

   acquired nearly 80% of Cavco for $75 million in 1997. The next year Cavco moved into Texas (one of the biggest markets for factory-built homes), acquiring Texas retailer Boerne Homes.

   With demand shrinking and surplus inventory building up, the company closed its Belen, New Mexico, factory in 2000 and moved its production to plants in Phoenix and Seguin, Texas. That fall Centex tapped manufactured housing veteran Joseph Stegmayer as chairman of its manufactured housing segment.

        <p>
   In 2001 the company launched Factory Liquidators, a new retail concept focusing on repossessed homes.
  </p>
        <p>
   Centex's board of directors approved the tax-free distribution to its shareholders of all of Cavco's outstanding common stock in 2003. The spin-off was completed in June of that year. Continued weakness within the industry forced Cavco to close eight of its company-owned retail outlets in fiscal 2004 and seven more in 2005.
