   Janssen Biotech (formerly Centocor Ortho Biotech) has ways of making your immune system behave itself. The
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   (J&amp;J) subsidiary makes blockbuster biotech drug Remicade, a monoclonal antibody used to treat a number of autoimmune conditions, or diseases in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. It is approved in the US and Europe for several indications including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis of the spine). The company also makes anemia therapy Procrit, oncology drugs Doxil and Zytiga, psoriasis drug Stelara, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Simponi.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Remicade is J&amp;J's top-selling drug, reaching about $5.5 billion in annual sales, or 8% of total revenue in 2011 (up from $4.6 billion in 2010). Janssen Biotech has expanded the market for Remicade since it was first approved more than a decade ago (for Crohn's disease) by seeking and winning approval for additional autoimmune indications; the drug was approved to treat ulcerative colitis in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Procrit (known as Eprex in international markets) is another top seller, earning some $1.6 billion in 2011. The drug is used to treat anemia in patients undergoing treatment for chronic kidney disease, cancer chemotherapy, and other procedures. While it continues to hold a leading spot on J&amp;J's drug list, Procrit's sales have fallen in recent years due to concerns over cardiovascular risks related to the drug's use.

  <p>
   Janssen Biotech markets its products through direct sales, distributors, and partnerships. Its top seller, Remicade, is sold directly to consumers, doctors, and retailers in the US, while commercialization partner
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   markets the drug internationally.

   To stay nimble in the face of market challenges -- including drug risk concerns and competitive demands (such as patent losses on older products) -- Janssen Biotech is looking to add new drugs through its R&amp;D programs. The firm has a pipeline of candidates in preclinical and clinical research stages in areas including immunology, oncology, and nephrology, partly through collaborative efforts with the
   <company id="110795">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development
   </company>
   unit, as well as other drugmakers such as
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103325">
    Genmab
   </company>
   . In late 2014 the company entered into license agreements with
   <company id="51457">
    Geron Corporation
   </company>
   and Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals to develop cancer drugs imetelstat and CAR-T, respectively. Janssen Biotech has had a number of R&amp;D triumphs in recent years; in 2011 prostate cancer drug Zytiga received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it still believes in allowing its operating units autonomy, J&amp;J has also been battling the effects of market challenges (including some manufacturing compliance troubles) by conducting broad restructuring and consolidation efforts. As a result, the company's name was changed from Centocor Ortho Biotech to Janssen Biotech in 2011; the move was part of J&amp;J's program to unite its pharma manufacturing units under a new operating division, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, which also includes
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   (neurology and other drugs) and Janssen Therapeutics (HIV therapies).

   To add to its pulmonary offerings, in 2010 Janssen Biotech purchased RespiVert, a private UK-based company engaged in the development of small-molecule, inhaled therapies designed to treat pulmonary diseases. RespiVert's lead compounds included potential treatments for asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cystic fibrosis.

  <p>
   Michael Wall and Hubert Schoemaker began Centocor in 1979 to make diagnostic medical tests. To avoid the costs of analyzer development, Centocor created tests to work on other companies' equipment. Centocor went public in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm aspired to make more than diagnostic products, and in the 1980s it began developing drugs. It raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a 1990 stock offering and focused on Centoxin, a treatment for septicemia, an often deadly infection. Anticipating FDA approval, the company ramped up manufacturing. In 1992, however, the FDA turned down the drug, and Centocor posted a series of losses over the next five years. The debacle forced it to shelve plans to evolve into an independent drug company and move toward collaborations with other firms. In 1994 it teamed with
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   to market ReoPro, which had sales of $23 million the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Centocor spun off its diagnostics unit. In 1998 it bought the rights to Retavase from
   <company id="41787">
    Roche Holdings
   </company>
   and sold Schering-Plough some rights to Remicade, which the FDA approved that year to treat Crohn's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Years of losses gave the company a pile of tax carryovers, which it used to beautify its bottom line in 1998. The next year
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   bought Centocor, and the FDA cleared Remicade as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. The FDA approved expanded use of Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis in 2000 and again two years later, making it the first drug to improve sufferers' mobility. Then the company received EU approval for the blockbuster Remicade as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's operations were broadened in 2008 when parent J&amp;J decided to combine Centocor and another J&amp;J unit,
   <company id="104020">
    Ortho Biotech
   </company>
   , to create Centocor Ortho Biotech. The merger was part of J&amp;J's consolidation efforts; the two companies moved into Centocor's existing headquarters. Parent J&amp;J made the decision in response to the shrinking market for Ortho Biotech's anemia drug Procrit, which faced a tougher market after safety concerns led the FDA to place stronger warnings on its label.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help fill out Janssen Biotech's pipeline, J&amp;J acquired
   <company id="159501">
    Cougar Biotechnology
   </company>
   for $1 billion in mid-2009. Cougar brought with it a compound in late-stage trials for treating prostate cancer. The company also has four other potential cancer treatments in its pipeline at various stages of development, making it a good fit with the unit's cancer treatment focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Drug candidate Simponi was approved in 2009 as a once-monthly treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Its other monoclonal antibody candidate, Stelara, was approved for treatment of psoriasis in the US in 2009; the drug had previously been approved in Canada and the EU to treat moderate to severe psoriasis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to streamline branding among its drug division, in 2011 Centocor Ortho Biotech was renamed Janssen Biotech.
