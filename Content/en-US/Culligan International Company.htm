   "Hey Culligan Man!" To be sure, the phrase made famous by an earlier advertising campaign still rings in the ears of Culligan International workers. Formerly a subsidiary of
   <company id="101315">
    Veolia Environnement
   </company>
   , Culligan produces filters for tap water, household water softeners, microfiltration products, desalination systems, and portable deionization services for commercial and industrial users. The "Culligan Man" noted in the advertising phrase delivers bottled water and water systems to consumers and businesses through more than 800 Culligan company-owned and franchised dealers. Culligan also has a commercial and industrial business, Culligan Matrix Solutions.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Culligan operates in more than 90 countries. It has a large network of locations in the US and an expanding presence in European markets such as Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />

   Sales and Marketing

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Culligan's strategy is to leverage its well-known brand, and its more than 70-year history and single-minded focus on improving water quality by using innovative technology and providing consistent service in order to maintain and build customer loyalty.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company offers programs that allows customers to finance purchases from franchises.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Culligan was awarded a contract by the Water and Sanitation Corporation in Rwanda to design and install a water treatment plant to provide drinking water to Kigali, that country's capital city. The expanded production will help Kigali to keep pace with future water demand.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 the company launched its innovative Culligan High Efficiency Water Softener Series for commercial water treatment in Europe. It launched the system (which can help a company reduce its water use) in North America in 2011. The Water Softener series addresses the most common concerns of commercial users, such as operating, labor, and maintenance costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to refocus its efforts on its franchise business, in 2011 Culligan announced an initiative to reduce the number of company-owned dealerships in North America. The company put about about 100 operations (mainly in major metropolitan areas) up for sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   Culligan sold its Culligan Store Solutions vended water business to Primo Water Corporation in 2010. The deal, valued at $105 million, gave Primo some 4,500 retail outlets in the US and Canada. The sale of the business allowed Culligan to focus on its water treatment and filtration operations, and to enhance its presence in the industrial water treatment industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ultimate parent of the company is Culligan Worldwide Ltd., which is controlled by buyout firm
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1936 by Emmett Culligan.
