   Jimi Hendrix's electrified version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" showed what at least one Fender guitar could do. Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) is the world's #1 maker of stringed instruments and the nation's #1 manufacturer of solid-body electric guitars, including the Stratocaster and Telecaster lines that have made it a favorite of strummers. It also makes acoustic guitars, electric basses, mandolins, banjos, and violins, as well as amplifiers. The company's other notable brands include Guild, Tacoma, Gretsch, Jackson, Charvel, EVH, SWR, Groove Tubes, and Squier. Private equity firm Weston Presidio owns 43% of Fender; Japanese distributors Yamano Music and Kanda Shokai own another 25%.

  <p>
   Fender filed a $200 million IPO in March, planning to use about half of that to pay down debt. It then reduced the asking price to $150 million before calling the deal off entirely in August, citing unfavorable market conditions.

   Fender, a musical instrument and accessories maker, marketer, and distributor, boasts a bulging portfolio of brands, including Squier, Gretsch, Jackson, Takamine, EVH, Ovation, Charvel, Passport, Groove Tubes, and namesake Fender, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary
   <company id="118434">
    Kaman Music Corporation
   </company>
   makes and distributors guitars under the Ovation, Takamine, and Hamer names. It's also responsible for producing Latin percussion, Gretsch drums, Gibraltar hardware, Toca percussion, Sabian cymbals, and Genz Benz amplifiers. The company's wholesale division -- FMI Wholesale -- sells to dealers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Besides selling its products through specialty stores and through distributors, Fender offers a full catalog of more than 36,000 wholesale music products.

   In recent years, Fender has focused on business abroad. It opened a custom-shop showroom -- the first of its kind -- in Mexico City in 2012 that's independently owned and operated by music store Holocausto Music. It also expanded in China by opening a new office in Beijing that's staffed by branding and marketing experts who aim to extend the reach of the brand there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because most Fender guitars are relatively affordable, they are known as "the working man's guitar." However, Fender works to offer its customers products across all price points. To this end, custom guitars can reach $75,000 or so. The company is expanding further into the value-priced instrument market with its FMI Wholesale division, which sells to a broader network of dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The instruments maker also has been working to expand its customer base to include more women. Through a national effort, Fender is looking to attract the fairer sex to play, produce, compose, or listen to music. As part of the campaign, Fender developed a Girl Rock Nation website to act as a destination to learn about songwriting, music production, and how to play an instrument.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also getting into apparel. In 2013 Fender inked a deal with Dragonfly Clothing to make a line of music-inspired dress shirts, work shirts, laser-printed microfiber shirts, denim and leather outerwear, and T-shirts. The line sells at specialty apparel and finer department stores throughout North America and Europe.

  <p>
   Fender is not known to be an acquisitive company. The company's most recent purchase to expand its business was back in 2008, when it bought
   <company id="118434">
    KMC Music
   </company>
   from
   <company id="13886">
    Kaman Corporation
   </company>
   . The deal, valued at some $117 million, has given Fender a deeper product offering in guitars (with Kaman's Ovation and Hamer brands), Toca hand percussion products, and Genz Benz amps, as well as access to the exclusive US sales for Sabian cymbals. The acquisition also created a music products company second only to
   <company id="41793">
    Yamaha Corp.
   </company>
   in scale. Soon after, Fender kickstarted a three-year integration of KMC, which included streamlining their shared operations, changing Kaman Music's name to KMC Music, and moving the subsidiary's headquarters within Bloomfield, Connecticut.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Fender made plans to sell its Guild guitar brand and assets to Cordoba Music Group, which specializes in manufacturing acoustic guitars, ukuleles, and accessories.

  <p>
   Leo Fender and Doc Kauffman formed K&amp;F Manufacturing in 1943 and made transducers (or pickups) for electric guitars. Soon thereafter, Fender bought out Kauffman and renamed the business Fender Electric Instruments Company. In 1951 the company introduced the Broadcaster, a simple, two-pickup instrument that is widely regarded as the first successful solid-body electric guitar. Three years later Fender added the now legendary Stratocaster electric guitar to its lineup. A perennial favorite, the guitar found its way into the hands of pop music luminaries such as Buddy Holly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1965 Fender sold the company to CBS for $13 million. Though the company suffered complaints about quality, CBS boosted sales to almost $60 million by 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing stiff competition from Japan, Fender began losing money, forcing CBS to sell the company to then Fender division president William Schultz and a group of investors for $12.5 million in 1985. Schultz halted US production, laid off more than 700 employees, and changed the company's name to Fender Musical Instruments; he also managed to turn the company around. In 1995 Fender acquired the Guild guitar line from guitar maker U.S. Music.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened a new $20 million production facility in Corona, California, in 1998. In 1999 Fender began selling its products through Musician's Friend, a musical equipment e-commerce site and catalog owned by Guitar Center. Also that year it began selling the guitars of Robert Benedetto, considered the world's top maker of jazz guitars. Fender introduced its American Series guitar in 2000; the guitar replaced the American Standard, the "bread and butter" of the company's products since 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a 2002 agreement with The Gretsch Company, makers of vintage, hollowbody acoustic and bass guitars, and percussion, Fender gained operational control (development, production, marketing, and distribution) of all Gretsch stringed-instrument products, effective January 2003. Also in 2002, Fender acquired the Charvel/Jackson guitar product line from Akai Musical Instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company acquired certain assets of SWR Sound Corporation, maker of bass amplification products. In October 2004 Fender acquired Tacoma Guitar, which designs the Olympia acoustic guitar.
