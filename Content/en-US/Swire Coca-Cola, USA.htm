   The USA contributed about 26% of Swire Pacific's beverages segment's revenue in 2013. Overall, beverage sales increased 5% in 2013 versus 2012. A decrease in the sales of sparkling drinks was offset by growth in still beverages, such as water. Sales of energy drinks and water grew significantly. Prices were weak during 2013 due to lower pricing for national accounts. However, raw materials and marketing expenses were also lower.

   Swire is focusing on increasing volume and profitability and making its beverages available in more markets. It's also looking to sell more categories of beverages within brands. In 2013, Swire and
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   partnered to create a stronger US business model through the granting of new, expanded territories. Under the arrangement, Swire assumed territories in Colorado, including the Denver and Colorado Springs markets, which border Swiire's existing territories.

   The company has been increasing capacity and several of its facilities. In 2013 it expanded its 400,000-square-foot-plus headquarters in Draper, Utah to keep up with its growth over the last few years and to allow for future expansion. It has leased a 257,351-square-foot warehouse in the Denver area from which it plans to serve the Denver metro area beginning in May 2014.
