   Descendants of founder Milton Levy own the company.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NCH was established in 1919.
  </p>
  <p>
   Salesman Milton Levy founded National Disinfectant Co. in Dallas in 1919 to make disinfectants, insecticides, and soaps. The company's offerings grew in the 1930s to include Everbrite, a top-selling industrial floor wax. Levy's sons, Irvin, Lester, and Milton Jr., worked for the company as teenagers and took over its management after their father's death in 1946.
  </p>
  <p>
   National Disinfectant expanded geographically in the 1950s and 1960s, opening its first branch office in St. Louis in 1956. The company changed its name to National Chemsearch in 1960 to reflect its diversity. It also expanded into Europe and Latin America. National Chemsearch went public in 1965. Acquisitions boosted its product line to about 250 items by 1970. The company shortened its name to NCH in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   NCH expanded its marketing to include catalog sales, direct mail, and telemarketing in 1986. It opened a South Korean plant in 1992. Troubled economies in Mexico and Venezuela hurt profits in 1994, and the next year NCH began work on a long-term business strategy that envisioned third-generation Levy family members moving into higher executive ranks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Softened currency rates in Europe and Asia contributed to a decrease in profits for fiscal 1999. That year NCH focused on strengthening its customer relationships by boosting sales staff training and implementing an Internet-based corporate network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Irvin Levy became the company's chairman and NCH sold its electronic components business. The next year the company shut down its direct broadcast satellite equipment operations. In February 2002 the Levys took the company private by purchasing the 43% of the company that they didn't already own. The brothers originally offered a 20% premium to buy the shares but were greeted by lawsuits from shareholders who claimed they were taking advantage of a depressed market. The Levys settled the suits by upping the offer by $120 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 subsidiaries Chem-Aqua and Nephros signed a non-exclusive distributor agreement for Chem-Aqua to distribute Nephros's innovative ultrafilters in North America. The addition of Nephros ultrafilters to Chem-Aqua's product line allows both companies to offer their institutional customers a comprehensive multi-barrier approach for the prevention of waterborne infection.
