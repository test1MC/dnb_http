   The Allen family counts its chickens before
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   after they hatch. Allen Harim Foods is a vertically integrated poultry operation that includes breeding, hatching, feed milling, and processing of its chickens. It operates about 25 of its own "growout" farms and contracts with about 170 independent farms to raise the rest of its chickens. Allen Harim offers whole frying, roasting, and rotisserie chickens, chicken parts, and tray packs. It sells 600 million pounds of chicken a year to food retailers in the US and throughout the rest of the world.

   To mirror the company's commitment to the future, Allen Harim in 2014 launched a rebranding initiative that includes a new logo, color palette, and a new vision/mission/values statement. As part of the effort, the poultry processor is underscoring its focus on growing its customer base and expanding its product line.

   Soon after the company sold its Allen Biotech, LLC, company to
   <company id="105059">
    Valley Proteins
   </company>
   in 2013, Allen Harim purchased the former
   <company id="162901">
    Pinnacle Foods
   </company>
   Vlasic processing plant located in Millsboro, Delaware. The deal, estimated at $100 million, stands to boost Allen Harim's employee count by 700. Adding the Millsboro plant to its operations allows Allen Harim to extend its reach into new markets, boost its processing capacity, and roll out new products.

  <p>
   The poultry producer listed both assets and debt in the $50 million to $100 million range in its mid-2011 bankruptcy filing. The company made initial plans to sell nearly all of its assets, including its inventory and facilities in Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina, to a new affiliate of
   <company id="113589">
    Mountaire Farms, Inc.
   </company>
   for $30 million. Those plans unraveled in July, when South Korean meat producer Harim outbid Mountaire at auction with a $48 million offer.
