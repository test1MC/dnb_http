   You might say this company makes headlines in Italy. RCS MediaGroup is a diversified media company with operations in newspapers, magazines, and book publishing. Its newspapers include
   <em>
    Corriere della Sera
   </em>
   , Italy's top daily, and sports paper
   <em>
    La Gazzetta dello Sport
   </em>
   , as well as Spain's #2 daily
   <em>
    El Mundo
   </em>
   (published by subsidiary
   <company id="102900">
    Unidad Editorial
   </company>
   ). The company's magazine division produces a number of general interest and specialty titles, while trade books are published through about a dozen subsidiaries. In addition, it has interests in outdoor advertising, digital media, and television. RCS is controlled by a group that includes investment bank
   <company id="91652">
    Mediobanca
   </company>
   and Fiat Partecipazioni, part of
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat.

  <p>
   Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali began as the product of Giovanni Agnelli's efforts to face the new economic order of a unified Europe. In the 1990s the largest Fiat stockholder reshuffled many of his personal and corporate holdings into several new companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   One was Gemina, whose components included financial services, the RCS Editori publishing interests (books, newspapers and magazines, and paper), Fila athletic shoes and clothing, and small interests in Pirelli (tires) and banks in Italy and Monaco. In 1994 Gemina bought Gruppo Finanziario Tessile (GFT), Italy's leading manufacturer of designer clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   GFT was founded as a uniform maker in 1930 by the Rivetti family of Turin, Italy. In 1960 it began manufacturing high-quality clothing for Valentino and in the 1970s and 1980s, as Giorgio Armani helped lead an Italian fashion renaissance, it became one of Italy's top fashion companies. By the 1990s, however, GFT ran into trouble, in part because of lavish spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gemina suffered a financial scandal in 1995 involving dozens of executives who falsified accounts and illegally distributed profits. (Some were cleared; some, including Fiat's CEO, Cesare Romiti, received suspended sentences.) The next year the company announced plans to separate its financial business from its industrial, apparel, and editorial holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even as the new company, Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali (HPI), went public in March of 1997, Gemina's owners (including the Agnellis, Romiti, and secretive investment bank Mediobanca, the former employer of HPI managing director Maurizio Romiti) were planning a link with Marzotto, which is majority owner of Hugo Boss and a maker of clothing for several designers. But after approval of both boards to create a luxury goods powerhouse, Marzotto withdrew, citing control issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cash-rich company was renamed HdP in late 1997. It continued with plans to assemble its own luxury goods empire, buying Valentino from its founders, Valentino Garavani and his partner Giancarlo Giammetti, in 1998. Valentino was founded in 1959 and made its first big publicity splash in 1960 when Elizabeth Taylor wore a Valentino gown to the premier of
   <i>
    Spartacus
   </i>
   . But by the 1990s Valentino, while still a classic fashion stalwart, was showing its middle age; it had also squandered some of its cachet with more than 30 product licenses, and Garavani and Giammetti were beginning to think of retirement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Maurizio reasoned that adding an in-house designer name to its Armani and Ungaro manufacturing operations would enable HdP to streamline its operations, as well as position it for building its own brands. During 1998, however, the company lost the Ungaro contract. Moreover, reorganization at Valentino, which included reacquiring its licenses, was proceeding slowly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Armani moved to control its production and purchased two factories from GFT, effectively ending the licensing agreements. GFT later bought design house Joseph Abboud for $65 million. HdP announced plans to exit the fashion business in 2001, putting GFT (including the Valentino and Joseph Abboud fashion houses) and its stake in Fila on the block.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2002, HdP completed the sale of Valentino to Marzotto for more than $200 million. The company changed its name in 2003 to RCS MediaGroup. That same year it sold Fila to
   <company id="108268">
    Sport Brands International
   </company>
   . In 2005 the company acquired a stake in online services firm Dada Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   RCS in 2007 acquired Spanish newspaper company
   <company id="101604">
    Recoletos Grupo de Comunicaci√≥n
   </company>
   for about $1.4 billion and merged it with Unedisa to form
   <company id="102900">
    Unidad Editorial
   </company>
   .
