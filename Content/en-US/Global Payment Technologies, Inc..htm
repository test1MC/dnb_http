   GPT's advice: Don't take any wooden nickels (or counterfeit dollar bills). Global Payment Technologies (GPT) makes systems that detect counterfeit paper currency. The gaming industry accounts for most of GPT's sales, but the company also makes products for vending machines, beverage dispensers, and other devices. GPT's basic currency validators accept, count, and store legal tender. Its advanced Generation II and Argus systems recognize coins and paper denominations from more than 50 countries, and incorporate bar-code readers, security sensors, and other features.

  <p>
   Joseph Vogel founded Coin Bill Validator (CBV) in 1988 to serve the increasing demand for paper currency validators in beverage, food, and novelty vending machines. In 1993 the company started targeting gaming machines and automated vending machines that dispense beverages, telephone cards, and postage stamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   CBV went public in 1995. The following year, shortly before his death, Vogel brought in Stephen Katz, a former cellular phone company CEO, to lead CBV.
  </p>
  <p>
   Katz pushed international expansion. In 1996 CBV acquired a 50% stake in affiliate Global Payment Technologies South Africa. (The company now owns 24% of the business, which was renamed Global Payment Technologies Holdings Limited.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 CBV bought 50% of China-based affiliate Hangzhou CBV Plastics, a maker of plastic and metal components for CBV's machines, and 50% of Global Payment Technologies Australia. To reflect its worldwide reach, CBV changed its name that year to Global Payment Technologies (GPT). Also in 1997 the company started shifting production to its second generation of note validation equipment. The next year the company formed a UK subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 GPT debuted its third-generation device, Argus. The company continued to transition to its more advanced Generation II and Argus lines in 2001, with plans to phase out or replace its first-generation products the following year. The new product lines meant that the company needed more complex plastics components, and in 2002 GPT sold its 50% stake in Hangzhou CBV Plastics and found other suppliers for its components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 GPT began shipping its Aurora validator for the beverage and vending machine market, a product that came to represent nearly half of sales within three years. In 2005 the company rolled out the Advantage and SA-4 worldwide note validators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steve Katz resigned as chairman and CEO in early 2003. COO Thomas Oliveri was elevated to CEO in early 2004 and resigned as CEO in November 2005, returning to the COO's post. Oliveri was succeeded by Stephen Nevitt, a consultant who had joined GPT's board in early 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nevitt stepped down for personal reasons in 2007. Company CFO William McMahon was named interim President and CEO.
