   GrafTech has two reportable segments: Industrial Materials and Engineered Solutions. The products are marketed under brand names such as GRAFOAM, SPREADERSHIELD, eGRAF, GRAFOIL, and GrafPower, among others. Industrial Materials comprises graphite electrodes and refractory products. Graphite electrodes act as conductors of electricity and are used primarily in steel manufacturing to generate sufficient heat to scrap metal in electric arc furnaces. Refractory products include carbon and graphite refractory bricks, which are used for their high thermal conductivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered Solutions comprises advanced graphite materials and natural graphite products. Advanced graphite materials include primary products, which are sold to customers for further processing (such as steel railroad car wheels). Natural graphite products consist of flexible graphite and electronic thermal management solutions used in electronics, power generation, automotive, petrochemical, and transportation industries.
