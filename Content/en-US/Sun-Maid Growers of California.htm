   The Sun-Maid's basket runneth over. Sun-Maid Growers is the producer of Sun-Maid Raisins. Packaged in the familiar red boxes with the smiling, red-sunbonneted maid Lorraine Collett Petersen offering her basket laden with grapes, the brand is seen in just about every food store in the US. In addition to offering every toddler's (and moms of toddlers) favorite little-red-boxed snack, the grower-owned cooperative manufactures industrial and food service products and exports to more than 50 countries. The company's other dried fruits include pitted prunes, currants, apricots, cranberries, figs, dates, apples, fruit bits, and tropical fruit mixtures. Founded in 1912, the coop is owned by 750 family farmers.

   Headquartered in Kingsburg, California, Sun-Maid's facilities are located in California's Central Valley -- the world's largest raisin producing area -- where vineyards belonging to some 750 family farmers span approximately 50,000 acres.

   Sun-Maid, whose growers harvest some 200 million pounds of grapes every year, also licenses its brand for products including raisin bread, raisin muffins, and raisin cookie mix, as well as chocolate- and vanilla yogurt-covered raisins. Retail products make up about half of the co-op's sales; ingredient products comprise the rest.
