   Need a prototype pronto? Proto Labs can help with that. The industrial manufacturer creates custom parts in quick turnaround for prototype and short-run production. The company uses 3D CAD software to upload new parts designs, and then its computer numerical control (CNC) process analyzes the design, quotes a price, and makes the parts. Proto Labs creates machined metal (Firstcut) and injection-molded plastic (Protomold) parts and can ship them the next business day. Its medical device, electronics, consumer products, appliance, and automotive manufacturing customers use the parts for prototyping, market evaluation, and functional testing. The company was established in 1999 and went public in 2012.

  <p>
   Proto Labs makes the majority of its revenue (67%) from its Protomold segment (also called ProtoQuote), which typically produces prototype quantities of 25-100 custom injection-molded plastic parts. It saves the designs and molds from these parts and benefits when the customer returns, sometimes requesting up to 10,000 additional parts for short-run production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Firstcut segment (FirstQuote; nearly 29%) specializes in designing and cutting plastic and metal blocks, but in smaller quantities. In addition to these segments, Proto Labs inherited a new segment, Fineline (4%), in 2014, with the acquisition of FineLine Prototyping. Fineline features an additive manufacturing product line, often referred to as 3D printing, which offers a variety of high-quality, precision, rapid prototyping services.

  <p>
   Proto Labs has manufacturing facilities in Japan, the UK, and the US; sales offices also reside in Italy. The US accounts for around 75% of its revenue each year.

  <p>
   Proto Labs has grown significantly since it was founded as revenues and profits continue to climb to unprecedented heights. From 2013 to 2014, Pro Labs' revenues surged 28% from $163 million to $209 million, and its net income increased by 18% from $35 million to $42 million. (Both these totals for 2014 represent historic milestones for the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2014 was driven by a 30% increase in US revenue, a 24% rise in international revenue, a 22% jump in Protomold revenue, a 25% increase in Firstcut revenue, and additional revenue from its new Fineline segment. The revenue increases were due to an uptick in the number of product developers and engineers served, which were driven by the company's enhanced marketing activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Proto Labs' operating cash flows have increased consistently over the past five years. In 2014 it increased 18% to $57 million due to a surge in cash inflows from depreciation and amortization and income taxes.

  <p>
   Its strategy includes increasing penetration within existing customer organization and in geographical markets it already operates (US, Europe, and Japan), moving into new geographic regions, and expanding its parts range and manufacturing processes. Another important component of its strategy involves optimizing its 3D CAD and CNC technology in order to design parts faster and more efficiently.

  <p>
   Proto Labs added to its manufacturing services in 2014 through the $38 million acquisition of FineLine Prototyping, a provider of stereolithography, selective laser sintering, and direct metal laser sintering services.

  <p>
   Proto Labs began as The Protomold Company (molded plastic parts) but added CNC metal part machining, its Firstcut business, in 2007. In 2009 both branches began operating under the Proto Labs banner. It all started when founder and computer geek Lawrence Lukis started a desktop printer design business and was astounded at the long turnaround (weeks) and cost (thousands) for prototype parts. He turned his computer skills to solving the problem and found a way to completely automate the entire process and produce a part in a day for prices starting at $1,500.
