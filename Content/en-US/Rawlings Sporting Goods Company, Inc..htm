   In a league of its own, Rawlings Sporting Goods is known for its ties to
   <company id="40293">
    Major League Baseball
   </company>
   (MLB); the company is the MLB's exclusive supplier of baseball helmets. Rawlings makes and distributes a variety of equipment and protective gear for playing baseball, football, and basketball. Its equipment is also used by the
   <company id="106802">
    National Collegiate Athletic Association
   </company>
   (NCAA), as well as amateur organizations, and in interscholastic athletics. Rawlings sells through mass merchandisers, sporting goods retailers, and its namesake website. It licenses its brand for an array of merchandise, including apparel, toys, and shoes. Founded in 1887, Rawlings is a subsidiary of consumer products maker

   Rawlings' operations are part of
   <company id="16009">
    Jarden
   </company>
   's Outdoor Solutions business segment. The segment combines trademark equipment and apparel for various outdoor and outdoor-related activities, fishing, as well as most team and individual sports. Products are made in China, Europe, Latin and North America. Geographically, the Outdoor Solutions segment caters to customers in the US and Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Rim.
  </p>
  <p>
   A division of Rawlings, Jarden Sports Licensing (JSL) holds numerous licenses aimed to further bolster brand exposure and equity in the sporting goods market. JSL has agreements with the

   In 2012 the Outdoor Solutions business segment accounted for 39% of Jarden's total sales, or approximately $2.7 billion. Jarden's largest business, Outdoor Solutions posted a 3% drop in sales in 2012 versus 2011, due in part to unfavorable currency translation and discontinued product categories. All things being equal, the Outdoor Solutions business segment's sales increased by about 1%.

  <p>
   Under Jarden, which acquired Rawlings in 2007, the team sports equipment maker's growth strategy counts on new technologically-enhanced products -- including protective football and baseball headwear -- and product extensions to strengthen its premium position among retailers and consumers. In 2012 Rawlings launched a new series of Velo and 5150 bats designed for the senior league and youth baseball levels, and a new series of football helmets within the Rawlings NRG series of helmets, designed for the youth up to the middle school aged player that are constructed with a unique protection system designed to dissipate impact force. Indeed, football helmets and re-establishing the Rawlings brand in Japan, the world's second-largest baseball market, are key growth initiatives for the company.

  <p>
   In 1887 brothers Alfred and George Rawlings opened a retail sporting goods shop in St. Louis. They introduced the first shoulder pads for football players in 1902, and in 1920 introduced the Bill Doak model baseball glove, the first to feature a pocket between the thumb and forefinger. Through the 1940s and 1950s, Rawlings devised and refined gloves for various positions, including the catcher's mitt. In 1967 Figgie International, a diversified conglomerate, bought Rawlings. During the 1970s Rawlings established its partnership with the American and National Leagues and became the official sponsor of
   <company id="40293">
    Major League Baseball
   </company>
   in 1985. After an IPO in 1994, Carl Shields was named president and CEO of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shields resigned unexpectedly in 1997, and former CEO Howard Keene stepped up to the plate as acting CEO. That year the company acquired Victoriaville, a manufacturer of name-brand hockey equipment, to help boost its off-season sales and give it a presence in hockey-loving countries overseas. It also moved into the promotional goods market via an alliance with Hosts Communications, a sports marketing company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stephen O'Hara was appointed chairman and CEO in 1998. (Keene remained as president and COO.) The firm benefited from the 1998 battle of power hitters, as fans flocked to purchase collectibles commemorating the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa (both Rawlings endorsers) home-run chase. Also boosting sales in 1998 was the pioneering "radar ball," a regulation-size baseball that displays the speed at which it is thrown.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales declined in 1999 when the company chose not to renew its NCAA contract. Also in 1999, after hiring an investment firm to help it find a buyer, Rawlings turned down an offer for the entire company (for about twice the going stock price) from minority owner Bull Run. Bull Run's CEO, Robert Prather, vowed to continue his quest to purchase Rawlings. (Later, Bull Run was folded into
   <company id="145660">
    Triple Crown Media
   </company>
   's operations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Rawlings discontinued its hockey equipment production, and in mid-2001 it sold its Vic Hockey division to the Vic Hockey Company. In March 2003 the company was acquired by sporting goods maker
   <company id="10118">
    K2
   </company>
   . Also that year K2 purchased helmet maker ABC Helmet (the exclusive supplier of
   <company id="40293">
    MLB
   </company>
   helmets) and bat maker Worth, further expanding Rawlings' baseball and softball product lines. Worth CEO Robert Parish was named president of Rawlings after the completion of the deals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid 2004 Hilton Corporate Casuals (owned by K2) moved its operations from Chicago to Fenton, Missouri. The company, a promotional industry supplier of sportswear and racing apparel, was renamed as the Rawlings Apparel Group. To integrate the Rawlings name into the apparel line, the group introduced the Rawlings Gold Glove Collection of shirts, outerwear, and hats. A line of premium products include watches, luggage, and desk accessories, as well as full-sized baseball bats and balls.
  </p>
  <p>
   To give it more elbow room, Rawlings moved from Fenton, Missouri, to St. Louis in late 2005. The location, near Maryville University, allows the sporting goods company to establish a strategic partnership with the school.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 K2 was acquired itself by consumer products manufacturer
