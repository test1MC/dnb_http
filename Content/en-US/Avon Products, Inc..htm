   "Avon calling" -- calling for a younger crowd, overseas reps, and improved global operational efficiencies. Avon Products, the world's top direct seller of cosmetics and beauty-related items, is busy building a global brand and enticing more consumers to buy its products. Direct selling remains its
   <em>
    modus operandi
   </em>
   ; sales also come from catalogs and a website. Its lineup includes cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, apparel, home furnishings, and more. Avon boasts more than 6 million independent representatives worldwide, and has sales and distribution operations in approximately 70 countries. In 2015, Avon sold its North American operations to private equity firm
   <company id="112328">
    Cerberus Capital Management
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Avon sells beauty, fashion, and home goods, accounting for 74%, 15%, and 11% of sales, respectively. The company's core beauty business consists of color cosmetics, fragrances, skin care, and personal care. Fashion consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, and children's products. Home consists of gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children's products, and nutritional products.

  <p>
   Avon calls on households in some 57 countries worldwide. In addition to these countries and territories, its products were distributed in 42 other countries and territories. Latin America is a major market for the cosmetics company, accounting for some 53% of sales. (Brazil alone contributes 20%.) It also operates in Russia, China, the UK, and Germany, among other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corporate headquarters are re-locating to the UK following the divestiture of its North America operation.

   Avon recruits sales reps and customers largely through personal contact, including recommendation from current representatives and customers, and local market advertising. Sales promotions and sales development activities are directed at assisting reps. The company also relies on television and print advertising to sell its cosmetics and other products. The company reported advertising expenses of some $128 million in fiscal 2015, down from $166.4 and $173.3 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013.

   Avon has struggled to arrest falling sales and net income in recent years. In 2015, following the divestitures of the company's North American operation and its UK-based Liz Earle skincare business, revenue plunged 30% ($2.7 billion) to $6.2 billion. Even exluding the divested North American operations, sales were down across all geographies, with the worst losses coming in Latin America, which saw sales fall by 23%. As a result, net income also worsened significantly to $-1.2 billion, a 196% decrease. Loss on the sale of the North American business was also a factor behind the poor figure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities fell by 68% ($197.5 million) to $91.4 million due to the fall in revenue.

  <p>
   Avon is facing severe difficulties as the rise in online retail eats into revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2015 the company sold its North American operations to investor
   <company id="112328">
    Cerberus Capital Management
   </company>
   . Cerberus -- through an affiliate -- now controls and manages the North American business as a separate, privately held company operating as New Avon LLC.  Cerberus acquired an 80% ownership stake in New Avon LLC after investing $170 million; Avon held on to a 20% stake. As part of the deal, Cerberus also invested $435 million to acquire a 16.6% interest in Avon. The spin off and ownership changes reflect Cerberus's plans to transform the shrinking North American business to ultimately restore Avon's brand presence in the US. As a result of the divestiture, Avon plans to re-locate to the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, Avon sold off its wholly-owned, UK-based Liz Earle skincare business for £140 million to
   <company id="163313">
    Walgreens Boots Alliance
   </company>
   , the global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing company.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Sheri McCoy, who joined Avon in 2012, is working to stabilize the business and return it to sustainable growth. The company has set a cost-savings target of $400 million by the end of 2015. Avon also reduced global headcount, including 15% of total jobs in 2014, and exited the South Korea and Vietnam markets, as well as noncore businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to use money freed up by its 2014 reorganization to fund investment in consumer research, product innovation, and advertising (for selling products and recruiting sales reps). It launched a redesigned website, which is a critical component of its digital strategy to enhance the social selling experience for Avon representatives and their customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Avon and Greek skincare brand KORRES entered into a partnership in Latin America to develop, manufacture, and market KORRES products. Also in 2014, Avon stuck a deal with fragrance giant (and former hostile suitor)
   <company id="55741">
    Coty
   </company>
   under which Avon Brazil's 1.5 million independent sales reps sell select Coty fragrances in Brazil.

  <p>
   In the 1880s book salesman David McConnell gave small bottles of perfume to New York housewives who listened to his sales pitch. The perfume was more popular than the books, so in 1886 McConnell created the California Perfume Company and hired women to sell door-to-door. (He renamed the company Avon Products in 1939 after being impressed by the beauty of Stratford-upon-Avon in England.) Through the 1950s these women, mostly housewives seeking extra income, made Avon a major force in the cosmetics industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the 1960s until the mid-1980s, Avon was the world's largest cosmetics company, known for its appeal to middle-class homemakers. But the company hit hard times in 1974 -- a recession made many of its products too pricey for blue-collar customers, and women were leaving home for the workforce. Discovering that Avon's traditional products had little appeal for younger women, Avon began an overhaul of its product line, introducing the Colorworks line for teenagers with the slogan, "It's not your mother's makeup."
  </p>
  <p>
   Avon acquired prestigious jeweler
   <company id="11481">
    Tiffany &amp; Co.
   </company>
   in 1979 (sold 1984) to help improve the company's image. To boost profits, it entered the retail prestige fragrance business by launching a joint venture with
   <company id="13977">
    Liz Claiborne
   </company>
   (1985) and buying
   <company id="54529">
    Giorgio Armani
   </company>
   (1987, the Giorgio Beverly Hills retail operations were sold in 1994). But Liz Claiborne dissolved the joint venture when Avon bought competitor Parfums Stern in 1987 (sold 1990). It sold 40% of Avon Japan (begun 1969) to the Japanese public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avon Color cosmetics were introduced in 1988, and sleepwear, preschool toys, and videos followed in 1989. The company introduced apparel in 1994 and the next year worked with designer Diane Von Furstenberg to launch a line of clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10966">
    Mattel
   </company>
   and Avon joined forces in 1996 to sell toys -- Winter Velvet Barbie became Avon's most successful product introduction ever. In 1997 the company launched a new home furnishings catalog and bought direct seller
   <company id="42595">
    Discovery Toys
   </company>
   (sold 1999). Late in 1997 it began a $400 million restructuring program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Passing over several high-ranking female executives (the company felt they weren't ready), Avon made Charles Perrin its CEO in mid-1998. Andrea Jung, the brain behind the makeover, became president. Avon also began selling makeup in 1998 at mall kiosks and through a catalog. Late that year The Avon Centre day spa opened in Manhattan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Jung became Avon's first female CEO by replacing the retiring Perrin. Former Goodyear and Rubbermaid CEO Stanley Gault was elected chairman of the board. In March 2000 Avon announced an alliance with Swiss pharmaceutical group
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   to develop a line of women's vitamins and nutritional products (its first) launched in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2001 the company relaunched its Web site; the site allows Avon representatives to transact business through their own personal Web pages. In September, Jung was elected chairman of the board. That year Avon also ceased marketing its beComing line in Penney's stores and added the brand to its direct-selling line of products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002, as part of a move to improve operating efficiencies, Avon closed its jewelry manufacturing plant in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico. The closure marked Avon's exit from jewelry manufacturing. It now outsources its full jewelry line by purchasing finished goods from Asia. In another cost-cutting move, Avon laid off 3,500 employees, or 8% of its workforce, that March, saying that the economic recession in Argentina, which accounts for about 5% of Avon's sales, made the layoffs necessary. The next month Avon announced the closing of production operations in Northampton, UK, and a shift of these operations to its facility in Garwolin, Poland, reflecting what the company called a continuation of its plan to improve efficiency and integration.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its focus on the younger market, in 2003 Avon launched a new cosmetics line called "mark." -- targeted to the 16-24 age group. Named for young women making their mark on the world, the line includes 300 products, such as cosmetics, skin care, fragrance, accessories, jewelry, and handbags.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Avon agreed to pay some $50 million for a 20% stake in its two Chinese joint ventures with Masson Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Avon bought Silpada Designs, a Kansas-based direct seller of sterling silver jewelry with operations in the US, Canada, and the UK, for $650 million. The acquisition was the company's largest in more than a decade. Three years later, in July 2013, Avon sold Silpada to Rhinestone Holdings, a newly-formed company created by Silpada's founders, for $85 million in an all-cash transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   The struggling company became a takeover target in 2012 when its smaller rival
   <company id="55741">
    Coty
   </company>
   made an unsolicited $10.7 billion offer for the business, which Avon rejected.
