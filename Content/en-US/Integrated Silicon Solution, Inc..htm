   Fabless semiconductor company Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. (ISSI) has the right acronyms for the manufacturing process. ISSI primarily makes SRAM (static random-access memory) chips and DRAM (dynamic RAM) chips that are used in cars, computers, consumer electronics, cell phones, and networking devices. It sells its chips to dozens of electronics manufacturers, from the automotive, communications, consumer, industrial, medical, and military markets, either directly or through distributors and contract manufacturers. Customers include
   <company id="41437">
    Bosch
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   . Most of its sales come from Asia. In late 2015 ISSI was acquired by Uphill Investment.

   ISSI outsources all of its manufacturing to factories in Asia. Its principal silicon foundries (contract semiconductor manufacturers) are

   (SMIC), and
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

   (TSMC). Operating as a fabless company allows ISSI to focus on design and not the heavy costs associated with manufacturing.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ISSI is headquartered in California and has worldwide offices in China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company generates about two-thirds of sales from Asia, followed by Europe (20%) and the US (12%).

   The company markets and sells its products through a direct sales force, independent sales reps, and distributors. It spends little on advertising, only $79,000 in 2013.

  <p>
   Overall sales increased 16% to $307.6 million in 2013. The boost was driven primarily by the added revenue from a 2012 acquisition, as well as an increase in average selling prices and a favorable shift in product mix to higher density products. ISSI recorded a profit of $17.5 million in 2013 against a net loss of $2.7 million in 2012, due to a gain on the sales of investments, despite spending $10 million more on R&amp;D in 2013. ISSI's cash flow from operations has generally been growing alongside the company's revenue. In 2013 it was $34 million.

  <p>
   The company's stated strategy is to target specific memory market segments, rather than commodity memory markets; establish long-term supply relationships with customers; continue to develop new high-performance products; and sell deeper to existing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   While ISSI is a fabless semiconductor company, one of its competitive advantages is a process development team that works with the company's silicon foundries in chip manufacturing, rather than solely relying on foundry personnel to decide how the chips will be fabricated. On the customer side, ISSI deploys low-cost engineering development teams close to customers in the Asia/Pacific region through its subsidiaries in China, Taiwan, and South Korea. In 2014 it inked a deal with
   <company id="132604">
    Spansion
   </company>
   that gives ISSI access to Spansion's patent portfolio to develop and produce specialized flash memory products.

  <p>
   In 2012 ISSI bought Taiwan-based Chingis Technology Corporation for about $33 million. The acquisition bolsters ISSI's specialty memory product line, adding nonvolatile NOR flash memory to meet customer demand, particularly from clients in the automotive and industrial sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The prior year it bought China-based Si En Integration Holdings for about $20 million in cash. The deal supported its effort to diversify product lines and tap new markets for its memory products. Also a fabless chip maker, Si En Integration specialized in analog and mixed signal devices.

  <p>
   Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc. (ISSI) was co-founded in 1988 by veteran electrical engineers Jimmy Lee (chairman) and Kong-Yeu Han. It shipped its first static random-access memory (SRAM) chips in 1990, its first nonvolatile memories in 1992, and its first flash memories in 1994. The company went public in 1995. That year sales jumped more than 100% thanks to a booming business in SRAMs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 ISSI received a license for certain flash memory technologies from
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , which was then the leader in that market. However, the company's income plummeted that year, hurt by lowered SRAM prices and a write-off for inventory. Also in 1996 ISSI made its first foray into manufacturing when it teamed up with
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   (TSMC),
   <company id="12568">
    Altera
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices
   </company>
   to form WaferTech.
  </p>
  <p>
   ISSI added DRAM and microcontroller products to its line in 1997. That year the company bought flash memory R&amp;D company Nexcom Technology. ISSI moved to cut expenses in 1998 by forming subsidiary NexFlash Technologies (flash memories; ISSI retained 32%) and by partially spinning off ISSI-Taiwan to private investors. In 2000 the company sold its interest in WaferTech to joint venture partner TSMC.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 ISSI-Taiwan (renamed Integrated Circuit Solution, Inc., or ICSI) was spun off as a public company in Taiwan; ISSI kept a 39% stake (later reduced to 29%). Also that year
   <company id="55633">
    Winbond Electronics
   </company>
   bought a major stake in NexFlash, reducing ISSI's share of NexFlash to 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004 ISSI acquired a majority stake in Signia Technologies, a Taiwan-based maker of radio-frequency chipsets used in consumer electronic devices. Two years later the company sold its assets in Bluetooth wireless communications and most of its shares in Signia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 ISSI set plans to buy the majority stake in ICSI for about $69 million in cash. It ended the year owning 83% of the Taiwanese company. Also that year Winbond acquired all of NexFlash.
  </p>
  <p>
   ISSI bought another 15% of ICSI in 2006. The company transferred a number of job functions to Taiwan from the US as a result, lowering its cost structure. ISSI also decided to exit the flash controller business that year, selling the product technology and assets while continuing to supply flash controllers to one customer on an exclusive basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the threat of a proxy fight in 2006, ISSI's board capitulated to activist investor Bryant Riley to avoid a costly battle. The board agreed to increase its size from seven to nine members on a temporary basis, and the two extra board seats were taken by Riley and Melvin Keating, who was installed as CEO of
   <company id="16807">
    Alliance Semiconductor
   </company>
   after Riley led a successful proxy challenge to its board. After witnessing Alliance's dismantling by Riley and his fellow dissident shareholders, the ISSI directors apparently had little stomach for a similar fate to befall their company. Keating and Riley agreed to resign from the ISSI board in late 2007 upon the company's completion of a stock buyback totaling 10 million shares of common stock. The buyback was completed in early 2008, with ISSI repurchasing about 27% of its common shares outstanding for $70 million. Keating and Riley then left the board.
  </p>
  <p>
   ISSI wound up acquiring Alliance Semi's synchronous SRAM product line in the auctioning of Alliance's assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   brought civil charges against ISSI and its former CFO, Gary Fischer, for fraudulently backdating stock option grants and concealing millions of dollars in compensation expenses. The company and Fischer settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt. Fischer agreed to repay $414,830 in ill-gotten gains and to pay a civil penalty of $125,000, and consented to an order prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly held company for five years. ISSI got off fairly lightly, agreeing to a permanent injunction against violating federal securities laws on books and records, fraud, internal controls, and reporting. The SEC cited the company's cooperation with the securities regulator's staff in the investigation.
