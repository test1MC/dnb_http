The company's advanced technical ceramics products combine hardness with light weight and the ability to withstand high temperatures, resist corrosion, and insulate against electricity. Some uses of Ceradyne's materials include armor for military helicopters, missile nose cones, body armor and helmets for soldiers, diesel engine components, ceramic industrial products, solar glass products, and orthodontic brackets.

   In 2011 Ceradyne expanded by purchasing Washington-based VIOX Corporation, a specialty glass company that serves the electronic, industrial, and healthcare markets. Among VIOX's products is specialty glass for polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic technology.

   VIOX is only one of several acquisitions Ceradyne has made to increase its business in the non-defense sector. Other important acquisitions to boost non-defense sales have included ESK Ceramics and Minco. Additionally, Ceradyne has increased its non-defense revenue base by expanding its operations in Canada and China.
