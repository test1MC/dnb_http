   This is where the
   <em>
    Six Million Dollar Man
   </em>
   could come for repairs, along with athletes and anyone else who has ever needed knee, foot, or shoulder surgery. Arthrex's strength lies in sports medicine product development and educational services for orthopaedic surgeons. The company makes more than 7,500 products for arthroscopic and minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery, including ablation devices, shaver blades and burrs, Achilles tendon reattachment bridges, and suture anchors. Operating from about 20 locations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, Arthrex distributes its products to hospitals and surgeons worldwide.

  <p>
   More than 94% of Arthrex's products are manufactured in the US, and exported to more than 100 worldwide. The company has subsidiaries and distribution centers in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Korea, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

   With 30 years of experience in the orthopaedic industry, Arthrex offers additional value to surgeons by providing educational courses and training programs mainly in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, and New York. The programs are designed to help surgeons beef up their skills in hip, knee, and shoulder arthroscopy procedures, as well as foot, ankle, hand, and wrist surgeries. Along with its US locations, Arthrex offers courses and surgical observation programs in Asia and Europe. Additionally, the company operates an interactive educational website called OrthoIllustrated. The site contains information about the diagnosis and treatment of common bone- and joint-related injuries and diseases; it also incorporates a surgeon finder function and a portal for surgeons.

   Pushing innovation, in 2013 the company launched a new web-based software platform, Synergy.net to further expand the functionality of Arthrex's SynergyHD3 System, to increase surgeon and operating room efficiency, enhance patient satisfaction and lower infrastructure costs for hospitals and surgery centers.

   In 2012 Arthrex launched its Balance Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty System, a minimally invasive instrument and implant platform for the treatment of degenerative or traumatic osteoarthritis of the knee.

   Arthrex also works to expand its facilities for continued growth. The company announced in 2011 its intention to add a 160,000-sq.-ft. biomedical operations and manufacturing facility in Florida and add more than 100 new jobs over several years after the facility is completed. In 2012 the company opened the Arthrex Logistics Center in Lee County, as a part of Arthrex's first phase of expansion in Southwest Florida.

  <p>
   Company President Reinhold Schmieding founded Arthrex in 1981 and incorporated the business in 1984.

   In late 2011 Arthrex prevailed in a patent-infringement case that was first brought against it by
   <company id="90390">
    Smith &amp; Nephew
   </company>
   (S&amp;N) in 2004. The case involved Arthrex's SutureTak and PushLock line of suture anchors for use in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Earlier in 2011 Arthex had received an $85 million jury verdict against it, but the Federal District Court in Portland reversed that verdict and dismissed S&amp;N's eight-year long pursuit against Arthrex.
