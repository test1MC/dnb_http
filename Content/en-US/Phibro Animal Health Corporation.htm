  <p>
   The company's fiscal 2016 (June year end) net sales grew by less than 1% to $751.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Animal Health net revenue grew by 3% due to volume increases across all segment product groups. Nutritional specialty products grew by 15%, due to US and EU volume growth of products for the dairy and poultry industries. Medicinal feed additives and other grew by 1%, as volume growth in international markets offset declines in US volumes. Vaccines declined by 2%. Excluding the prior year $8 million in vaccine licensing milestone revenue, vaccines grew by $6.8 million, or 15%, principally from volume growth.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales of  Performance Products decreased by 4% due to lower average selling prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients and lower volumes of chemical catalyst products.

Mineral Nutrition gross profit grew by $0.3 million due to lower material costs, partially offset by lower selling prices. Performance Products gross profit declined by $1.3 million due to lower prices of copper-based products and personal care ingredients, partially offset by a drop in material costs.
