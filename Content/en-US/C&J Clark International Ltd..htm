   In the race for consumer approval, C&amp;J Clark focuses on everyday footwear. The shoe retailer and maker is one of the largest manufacturers of non-sports shoes in the world, selling more than 70 million pairs of shoes a year. Its lineup of boots, casual and sports shoes, slippers, and sandals are made for men, women, and children, and sold under brand names, including Mary &amp; Clarks, K Shoes, C&amp;J, and Bostonian, through department stores, online, as well as retail operations under its own banner. C&amp;J Clark counts some 600 shoe shops in the UK. Founded in 1828 as a sheepskin tannery, more than two-thirds of C&amp;J Clark is 80%-owned by the 500 living descendants of co-founder James Clark.

   . C&amp;J Clark has won a following that includes celebrities; its Orignals DesertBoot adorns the peds of British pop stars. However, the company faces increasing competition in the UK from sellers of athletic footwear as well as from value-priced shoe chains. With the UK market for footwear flat, the company's sales growth is originating overseas, as its franchised network around Europe expands and its North American business takes root.
  </p>
  <p>
   C&amp;J Clark is banking on Eastern Europe and parts of Asia for growth, where production is outsourced. The last of the footwear company's British manufacturing facilities shut down in 2005, but shoe design is still largely done in the UK.

  <p>
   An apprentice at his brother's sheepskin rug business, James Clark began making shoes in 1828 by using remnants to make sheepskin slippers, which he named Brown Peters. By 1833 James was a full partner in the business, and shoes accounted for a third of the company's sales. However, by the late 1840s sales had been trimmed severely, and the company encountered its first brush with bankruptcy. It recovered only to fall back into trouble in 1863, when James' son William Stephens Clark took control. During the 1860s the company entered the Industrial Age, purchasing Singer sewing machines and increasing production. Following the death of co-founder Cyrus Clark in 1866, James and William formed a new partnership and launched Torbrand shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new, shoe-focused company launched its Hygienic range of shoes in 1893 and in the process made a commitment to manufacture foot-friendly shoes designed on "anatomical principle." The company also became increasingly employee-friendly. The Clark family was Quaker, and in accordance to its beliefs, provided sick benefits to employees. (William also purchased a pub across the street from the Clark factory and turned it into a coffee house in order to discourage employees from drinking alcohol.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was not immune to the industrialization and globalization trends of the early 20th century. By 1910 the company had developed an in-stock system by which shoes were dispatched from the warehouse on receipt of order. New methods for insoles and soling also benefited the business. Under the leadership of William's three children, C&amp;J Clark International increased its global presence (exports accounted for a third of sales by 1970) and its emphasis on women's shoes. The Torbrand line was renamed Clarks in 1920, and another line of shoes, Wessex, was launched in 1927. In 1937 the company began retailing under the name Peter Lord.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII set the stage for a major Clark development: the Desert Boot. Modeled after shoes worn in Egypt by the war buddies of Clark clansman Nathan, the Desert Boot was an immediate hit, turning up on the feet of British Mods and in the pages of fashion magazines overseas. Shortly after the Desert Boot's release, the Clarks name appeared on retail outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1980 the company made its first major acquisition, taking over K Shoes. Still, in 1993, affairs between the 400 family member-shareholders had become strained. Profits were shoelace-thin, and chairman Walter Dickson recommended selling the company to former sugar company Berisford. While institutional shareholders seemed interested, the family (which controlled 70% of the voting shares) decided not to sell. Instead, Roger Peddar was elected chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tim Parker became CEO in 1996. At the time the company reflected the Clark family's traditional Quaker values and resorted to cheaper leathers and reduced detailing to cut costs rather than lay off workers. Parker recognized the problem and responded by cutting management, closing all but two factories in the UK and moving production into Brazil and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 privately held C&amp;J Clark announced it would petition its institutional shareholders to vote on going public, but the idea was withdrawn. C&amp;J Clark made its first acquisition in 15 years in 2001 with the acquisition of German shoemaker Elefanten. In 2002 Parker left the company and was replaced by former operations director Peter Bolliger. Lower costs abroad forced the company to shutter its British manufacturing operations, causing thousands of layoffs over the course of a decade. The last of C&amp;J Clark's British production facilities closed in 2005.
