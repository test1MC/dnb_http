   Sonoco Products believes you
   <em>
    can
   </em>
   judge a container by its packaging. The company is one of the world's largest makers of industrial and consumer packaging used by the food, consumer goods, construction, and automotive industries. Its consumer packaging segment produces round and shaped composite cans for snack foods, powdered beverages, pet food, and more. Sonoco makes flexible and rigid packaging (paper and plastic) for food, personal care items, and chemicals, and it produces paperboard tubes and cores, too, for industrial protective packaging. The company's end-to-end packaging services include co-packing and fulfillment, supply chain management, and point-of-purchase display design/assembly.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sonoco operates more than 330 locations around the world in nearly 35 countries concentrated in Canada, Europe, and the US. Around 65% of its total sales are generated from the US each year. Sonoco's international sales are concentrated in Europe (20%) followed by Canada (5%).

  <p>
   The company divides its business structure into four chief business segments. Consumer Packaging is its largest segment, accounting for 43% of its net sales. Other segments include Display and Packaging (12%), Paper and Industrial Converted Products (35%), and Protective Solutions (10%).

  <p>
   After posting more than $5 billion in revenues for 2014, a historic milestone for the company, Sonoco saw its revenues fall marginally by 1% to $4.96 billion. The small revenue dip was driven by a 9% decline in both its Display and Packaging Paper and Industrial Converted Products segments. Canada sales also declined by 10%, while sales in the US fell 2% during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits jumped 5% from $239 million in 2014 to peak at $250 million in 2015 due to the additional revenue coupled with a decrease in interest expenses. (Note: the company's annual 2014 report was restated due to consolidations.)

  <p>
   The company's goal is to reach $5.5 billion to $6 billion in sales over the next three or four years. It plans to achieve this by growing its existing products and services portfolio by $300 million and new product sales by $350 million. It also expects future acquisitions to contribute an additional $500 million in annual sales. (It reached the $5 billion revenue milestone in 2014.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Inherit to its strategy are the company's ongoing efforts to improve its operating structure and keep a lid on costs. Looking to launch offices in fast-growing markets, Sonoco in 2014 opened its third manufacturing plant in Russia and announced plans to invest $20 million to build a new production facility in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.

  <p>
   Sonoco also looks to acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2017, the company acquired Peninsula Packaging Company, a manufacturer of thermoformed packaging for fresh fruit and vegetables, for $230 million from Odyssey Investment Partners. Peninsula has annual revenue of around $190 million, and Sonoco hopes the acquisition will help capture new growth in the fresh fruit and vegetable market segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired a two-thirds stake in Graffo Paranaense de Embalagens S/A (Graffo), a flexible packaging business located in Brazil. Sonoco made the deal in order to grow its presence in an important emerging market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company obtained Weidenhammer Packaging Group, a European provider of composite cans along with composite drums and rigid plastic containers, for $360 million. The deal enhanced its rigid paper packaging operations and is expected to increase its net sales in Europe to approximately 21% of total sales. Also in 2014, Sonoco picked up Dalton Paper Products (DPP) in order to fortify its paper and industrial converted products business segment.

  <p>
   Sonoco Products originated during the South's industrial renewal after the Civil War. Major James Coker and son James Jr. (who had been badly wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga) founded the Carolina Fiber company in Hartsville, South Carolina, to make pulp and paper from pine trees. The business was based on a thesis James Jr. wrote in 1884 at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. The essay explained how to make paper pulp using the sulfite process.
  </p>
  <p>
   After failing to sell the pulp commercially, the Cokers decided to use it to make paper cones for the textile industry, which was seeing rapid growth in the southern US. In 1899 Major Coker and investor W. F. Smith formed the Southern Novelty Company. Major Coker's son Charles became president in 1918. As sales neared $1 million in 1923, the company changed its name to Sonoco.
