   Recognized by its rearing-stallion logo, sports carmaker Ferrari is up to speed, and then some. The Italian OEM eschews volume sales in favor of building its status brand around producing some 7,225 high-performance stylish sports cars a year, with a price tag starting at about $300,000. Its cars are associated with its fabled Formula One racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, having won 222

   In late 2015, Ferrari launched an IPO, raising about $893 million. The majority of the proceeds will go to owner Fiat, which plans to distribute its remaining 80% stake in Ferrari to its own investors in early 2016.

   Ferrari caters to the upper end of the luxury car segment, and buyers of its cars tend to belong to the wealthiest segment of the population. As the size and spending capacity of its target client base has grown significantly in recent years, its addressable market and the sense of exclusivity fostered by its low volume strategy have been further enhanced.

  <p>
   Executing a plan that calls for selling fewer cars than the market demands requires a balance of product innovation, manufacturing excellence, along with strategic product distribution. To this end, Ferrari continues to focus on its facilities, cars, and dealerships.

  <p>
   After serving in WWI, Enzo Ferrari found work as a test driver in Turin, Italy, in 1918. He soon moved to Milan, where he went to work as a test driver and racecar driver for Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali (CMN). His first race was in 1919. The next year Enzo began a career with Alfa Romeo that would span 20 years and take him from test driver to race driver to sales assistant, and ultimately to the position of director of Alfa Romeo's racing division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari in Modena in 1929 in order to organize racing events for its members. The organization became the engineering and racing division at Alfa Romeo in 1933.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enzo's Scuderia Ferrari split with Alfa Romeo in 1940 to become an independent company -- Auto Avio Construzioni Ferrari. In 1943 the new business moved from Modena to Maranello, where it began making machine tools such as powered grinders for the manufacture of ball bearings. The shop had only been open a year when it was bombed out in 1944. The workshop was rebuilt by 1946, the same year it rolled out its first Ferrari. The following year the company raced a Ferrari -- the 12-cylinder 125 Sport -- for the first time. It was also the initial appearance of the company's "prancing horse" trademark. The car lost the race after it had mechanical trouble during the last lap, but the 125 Sport won the Rome Grand Prix two weeks later. The company's name was trimmed to Auto Costruzioni Ferrari in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 the firm became a joint stock company, and its name was changed to Societ√† Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse (SEFAC S.p.A.). Three years later Enzo opened an automotive training school, Istituto Professionale per l'Industria e l'Artigianato. Fiat became a 50-50 partner in the company in 1969. Enzo Ferrari built the Fiorana test track near the factory in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   The founder died in 1988 at age 90. Fiat increased its ownership that year to 90%. Enzo's son, Piero Lardi Ferrari, held the remaining 10%. The following year the company's name was changed to Ferrari S.p.A.
