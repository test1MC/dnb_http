   Valmont Industries has five primary business units: engineered support structures (metal poles and other structures for lighting, traffic, and wireless communications industries); irrigation (agricultural irrigation equipment sold under the Valley brand); utilities support structures (steel and concrete poles and other structures used by utilities); and coatings (galvanizing, anodizing, and powder coating). Other operations make energy and mining equipment such as access systems applications, forged steel grinding media, and oil, gas, and wind energy structures.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Products are sold worldwide, and the US accounts for about 60% of sales. Its principal manufacturing locations are in Valley and McCook (Nebraska), Tulsa, Oklahoma, Brenham, Texas, Charmeil, France, and Shanghai, China. The company also has a manufacturing presence in Australia. Valmont Irrigation operates in nine factories located in six continents.
  </p>

  <p>
   Besides poles, Valmont's engineered support structures segment (29% of 2015 sales) makes roadway safety systems and access systems. The irrigation segment (22% of sales) makes equipment for carrying not only water, but also chemical fertilizers and pesticides to crops in fields that range in size from four acres to 500 acres.
  </p>
  <p>
   Utilities (26% of sales) support structures (USS) are used for electrical transmission and distribution lines and other power distribution equipment. To ensure that the structures are capable of supporting such large-scale systems as utilities, the company's engineering teams consider capabilities against wind speeds, ice loads, and other stresses during the design process. USS is headquartered in Alabama, unlike the company's other segments, which are headquartered in Nebraska.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its energy and mining segment (13%) operates outside the US and makes access systems applications; forged steel grinding media; and on and off shore oil, gas, and wind energy structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The coatings segment (10% of sales) receives unfinished products and submits them to such processing operations as galvanizing to prevent rust, anodizing to allow aluminum to be dyed, and painting. Most customers of the segment are found in the construction-related industries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Valmont sells its products through a direct sales force and commissioned sales agents. It focuses on the two global markets of agriculture and infrastructure. Irrigation products are marketed through about 275 independent dealers in North America and about 220 in the rest of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its products for infrastructure serve highway, transportation, wireless communication, electric transmission, and industrial construction and energy markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Valmont's revenues decreased 14% from $3.1 billion in 2014 to $2.6 billion in 2015. Its profits also nosedived by 78% from $184 million to $40 million during that same time period. However, the company's operating cash flow surged by 56% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to favorable changes in receivables and income taxes payable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were fueled by diminished sales from irrigation and utility support structures products. The decrease in irrigation products was mainly due to sales volume decreases in both the North American and international markets. Utility segment sales fell in 2015 due to lower sales volumes, a decrease in average selling prices (most notably for its steel producust), and an unfavorable sales mix.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Valmont's irrigation segment has responded to demand from North American farms struggling under the kind of dry conditions that necessitate more irrigation equipment. More generally, the worldwide farm economy has enjoyed a sales bump that has placed the irrigation segment in good stead. As such, the company is focused on growing this segment further.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to increase its market penetration by differentiating its products from its competitors' products through superior customer service, technological innovation; expand the sales of its existing products into new geographic areas; and develop new products for markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has sought new customers for lighting structures in Europe and North Africa. It has also been developing business in such emerging markets as China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Middle East. Included among those efforts have been new facilities in China and India for making poles for lighting, utility, and wireless communication. The company has also been focusing on providing galvanizing services in India.

  <p>
   Valmont has widened its international reach and added additional revenue to its balance sheet through acquisitions. In 2014 it purchased privately-held DS SM A/S, a Northern Europe-based manufacturer of heavy complex steel structures serving a diverse range of industries including wind energy, offshore oil and gas, and electricity transmission. The company will be renamed Valmont SM A/S, and will be reported in Valmont's EIP Segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquired US-based Shakespeare Composite Structures, a market leader in fiberglass reinforced composite structures and products, and the originator of the composite light pole, with two manufacturing facilities in South Carolina. The acquisition extends Valmont's leading product offerings in the lighting, traffic and utility markets

  <p>
   Valmont was founded in 1946. Its founder, Robert Daugherty, helped develop the center pivot irrigation pipe that transformed farming.
