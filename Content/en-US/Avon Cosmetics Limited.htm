   . Avon has become one of the top handful of beauty brands in the UK. Some 160,000 independent sales representatives sell cosmetics directly to customers through home parties and work get-togethers. The company's catalog is distributed every three weeks to nearly 8 million existing and potential customers. Avon Cosmetics' distribution center, located in Corby, processes about 10,000 orders each day. The company banned animal-testing of its products in 1989.

  <p>
   Avon revenue declined 12% in the UK in 2015 from 2014, due, in part, because of the strength of the US dollar compared to other currencies. On a constant dollar basis, sales were off 5%. This was attributed to a decrease in the number of Avon representatives in the UK.

  <p>
   In 2016 Avon Products began a company wide transformation plan, which involves reductions in some places and increased investments in others. Technology to better serve representatives and customers is an area of investment, which could help drive up the number of representatives in the UK. The company plans to invest $200 million to change its service model and in information technology and another $150 million in media and social selling.
