   TDK puts materials to work to transfer and store energy as well as story digital information. The company branched out from its original focus of commercializing ferrite, a magnetic material. The company make capacitors, transformers, inductors, and other other products that are key parts of modern electronics. It also makes rechargeable batteries and hard disk drives and components for the drives. TDK targets the communications, automobile, industrial equipment and energy, and information appliances markets for growth. About half of its business comes from its passive components products. With operations around the world, TDK generates about 92% of its sales outside of Japan.

  <p>
   TDK's three major reporting segments are Passive Components, Magnetic Application Products, and Film Application Components.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 50% of revenue comes from passive components, which include ceramic capacitors, aluminum electrolytic capacitors, film capacitors, and iInductive devices products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magnetic application products, 27% of revenue, hard disk drive (HDD) heads, HDD suspension assemblies, power supplies, and magnet products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Film application products, 19% of revenue, produces rechargeable batteries and applied film.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   TDK, based in Tokyo, has a network of design and manufacturing locations and sales offices in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of TDK's revenue -- some 71% -- comes from customers in Asia. Another 12% comes from Europe with the US and Japan supplying 9% and 8%, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2015 TDK's revenue rose 6% from 2015 from greater sales in passive components and film applications. Increased demand from IT markets for energy devices boosted battery sales for the film application segment while automotive demand drove the increase in passive components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income sprung up 31% in 2015 from 2014 on the sales increase. It might have been higher but for higher costs in research and development and administration. The company also suffered from currency exchange rates in relation to Japanese currency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The increase in net income helped boost cash flow from operations some 6% in 2015 from the prior year.

  <p>
   TDK is riding a wave of demand in its businesses for passive components and rechargeable batteries. The automotive market is adding electronics to vehicles at a fast clip, and capacitors are part of the package. As wireless devices increase in number so does demand for rechargeable batteries to power the devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   TDK raised its R&amp;D spending 20% in 2016 from 2015 to develop new products for those growing markets. It also is adding sales staff to find more deals for its products.

  <p>
   In 2016 TDK strengthened its position in the sensor market. in December 2016 it agreed to acquire
   <company id="161792">
    InvenSense
   </company>
   , a maker of motion sensors, for $1.3 billion. InvenSense makes, among other things, gyroscopes for smartphones and other devices. The company's biggest customer is Apple. Earlier in 2016 TDK subsidiary EPCOS agreed to acquire Tronics Microsystems SA, another sensors company. TDK looks for the addition of InvenSense and Tronics to increase it appeal to the automotive, consumer, and industrial markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 TDK acquired HDD suspension manufacturer, Hutchinson Technology Inc. Hutchinson manufactures components for HDD suspensions (mount plate, trace-gimbal circuit and stainless steel etching parts) and assembles these components into HDD suspensions, a key component of HDD heads.

  <p>
   Kanzo Saito, who had previously raised rabbits for their fur, took out a patent in 1935 on ferrite, a type of ceramic made mainly from iron oxide that held promise for electronics applications. (Japan's Yogoru Kato is credited with inventing the material.) Saito founded Tokyo Denkikagaku Kogyo K.K. (TDK) to pioneer the mass production of ferrite and output rose quickly as developers found countless new uses for the substance. Saito handed over the presidency of the company in 1946 to Teiichi Yamazaki, who expanded TDK's portfolio into products such as magnetic recording tape (1952).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's global thrust began when it opened a Los Angeles office in 1959. Two years later it was listing shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. TDK branched into cassette tapes in 1966 and electromagnetic wave absorbers in 1968, the year the company opened its first overseas manufacturing center in Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s TDK launched operations in Australia, Europe, and South America. It began listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 1982. That year the company also introduced a solar battery. In 1983 TDK officially changed its name to TDK Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Hiroshi Sato was appointed president of the company. TDK bought integrated circuit maker Silicon Systems in 1989 (sold in 1996 to
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   ) as Sato began to modernize the company's offerings and organization. With a conservative management style, he'd often wait to see how other companies fared in new markets before committing TDK, prompting the industry to label him the "gambler who follows someone else." During his tenure, Sato gave the company solid footholds in niches such as optical disks, high-density heads, and cellular phone components.
