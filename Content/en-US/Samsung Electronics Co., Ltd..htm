   Samsung Electronics is an electronics Samson. One of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers, Samsung Electronics is also South Korea's top electronics company. It makes many kinds of consumer devices, including DVD players, digital TVs, and digital still cameras; computers, color monitors, LCD panels, and printers; semiconductors such as DRAMs, static RAMs, flash memory, and display drivers; and communications devices ranging from wireless handsets and smartphones to networking gear. The company, which is the flagship member of
   <company id="41463">
    Samsung Group
   </company>
   , also makes microwave ovens, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. Nearly half of sales come from the Asia/Pacific region.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company operates through independent business units: Consumer Electronics (about 55% of sales), IT and Mobile Communications (20% of sales), Semiconductors (15% of sales), and Display Products (10% of sales).
  </p>
        <p>
   A true vertically integrated company, Samsung Electronics is a leader in producing many of the chips and software at the heart of its products. The company has been the leader in the worldwide memory market for more than a decade, and has a significant share of the global market for CMOS image sensors for mobile phones.

   Altogether Samsung has offices in 80 countries. Outside South Korea it has regional headquarters in the US (California and New Jersey, through

   ); Europe (Germany and the UK, through

   ); Asia (China, Japan, India, and Singapore); as well as in Brazil, Russia, South Africa, and the UAE.
  </p>
        <p>
   It has some 40 manufacturing plants located in Brazil, China, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and the US (at
   <company id="143441">

   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   America is its largest single market, accounting for 30% of sales; Europe contributes about 25%; while China makes up another 20% and South Korea 10%. Other countries across Asia and Africa make up the remaining 15%.

   Samsung uses a direct sales force that operates from offices located in more than 50 countries. Its products for the consumer market (electronics, appliances) are sold through major retailers worldwide. Other products, such as the LCD and OLED panels made by
   <company id="162767">
    Samsung Display
   </company>
   , are sold to OEMs. The chips made by
   <company id="111702">
    Samsung Semiconductor
   </company>
   are sold directly as well as through distributors.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   As a market leader, the company has enjoyed steady growth in both its native currency (the South Korean won) and US dollars. In 2013 Samsung enjoyed strong sales for its core products -- smartphones, TVs, and memory chips. That year it launched the Galaxy S4 smartphone, a curved TV, and it began mass producing the world's first 20 nanometer 4Gb ultra high-speed mobile DRAM.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Its primary growth strategies are to solidify its market leadership by focusing on product differentiation in each business unit; identify businesses that will sustain growth over the next five to 10 years; and prepare management to anticipate and respond to business risks during times of global market uncertainty.
  </p>
        <p>
   Over the long term, Samsung Electronics is looking to grow in key product areas including mobile devices (phones and tablets), LCD panels, flat-panel TVs, system LSI chips, IT products, and home appliances. It is also promoting future growth centered around software and service opportunities, while continuing to lay the foundation for future businesses, particularly the health and medical equipment markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   R&amp;D is critical to its product development efforts, and its research and development network spans six facilities in South Korea and 18 more in nine other countries, including China, Japan, Israel, India, Russia, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a case with potentially wide-ranging implications, in August 2012 Samsung Electronics lost a patent infringement lawsuit with
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   in an ongoing copyright battle between the two. Samsung was found to have violated several Apple patents, including the "bounce back" effect and the physical design of the iPhone, but argued that the design similarities were not copying, but benchmarking (a practice used by companies to keep up with rivals on details such as battery life, screen size, and other core features). Apple was awarded $1 billion in damages (the company originally sought $2.75 billion), but Samsung plans to appeal. The verdict is complicated by a decision the same week in a South Korean court that each company had infringed on the others' patents that resulted in bans and fines for both parties. Samsung continues to be, nonetheless, a major supplier of components for Apple products, including the iPhone.
  </p>
        <p>
   Samsung was forced into discontinuing its Galaxy Note 7 just two weeks after the device's fall-2016 release. Reports of exploding batteries started soon after release and prompted a total product recall. However, Samsung was unable to fix the issue, and discontinued production thereafter.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p> Samsung made its biggest acquisition of a non-South Korean company with its $8 billion deal to buy
   <company id="10707">
    Harman
   </company>
   , which develops and makes technology for the automotive market. The purchase, which closed in 2017, maneuvers Samsung quickly into to the growing connected-car market. Harman makes stereo equipment for vehicles as well as an increasing number of products that enable cars to communicate with each other and other devices. Samsung and Harman intend to pursue development of devices and equipment for self-driving vehicles.
  </p>
        <p>
   Samsung attempted to take on Apple's iTunes with the 2012 purchase of mSpot, a cloud-based music service. Two-and-a-half years later it shuttered the service, since renamed Samsung Music Hub, in mid-2014, citing a desire to offer services as individual apps over a single, bundled storefront.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company rid itself of other operations considered non-core or poor performing. In 2013 it sold Liquavista to
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   . Samsung originally bought Liquavista in 2011 hoping to increase its share of the e-reader market. In 2011 it sold its hard disk drive (HDD) business to
   <company id="14678">
    Seagate
   </company>
   for about $1.4 billion. As part of the transaction, Seagate will supply Samsung with disk drives for its consumer electronics products, while Samsung will provide Seagate with flash memory chips for storage devices. Freeing up resources to focus on newer storage technology, in late 2012 it bought NVELO, a California-based maker of the Dataplex storage software, to add to its solid-state drives (SSDs) offerings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Samsung Electronics is also investing in industries it isn't traditionally known for. In 2013 it bought Massachusetts-based NeuroLogica, the maker of the BodyTom and CereTom portable CT scanners, as part of its goal to grow as a healthcare technology player.
