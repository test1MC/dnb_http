   SL Industries has the power to protect. Operating through four business segments, SL Industries makes and markets custom and standard AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies, surge suppressors, conditioning and distribution units, motion-control systems, and power protection equipment. Products are typically married to larger systems to improve their operating performance and safety. SL sells its power electronics and systems and related products to OEMs in the aerospace, computer, medical, wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, and transportation industries, as well as to US military contractors and municipal utilities.

        <p>
   SL Industries' manufacturing operations reside in California, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. International locations are in China and Mexico. The US accounts for 80% of its revenues.

   SL Industries operates through four segments: SL Power Electronics (SLPE), High Power Group (HPG), SL Montevideo Technology (SL-MTI), and RFL Electronics (RFL). Each segment generates 39%, 33%, 18%, and 10% of total sales, respectively.

   The company's products are largely sold to OEMs of medical, commercial, and military aerospace, computer, datacom, industrial, telecom, transportation, utility, rail, and highway equipment applications. It also targets the utility industry and, to a lesser extent, to commercial distributors.

   SL Industries generated its highest revenues in history, around $212 million, in 2011. However, revenues fell 6% in 2012 to $200 million. Net income also fell 5% from $8.2 million to $7.78 million due to higher operating expenses related to acquisitions and severance and restructuring charges.
  </p>
        <p>
   The declines were driven by a 15% drop in SLPE sales and a 7% dip in RFL sales. The declines in SLPE were attributed to an 11% fall in medical equipment products and a 21% decline in industrial products. Other product sales decreased 55% as a result of the company's shift in focus to standard platform products and services in 2012.

        <p>
   Steven Lax and Edward Gaugler founded G-L Electronics, the forerunner of SL Industries, as a public company in 1956. In 1963 the firm, renamed G-L Industries, fell prey to conglomerate fever. By the end of the decade the company's diverse offerings included heavy machinery, printed circuit boards, microwave technology, chromium plating, and surface finishing. G-L Industries became SGL Industries in 1970. In the following decade it added companies that made batteries, graphics, spark plugs, plastics, and lubrication systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company, renamed SL Industries in 1984, began divesting operations during the 1980s. It held onto its power systems, plating and finishing, piping systems, and jet engine ignition businesses. Erratic earnings in the late 1980s led to more divestitures and a fight for control of the company in 1992. Management beat back a group of dissident shareholders and focused the company on power system products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the 1990s SL bought Teal Electronics (power distribution units). It sold its piping systems and aviation spark plugs businesses in 1997. It then unveiled its UPSTART Network line of uninterruptible power systems for networking equipment. The company bolstered its presence in the world and in the aerospace industry by buying Germany-based Elektro-Metall Export (1998), RFL Electronics (specialized communications equipment, 1999), and Todd Products (power supplies, 1999).
  </p>
        <p>
   Restructuring its acquisitions, SL put its Mexico-based plants under the management of subsidiary Condor D.C. Power Supplies in 2000 and combined the marketing operations of its Todd Products and SL Waber subsidiaries. Early the next year SL announced that it was looking for a buyer. In early 2003 the company announced the sale of its Germany-based subsidiary, Elektro-Metall Export (electronic actuation devices and cable harness systems), for a reported $11.6 million. SL's coating and plating unit, Surface Technologies, was sold for a reported $600,000 and other considerations in late 2003.
  </p>
        <p>
   James Taylor, the CEO of the Power Electronics Group, was named the company's EVP/COO in early 2004. He was promoted to president and CEO in August 2005.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2005 SL agreed to acquire competitor Ault for around $14 million in cash; the transaction was completed in early 2006.
