   Vital Signs wants you to take a deep breath and keep breathing, whether you're going under for surgery or peacefully sleeping through the night. Vital Signs makes disposable medical products used to help patients breathe during surgery and in critical care settings. Its anesthesia products include airway management and ventilation devices such as face masks and tubes. Its respiratory and critical care units also make manual resuscitators and patient monitoring products. Parent

   Growth in both US and overseas markets led the company to expand its global supply chain organization by adding manufacturing and assembly staff, increasing production shifts, and adding equipment and skilled resources at its New Jersey and Colorado facilities. The company boosted production to meet rising demands for its Limb-O anesthesia and other products. The unit also started up production in western Europe in 2012.

   Terence Wall founded Vital Signs in 1972. Originally the company made private-label products for larger medical firms, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, but in 1975 it focused on direct sales. The company grew as disposable medical products gained popularity for their cost-effectiveness and reduced risk of infection. Vital Signs went public in 1990.
  </p>
        <p>
   Pressure on hospital suppliers from managed care companies forced Vital Signs to concentrate on new marketing strategies and overseas growth. In 1995 Vital Signs and Baxter International partnered to distribute each other's products in the UK and Europe. Also that year Vital Signs acquired 85% of Israel-based Mediziv Medical Products, a maker of anesthesia and critical care supplies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 the company sold its endoscopic product line to UroHealth Systems (now Imagyn Medical Technologies) and bought sterile-packaging maker HealthStar Pharmaceutical. That year Vital Signs established a source agreement with Premier Purchasing, a group-purchasing partnership representing some 1,700 US hospitals. Vital Signs also opened a sales office in China.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 Vital Signs bought troubled Marquest Medical Products (disposable respiratory products) from Scherer Healthcare. Vital Signs ramped up its sales force to twice its size in 1997 so it could better market Marquest's products, but a 1998 sales slump prompted the company to cut its sales force. In 1999 Vital Signs focused on commercializing products in its pipeline and expanded into sleep therapy devices by acquiring a controlling interest in Swedish firm Breas Medical. The company also acquired National Sleep Technologies in 2000.
  </p>
        <p>
   Vital Signs formed Sleep Services of America in 2002 when National Sleep Technologies merged with HSI Medical Services.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also during 2002 Vital Signs acquired Stelex, a provider of regulatory compliance counseling. Stelex was then merged with Vital Sign's subsidiary, The Validation Group, and the surviving subsidiary was renamed Stelex-The Validation Group. The company sold its Vital Pharma subsidiary, a contract drug manufacturer, in 2003.
  </p>
        <p>
   Vital Signs added to its anesthesia unit in 2005 with the purchase of the disposable airway management device operations of a
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   subsidiary.
  </p>
        <p>
   Vital Signs was acquired by GE in 2008 and became part of its Clinical Consumables division. The firm's Sleep Services of America unit, a joint venture with Johns Hopkins that diagnosed such sleep disorders as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at its labs in seven states, was transferred to another GE division. Vital Signs' Breas subsidiary, a Sweden-based maker of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines for patients with sleep disorders, was also transferred to GE's Respiratory and Sleep division.
