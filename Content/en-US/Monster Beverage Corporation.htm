   Monster Beverage serves up a variety of "alternative" sodas, juices, and teas in more than 155 countries worldwide. Its most popular and now namesake brand, Monster, is the #2 energy drink behind
   <company id="101316">
    Red Bull
   </company>
   and has spawned the Java Monster coffee drink. Other products include fruit juice, smoothies, and dry juice mixes. The company sells most of its products in the US and Canada through a distribution network, but also directly to retailers such as grocery chains and wholesale clubs. In 2015, Monster formed a long-term strategic partnership with
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   , which acquired a minority stake in the business for $2.1 billion.

  <p>
   Monster Beverage in 2015 reorganized into three operating segments: Finished Products, Concentrate, and Other. The Finished Product segment (formerly the Direct Store Delivery segment), which accounted for 93% of Monster's total sales during 2015, sells finished energy drinks to beverage distributors, retail grocers and specialty chains, wholesalers, the military, and various retail and food distribution chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Concentrate segment (5% of sales), which was made from the energy drinks brands acquired from Coca Cola in 2015, sells concentrates and/or beverage bases to bottling and canning operations that combine the materials with sweeteners and water to produced finished beverages. The Other segment (formerly the Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand), consists of the juice-based beverage brands disposed of after the 2015 Coca Cola deal.

  <p>
   Although most of Monster Beverage's sales are generated in the US, it continues to expand its international footprint; its products are now available in some 156 countries worldwide. It packs its product from facilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US.

   The company markets to consumers who thrive on caffeine consumption, whether it's Boomers needing more energy to retain their youthful pace or Gen Y's use of the drink to stay awake to study and party. Its main focus is to develop brand awareness through image enhancing programs (including celebrity or sports figure endorsements or event sponsorships) and product sampling (including coupons). The company also advertises via TV and radio, print, in-store promotion displays, and outdoor posters, and uses "push-pull" techniques that enhance its shelf and display space exposure in retail stores (through branded racks, coolers, in-store placements, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
   The multi-channel marketer serves a variety of customers, including full service distributors (65% of 2015 sales); those outside the US (23%); club stores, drug chains, and mass merchants (9%); retail grocery, specialty chains, and wholesalers (2%); and other (1%). Some of its largest clients include: the TCCC North American Bottlers,

   <company id="91693">
    Coca-Cola Hellenic

   ,
   <company id="111830">

   , and certain other Coca-Cola independent bottlers,

   Monster Beverage spent $209.7 million on advertising and promotional activities in 2015, compared to $171.5 million and $181.8 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   Monster Beverage's revenues and profits have been rising over the past several years thanks to growing consumer demand for its energy drinks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue climbed 10% to a record $2.72 billion during 2015, with sales of the company's namesake brand, Monster Energy, driving 79% of the rise with a $204 million increase in sales. Increased domestic and international demand -- in new and established foreign markets -- led to volume increases for its Monster Energy drinks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solid revenue growth in 2015 drove Monster Beverage's net income up 13% to $546.7 million. Monster's operating cash levels fell by more than half to $208 million mainly after adjusting its earnings for non-cash items including a $314.7 million excess tax benefit from stock option exercises and a $302 million change in deferred income taxes.

  <p>
   With sales in the US maturing, Monster Beverage continued in 2016 to expand its distribution networks worldwide. It also continues to aggressively roll out new beverage products to cater to trendy consumers in the niche "alternative beverage" market as the industry has grown increasingly crowded with bottled water and juices from beverage giants such as
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   . The beverage maker particularly likes to introduce new versions of its famous Monster-branded products such as Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology, Java Monster non-carbonated coffee + energy drinks, and M3 Monster Energy Super Concentrate energy drinks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a deal that greatly expanded the product lines of both Monster Beverage and its new long-term strategic partner,
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   (TCCC) in early 2015 purchased a 16.7% equity stake in Monster for $2.15 billion. Under the terms of the deal, TCCC transferred ownership of its worldwide energy drink business, including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and Relentless, to Monster; and Monster will transfer its non-energy beverages, including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade, and Hansen's Juice Products, to TCCC.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Monster Beverage launched a plethora of drinks including its Punch Monster Baller's and Mad Dog drinks; Peace Tea Viva Mango juice drink, its carbonated Monster Energy Valention Rossi drink, Hubert's Organic Lemonade; zero calorie and zero sugar drinks like Monster Energy Ultra Black and Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise; and the caffeine-free Monster Energy Unleaded.

  <p>
   In February 2016, Monster Beverage aimed to bring its primary flavor supplier in-house after agreeing to buy long-time business partner American Fruits &amp; Flavors (AFF) for $690 million. The acquisition of AFF would also secure the intellectual property of Monster's most important flavors.
