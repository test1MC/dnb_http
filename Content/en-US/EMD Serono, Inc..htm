   in the US) and Gonal-f (a recombinant hormone therapy for female infertility) are among the top sellers for the firm's parent
   <company id="58089">
    Merck

   . Other marketed therapies are designed to help treat growth hormone deficiency, HIV, and short bowel syndrome. In its development portfolio, product candidates include vaccines and immunotherapies that may help a patient's own immune system fight cancer.

   EMD Serono has recently restarted a clinical program studying BLP25 liposome vaccine, a therapeutic vaccine for non-small cell lung cancer. The FDA had previously put the program on hold after a multiple myeloma (plasma cell cancer) patient in a clinical trial developed encephalitis (acute brain inflammation). BLP25 is still on hold for clinical trials in advanced breast cancer.

   As part of its neurodegenerative drug development efforts, EMD Serono is helping to advance basic and clinical research on MS through several collaboration agreements. With Boston-based

    The National Multiple Sclerosis Society

   , EMD Serono is evaluating and offering funding to promising MS projects engaged in early-stage clinical development. And it is providing

   In 2015, as part of its strategic partnership with Pfizer, EMD Serono began co-promoting XALKORI, a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer developed by Pfizer. The two companies are working together to bring novel oncology drugs to the market. Previously, they developed and commercialized a monoclonal antibody, avelumab, which was designed to promote the creation of immuno-oncology therapies.
