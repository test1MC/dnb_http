   If you're familiar with the munchies named Toastchee, Nipchee, and Captain's Wafers, Snyder's-Lance (formerly Lance) has undoubtedly helped you satisfy a snack attack. The company produces single-serve, multi-pack, and family-sized packages of bakery products and sweet and savory snack foods, including cookies, crackers, nuts, potato chips, and pretzels. Its snacks are sold under the Lance, Cape Cod, Tom's, Archway, and Snyder's brands at food retailers, mass merchants, and convenience and club stores in the US. The company also makes private-label and branded snacks for food makers. In 2016 the company acquired fellow snack maker

  <p>
   Blending the Snyder's and Lance businesses has made Snyder's-Lance the No. 2 salty snack maker in the US. Snyder's-Lance boasts about a dozen owned brands (70% of revenue), as well as a vast collection of popular licensed names (20% of revenue), such as Bugles. Snyder's and Lance retained their corporate offices in North Carolina and Pennsylvania and knit together their executive suites to form a snack food powerhouse.

   Snyder's-Lance logged about $32 million in advertising expenses in 2015. The snack food giant sells its products to mass merchandisers, club stores, discount stores, convenience stores, foodservice operators, and other retailers the likes of drug stores, the military, schools, and government facilities.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , its largest customer, represented about 13% of the company's revenues in both 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distributes snack food products nationwide using a large direct-store-delivery (DSD) network consisting of some 3,000 distribution routes served mostly by Independent Business Owners (IBOs) and others that are company-owned.

  <p>
   In 2015, revenue increased 2% to $1.66 billion as consumers munched down more snacks under the Late July, Cape Cod, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, and Lance brands. A full year of revenue from Baptista's, acquired in June 2014, also pushed growth higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income tumbled 74% in 2015 to $50.7 million. In 2014 the company gained on the sale of discontinued operations, which it didn't have in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations soared to $146 million in 2015 from $13 million in 2014 on changes in working capital including inventory and other accrued liabilities.

  <p>
   As part of the company's effort to merge the two businesses, Snyder's-Lance is paying particular attention to what it has deemed its core brands -- Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, Lance sandwich crackers, and Cape Cod potato chips. It's fueling growth among these brands by developing them and expanding their distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company sold two of its United States subsidiaries as well as certain assets of its Canadian subsidiary, which included the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the majority of its Private brand products and certain contract manufactured products for Shearer's Foods, LLC (Shearer's) for $430 million.

  <p>
   In early 2016 the company acquired
   <company id="100917">
    Diamond Foods
   </company>
   , makers of Diamond and Emerald nuts, for about $1.3 billion. The move added snack brands as well as UK and US distribution might to Synder's-Lance. Later in 2016, to maintain focus on its core products, the company sold its Diamond of California culinary nut business to private equity firm Blue Road Capital. Diamond of California had been one of four Diamond Foods brands at the time of Snyder's-Lance's acquisition.

   Snack food is a highly competitive sector in food manufacturing; there are many players, from giants such as
   <company id="48009">
    Frito-Lay
   </company>
   (Lay's Potato Chips, Doritos, Cheetos, Cracker Jack) to little guys like pork rinds maker
   <company id="111124">
    Rudolph Foods
   </company>
   that carve out a spot in either a regional or product niche. Whether large or small, most snack food companies are bowing to customer demand to produce healthier products. The company has introduced 100-calorie snack packs and whole-grain snack crackers. (It had previously removed lard, trans-fats, and high-fructose corn syrup from its products.)
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A business deal gone awry stuck coffee dealer Philip Lance with 500 pounds of peanuts in 1913. Selling nickel bags of roasted peanuts and then peanut butter, Lance began packaging peanut-butter-and-cracker sandwiches. His son-in-law, Salem Van Every, joined him two years later to form Lance Packing. Lance introduced Toastchee in 1938 and by 1939, the year the firm became Lance, sales reached $2 million. The company began serving the institutional market in 1953 and began selling through vending machines the next year. Lance went public in 1961.
  </p>
  <p>
   The family continued to run the company until 1973 when Van Every's grandson retired as CEO. After decades of serving mom-and-pop retailers, Lance found the snack market changing. Individual stores gave way to chains; Frito-Lay gobbled up grocery shelf space; and regional rival, Austin Quality Foods, nabbed sales in the new warehouse/club store market. Eventually the conservative company responded with an influx of new management, restructuring, and the advent of marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lance purchased Tamming Foods (sugar wafers) and Cape Cod Potato Chips (salty snacks) in 1999. Lance then signed an agreement with China Peregrine (now China Premium Food Corp) to export private-label snack foods to China. (Lance has since ceased distribution in China.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Lance's board of directors elected Bill Prezzano as chairman. David Singer, formerly EVP and CFO of
   <company id="13014">
    Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated
   </company>
   , was named president and CEO of the company. And in 2005, Lance purchased a Canadian sugar-wafer manufacturing plant from A&amp;M Cookie Company Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The $40 million acquisition of Tom's Foods in 2005 added four new bakery and potato chip manufacturing plants to the company's operations. Lance manufactures about 90% of its products; the remainder is purchased for resale.
  </p>
  <p>
   While
   <company id="48009">
    Frito-Lay
   </company>
   dominates the snack-aisle grocery shelves, Lance's stronghold has been its company-owned vending machines placed in 15,000 locations such as break rooms and cafeterias. In order to concentrate on more profitable operations, in 2006 Lance began phasing out its vending-machine sales and ceased vending operations altogether in 2007. In addition the company joined the ranks of munchies makers that offer healthier products in 2007 with the $2 million purchase of a minority interest in Late July Products, a Massachusetts-based organic snack food maker (crackers, and sandwich crackers and cookies).
