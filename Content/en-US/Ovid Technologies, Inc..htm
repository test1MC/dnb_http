   fluctuCompany founder Mark Nelson began writing search programs for a small consulting firm in the early 1980s. He launched Online Research Systems in 1985 and spent the next three years writing a search program to access the National Library of Medicine's Medline database, released on CD-ROM in 1988. That year he incorporated his company as CD Plus. To satisfy increasing demand for multiple users, the company released its PlusNet networking products in 1989. PlusNet offered the same search software as the CD-ROM products, but up to 24 people could use it simultaneously.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced the Ovid user interface in 1993 to provide a common way to access all of the company's products and services. It changed its name to CDP Technologies and then entered the online market in 1994 -- acquiring BRS Online, one of the original online database services. That year the company went public. In 1995 Ovid took its present name and released the Core Biomedical Collection, making the full text of 15 respected biomedical journals available online.

   In 1996 Ovid released the Ovid Web Gateway to allow users to access Ovid software over the Web. The following year it formed a clinical information division to develop new products for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals. In 1998 the company launched Journals@Ovid, an online aggregated database of scientific, medical, and technical journals. Later that year

   bought the company for $200 million.

   In 1999 Nelson stepped down to pursue other interests; his replacement, Ovid veteran Deborah Hull, remained with the company less than a year. Dean Vogel, from sister Wolters Kluwer subsidiary
   <company id="127789">
    Aspen Publishers
   </company>
   , was tapped as CEO in 2000. That year Ovid introduced several new products, including Clinical Evidence (a searchable database of clinical questions) and Ovid On Call (a question-and-answer service).
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year the company debuted Ovid@Hand, offering wireless access to the company's information. Also in 2001 the company expanded its offerings when parent company Wolters Kluwer acquired Boston-based SilverPlatter and its 250 databases. Vogel resigned his post in late 2003. Gary Foster took over as head of the company in 2004 when he was appointed chief of the Global Medical Research unit.
