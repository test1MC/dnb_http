   Echelon Corp. has made the infrastructure that connected industrial devices into networks that morphed into the Internet of Things. The company's combination of computer chips, routers and controllers, network interfaces, and software have enabled connections for about 100 million devices for lighting, heating and cooling, security, manufacturing, lighting, and building automation around the world. Echelon is moving to develop networking resources for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing the capability for things such as sensors inside jet engines to communicate their operating status. The company also develops and sells an array of lighting control systems, another portion of the Internet of Things.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has developed two protocols for connecting devices. Its LonWorks protocol connects devices by cables and lines including twisted pair, power lines, and fiber optics. It also supports radio frequency connections. Echelon's newer platform is IzoT, which connects devices wirelessly via Internet Protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has two product portfolios: building automation and outdoor lighting products. Building automation products include the company's platform for the IIoT, IzoT, as well as transceivers, controllers, and the LNS and OpenLNS Operating System. Included in the outdoor lighting line are Smart Transceivers, Outdoor Lighting Controllers, Motion Sensors, Wireless and Ethernet Gateways, and Wireless and Ethernet Gateways.
  </p>
  <p>
   To a large degree, Echelon's products are made by third-party manufacturers. It gets components from with
   <company id="10428">
    Cypress Semiconductor
   </company>
   and has manufacturing agreements with
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   and Open-Silicon.
   <company id="12760">
    Bel-Fuse
   </company>
   (formerly TYCO) is a third-party manufacturer of Echelon products requiring assembly.

  Echelon's revenue tumbled 55% in 2014 to $38.7 million from 2013. The company blamed the decline on reduced sales to its customer Enel, reduced sales of the LonWorks protocol, and economic conditions in the European region. The company's net income also fell, dropping 38% to $24 million.
  <p>
   The company sold its Grid segment in 2014, which had an impact of its sales, particularly to Enel.

  <p>
   With the sale of a major portion of the company and an acquisition to replace it, Echelon is in the midst of a makeover that will place it firmly in the vanguard in developing the Industrial Internet of Things.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2014, Echelon sold its Grid operations, which had been a significant part of the company's business, to S&amp;T AG, a European IT systems provider. Echelon made to deal to focus on its networking platform for the IIoT. The Grid operation made products that connected energy devices to increase efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further its bet on IIoT, Echelon bought Lumewave Inc., a wireless outdoor lighting control system provider. Echelon sees LED lighting products as a driver of demand for its networking products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lumewave makes individual lighting controllers, motion sensors, gateways, and management and maintenance software. It sells to U.S. municipalities, universities, medical facilities and enterprises. Lumewave's wares add to Echelon's streetlight networking business, which uses powerline carrier (PLC) technology.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Echelon acquired Lumewave in August 2014 for an undisclosed sum. The addition of Lumewave's products and other resources should help Echelon's networking products gain sales in outdoor lighting control for municipalities and companies. The outdoor lighting market includes streetlights and illumination for parking areas, walkways, and other outdoor spaces.
