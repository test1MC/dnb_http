   You certainly couldn't accuse CEMEX of being stuck in the mud. The building materials company is one of the top cement makers in the world (along with
   <company id="91789">
    LafargeHolcim
   </company>
   ). The majority of its sales come from cement; the company has about 60 cement plants and an annual production capacity of about 95 million tons. It also produces, markets and distributes ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and clinker (an intermediate product used to make cement). CEMEX operates in North America (through
   <company id="117080">
    CEMEX Inc.
   </company>
   ), as well as in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. The US, Mexico, and Europe account for more than 70% of revenues.

  <p>
   The foundation of CEMEX began with -- what else? -- cement. Lorenzo Zambrano founded Cementos Hidalgo in northern Mexico in 1906. In 1931 the company merged with Cementos Portland Monterrey and was renamed Cementos Mexicanos, from which its current name, CEMEX, is derived.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s the company expanded into the cities of Ciudad Valles and Torreón by building plants; it moved into Mérida in 1966 by acquiring Cementos Maya. The founder's grandson, also named Lorenzo Zambrano, joined the company in 1968. CEMEX became a true national force during the 1970s by acquiring more plants, including one in central Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEMEX went public in 1976. With its acquisition of Cementos Guadalajara and its three plants, it became Mexico's top cement maker. After serving in several engineering positions and as VP of operations, Zambrano was named CEO in 1985. He had worked at CEMEX as a teenager in the early 1960s and claims he knew he wanted to work for CEMEX since he was 14.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zambrano set about making CEMEX an international player. Already an exporter, the company boosted its exporting business by purchasing Cementos Anáhuac in 1987. Two years later CEMEX sealed its position as the top Mexican cement maker by acquiring that country's #2 cement company, Cementos Tolteca. CEMEX then bought its first non-Mexican operations in 1992, adding Valenciana de Cementos and Sanson, Spain's largest cement makers. Two years later CEMEX added Vencemos (Venezuela's top cement business), Cemento Bayano (Panama), and a plant in Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The globalization of CEMEX helped the company weather several peso devaluations during the 1990s, including one in late 1994. The company continued to expand abroad, adding Cementos Nacionales (Dominican Republic) in 1995 and Cementos Diamante and Samper (both in Colombia) in 1996. Those deals made the company the world's third-largest cement producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   After claiming more of the European and Latin American cement markets, CEMEX turned its attention to the Pacific Rim, where it made investments in Rizal Cement Company in the Philippines in 1997 and PT Semen Gresik in Indonesia in 1998 (it sold its 25% stake in 2006).
  </p>
  <p>
   A booming US economy fueled residential and commercial construction in fiscal 1999, lifting CEMEX to record sales. In 2000 CEMEX gained significant size when it acquired US cement maker Southdown for $2.8 billion. The company sold its Kentucky and Missouri operations to Rinker Materials, a unit of Australia's CSR Ltd, in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2002 CEMEX bought Puerto Rican Cement Company (PRCC) for around $180 million. The next year CEMEX acquired Mineral Resource Technologies and Dixon-Marquette Cement in the US. In 2005 CEMEX added extensive European operations with the acquisition of UK-based ready-mix cement giant RMC Group. The deal, worth about $5.8 billion, instantly made CEMEX a leader in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquired Rinker, Australia's biggest building material manufacturer, for more than $14 billion in 2007. In 2008 CEMEX sold most of its stake in telecom company
   <company id="159577">
    Axtel
   </company>
   and later its Canary Islands operations, garnering a combined $474 million for debt payments. In 2009 CEMEX (still struggling under the weight of debt and facing declining sales) sold its Australian operations to Holcim for nearly $2 billion. In 2011 CEMEX bought Ready Mix USA's interest in the companies' two joint ventures, which have operations in the Southeast US.
