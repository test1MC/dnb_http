   U10 finds utility in making housewares. The company offers many kinds of textiles (especially table linens and draperies), other household items such as portable plastic drawer units, and decorative items for major holidays. The company focused on organic growth for its main textile lines from its founding in 1994 until 2000, when it began acquiring nearly a dozen other housewares companies. U10's brand portfolio includes Fred Olivier (linens, cushions, and kitchen accessories), Décordis (plastic bath and kitchen goods), PRA (fragrances and cosmetics), and Codico (leisure goods such as outdoor furnishings). CEO Thierry Lievre partnered with

   The company divides its operations geographically - Europe and Asia - and each carries out a separate function. Europe carries out the rapid delivery of small quantities of products to platforms and stores. Asia delivers products in large volumes to customers' logistics platforms.
