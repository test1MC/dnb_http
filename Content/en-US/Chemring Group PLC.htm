   Chemring has several divisions, but none of them have much to do with chemicals or rings. Operating through four principal segments, the company specializes in designing and supplying aerospace and defense countermeasures and marine and military electronics and pyrotechnics. Its Countermeasures segment supplies flares and decoy components used to combat incoming missiles. Counter-IED supplies radar, chemical, and biological detection systems; Pyrotechnics offers beacons, radios, and emergency flares used for space, safety systems, military training, screening, and signaling purposes. Chemring's operations are located throughout the world.

   The US represents 57% of Chemring's net sales. Other major markets include the UK (20%) and the rest of Europe (10%).

   Chemring's operations cater primarily to the US market, where the company has developed a strong relationship with the

   </company>
   . The arrangement enables Chemring to draw multi-year contracts, and it spurs the company to expand its pyrotechnic capabilities and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) production through key US operational bases.

   Chemring's balance sheet has been trending downward the past few years. Revenue fell 36% from $1 billion in 2013 to $645 million in 2014, and it also suffered net losses for 2013 and 2014 primarily due to losses stemming from discontinued operations. Its operating cash flow declined from $89 million in 2013 to $74 million in 2014 as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decreases for 2014 were driven by a 23% decrease in its Countermeasures segment due to reductions in demand from the UK and US as a result of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Sensors &amp; Electronics revenue also declined by 27% upon the completion of a major production contract with the US

   To get its balance sheet out of the red, Chemring has been making divestitures. In 2014 it sold its European munitions businesses in addition to its German subsidiary, Chemring Defence Germany GmbH.
