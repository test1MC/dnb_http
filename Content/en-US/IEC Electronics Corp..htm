   IEC makes products you may never see. The company is a contract electronics manufacturer of printed circuit boards, system-level assemblies, extreme-condition cable and wire assemblies, and precision sheet metal components. Customers come from the aerospace, communications, medical, and military sectors. Like many contract electronics manufacturers, IEC also offers a variety of auxiliary services, including systems integration, design and prototyping, materials procurement and management, engineering, and testing.

  <p>
   The company's products are made in the US at plants located in California, New Mexico, and New York.

   IEC uses a direct sales force as well as a nationwide network of manufacturers' representatives. It targets customers that develop low-to-moderate volumes of complex, advanced technology products for markets ranging from satellite communications to medical, military and ruggedized industrial products.

   IEC has weathered plenty of economic ups and downs during its four-decade history. Sales fell 3% in 2013 to $140 million after one customer chose to use two different contract manufacturers to mitigate risk and another medical customer had its product recalled. Profits plummeted to -$9 million after the company recorded a $14.2 million impairment charge for its Southern California Braiding Company subsidiary. IEC plans to shift future cable and wire assembly to its New Mexico plant.

   IEC's turn-key range of products and services, and a focus on high-reliability assemblies are geared to woo and support long-term relationships with original equipment manufacturers. The company seeks to offer its customers flexible production methods, quick turnaround, and sophisticated testing.

    General Dynamics
   </company>
   veteran Roger Main and others founded IEC in 1966 to make components for handheld two-way radios and other electronic devices. IEC went public in 1967 and sold its radio business in 1979 in order to concentrate on contract electronics manufacturing. IEC began a partnership with
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   in 1983 when the latter started building PCs. Main and other executives took IEC private in an LBO in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Compaq's orders slowed during the recession of the early 1990s, IEC's profits fell. When Compaq rebounded, IEC did likewise. It acquired Texas-based Calidad Electronics in 1992, and went public again in 1993. In 1995 IEC expanded its production facilities and services, but component shortages and customer scheduling demands led to a drop in sales. After Main died in 1996, EVP Russell Stingel (Main's former General Dynamics co-worker) was named CEO. That year IEC's earnings slipped as computer equipment sales fell and the market for electronic components became saturated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed its money-losing Alabama plant in 1998, taking a restructuring charge that contributed to a loss for the year. In early 1999 IEC opened a manufacturing facility in Mexico. The following year IEC closed its operation in Ireland and began to diversify its customer base, decreasing its dependence on PC makers and targeting the telecommunications equipment and industrial instrumentation markets. Also in 2000 turnaround specialist Thomas Lovelock succeeded Stingel as president and CEO; Stingel remained as chairman until 2001, when director W. Barry Gilbert took over the position.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the economic downturn in the telecom equipment market resulted in fewer orders for IEC in 2001, the company responded with more restructuring, closing its Texas facility and transferring those operations to its plant in Mexico. In 2002 the company laid off employees, and Lovelock resigned. (Gilbert became president and CEO, in addition to chairman.) Later that year, in response to continuing losses, the company sold the assets of its manufacturing plant in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales continued to drop in 2004 and 2005, as IEC lost the business of two top customers. The company tried to make up the lost business by signing up many smaller customers. In 2006 IEC had around 25 customers and was able to reverse the sales decline. Its top five customers, however, accounted for around two-thirds of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   While IEC was able to stop a long decline in sales and return to profitability, its annual revenues in fiscal 2006 were less than one-tenth of what they were a decade earlier; its headcount, while rebounding from a low in 2005, was one-sixth that of 10 years before.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company definitively reversed the decline in fiscal 2007, increasing revenues by 81% over the prior year, by adding a number of new customers. IEC's five largest customers, however, account for about 60% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it returned to acquisitions, purchasing Val-U-Tech, a privately held supplier of wire harness assemblies, which was renamed IEC Electronics Wire and Cable and now makes up IEC's manufacturing capabilities outside New York. In 2009 it bought contract manufacturer

   (GTC) from
   <company id="10415">
    Crane Co.

   for a little over $14 million. GTC serves the military and defense sectors, a market that now accounts for about 60% of its revenues.
