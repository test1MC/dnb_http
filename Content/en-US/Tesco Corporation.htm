  <p>
   In 2014 Tesco's net revenue increased by 3% primarily due to sales growth in the Tubular Services segment primarily in Latin America and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net revenues decreased by 39% due to higher income tax provisions (reflecting the fluctuating mix of pre-tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which the company operates) and an increase in Other Expenses due to a reversal $1.8 million of other expense in 2013 related to the Mexico Amnesty program in which the company participated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Tesco's operating cash inflow decreased by 57% due to lower net income and changes in working capital as a result of changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and inventories.

  <p>
   Tesco is focusing on its technology, looking to change the way people drill wells by making drilling more efficient and less costly for the upstream energy industry. It also seeking to deliver safer drilling methods and reducing risks to personnel and assets for both surface and downhole drilling operations. The company has been concentrating on commercializing its investment in its proprietary technologies and has brought in executives to oversee the commercialization of its technologies while letting other managers focus on their areas of expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tesco estimates that about 95% of the world's offshore rigs are equipped with top drives. The company sees a major growth potential in the land rig market (only 60% of land rigs currently use top drive systems). (Tesco was first top drive maker to provide portable top drives for land drilling rigs.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's four strategic initiatives are: The expansion of Tubular Services business, particularly offshore; The expansion of After Market Services to service third party equipment; The incorporation of additional pipe handling products into manufacturing platform; The adaptation of Top Drives rental business to the market conditions and incorporation of additional pipe handling products into the company's global platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has proposed a total of $650 million in strategic capital investments during the five-year period through 2019. This includes $250 million in capital expenditures to fuel organic growth, and $250 million to fund acquisitions. The balance will be used to enhance shareholder return.

  <p>
   In order to focus on its core products, Tesco sold its casing drilling equipment assets in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired the Egyptian company Premiere Casing Services (PCS). PCS, a tubular services provider for the onshore and offshore oil and gas industry in Egypt, will be integrated into the TESCO Middle East Business Unit . The transaction, the first for TESCO in that market, will utilize the current PCS contract portfolio and workforce and positions the company for further expansion of operations in the region. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it formed a new segment, under the CASING DRILLING name. CASA DRILLING allows wells to be drilled with conventional oilwell casing, but in a manner that reduces both drilling time and minimizes the use of conventional drill pipe and drill collars and the problems associated with their use.
