   It's a bird! It's a plane! Actually, it's an unmanned aircraft built by Insitu. The company makes unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) -- small pilotless aircraft, such as the ScanEagle, NightEagle, and Integrator -- for the military, public safety, aerospace, and other markets. These miniature robotic aircraft are typically used for commercial and government intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) from border patrol and forest fire control to meteorology and geophysical mapping. ScanEagle, which is used by the US for surveillance in Afghanistan, was developed with

   . The collaboration was so successful that in 2008 the aerospace giant acquired Insitu, which was formed in 1994.

The new location will be used for inventory, production, depot maintenance, and propulsion engineering; it will cater to the forest management, crop monitoring, firefighting, and marine life surveillance sectors.
