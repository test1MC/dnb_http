   The company believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on growth in the M2M market through its broad offerings and experience. The company is pursuing growth in its hardware, networking, and software offerings through organic and acquisitive means. Its research and development programs are focused on hardware products, especially wireless hardware, which remains the company's main product offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Digi is also working on new software applications and related solutions for customers looking to link numerous devices in various locations. The company is moving into the cloud with products such as iDigi, an M2M (machine-to-machine) cloud-based Internet platform for monitoring and controlling electronic devices.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   In October 2015 Digi International sold its Etherios CRM consulting services business to West Monroe Partners. It divested the software unit to focus on its machine-connectivity products. The divestment included closing the company's operation in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, in the next month, Digi International expanded its connectivity offerings with the purchase of Bluenica Corp.

  <p>
   The $10 million Bluenica acquisition added wireless sensors, gateways, and software for remotely monitoring the temperature of food and other perishables. Besides adding to its internet of things portfolio, the Bluenica addition provides recurring revenue.

  <p>
   John Schinas was working for a computer company that stopped making digital circuit boards in 1985. He quit that year, mortgaged his home, bought the company's inventory, and started selling under the name DigiBoard. The enterprise became Digi International and went public in 1989. Digi's quality engineering and strong network of distributors fostered growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Digi began buying companies in 1991 with the purchase of competitor Arnet. It expanded into the LAN market, buying connectivity device maker MiLAN in 1993. In 1995 Digi bought LAN Access and began developing network and remote-access products. But the acquisitions resulted in drastically lower earnings and a management shakeup in 1996. The following year CEO Ervin Kamm was replaced by consultant Jerry Dusa. Shareholders filed suit against Digi, alleging it misrepresented the financial results of a soured investment in development-stage company AetherWorks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Losses in 1997 caused the company to take a restructuring charge, consolidate operations, reduce its workforce by 33%, and write off its remaining AetherWorks stake. Digi pursued the growing Internet telephony market with the 1998 purchase of ITK International. Losses resulted that year, leading to Dusa's resignation in 1999. Later in 1999 former
   <company id="46656">
    Lucent
   </company>
   executive Joseph Dunsmore was named CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company exited the Internet telephony market when it wrote off its NetBlazer line. That year the company also restructured its European operations, moving all product development and manufacturing to its US facilities. The following year Digi cut about 13% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company acquired networking equipment maker
   <company id="58166">
    NetSilicon
   </company>
   for about $55 million. Digi sold its MiLAN subsidiary, which made local-area networking devices, to
   <company id="13049">
    Communications Systems
   </company>
   for $8.5 million. In 2003 Digi repurchased all shares held in the company by
   <company id="46607">
    Sorrento Networks
   </company>
   . Sorrento received the shares through its equity ownership in NetSilicon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company grew its embedded product line when it acquired Rabbit Semiconductor, a supplier of microprocessors, MPU modules, and single-board computers, for $49 million in cash in 2005. Such products were used in building security, point of sale, parking systems, telecommunications, vehicle and ship systems, and container tracking. In addition to acquiring Rabbit Semi, Digi also bought FS Forth-Systeme and Sistemas Embebidos from Embedded Solutions AG, adding to its portfolio of modules and software for the embedded networking market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Digi purchased MaxStream, a developer of  radio-frequency (RF) modules and modems used in wireless networking, in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired Sarian Systems, a UK-based developer of IP routers and other networking equipment, for about $31 million. Sarian primarily markets to customers in the finance, lottery, remote access, retail, and telemetry markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Digi purchased wireless development services provider Spectrum Design Solutions in 2008. In 2009 it bought MobiApps, an Indian developer of machine-to-machine (M2M) technology, including mixed-signal ASICs. The acquisition moved Digi into the satellite communications market and increased its presence in India and Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   The global recession dampened sales and profitability in fiscal 2009. Digi reacted by restructuring operations, closing two facilities in California and reducing its workforce by about 13%. The company added more than 60 employees with the acquisition of MobiApps following the restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internationally, the company discontinued manufacturing at its Breisach, Germany, facility and consolidated the facility's operations into its Minnesota location.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved into the cloud with the 2009 introduction of iDigi, an M2M (machine-to-machine) cloud-based Internet platform for monitoring and controlling electronic devices.
