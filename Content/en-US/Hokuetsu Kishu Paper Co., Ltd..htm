   Paper and pulp are big business at Hokuetsu Kishu Paper. The company harnesses one of the largest paper machines in the world (N9) to produce mainly coated and noncoated paper, specialty papers, and white boxboard. Hokuetsu Kishu's six mills cross Japan's east to west girth. At the Kanto Plant, Hokuetsu Kishu operates a biomass boiler using a wood fuel made from demolished houses, for power generation which has a generation capacity of 42,900 kW. The company has a paper export capability with a capacity of 400,000 tons per year, although customers in Japan account for most of its sales. Hokuetsu Kishu also has timberland in South Africa.

   Hokuetsu Kishu's non-paper work, albeit a relatively small portion of its revenues, offers some buffer to swings in the paper and packaging market. The company's forest business manufactures chips and sells bark compost for mushroom farming. An engineering arm builds and maintains machinery related to timber activities. A property, real estate, and casualty insurance business, including driving school, is channeled through Hokuetsu Trading Corp. Moreover, Hokuetsu Logistics manages the parent company's stores and product transportation. Hokuetsu's biomass Niigata Mill generates power.

   In 2014 Hokuetsu Kishu introduced two large-scale solar power plants at its two bases in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. A mega-solar power plant installed on the site of the company's Kanto Plant, started power generation (expected to generate about 1,670 MWh of electricity per year) in 2014. A second plant, installed on the roof of the plant of Hokuetsu-Forest Co Ltd, a subsidiary of Hokuetsu Kishu P, in Hitachiota City, Ibaraki Prefecture, is expected to generate about 930 MWh of electricity per year.

  <p>
   Formerly Hokuetsu Paper Mills, the company merged with rival Kishu Paper, forged their names, and took on the role of parent company in 2009. The combined operations sought to reduce operating costs on product distribution and procurement of raw materials, and expand domestic sales.

   The company was established in 1907 to make paperboard from rice.
