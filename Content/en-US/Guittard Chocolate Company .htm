   For some, chocolate is as good as gold. Guittard Chocolate Company founder Etienne Guittard was one of many 49ers hailing from France who didn't strike it rich in California's Gold Rush. However, he hit pay dirt with his family's chocolate recipe. Guittard's products include cocoa, chocolate syrup, mints, mint wafers, milk chocolate balls and eggs, and baking chips. The chocolate purveyor, which also provides chocolate flakes and chunks, mostly sells its products to candy manufacturers. Founded in San Francisco in 1868 and rebuilt after the great earthquake of 1906, Guittard is owned and operated by the Guittard family, including Etienne's great-grandson and company president and CEO Gary Guittard.

   In the competitive and faddish chocolates business, where new names come on the market each season, Guittard competes with its rivals by sticking to its French roots and by selectively sourcing its cacao, such as its does with Venezuelan cacao. Guittard is one of the few chocolate makers to work directly with growers. It is also known for offering products free of any genetically modified ingredients.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company works to maintain its market share by keeping its products reasonably priced. It focuses on selling its chocolate directly to candy makers and professional pastry chefs in an effort to bypasses the more fickle retail market.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company makes and markets an artisan line of E. Guittard-branded chocolates in honor of its founder. The line includes all-natural ingredients, such as pure cane sugar, real vanilla beans, and full cream milk when making milk chocolate. In 2013 the company rolled out Collection Etienne Baking Bars, a newly developed fine chocolate used by professionals, for the home baker.
