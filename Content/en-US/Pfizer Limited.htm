   , offering many of its parent company's products including Lipitor for high cholesterol, Celebrex and Lyrica for chronic pain, Viagra for erectile dysfunction, and the Prevnar pneumonia vaccine. It also provides consumer health products (including Anadin, Centrum, and ThermaCare) and nutritionals (baby formula), as well as animal health offerings.

   Pfizer Limited markets its products directly to medical professionals, health care organizations, and consumers; its drugs are then sold primarily through wholesalers to the end users. The company's locations in the UK include a pharmaceutical marketing base in Tadworth, Surrey, where most of its sales force is located. Another office in Maidenhead conducts marketing activities for the consumer health and nutritional lines, and the firm also operates a manufacturing and distribution site in Havant that primarily handles temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer Limited also operates a major research and development center in Sandwich, Kent.

   Despite downsizing the R&amp;D organization, new drug development efforts remain key to Pfizer's efforts to add new products to its offerings to replace the aging blockbusters. The company is focused on growth in the areas of immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular, metabolic, and endocrine disease; oncology; pain and neurology; and vaccines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company Background
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of Pfizer's ongoing cost-reduction efforts, Pfizer significantly reduced the size of the Sandwich research organization. (The company had already shut down manufacturing operations at the Sandwich location as part of an earlier global manufacturing consolidation program in 2008.) Pfizer also closed or sold R&amp;D sites in Aberdeen and Gosport in the UK as part of a global program to consolidate R&amp;D facilities and reduce research spending in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer has been scrambling to cut costs in all areas of its business to offset revenue drops from patent losses -- including the expiration of top selling drug Lipitor's patent in the US and other key markets in 2011 and its exposure to generic competition in the UK in 2012 -- as well as to integrate the massive 2009 acquisition of US-based pharmaceuticals rival

    Wyeth
   </company>
   . The massive $68 billion deal expanded Pfizer's operations substantially in areas including vaccines, animal and consumer health products, and traditional and biological therapies; it also added a number of UK facilities. But to keep its organization efficient, Pfizer is furiously consolidating overlapping areas of the two companies' operations, including sales, administration, R&amp;D, and manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Sandwich R&amp;D center is focused on middle and late-stage clinical trials of pipeline candidates. Pfizer Limited also opened a new R&amp;D center (known as Neusentis) in Cambridge in 2011 to expand its research of biotech therapeutics for pain management, sensory disorders, and regenerative medicine. The company also intends to continue to pursue acquisitions and partnerships as a means of expanding both its development-stage and commercialized pharmaceutical assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pfizer first entered the UK market in the 1950s to manufacture and sell antibiotics; the UK unit enhanced its research operations extensively in the 1980s. Pfizer Limited became a top UK pharmaceutical company when it acquired
