   Filling the salad bowls of England is the challenge for Natures Way Foods. Once simply a lettuce farm, the company is now one of the UK's leading fresh produce manufacturers, specializing in ready-made bagged salads, prepared fruit, and leafy salad bowls and trays for sale through major UK grocery retailers and restaurants. The company boasts two leaf processing facilities in Selsey and Runcton, as well as a prepared fruit facility in Merston. Natures Way Foods was founded in 1994 when
   <company id="90426">
    Tesco
   </company>
   asked farmer David Langmead to produce a salad product for the company. Langmead's brother, Robert, a former food consultant to
   <company id="93845">
    Unilever
   </company>
   , joined him and together they created Natures Way as a sister company to Langmead Farms.

  <p>
   The produce supplier's factor in Merston allows for increased capacity of its prepared fruit operations. The facility is outfitted with equipment for producing leafy bowls and trays and is designed to give Natures Way the ability to manufacture new products with chicken, fish, or cheese, opening up the potential for new products to capture the complete meals market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Natures Way's other facilities include: Selsey, which processes whole-head Iceberg lettuce and babyleafs; and Runction, which produces shredded Iceberg, Sweet &amp; Crunchy, and Lasting Leaf types.
