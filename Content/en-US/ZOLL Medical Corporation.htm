   ZOLL Medical knows how to get your heart pounding. The medical equipment firm makes noninvasive cardiac defibrillators and pacing devices used in emergency situations to resuscitate hearts that have stopped beating during sudden cardiac arrest. ZOLL Medical also makes disposable electrodes for use with its products, as well as related information technology software. The company's products are used by hospitals, paramedics, and other emergency medical personnel and are sold through a direct sales force in the US and via representatives and distributors in some 140 countries worldwide. ZOLL Medical manufactures its products at five facilities in the US. Japanese firm
   <company id="52336">
    Asahi Kasei
   </company>
   acquired ZOLL in 2012.

  <p>
   Japanese chemical firm Asahi Kasei purchased ZOLL for some $2.2 billion in April 2012 through a cash tender offer. The acquisition was part of Asahi Kasei's efforts to expand in the critical care market; the two firms already had a distribution agreement (formed in 2011) through which Asahi Kasei distributed (and continues to distribute) certain ZOLL products in Japan. Following the transaction, ZOLL will operate as an independent subsidiary of Asahi Kasei. The new parent company plans to invest in expanding ZOLL's resuscitation offerings.

  <p>
   ZOLL's lead professional defibrillator product line is designed for trained health care professionals, such as paramedics and hospital personnel. The device incorporates features that record and transmit data and monitor heart rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. The firm's R Series models target hospitals, while its E Series, M Series, and X Series are designed for use in ambulances and critical care transport, while the Propaq MD was designed for military emergency response applications. ZOLL maintains healthy sales to military customers through a "state of readiness" contract to supply defibrillators on short notice to the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   While its core products were developed for use in hospital and ambulance settings, ZOLL Medical has branched out to develop more portable defibrillators, and helped to create the demand for units to be used by non-professionals in non-medical settings. ZOLL Medical's automated external defibrillators (AEDs) including the AED Pro are lower-cost, portable devices that non-professionals can use to analyze a patient's condition and shock the heart back into rhythm, if necessary. For patients at risk of a sudden cardiac arrest, doctors can prescribe the ZOLL LifeVest automatic defibrillator which can be worn at all times.

  <p>
   ZOLL is part of its parent's Critical Care segment, which accounted for 3% of total corporate revenue in 2013. The unit reported an operating loss due to amortization of goodwill.

  <p>
   The company plans to continue expanding its line of defibrillators for lay users and medical professionals. In 2013 it launched a device to help adults perform CPR on children under eight years of age without applying too much force. ZOLL also looks to expand geographically as it did in 2012 with the launch of its Japanese subsidiary. In 2013 it purchased a German company, expanding its operations in that country.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 ZOLL made two purchases. It bought Germany's LIFEBRIDGE Medizintechnik AG, which makes emergency uses medical devices to support respiratory and circulatory functions. The US-based development stage company Coaxia was its other buy.
  </p>
  <p>
   More recently, the company has agreed to buy Advanced Circulatory Systems, a Minnesota-based developer of products that non-invasively increase blood circulation. The business will operate as part of ZOLL's core products division. ZOLL also acquired, in mid-2015, Israel-based Kyma Medical Technologies, which develops products that measure early signs of congestive heart failure. Kyma will join ZOLL's LifeVest division.

  <p>
   In 1983 Paul Zoll, who pioneered the use of electrotherapy to regulate heart rhythms, formed ZOLL Medical with his son and some help from venture capitalists; the company soon became the main supplier of defibrillators to hospitals. In 1992 it went public with much fanfare. Stock soared when main rival Physio-Control (now a Medtronic subsidiary) was shut down temporarily by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of manufacturing problems. During that time ZOLL gained market share and raised its visibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 ZOLL diversified, buying Westech Mobile Solutions, a maker of software and hardware to handle data collection and billing for ambulance companies. In 1997 the FDA approved the use of a competitor's defibrillator on airplanes, creating a new market niche. Later that year the FDA issued a warning to ZOLL, claiming the company failed to respond adequately to claims of defibrillator malfunctions.
  </p>
  <p>
   ZOLL's M Series, which combined defibrillation, external pacing of the heart, and monitoring technology in a single unit, was launched in late 1998, followed poignantly by the death of founder Zoll in early 1999 (Richard Packer took over as chairman and CEO). Also in 1999 ZOLL acquired Pinpoint Technologies to expand its software business.
