   Belgium-based Ontex makes a range of diapers for babies and adults, tampons, and sanitary pads that it sells in 100 countries worldwide. The company sells branded products, such as Helen Harper and Fiore, but also manufactures products for partner retailers. It sells directly to consumers through retail markets, and to healthcare institutions like hospitals, nursing homes, health insurers, and local authorities. Ontex was founded in 1979 in Belgium, and the UK and France are the company's largest markets.

        <p>
   Ontex has three product categories: Baby Care, Femcare, and Adult Care (it also has a small Other product category).
  </p>
        <p>
   Baby Care, the largest of the three at 53% of revenue, sells diapers for babies, baby pants and wet wipes under ConBaby, Helen Harper Baby, Moltex, Bio Baby, bbtips, Kiddies Antifugas, and Chicolastic brands. Adult Care, bringing in 34% of revenue, makes incontinence products like adult pants, adult diapers, incontinence towels and bed protection under its iD, Serenity, Canped, Euron, Affective, and Liberty brands. Femcare, at 12% of revenue, sells tampons, sanitary pads and panty liners under Helen Harper and Fiore brands.
  </p>
        <p>
   Over 60% of revenue comes from retailer brand partnerships, with the remainder its own brand lines.

        <p>
   In 2015, revenue grew 4.5% on prior year to €1.7 billion, largely as a result of the Grupo Mabe acquisition. All three product categories saw positive growth in 2015.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income rose from a low base to €98.6 million due to lower non-recurring income and expenses. Cash from operating activities was up 17% on prior year to €180.6 million

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ontex is well positioned to capitalize on global demographic changes. In Western Europe, an aging population paves the way for strong growth in the Adult Care industry, while the higher birthrate in the Middle East and North Africa creates opportunities in Baby Care.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, Ontex acquired Grupo Mabe of Mexico, the second-largest Baby Care company in the country. This marks the first expansion of Ontex's branded products across the Atlantic, and is hoped to be the first of a series of acquisitions in the North and Latin American markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is also transitioning from an acquisition-led strategy (in the 90s-00s Ontex acquired iD Medica, Lille Healthcare, and Serenity) to a centrally-led strategy whereby it leverages its size and scale to increase cost efficiencies.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2015, Ontex acquired Grupo Mabe, the second-largest player in the Mexican baby care market. The Mexican personal care market is the fifth-largest in the world and represents a sizeable opportunity for the company, as well as providing a foothold in the coveted North American market.
