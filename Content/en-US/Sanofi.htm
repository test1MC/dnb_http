   Sanofi develops and manufactures prescription and over-the-counter drugs and vaccines for mankind and man's best friend. The company's pharmaceutical division is focused on diabetes, cardiovascular, and multiple sclerosis products, among others. Its biggest revenue generators include insulin brand Lantus and blood thinners Plavix and Lovenox. The company also operates vaccine maker
   <company id="161206">
    Sanofi Pasteur
   </company>
   and
   <company id="112833">
    Merial
   </company>
   , one of the world's largest animal health firms, which it is selling. The US is Sanofi's largest market, but it operates worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sanofi operates through three segments: pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and animal health. Its pharmaceutical segment is the largest, accounting for about 80% of total revenue. In addition to diabetes and its other primary areas, the company focuses on rare diseases (Gaucher, Fabry) and cancers. Sanofi also has one of the world's largest consumer health portfolios, which includes treatments for colds and allergies, pain, and heartburn.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's vaccines, produced through Sanofi Pasteur, generate about 15% of revenue and include immunizations against pertussis, flu, and meningitis, among other diseases.
  </p>

  <p>
   Although the US is Sanofi's largest market at some 35% of revenue, emerging markets as a group (including Latin American and Eastern Europe) contribute about a third.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has office locations, production sites, and other facilities in about 100 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sanofi's products are marketed primarily by its own sales force, but partnerships with pharma firms such as
   <company id="12239">
    Regeneron
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   also play an important role.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanofi's primary customers include wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, and hospitals. The top three worldwide wholesale customers account for a quarter of total revenue, with the top three US-based wholesale customers generating more than half of US pharmaceutical sales.

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company reported revenue of €37.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Although all three operating segments grew year-over-year, 65% of the increase is a result of strong performance in the pharmaceuticals segment. That growth was driven primarily by favorable exchange rates, with the Genzyme business (rare disease and MS products) performing strongly as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped slightly that year, falling 3% to €4.4 billion, as Sanofi invested in new products in the diabetes and cardiovascular areas, among others.

  <p>
   Sanofi's long-term strategy, through 2020, focuses on reshaping its portfolio, simplifying its organization, innovating in R&amp;D, and launching new products successfully.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 the company announced divested its smallest business segment, animal health products, to focus on its core pharmaceuticals and vaccines businesses. As part of the divestment, which took place as a business swap, Sanofi acquired the consumer health care operations of
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   ; this made Sanofi a global leader in an important area for the company. Other areas in which the company wants to enhance its portfolio include cancer, immunology, and multiple sclerosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to simplify its organization, Sanofi in 2016 reorganized into five business units: General Medicines &amp; Emerging Markets (established prescription products, generics, consumer healthcare, and all pharma operations in emerging markets); Specialty Care (rare disease, MS, cancer, and immunology products); and Diabetes &amp; Cardiovascular; as well as the vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur) and animal health products (Merial) businesses.

  <p>
   The Sanofi group got its start in 1973 when French oil conglomerate Elf Aquitaine (later part of
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   ) merged several health care, cosmetics, and animal nutrition companies into one subsidiary. In 1977 Sanofi set up a Japanese subsidiary, through which it developed joint ventures with Japan's
   <company id="56832">
    Meiji Seika Kaisha
   </company>
   and Taisha Pharmaceutical firms. In 1979 Elf spun off Sanofi, although it retained ownership of more than half of the company. Almost from its founding Sanofi grew through acquisitions and alliances. During the 1980s it used a massive war chest to buy stakes and set up joint ventures, such as one with American Home Products in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought
   <i>
    couturier et parfumier
   </i>
   Nina Ricci in 1988; such well-known fragrances as L'Air du Temps put it among the industry's top perfume houses. But Sanofi overreached the next two years and was outbid by American Home Products for AH Robins (the drug firm bankrupted by lawsuits over deaths from its Dalkon Shield IUD) and by Rhône-Poulenc (now part of
   <company id="41833">
    Aventis
   </company>
   ) for Rorer. A chastened Sanofi and
   <company id="10500">
    Kodak
   </company>
   subsidiary Sterling Drug in 1991 entered into an alliance that didn't involve an exchange of cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Sanofi made a splash when it bought the perfume business of fashion designer
   <company id="92633">
    Yves Saint-Laurent
   </company>
   . The next year it bought out much of the pharmaceutical joint venture with Kodak. Sanofi began divesting such noncore businesses as veterinarian and biotech operations in 1995. After suffering a loss in its perfume and beauty division in 1996, it sold Nina Ricci. The rest of its beauty division was sold in 1999 in preparation for the Synthélabo merger.
  </p>
  <p>
   Synthélabo was founded in 1970 when drug firms Laboratoires Dausse and Laboratoires Robert et Carriere merged. In 1973 it became a 53%-owned subsidiary of beauty products maker
   <company id="41772">
    L'Oréal
   </company>
   . In 1980 drug firm Metabio-Jouillie became a part of Synthélabo, making it the #3 drug company in France. In 1983 Synthélabo and US drugmaker Searle created Lorex to market the French firm's products in the UK. (Synthélabo bought Searle's interest 10 years later.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the 1980s Synthélabo acquired, merged, and formed joint ventures, including some in Japan with
   <company id="52314">
    Mitsubishi Chemical
   </company>
   , Fujisawa Pharmaceutical (1985), and Tanabe Seiyaku (1987). The company continued its acquisitive ways in the 1990s, buying several French rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Synthélabo openly admitted its quest for a large international presence in 1996, announcing it wanted 80% of its sales to come from such foreign markets as Asia and the US. That year the company entered an alliance with Genset to research cancer-causing genes; it also signed on with SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="16995">
    Human Genome Sciences
   </company>
   to fund genetic research. Synthélabo's Hungarian subsidiary began planning to make drugs for the first time, rather than just selling its parent's products as in the past. The next year Synthélabo bought Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn's German generic drug subsidiary Sanorania Pharma.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Synthélabo and Sanofi merged in 1999, the new company's concentration on pharmaceuticals dictated several changes, including the sale of the company's interests in joint venture Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics, as well as its beauty division, home to such well-known perfume lines as Yves Saint Laurent. It also sold its veterinary and animal feed division to what later became
   <company id="90775">
    BNP Paribas
   </company>
   .
