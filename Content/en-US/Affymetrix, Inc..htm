   Affymetrix detects the secrets of human genetics. Its GeneChip system and other products are used to identify, analyze, and manage genetic data and disease characteristics in the development of new treatments for infectious diseases, cancer, and other ailments. Affymetrix sells its products directly to drugmakers, academic research labs, and government agencies, primarily in North American and European markets. It also provides outsourced genotyping research services, and it has partnerships and licensing agreements with such pharmaceutical companies as

    BGI
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   to develop new disease diagnostics and instrumentation systems. In early 2016 Affymetrix was acquired by

   Affymetrix Core accounted for 73% of the company's 2014 revenue and consists of four businesses: Expression (GeneChip gene expression products and services, and the QuantiGene line of low-to-mid-plex RNA measurement products); Genetic Analysis and Clinical Applications (genotyping, such as the Axiom product line and arrays with clinical research applications including CytoScan cytogenetics arrays; Life Science Reagents (reagents, enzymes, purification kits and biochemicals used by life science researchers); and Corporate, which includes incidental revenue from royalties and field services.
  </p>
  <p>
   eBioscience, which accounted for 27% of Affymetrix's revenue in 2014, specializes in the development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of research tools for flow cytometry, microscopic imaging immunoassays, and other protein-based analyses.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than 2,300 Affymetrix systems have been shipped around the world and more than 94,500 peer-reviewed papers have been published using the company's proprietary technology. The company works with academic, government, and commercial researchers to develop and validate new applications of its technologies. Collaborators include the

   In some markets, such as Brazil, Mexico, India, the Middle East, and Asia/Pacific (including China), the company sells its products primarily through third-party distributors that specialize in life science supply.

   In 2014 the company's revenues increased by 6% to $349 million with strong contributions from the Genetic Analysis and Clinical Applications, Cytogenetics, and OncoScan products. The company reduced its net loss in 2014 to $3.8 million from the $16.3 million loss posted in 2013 because of lower interest expenses and taxes. Cash flow from operations was $43 million in 2014 compared to $53 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Due to increasing competitive pressures, the company is working to re-engineer and strengthen its reagent technologies, and it plans to grow in the biomarker validation and routine testing markets (tests for clinical researchers and specialists for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of disease), as well as in the development of complex biological assays and related automated instruments. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies, which allow scientists to map a patient's entire genetic profile, is putting pressure on companies like Affymetrix, which primarily produce single-gene expression (biological function) and partial patient profile (genotyping, or genetic variation) tests, to expand and enhance their offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company introduced a new analysis software, Nexus Copy Number for Affymetrix. It is used specifically for data generated by Affymetrix's genetic analysis platforms in cancer research, including the CytoScan Cytogenetics Suite and the OncoScan FFPE Assay Kit. Also Affymetrix, with Leica Biosystems released Affymetrix' fully automated RNA in situ hybridization assays ViewRNATM eZ Assays on the Leica BOND RX staining platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Affymetrix has historically grown through acquisitions, it also relies on its partnerships with customers and even rivals to expand and improve its technology. In 2015 the company began a collaboration with Evergene, a subsidiary of MTI Ltd., in genetic research and personal genomics services in Japan. With the support of academic researchers and through this collaboration, Evergene plans to further expand its business in health care.

  <p>
   The company has also entered agreements with academic and commercial researchers to study and analyze wheat and salmon to enhance sustainable production.

   Affymetrix has filled in and expanded its product line through acquisitions, but in 2014 it remained on the acquisition sidelines.
