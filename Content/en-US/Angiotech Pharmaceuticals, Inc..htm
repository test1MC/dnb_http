   In early 2016 Surgical Specialties bought FSSB Chirurgische Nadein GMBH, a Germany-based maker of surgical needles. The companies said their combination created one of the largest manufacturers of surgical needles. FSSB has two manufacturing facilities in Germany. The deal expands the products and geographic markets of both parties. Terms were not disclosed.
