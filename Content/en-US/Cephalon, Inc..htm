   Cephalon has a handful of powerful specialty drugs. The company's research, development, manufacturing, and marketing activities focus on therapies for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, cancer, pain, and inflammatory disease. Its NUVIGIL and PROVIGIL drugs treat the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The company's other top sellers are cancer drug TREANDA, cancer pain medications ACTIQ and FENTORA, epilepsy treatment GABITRIL, and muscle relaxant AMRIX. Its eight major products are primarily sold in the US and Europe. Cephalon was acquired by top generic drugmaker
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
   </company>
   in 2011.

  <p>
   A senior research biologist with DuPont, Dr. Frank Baldino formed Cephalon in 1987 to research neural degeneration. The company raised $500 million in venture capital and went public in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cephalon in 1990 teamed with
   <company id="11326">
    Schering-Plough
   </company>
   to research Alzheimer's disease. By 1992 it had developed Myotrophin to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).
  </p>
  <p>
   With optimism running high for Myotrophin, Cephalon in 1992 bought a drug plant (sold 1996). The next year it joined with SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) to research neurodegenerative diseases. In 1995 the firm established a sales force. Word of promising Myotrophin trial results sent the stock soaring, but criticism of the trial brought it crashing back. A 1996 shareholder suit charging that Cephalon hid poor results was settled for $17 million in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, it bought rights to PROVIGIL from Group Lafon and shepherded it through the FDA approval process for the treatment of sleep disorder narcolepsy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the FDA rejected Myotrophin; Cephalon's research agreements with Schering-Plough and SmithKline Beecham ended too. The next year the FDA ruled Myotrophin "potentially approvable" and required more expensive trials. Better news came from Ireland and the UK, where PROVIGIL was approved for sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Cephalon won a research contract with Dutch drug maker
   <company id="147681">
    H Lundbeck
   </company>
   to research neurodegenerative diseases. Later that year Cephalon threw in the towel on Myotrophin, disappointing ALS victims who had been taking the drug in trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 PROVIGIL failed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in trials. Cephalon bounced back by boosting its pipeline with the purchase of pain drugmaker Anesta. The following year it bought Group Lafon to gain full control of PROVIGIL's marketing rights. Spooked by the on-the-sly partnerships that helped bring down
   <company id="10521">
    Enron
   </company>
   , Cephalon also acquired control of two joint ventures it had set up to market PROVIGIL and GABITRIL to avoid arousing suspicion among investors. It also bought back European rights to ACTIQ from
   <company id="47964">
    Elan
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Cephalon received approval from the FDA in 2004 to market PROVIGIL as a therapy for other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 2004 purchase of CIMA allowed Cephalon to develop new versions of its existing drugs using CIMA's delivery technologies. But the acquisition didn't come without costs -- in addition to the $515 million it paid for CIMA, Cephalon agreed to give
   <company id="11754">
    Barr Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   the right to license a generic version of ACTIQ to gain FDA approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cephalon acquired drugmaker
   <company id="134360">
    Zeneus Pharma
   </company>
   in late 2005. Zeneus added nearly 15 products to the company's portfolio, but more importantly Zeneus' 15 European operations greatly expanded Cephalon's presence across the pond. Also that year the company expanded its cancer pipeline with its purchase of
   <company id="132701">
    Salmedix
   </company>
   and of the TRISENOX franchise from Cell Therapeutics (later renamed
   <company id="53036">
    CTI Biopharma
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 lead drug candidate FENTORA (the next-generation version of ACTIQ) was approved for cancer pain. Sales of ACTIQ were cut in half in 2007 due to generic competition; however, the company took up some of the slack through increased sales of FENTORA and the launch of its own generic version of ACTIQ.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company sent a warning letter to doctors about several deaths related to FENTORA, which Cephalon primarily attributed to inappropriate prescribing of the drug. The FDA later issued a health advisory urging the use of caution when prescribing FENTORA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the company's fentanyl drugs had not been approved for use in any context other than cancer pain, Cephalon fell under investigation for pushing ACTIQ for off-label uses; it reached settlement agreements with several government agencies over the charges in 2007 and 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired muscle relaxant AMRIX in 2007. One of Cephalon's treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, TREANDA, received approval from the FDA in 2008 and was successfully launched later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman, CEO, and founder Dr. Frank Baldino died in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to its 2011 acquisition by Teva, Cephalon had been spurning the advances of Canadian drugmaker
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , which had first offered $5.7 billion in early 2011. Cephalon rejected the bid as undervalued, but Valeant grew aggressive and vowed to replace Cephalon's board of directors to gain access to the company. When generic drug giant Teva's higher bid came along, Cephalon quickly and gratefully accepted the offer.
