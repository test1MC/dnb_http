  <p>
   The Finnish food company is aiming to increase the efficiency of beef and pork procurement and processing at its plant in Jyvaskyla to improve profitability and productivity. Overlapping functions in meat procurement and administration, resulting from the deal concluded between Atria and Saarioinen Oy, will be eliminated. Going forward, the Jyvaskyla plant will focus on bovine and pig slaughtering and cutting. Atria estimates the restructuring and efficiency improvements will generate annual cost savings of about €5 million ($6.8 million).
