   A special committee of Marvell's board completed its internal inquiry into stock option grants in 2007 and recommended a number of changes as a result. The inquiry found there were numerous instances of backdating for option grants and that internal controls were lax. CFO George Hervey resigned for his role in the options process, while co-founder Weili Dai stepped down as EVP/COO and as a director, taking a non-management position as director of strategic marketing and business development. Matthew Gloss, general counsel of the company's US subsidiary, was fired.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Marvell and Weili Dai received Wells notices from the staff of the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   , formal notifications that the staff intended to recommend civil enforcement actions against the company and Dai to the commission. The SEC staff did not recommend any enforcement actions against the company's top officers or its directors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-founder and CEO Sehat Sutardja was found by the board's special committee to be minimally culpable in the options shenanigans; he agreed to give up the post of chairman, while remaining on the board and continuing as the company's president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restated historical financial statements as a result of the inquiry and took a non-cash charge against earnings of $362 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Marvell acquired
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   's communications and application processor line for $600 million in cash. Marvell picked up processors that go into such popular electronic devices as the BlackBerry, the Q, and the Treo with the Intel transaction. The company will use the product line, based on Intel's third-generation Xscale technology, to design a new line of wireless and embedded processors, code-named Monahans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 Marvell acquired the printer chip business of Avago Technologies (renamed
   <company id="144560">
    Broadcom Limited
   </company>
   ) for nearly $250 million in cash. The company paid another $35 million for the Avago semiconductor line in earnouts over two years. Avago is the former semiconductor business of
   <company id="60896">
    Agilent Technologies
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   In 2005 Marvell acquired the hard drive and tape drive controller semiconductor products of
   <company id="43824">
    QLogic
   </company>
   for about $242 million in cash and stock. Marvell paid $184 million in cash and issued nearly 1 million shares of its common stock to QLogic in exchange for the semiconductor business, then paid another $12 million one year later, held in escrow.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon after buying the QLogic semiconductor lines, Marvell agreed to acquire the assets of
   <company id="59791">
    UTStarcom
   </company>
   's System-on-Chip semiconductor business for $40 million in cash. UTStarcom's semiconductor design business develops chips for wireless communications, including the so-called third generation (3G) of wireless phone services and Personal Handyphone System features for the Japanese cell phone market and other Asian markets. The transaction closed in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marvell expanded its product line with its purchase of communications chip maker
   <company id="55110">
    Galileo Technology
   </company>
   in 2001. In 2003 Marvell acquired Radlan Computer Communications, a maker of networking software, for about $50 million.
