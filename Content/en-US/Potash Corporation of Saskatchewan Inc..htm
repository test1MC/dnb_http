   The Bigfoot of Saskatchewan is Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, the world's leading producer of potash, commonly used as fertilizer. Potash Corp. also produces nitrogen (used in fertilizer and industrial and consumer products) and phosphate (for feed products, food products, and detergents). Its annual production capacity of more than 13 million tons of potash represents more than 20% of the world's capacity. Potash Corp. also sells these minerals as phosphate feed ingredients for animal nutrition and as nitrogen products for the industrial chemicals market. It has about 20 plants. In 2015 the company withdrew a $8.7 billion bid to buy rival

   , but in 2016 entered into talks to merge with

   .

   The company operates through three business segments: Potash (mining and processing of potash); Nitrogen (nitrogen fertilizers and nitrogen chemicals for agricultural, industrial and animal nutrition purposes); and Phosphate (mining phosphate ore and manufacturing phosphoric acid, solid and liquid fertilizers, animal feed supplements, purified phosphoric acid, hydrofluosilicic acid, and silicon tetrafluoride).

  <p>
   The company's net revenues have been decreasing since 2011. In 2014, Potash Corp.'s net revenue declined by 3% due to decrease in Phosphate segment revenues as a result the closure of Suwannee River chemical facility and weather-related production issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed a similar trend. In 2014 the company's net income decreased by 14% due to lower revenues and higher finance costs, as a result of lower capitalized interest due to reduced capital spending.
  </p>

   The company's operating cash inflow decreased by 19%.

  <p>
   Potash Corp. focuses on maximizing its long-term growth potential and value by prioritizing opportunities (particularly in potash) and creating sustainable competitive positions in each nutrient by optimizing cost structure and investing in high-return opportunities that capital costs.

   Trying to extend that big foot worldwide, Potash spent the 2000s building up its investments in fertilizer businesses around the globe. It has interests in specialty fertilizer company

   . The company's strategy is focused on developing its potash business, making sure its production is matched to market demand. It also believes that its phosphate and nitrogen business provides customers with a full spectrum of fertilizer products and protects the company from market fluctuations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of waning demand for potash, the company planned to shut down production at a mine in Saskatchewan for about a month. The move would slash production by 150,000-160,000 metric tons. (The company produced  9.5 - 9.7 million metric tons of potash in 2011.) The shutdown followed two other temporary closures by the company in 2011 because of weakened demand for fertilizer products and lower food commodity prices.

  <p>
   Australian mining giant

    BHP Billiton
   </company>
   made a $40 billion hostile takeover offer for Potash in 2010. Potash's board rejected the $130-a-share offer, saying BHP Billiton's unsolicited bid failed to reflect the company's true value. BHP Billiton then took its offer directly to Potash shareholders. Potash subsequently filed suit in US federal court to block the takeover. In the meantime, Canadian regulators rejected the proposed buyout as anti-competitive, causing BHP Billiton to withdraw its offer.
