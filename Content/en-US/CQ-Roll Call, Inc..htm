   CQ-Roll Call examines the issues on the Hill, but leaves the yea- and nay-saying to its readers. The company publishes the nonpartisan newspaper
   <em>
    Roll Call
   </em>
   , which covers a variety of Congressional topics, including policy making, legislation voting, elections, and investigations. The publication is written for lawmakers, lobbyists, and others in DC politics; it also covers lighter topics such as DC area entertainment, features on lawmakers, and even the Capitol Hill softball league. Other CQ-Roll Call titles include
   <em>
    CQ
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Gallery Watch
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    CongressNow
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Capitol Advantage.
   </em>
   Founded as Roll Call in 1955 by former Capitol Hill press secretary Sid Yudain, today CQ-Roll Call is owned by
   <company id="56126">
    The Economist Group
   </company>
   .
