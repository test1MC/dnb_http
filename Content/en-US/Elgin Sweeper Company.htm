   <company id="10556">
    Federal Signal
   </company>
   , Elgin Sweeper makes street sweepers, including broom, air, and specialty sweepers marketed under brands like Road Wizard, Broom Bear, and Crosswind. Elgin also makes sweepers that run on alternative fuels (compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas). Besides streets, the vehicles are used to clear debris from airport runways, industrial plants, and construction sites. Elgin Sweeper is a part of Federal Signal's Environmental Solutions segment.

   Elgin is a part of
   <company id="10556">
    Federal Signal
   </company>
   's Environmental Solutions segment. It sells primarily to municipalities and other government entities who use its sweeping technologies-mechanical, pure vacuum, regenerative air, alternative fuel, and waterless dust control. Products are applied in municipal applications like street sweeping and leaf removal. Industrial applications include sweeping for cement and power plants, and other uses include airport ground and race track maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to help its customers deal with budget constraints, Elgin has introduced a sweeper rebuild program. Rather than buying a new sweeper, clients can opt to have the vehicle rebuilt by dealership technicians. The company is also providing online training for dealership technicians.

  <p>
   Elgin sells its products to more than 100 dealers across North America and through a direct salesforce. Its direct sales channel concentrates on the industrial, utility, construction, and ground maintenance markets while the dealer networks focus primarily on the municipal markets.

   Federal Signal's Environmental Solutions segment generated 56% of its parent's total revenue in 2013. Net sales increased by $46.2 million (or 11%) driven by a growth in demand in the US, Canada, and the Middle East, partially offset by lower sales of vacuum trucks in the Asia Pacific region.

  <p>
   New product introductions are a key part of Elgin's growth strategy. In 2014 it launched a consolidated platform on the Eagle mechanical broom sweeper that incorporates the best features, systems and components of the Eagle, Broom Bear® and Road Wizard® sweepers that make up the company's four-wheel mechanical sweeper line. In 2013 the company introduced a modified Crosswind® Specialty Track Sweeper which plays a supporting role in a new racetrack drying initiative that uses a combination of air power and vacuum suction to dry rain-soaked racetracks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Elgin entered into a marketing agreement with Challenger Manufacturing to market and distribute a mechanical broom sweeper under the Elgin Sweeper brand name in order to extend its street sweeper product offering in North America and provide its municipal and contractor customers with more options.
