   Morningstar offers a smorgasbord of financial information to individual, professional, and institutional investors via Internet, software, and print-based products. The company provides data on some 375,000 investment products, including stocks and mutual funds. It also provides real-time global market data on more than 8 million equities, indexes, futures, options, and commodities. Its Morningstar Style Box, which provides a visual summary of a mutual fund's underlying investment style, and Morningstar Ratings, which rate past performance based on risk- and cost-adjusted returns, have become fixtures on the investment landscape. Company founder Joe Mansueto owns about 50% of Morningstar.

  <p>
   Morningstar has operations in about 25 countries. About 60% of the company's international revenue is from Europe and the UK. Australia and Canada also contribute heavily to Morningstar's annual revenue.

   The company earns the majority of its revenues through subscriptions, license agreements, advertising on its websites, and asset-based fees.

  <p>
   Morningstar's revenue was $760 million in fiscal 2014. That was an increase of 9% compared to the previous fiscal period. However, even with the spike in revenue, the company net income of $78.3 million in fiscal 2014 was a decrease of 37% compared to its fiscal 2013 net income. The drop in net income was caused by increased operating expenses. A decrease in accounts receivable during fiscal 2014 led to a $132 million decrease in cash on hand from operating activities compared to fiscal 2013 levels.

   Morningstar works to keep its data accurate and real-time. Historically, the company used acquisitions to expand its products' functionality, sell more subscriptions, and reach new market segments.

  <p>
   Joseph Mansueto founded Morningstar in 1984, using a line borrowed from Thoreau's
   <i>
    Walden
   </i>
   ("The sun is but a morning star"). Armed with an MBA and experience culled from a stint as a securities analyst for Harris Associates, Mansueto published
   <i>
    Mutual Fund Sourcebook,
   </i>
   a tome outlining performance histories and other information on 400 stock mutual funds. The boom in mutual funds during the early 1980s spurred interest in Morningstar's product and prompted the company to add a second publication,
   <i>
    Morningstar Mutual Funds,
   </i>
   two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 1994 acquisition of MarketBase helped the firm add stock information to its coverage. A 5% staff cut in 1996 and the cessation of some of its publications helped reverse Morningstar's sagging fortunes. It took to cyberspace the following year when it launched Morningstar.net (now Morningstar.com). That year the company partnered with Japanese digital dynamo SOFTBANK to create Morningstar Japan and present financial information to investors in that country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Don Phillips, who had joined Morningstar as its first analyst in 1986, was appointed CEO in 1998. The company began offering a subscription-based premium service feature for its website to provide users with expanded financial coverage. In 1999 Morningstar extended its reach, partnering with FPG Research to offer financial information to residents of Australia and New Zealand. Later that year SOFTBANK invested $91 million in Morningstar.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Morningstar established website MorningstarAdvisor.com, relaunched its flagship site with additional information and tools, and opened offices in Hong Kong, South Korea, and the UK. Founder and chairman Joe Mansueto also assumed the role of CEO in 2000 and made Phillips a managing director of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year the company launched its website in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. Morningstar added Australian financial publisher Aspect Huntley to its stable in 2006. It paid nearly $23 million for the provider of equity information, research, and financial trade publishing in order to expand outside the US. In 2007 Morningstar paid some $58 million for the mutual fund data business from

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A significant acquisition for Morningstar was the 2008 purchase of
   <company id="59717">
    10-K Wizard
   </company>
   , an electronic provider of
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   filing documents, for $12.5 million. The purchase bolstered Morningstar's research capabilities and aids in the company's goal of providing greater transparency to equity investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other 2008 purchases included London market data firm Tenfore Systems for £13.5 million ($20.9 million). Tenfore provides information on stocks, commodities, derivatives, and other investments, and the deal allows Morningstar to bundle real-time data such as stock prices with its research. The company purchased Fundamental Data Limited, a provider of data on closed-end funds in the UK, for some £11 million (approximately $19 million), as well as the

   </company>
   data, media, and investor relations website businesses from
   <company id="102208">
    Ipreo
   </company>
   for about $52 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisitive Morningstar entered a new distribution channel in 2009 with the nearly $52 million buy of
   <company id="126921">
    Logical Information Machines
   </company>
   , a provider of market pricing data and data management services to the agricultural, energy, and financial sectors. The Logical Information Machines acquisition complements and expands many of the services already provided by Morningstar, including data and software management.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 the company grew its investment management business with the acquisition of Intech Pty Ltd. Now doing business as Ibbotson Associates, the subsidiary provides multi-manager and investment portfolio solutions in Sydney, Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Morningstar acquired Realpoint, a statistical ratings organization that specializes in structured finance, for some $52 million in cash and stock. Morningstar made the deal to build on its recent entry into corporate credit ratings. (In 2011 it rebranded Realpoint under the Morningstar name.)
  </p>
  <p>
   International acquisitions in 2010 included Old Broad Street Research, a provider of fund research, ratings, and investment consulting services in the UK, for about £12 million (or approximately $18 million). Also in 2010 it purchased Seeds Group, a provider of investment consulting services and fund research in France. The company launched local language versions of Morningstar Direct in Spain, France, and Germany in 2010, adding to existing versions in China and Italy.
