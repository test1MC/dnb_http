   LDH (La Doria) is all things
   <em>
    pomodoro
   </em>
   to the UK market. The company sells a slew of canned tomato products -- in whole, chopped, and pureed forms, or as prepared sauces. LDH also offers canned pulses (legumes); dried pasta; canned fruits and fruit beverages; canned vegetables; canned fish (salmon and tuna); baking chocolate, and other food products. The company's lineup is sold under private labels and, less so, its namesake and industry brands, including La Doria, Heinz, John West, and Bonduelle. Customers are UK-based food retailers, such as
   <company id="40427">
    J Sainsbury
   </company>
   and
   <company id="90426">
    Tesco
   </company>
   , and some food service operators and manufacturers. LDH (La Doria) is a subsidiary of
   <company id="99221">

   </company>
   , which owns 51% of its business;
   <company id="134940">

   owns 20%.

   LDH (La Doria) has sought to expand beyond tomato-based products into the seafood sector as well as enter the growing domestic pet food market in the UK. It owns Oriental &amp; Pacific Frozen Food Company, a UK-based frozen food wholesaler, and produces frozen shrimp, ready-made meals, and canned tuna, in addition to pet food. Other LDH (La Doria)'s operations include Manpineco Ltd., a subsidiary established to import canned pineapple from Thailand. In addition, the parent company is focusing on introducing a variety of added-value offerings, such as enriched baked beans and minestrone soup, and a redesigned, more convenient packaging.
