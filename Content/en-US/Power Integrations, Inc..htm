   Power Integrations develops high-voltage analog integrated circuits (ICs) that convert alternating current (AC) to lower-voltage direct current (DC). The fabless company's high-voltage analog semiconductors, which account for virtually all of its sales, are used in PCs, cell phones, cable boxes, and other consumer and industrial electronics. The TOPSwitch line features products made with its environmentally friendly EcoSmart technology, which reduces energy waste. Power Integrations sells its chips to electronics manufacturers and distributors such as
   <company id="175522">
    ATM Electronic
   </company>
   and Burnon. It makes nearly all of its sales overseas.

  <p>
   The fabless manufacturing model allows Power Integrations to focus on engineering and design and still have access to high-volume manufacturing capacity, while not having to maintain a silicon foundry. Power Integrations relies on four Japanese and German contract manufacturers to fabricate its chips: ROHM Lapis Semiconductor,

   ,
   <company id="116590">
    X-FAB Dresden
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="107617">
    Renesas Technology
   </company>
   . Its products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

  <p>
   Asia is Power Integrations' largest market, representing nearly 85% of sales (China and Hong Kong, the company's fastest-growing market, contribute nearly 40% of overall revenue). Europe and North America account for about 13% and 5% of sales, respectively.

  <p>
   About 75% of the company's sales are made to distributors such as
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   (which accounted for more than 10% of revenue) and ATM Electronic, while the rest come from original equipment manufacturers and merchant power supply manufacturers. Power Integrations has sales offices in 12 countries -- China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   Revenue was essentially flat from 2013 to 2014, rising just 0.49% to $348.8 million. Growth in the consumer, industrial, and computer markets was driven by higher unit sales for a range of applications including consumer appliances, industrial motor drives, and desktop computers. Revenue from the communications market fell because of lower unit sales for residential-networking applications and cellphone chargers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income for 2014 rose about 4% to $59 million 30% to $34 million on the slight revenue gain as well as interest income and income tax benefits.

  <p>
   Energy-efficiency is the driving factor in developing new power management chips, and Power Integrations has sold nearly 4 billion EcoSmart chips since they were introduced in 1998. The company has since introduced three more product lines that interrupt the power supply when electronics are turned off: CAPZero, LinkZero, and SENZero.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its new InnoSwitch product family, introduced in 2014, Power Integrations is looking for a bigger share of the power supply market with a smaller footprint. InnoSwitch ICs integrate circuitry on both the high- and low-voltage sides of the circuit board. This means smaller, simpler, more energy-efficient designs.

  <p>
   In 2015 Power Integrations acquired Cambridge Semiconductor, a UK-based supplier of controller chips for AC-DC power supplies, for $23 million. The acquisition is to help Power Intregrations accelerate product development for the low-power market. The acquisition also broadens the company's technology and product portfolio for low-power applications, particularly in the mobility and LED lighting markets.

  <p>
   At the end of 2007 Power Integrations acquired Potentia Semiconductor, a Canadian developer of controller chips for high-power AC-DC power supplies. The company paid about $5.5 million in cash for Potentia.

   In another example of the widening corporate scandals on options backdating, where executives and board members have skirted US regulations on the timing and purchasing of stock-option grants, Power Integrations reported in 2006 that its board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to investigate company practices related to stock-option grants to executives and board members. Chairman Howard Earhart, a former CEO of Power Integrations, and CFO John Cobb resigned. The board soon after named Steven Sharp as non-executive chairman to succeed Earhart. Power Integrations later restated financial results for 2001 through 2004, and for the first three quarters of 2005.

   The

   's staff notified the company in 2007 that the commission's investigation into its past practices in granting stock options ended, without any enforcement action recommended against Power Integrations. The company still faces a probe by the
