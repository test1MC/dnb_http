   subsidiary Gulfstream Aerospace is flying high as one of the world's leading manufacturers of business jet aircraft. The company's fleet consists of eight types of aircraft at varying price and performance levels, ranging from the smallest plane, the eight-seat G150, to the newest and largest, the 18-seat G650. It also provides aircraft sales services for those looking to buy or trade in a pre-owned Gulfstream aircraft through its Gulfstream Pre-Owned Aircraft Sales unit. In addition, Gulfstream offers maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services to its customers through a network of about a dozen company-owned service centers worldwide.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Savannah, Georgia, Gulfstream operates in 12 locations spanning Georgia, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Nevada, Florida, California, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, and Beijing. Additionally, it has over 30 service centers worldwide.

  <p>
   Private companies and individual customers together account for approximately two-thirds of Gulfstream's total orders. Among companies, Gulfstream routinely markets its business jets to growing international corporations that need frequent and fast transportation. It also provides aircraft for the government and military sectors, which use the planes to transport heads of state and engage in special missions, such as aerial reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, weather research, and astronaut training.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company's revenue increased 7% to $8.7 billion, due to an increase in deliveries of large-cabin aircrafts along with a rise in number of aircraft in service and the resulting increased demand for maintenance work.

   Gulfstream extends its geographical footprint with the opening of new facilities in key markets. In 2014 the company opened a 5,000 sq. ft. parts and materials distribution center near Los Angeles, further expanding its service and support network. The center located at Van Nuys Airport serves customers in the western US and Canada, minimizing shipping costs and delivery time.

  <p>
   The company in addition opened an Asia Customer Support Contact Center in Hong Kong, with an initial focus on over-the-counter sales and warranty support. The center is located near Hong Kong International Airport, as it is the central location for the Asia.
  </p>

   Also in 2014 the company opened a new sales and design center in Long Beach, California, providing customers an option to personalize their aircraft's interior and paint.

   In 1958 military aircraft maker Grumman introduced the Gulfstream I, the first jet designed for business use. The Gulfstream II (introduced seven years later) flew at commercial jet speed and carried up to 16 passengers plus crew; the company received 256 orders worldwide. (

   later used a modified fleet of Gulfstream II jets for Space Shuttle training.) The popularity of business jets accelerated, and companies such as Canadair (now
   <company id="42381">
    Bombardier
   </company>
   ) and France's Dassault-Breguet began crowding the market skies. Getting serious itself, Grumman dedicated a corporate plane assembly plant in Savannah, Georgia, in the late 1960s.

  <p>
   Business stalled in the recessional late 1970s, prompting Grumman (now part of
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop Grumman
   </company>
   ) to sell off operations and focus on its core military aircraft operations. Ex-TWA mechanic Allen Paulson, then head of a company that converted planes into propjets, bought the Gulfstream plants and offices in 1978 for $52 million and formed Gulfstream Aerospace.
