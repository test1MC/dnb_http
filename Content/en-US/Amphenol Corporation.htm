   Amphenol considers the industry to be highly fragmented, so it looks to acquire companies that help it fill in its product lines. Likely candidates are high growth businesses that can augment Amphenol's product portfolio, customer base, or geographic reach. In 2015, the company spent about $200 million for three acquisitions in the automotive, military, commercial aerospace, and industrial markets. Over the past five years or so the company has put more than $1 billion into acquisitions.

  <p>
   Besides spending to acquire differentiating products, Amphenol increased R&amp;D spending by $10 million to $125 million in 2015 from $115 million in 2014.

   Amphenol was founded in 1932 as The American Phenolic Corporation by Arthur J. Schmitt, who wanted to mass produce vacuum tube sockets used in making radios. He discovered that insulating plastic could produce tube sockets in a faster and easier method that using Bakelite or ceramic. The company's first customer was

    RCA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During World War II Amphenol's 5015 AN series connector becomes known as the "Amphenol Connector" by military maintenance crews. (The B-29 Super Fortress contains more than 1,600 Amphenol connectors.) The company's Sidney, New York facility was designated a site of national importance and was defended from air strikes.
  </p>
  <p>
   As telephone networks expanded Amphenol invented the Amphenol blue ribbon cable, which became the standard for Bell.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amphenol has grown its business with select acquisitions, including the industrial/avionics connector business of

    PCD
   </company>
   and the custom connector assembly business of
   <company id="16999">
    Insilco Holding
   </company>
   . In 2005 it purchased
   <company id="11456">

  <p>
   Amphenol's plant in Sidney, New York, was damaged in sudden and severe flooding in mid-2006. Flood-related losses beyond insurance coverage reached almost $21 million. Amphenol's management and employees worked 12-hour shifts for three weeks to clean up and restore the manufacturing facility, which serves the aerospace and industrial markets.
