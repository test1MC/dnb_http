   Feedback has gained a new image in medical imaging. With the acquisitions of Cambridge Computed Imaging (CCI) and TexRad, the company has refocused from technical training tools to provide medical practitioners and researchers with medical imaging tools. Its products are used by research institutions and medical centers around the world. Some 70% of Feedback's sales are to customers in the UK. To make way for the imaging business, Feedback sold interest in some of its previous pursuits.

  <p>
   In 2014, Feeback bought CCI and TexRad and shifted to medical imaging as it core business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CadRan product from CCI allows clinicians to display, review and manipulate images using in-line measurement and analysis tools to assist diagnosis and quantify treatment response.
  </p>
  <p>
   TexRad instruments provide for stratification of clinical diagnostic images for prognosis, risk, and treatment. TexRAD analyzes the textures in radiological scans and has the potential to assist clinicians in assessing the prognosis of patients with cancer. It has been used retrospectively on a wide range of conditions including colorectal, breast, lung, prostrate, esophageal, head and neck, and renal cancers.
