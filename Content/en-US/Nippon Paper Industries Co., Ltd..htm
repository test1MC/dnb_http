  <p>
   After peaking at $13.2 billion in revenue for 2011, Nippon Paper saw its revenues decrease in both 2012 and 2013. It also suffered a net loss of more than $500 million in 2012 due to climate disasters across Asia; however, it posted positive net income of $113 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the last two years the company's cash flow has also decreased due to additional investments for the purchases of property, plant, and equipment, and increased financing activities related to the the repayment of interest-bearing debt.

  <p>
   Nippon Paper' strategy is to enhance the profitability of its core paper business, while also becoming more of a biomass-focused company that makes use of trees and wood in other fields, such as building materials, chemicals, and energy. Overseas, it is implementing measures to increase profits in Australia, deepening ties with partners like

   . Jujo Thermal Oy is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Paper, who expects to recognize synergies through close collaboration in the areas of sales, marketing, production, and R&amp;D.
