   Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative (SMBSC) offers a sweet deal to its approximately 585 member/farmers. The co-op slices about 3 million tons of Minnesota-grown sugar beets annually. Converted products include baker's sugar and fruit sugar, as well as molasses, beet pulp pellets and shreds, and raffinate (liquid from desugaring molasses). The co-op also provides member services, such as seed, agronomy research, farm support products, and workers' compensation insurance. SMBSC's refined and liquid sugars are marketed through

   The beet sugar processor's operations consist of a main factory with an annual processing capacity of about 3 million tons of harvested sugar beets. The factory campus comprises settling ponds, water-holding lagoons, receiving strips, off-site receiving stations, and 1,100 acres of land, some of which is planted with grass and irrigated with waste water from the ponds and treatment plant. In addition, the co-op has several silos to hold bulk granulated sugar, a warehouse to store industrial-size bags of sugar, and more than a dozen thick-juice storage tanks. Campus expansions since the factory's start in 1975 have included a molasses desugarization facility, increases to processing capacity, and new equipment.

   The co-op has grown both through investments in added capacity to attract new member/farmers and acquisitions. Acquired in 2005, subsidiary Spreckels Sugar Company operates a beet sugar factory in Brawley, California. Sugar, produced under the Spreckels Sugar brand, is sold to markets in the western US. Based in Sheridan, Wyoming, SMBSC's Holly Seed, a former subsidiary of
