   Cytokinetics studies the cytoskeleton to get to the heart of the problem. The biopharmaceutical firm's drug development technologies aim to treat disease by modulating muscle function through manipulation of the cytoskeleton (biological infrastructure of cells). Its pipeline includes lead candidate omecamtiv mecarbil, which is designed for the treatment of heart failure based on a cytoskeletal protein in the heart muscle. It is being developed in collaboration with
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   . Its other lead candidate, tirasemtiv, is in clinical studies for use by patients with ALS. In collaboration with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas
   </company>
   , Cykokinetics is also studying developing CK-2127107 for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

  <p>
   The company has exclusive global licensing rights to develop and commercialize CK-2127107.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cytokinetics also conducts research into muscle biology and has identified compounds that inhibit or activate smooth and skeletal muscle cells that might lead to treatments for high blood pressure, bronchoconstriction, and diseases related to skeletal muscle deficits. Through previous research Cytokinetics developed cancer drug candidates which it has licensed out to third parties for further development.

  <p>
   Cytokinetics primarily operates on R&amp;D and licensing earnings from partners and grants, which have led to significant growth over the past five years. In 2014 revenue increased 53% to $47 million due to R&amp;D revenue from Amgen, Astellas, and with newcomer MyoKardia (which is focused on genetic heart disease). Growing licensing revenues from Astellas also contributed to the rise in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a biopharmaceutical development firm, Cytokinetics has incurred losses every year since its 1997 founding, and it expects to continue incurring losses for several more years as it continues R&amp;D efforts, seeks regulatory approvals, and work towards commercializing approved drugs. However, with the growth in revenue in 2014, its net loss for the year dropped 57% to $15 million (versus $33.7 million in 2013). By the end of 2014, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $497.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 481% to $45 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in cash paid to related parties.

  <p>
   The company's strategy is to focus on drug discovery and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function, leveraging its cytoskeletal expertise and proprietary technologies while engaging in strategic alliances to support its drug development programs. It primarily seeks to develop and discover treatments for disease areas that have seriously unmet medical needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, Cytokinetics and Astellas expanded their partnership to explore skeletal muscle activators, including CK-2127107 for the treatment of SMA and other possible indications.
