   Vicor makes converters that tame and transfer raw electricity into the stable DC voltages needed to power electronic circuits. The company's zero current and zero voltage switching technologies, which allow its converters to operate at high frequencies with relatively little noise, are designed to be mounted on a printed circuit board. Customers -- including global OEMs and small manufacturers of specialized electronics devices -- incorporate the converters into all sorts of electronic equipment, ranging from fiber-optic systems to military radar. Vicor derives some 40% of its sales from customers in the US.

  <p>
   Vicor has domestic locations in California, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Texas. International locations reside in China, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Japan, and the UK. International sales in 2014 accounted for 60% of revenue, while revenues from customers in Hong Kong and China accounted for 20% and 12%, respectively.

  <p>
   Vicor's segment strategy within its Brick Business Unit (BBU) is to provide modular power converters (called "bricks") that can be used to configure a power system that meets specific customer requirements. The company has supplemented this strategy by manufacturing configurable power supplies and turnkey custom AC-DC and DC-DC power conversion products for its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its V*I Chip subsidiary designs and manufactures Vicor's next generation of component-level power converters, a line of products based on the company's Factorized Power Architecture (FPA). The V*I Chips and the FPA are designed to provide greater efficiency and better performance at a lower cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another subsidiary, Picor Corporation, designs and markets integrated circuits and related products used in power management applications. Picor's products are used in or in conjunction with Vicor's other products, as well as sold as stand-alone products for other applications.

  <p>
   The company's products are sold worldwide to customers ranging from smaller, independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices to larger original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their contract manufacturers. In 2014 NuPower Electronic accounted for 15% of the company's sales.

   Vicor is attempting to bounce back after posting two years of revenue declines (during 2012 and 2013) and three straight years of net losses (2012 through 2014). Revenues climbed 13% from $199 million in 2013 to $226 million in 2014. Vicor experienced negative operating cash flow of roughly $5 million during 2013; however, it posted positive cash flow of $2 million the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2014 was driven by an 11% increase in bookings and a 13% spike in BBU segment revenues (primarily attributed to additional customers in China). The company was also helped by increased Vicor Custom Power, Westcor, and VJCL revenues, and a 49% rise in Picor segment revenue was primarily due to increase in Picor bookings and shipments in 2014.

   Vicor extends its geographic reach through the opening of offices in select markets and by constantly streamlining its sales and operating network. During 2013, the company established a sales office in Seoul, South Korea, and redirected resources from its location in Paris, France, to its technical support centers in Munich and Milan. The company also in 2013 expanded its sales and support network in India via a partnership with sales representative CoreEL Technologies and the opening of a Vicor technical support center in Bangalore. In 2014 it opened a new technical support center in Taiwan.

   Inspired by an incident in the 1970s -- his hi-fi system blew up -- Italian physicist Patrizio Vinciarelli left his

   fellowship in 1980 to experiment with power-supply technology. Borrowing $500,000 from friends and their families, he founded Vicor in 1981. By 1982 he developed the basic technology that the company's products are based on. Vicor shipped its first product in 1985 and was profitable by 1987. Early customers included
