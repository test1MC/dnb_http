  <p>
   The company operates through three businesses: Mountaire Farms of Delmarva, Mountaire Farms of Delaware, and Mountaire Farms of North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mountaire Farms of Delmarva, established in 1977 as H &amp; H Poultry located in Shelbyville, Delaware, has processing feedmill and hatchery operations in Maryland and Delaware. It produces high-quality retail, wholesale, and export chicken products. Delmarva Peninsula's contract growers produce the live chickens for the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Established in 2000 when Mountaire acquired the assets of Townsends Poultry in Millsboro, Delaware, Mountaire Farms of Delaware boasts four grain elevators in Delaware and Maryland, a processing plant, a hatchery, and a feedmill. The business is situated on some 2,000 acres near Millsboro. The Mountaire unit sources its live chickens from Delmarva Peninsula contract growers. In 2012 the company constructed a Resource Recovery Plant at the site and supplemented its operations by acquiring Gavilon Grain in Townsend, Delaware, in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Mountaire Farms of North Carolina is the resulting entity from Mountaire's acquisition of Lumber Bridge, North Carolina's Piedmont Poultry in 1996. The operation consists of a new feedmill in Candor, North Carolina, a hatchery near Siler City, North Carolina, and processing plants in Lumber Bridge. Besides high-quality retail, wholesale, and export products, the processing division produces value-added items the likes of pre-marinated boneless skinless chicken fillets, marinated roasters, and Sizzlin' Sensation Meal Kits for sale in retail supermarkets. Mountaire's freezer and warehouse facility in North Carolina, which has the ability to freeze more than 1 million pounds of chicken and chicken products, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the food industry.

   Mountaire partners with companies in several sectors, such as retail private label, wholesale products, Asian food service, international, and food service.

   The company's Mountaire Farms subsidiary was looking to purchase Allen Family Foods, which filed for bankruptcy protection. The deal included the poultry company's inventory, hatcheries, feed mill, breeder operations, rendering operations, and production assets. Outside its home state of Delaware, Allen Family Foods boasted operations in Maryland and North Carolina. It listed both assets and debt between $50 million and $100 million in its bankruptcy filing. It was sold, however, in 2011 to a unit of meat processor South Korea-based Harim Corporation for $48 million.
