   Just about every office -- from home to big business -- has two basic items: a computer and printer. That's pretty much the business of HP Inc., one of two companies created from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard Co. HP makes most of its revenue from personal systems (notebook computers and desktops as well as tablets and point-of-sale systems) and about 40% from printers (including large format commercial printers) and supplies such as ink. It's the No. 1 printer company and No. 1 maker of PCs for commercial use in the world (
   <company id="56726">
    Lenovo
   </company>
   is the No. 1 PC maker overall). About 40% of revenue comes from customers in the US. Even after the breakup, HP and sibling HP Enterprise (HPE) would rank in the Fortune 100.

  <p>
   HP Inc. reports that notebook computers are wits biggest revenue producer, generating 35% of the total. Sales of printer supplies such as ink account for a quarter of HP Inc.'s revenue, followed by desktop computers with 20%, and printers at 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company operates some of its own manufacturing, it outsources a significant portion of the work to third party companies.

  <p>
   Some 40% of HP Inc.'s revenue comes from sales to customers in the US. No other country generates more than 10% of revenue. The company has operations throughout the world with significant facilities in the US, Singapore, Malaysia, and Israel.

   As the successor to the former Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Inc.'s fiscal 2016 (ended October) revenue fell nearly 50% without the inclusion of the enterprise technology and software business that was spun off. However, looking at only the comparable business results, HP's 2016 sales fell just some 5% to about $48 billion from some $51 billion in 2015. One factor was the unfavorable currency exchange rates that affected many companies during the year. More specifically for HP Inc., consumer and commercial computer sales fell 5%, primarily with weak demand -- although there was an uptick in sales of commercial notebooks and PC services. Price pressure drove down average selling prices. Printing revenue fell 15% on weaker demand, the impact of the change in the supplies sales model, and pricing pressures. While unit volume of sales declined, the average selling price increased because of a shift to high-value printers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income's drop on the lower revenue took it to $2.5 billion in 2016 from $4.5 billion in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell to $3.2 billion in 2016 from $6.5 billion in 2015 because cash from discontinued operations was not included in the 2016 figure.

  <p>
   In 2015 Hewlett-Packard split into two companies. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise took the computer systems and software products and services for large corporate customers while HP Inc. took the PC and printer business. The reasoning behind the separation was that that the independent companies would be more nimble and responsive in developing products and services for their different markets. The 2016 fiscal year, which ended in October, was their first as separate companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although ink has been a cash cow for HP Inc. the company in 2016 made a significant change in its sales model for printer supplies, going from push to pull. Instead of stuffing the supply line with ink and toner, it changed to making ink and shipping it as demand occurred. At the same time, the company said it would end price promotions in favor of consistent pricing. HP Inc.'s supplies business has been under pressure from competitors prices and reduced printing by businesses and consumers. The company, however, has extended a proprietary ink from commercial use to the office. The ink is a special formula available only from HP Inc., which says is better, faster to print, and cheaper. It is used in the new PageWide and OfficeJet Pro printers. The company also began offering quick delivery of ink to offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   A printer area where HP Inc. is investing is 3D printing, for design and manufacturing applications. It is pumping about $65 million a year into a 3D printing research center in Spain and making other investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   While HP Inc. saw an uptick in PC sales in its fourth quarter, the long-term outlook for notebooks and desktops isn't bright as worldwide sales decrease, if somewhat slowly. In 2016, the company instituted a device-as-a-service program, designed to let customers rent computers and software, which HP Inc. controls from the cloud.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company started a restructuring in late 2016 that would include cutting some 4,000 jobs -- a bit less than 10% of its workforce. The cuts should save up to $300 million a year.

   HP Inc. sold its Customer Communications Management business to

   HP Inc. in September 2016 agreed to buy

   's printer business for $1.05 billion. HP gets Samsung's laser printer portfolio and thousands of patents for printing technologies as well as an increased presence in Asia. The deal particularly strengthens HP in combination printer-copier machines which helps it compete with companies such as

   and
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   in the enterprise and office markets. The companies expect the deal to close within a year.

   In related 2016 deals, HP Inc. bought David Vision Systems GmbH and David 3D Solutions, which make 3-D scanning technology.

   professor Frederick Terman (considered the founder of Silicon Valley), in 1938 engineers Bill Hewlett and David Packard started Hewlett-Packard (HP) in a garage in Palo Alto, California, with $538. Hewlett was the idea man, while Packard served as manager; the two were so low-key that the company's first official meeting ended with no decision on exactly what to manufacture. Finding good people took priority over finding something to sell. The first product ended up being an audio oscillator.

   Demand for HP's electronic testing equipment during WWII spurred sales growth from $34,000 in 1940 to nearly $1 million just three years later. HP went public in 1957. The company expanded beyond the US during 1959, establishing a marketing organization in Switzerland and a manufacturing plant in West Germany. HP entered the medical field in 1961 by acquiring Sanborn, and the analytical instrumentation business in 1965 with the purchase of F&amp;M Scientific. In 1969 Packard left the company to serve as deputy defense secretary under President Nixon for two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company pioneered personal computing with the world's first handheld scientific calculator in 1972. Under the leadership of John Young, the founders' chosen successor (named CEO in 1978), HP introduced its first PCs, the first desktop mainframe, and the LaserJet printer. Its initial PCs were known for their rugged build, tailored for factory operations. They were also more expensive than rival versions and, consequently, didn't enjoy strong sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1986 a five-year, $250 million R&amp;D project -- the company's largest at the time -- produced a family of HP computers based on the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture. Hewlett retired in 1987 (he died in 2001); sons of both Hewlett and Packard were named that year to the company's board of directors. HP became a leader in workstations with the 1989 purchase of market pioneer Apollo Computer, despite technology delays with the merger that resulted in the loss of nearly $750 million in new business.
