   's sales. Along with Arnott's biscuits made for Asia/Pacific and Australia, Pepperidge Farm is part of Campbell's Global Baking and Snacking unit. Founded in 1937, Pepperidge Farm now boasts a vast products portfolio that includes fresh bread and rolls, stuffing mix, ready-made croutons, and frozen puff pastry. The company sells its items in more than 45 countries worldwide through two of Campbell's business segments: North America Foodservice and International Simple Meals and Beverages.

   Like snack foods giant Snyder's-Lance, Pepperidge Farm enploys a Direct-Store-Delivery (DSD) system to get its product in front of customers. Leveraging a network of more than 3,500 independent distributors that operate 4,000-plus snack-products distribution routes, Pepperidge Farm makes its cookies and crackers available throughout the US and its bread, stuffing, and croutons east of the Rocky Mountains.

   During 2015 Campbell's second-largest business segment, Global Baking and Snacking, which Pepperidge Farm is part of, accounted for 29% of sales. Global Baking and Snacking sales decreased 3%, primarily due to the impact of an extra week during leap year. Otherwise, Pepperidge Farm sales increased due to gains in fresh bakery, and crackers and cookies, partially offset by declines in frozen products.

  <p>
   Parent company Campbell is voluntarily pushing for healthier products, particularly those marketed to children. Goldfish crackers, for example, are specifically called out by some regulators as too heavy in saturated fat and salt. To this end, Pepperidge Farm has eliminated the use of trans fat in the crackers, cut salt (in some options), eliminated artificial colors, and introduced a whole-wheat variety. Other health initiatives include a Baked Naturals Cracker, hailed as 60% to 65% less fat and a comparable serving of potato chips, and cut the salt in 80% of its breads. The company has also garnered approval by diet behemoth

   Pepperidge Farm, named for an ancient Pepperidge tree, was purchased by Campbell Soup in 1961. Under Campbell's direction, the Pepperidge Farm product portfolio has swelled from 58 products to about 600 items, and its sales from $32 million in 1961 to more than $2 billion (as a segment). The Pepperidge Farm name is among the top 2% of globally recognized brands.
