   Prowling over hard ground or snow, Arctic Cat offers drivers a
   <em>
    purrfect
   </em>
   ride. The company manufactures and markets about 30 types of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and about 60 snowmobile models. Its four-wheel recreational and utility ATVs and snowmobiles are marketed under the Arctic Cat name. Arctic Cat also supplies replacement parts, and Cat-branded protective clothing and riding gear to foster its drivers' experience and loyalty. The company produces and outsources parts to other vehicle OEMs, too. Products are sold through a network of independent dealers throughout North America and through representatives of dealers worldwide. The US accounts for roughly 60% of Arctic Cat's sales.

  <p>
   Arctic Cat has classified its business into three segments on the basis of its product lines: snowmobile (43% of net sales); ATV (41%); and parts, garments, and accessories (16%).

  <p>
   The company sells its products through independent dealers across the US and Canada, and it sells through distributors representing dealers in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other international markets. Yamaha accounted for 10% of its sales in 2015.

  <p>
   After achieving several straight years of steady growth, Arctic Cat saw its revenues dip 4% from $730 million in 2014 to $699 million in 2015. The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by a 15% drop in ATV segment sales as the company lowered its core ATV inventory of its North America dealers. The parts, garments, and accessories segment also observed a marginal decline of 1%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits nosedived by 88% from $39 million in 2014 to almost $5 million in 2015 over that same time period due to a surge in expenses related to legal costs and increased ATV dealer show expenses. The company's cash flow from operations gradually increased during 2014 and 2015.

   Arctic Cat grows through small, bolt-on acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2015 it acquired Motorfist, a privately owned company based in Idaho Falls, Idaho, that designs, develops, and distributes high-performance technical riding gear. The transaction complemented its garment and riding-gear business.

  <p>
   The Arctic Cat snowmobile was introduced in 1961. The snowmobile industry expanded rapidly in the 1960s and early 1970s, but by the late 1970s sales had declined as a result of high gasoline prices and high interest rates. Arctic Enterprises, maker of Arctic Cat, went bankrupt in 1981, but demand for its products remained strong from loyal customers. The company re-emerged in 1983 when a group of former employees, distributors, and dealers revived the product line under a licensing agreement. The group bought rights to all of Arctic Cat's trademarks, equipment, and manufacturing in 1986 and 1987, and the group went public as Arctco in 1990. It changed its name to Arctic Cat in 1996.
