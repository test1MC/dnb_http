   <company id="10434">
    Danaher
   </company>
   and Cooper Industries (now
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton
   </company>
   ). It was acquired by investment firm
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital

   In 2013 Danaher and Eaton sold Apex to global private investment firm
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   for about $1.6 billion. Apex Tool Group was an attractive buy for Bain Capital as it combined two premier tool businesses into a single company that holds strong market positions in developed markets, as well as in key developing markets, such as China and Brazil.
