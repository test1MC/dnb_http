   NCR’s products don’t “ka-ching” anymore, but the company still registers with people and money. Born in the 1880s as National Cash Register, NCR is a leading maker of ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bar code scanners, and related printer consumables. Its other retail and financial systems offerings include check image processing systems and self-service kiosks for hospitality, retail, and travel. NCR's services segment provides maintenance and support, as well as professional services such as systems integration and managed services. NCR does business in more than 180 countries. International customers generate more than half of the company’s sales. Its products enable more than 650 million transactions a day.<![CDATA[  ]]></p>

        <p>
   In 2016, NCR began reporting financial results as solutions segments rather than line-of-business, reflecting the switch to a more software-oriented business model. The new segments are software, services, and hardware.</p>
        <p>The company’s hardware products, about 40% of revenue, consist of several lines of automated teller machines (ATMs), cash dispensers, cash recycling ATMs, and hardware for check and image processing. Among other hardware products are point-of-sale (POS) terminals, self-checkout kiosks, order and payment kiosks, bar code scanners, printers, and peripherals.</p>
        <p>NCR’s services segment generates 35% of revenue by helping users get hardware and software up and running and, in some, cases managing entire systems. The company Predictive Services helps customers identify and address technology issues.</p>
        <p>NCR’s software products, accounting for the remaining revenue, run the company’s hardware. Its software platforms include the Cx Banking self-service ATM software application suite for financial services, the Retail ONE and Aloha Enterprise software for the retail and hospitality industries, and NCR Silver, a cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) system for small businesses.</p>

        <p>The US is NCR's largest market, accounting for about 45% of sales. Europe and the AMEA (Asia, Middle East, and Africa) region account for more than 30% of revenue. The Asia/Pacific region – including Japan – generates about 15% of revenue.</p>
        <p>The company operates more than a dozen research and development and manufacturing facilities around the world.</p>

        <p>NCR's products and services are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, although it does tap a network of distributors and resellers.</p>
        <p>Recurring revenue and product revenue each supply more than 40% of NCR’s sales with installation services accounting for 15%.</p>

   NCR rebounded with higher revenue and a profit in 2016 after a sales dip and net loss in 2015. Cash flow from operations also surged in 2016 from 2015.</p>
        <p>Revenue rose about 3% to $6.5 billion in 2016 from $6.4 billion. The Americas drove the increase with higher sales in hardware, software, and services. Overall, software and services increased sales in 2016 while hardware broke even as growth from ATM and self-checkout machines was offset by declines in point-of-sale and consumables because of a divestiture. Cloud revenue was up 9% from previous bookings aided by mobile banking growth.</p>
        <p>NCR rang up a $270 million profit in 2016, a turnaround from a $180 million loss in 2015. The company reduced costs for sales, general, and administrative functions as well as pension-related costs. The company spent more on research and development in 2016, but the amount was consistent with past levels of R&amp;D as a percentage of revenue.</p>
        <p>Higher net income and improvements in working capital pushed cash flow from operations to $895 million in 2016 from $680 million in 2015.</p>

   NCR is building software, hardware, and services to help businesses and customer conduct transactions however they want – what NCR calls the omni-channel experience. That could mean conducting an ATM transaction with a live teller via video or checking out of a grocery store without putting items on the checkout conveyor belt.</p>
        <p>Software drives the hardware and that’s what NCR emphasizes. Software can be updated more frequently to provide better experiences for stores and their customers. But NCR continues to roll out new ATM and POS hardware. In fact, the company said it introduced a record number of hardware products in 2016. The costs associated with the new products reduced NCR’s hardware revenue for the year. The company’s service segment gets into the mix by helping customers make the best use of their hardware and software.</p>
        <p>The company has also improved its business processes including investing in systems for billings and invoices that helped reduce its days sales outstanding by six days in 2016.</p>
        <p>In 2016, NCR sold its Interactive Printer Solutions Division to Atlas Holdings. The division provided consumable products that include stock and custom color-printed paper receipt rolls, pressure-sensitive labels, impact inking and thermal transfer ribbons. NCR said the division no longer fit into its software-focused portfolio.  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>In 2016 NCR acquired CimpleBox Inc., a provider of simplified Software-as-a-Service-based back office software to small and medium-sized businesses such as restaurants and retailers. CimpleBox software helps businesses reduce the time spent on manual processes, consolidates data and scheduling, and gives managers more insight into the business and day-to-day operations.</p>

   John Patterson bought control of a Dayton, Ohio, cash register factory in 1882 and founded National Cash Register (NCR). Colonel Edward Deeds (who later became chairman) joined NCR in 1889, and hired inventor Charles Kettering in 1904 to develop an electric cash register. (The duo also developed an electric car ignition system and left NCR to start Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co., or Delco.)
  </p>
        <p>
   By the 1920s NCR controlled 90% of the cash register market. That decade NCR introduced accounting machines, which became almost as important to the company as cash registers. NCR's stock dropped from $154 to $6.87 in the crash of 1929, but by 1936 the company had fully recovered.
  </p>
        <p>
   Responding to the commercialization of computers following WWII, NCR bought computer developer Computer Research in 1952. During the 1960s the company introduced mainframe computers, opened data processing centers, established microelectronics research facilities, and introduced disk-based computers. However, NCR failed to automate its primary products -- cash registers and accounting machines. In 1969 the company had record profits of $50 million; by 1971 they had plunged to $2 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   William Anderson, who became president in 1972, is credited with saving NCR. He slashed its Dayton workforce by 75% and focused the company on computing, with an emphasis on retail scanners and ATMs.
