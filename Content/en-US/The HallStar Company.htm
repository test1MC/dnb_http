    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. The buy gives HallStar a broader range of ester technology, which is used in rubber modification.

  <p>
   In 2012 HallStar launched Polycrylene S1, a new singlet-quenching photostabilizer that helps formulators meet FDA standards for broad-spectrum claims and enhances the water resistance of sun care and daily wear products. Polycrylene S1 allows formulators to combine active ingredients once considered too photo-unstable to be effective.  Polycrylene S1 replaces the triplet-quenching portion of Polycrylene with a singlet-state quencher. The photostabilizer improves sunscreens and daily wear products, providing better UV protection.

   In 2011 HallStar acquired BioChemica International, a supplier of exotic butters and oils for use in personal care products. The acquisition is a move into the natural and organic personal care products market. The industry recorded $3.8 billion in sales in 2009, with a 14% annual growth rate from 2003 to 2009. BioChemica will retain its brand and operate as a HallStar business unit.

   That same year, HallStar acquired B&amp;T S.r.l., a developer of natural ingredients based on olive chemistry for use in personal care products. B&amp;T has $3.8 billion in annual sales, and a 14% growth rate. The acquisition bolsters HallStar's position in the market for personal care products using renewable natural ingredients.
