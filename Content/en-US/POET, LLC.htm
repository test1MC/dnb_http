   POET aims to craft an ode to sustainability and a sonnet of profit. Using corn and corn by-products, the US's largest ethanol company produces bio-ethanol and Dakota Gold brand livestock feed. It includes 27 plants in seven states, a bio-refinery design and construction group, an R&amp;D unit, a licensed commodity trading advisor firm, and a marketing unit (POET Ethanol Products) that works for POET and other producers. In addition to the ethanol and animal feed it makes annually, POET's other petroleum substitutes include Voila corn oil used to make lubricants, paint, and motor oil, and its Inviz edible packaging, adhesives, coatings, and films.

  <p>
   POET annually produces more than 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol and 9 billion pounds of high-protein animal feed at its network of 27 US production facilities ans 2 research centers. Its products include Dakota Gold distillers grains, Voila corn oil, and Inviz zein (a protein found in corn). Through its joint venture with DSM (POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels), POET also operates a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa.

   The company's unique structure is more like a hub than the traditional family tree hierarchy; each member company, except the plants, works for the POET system and for outside firms. Each plant is owned by a separate group of shareholders, including farmers and members of local communities where the plants are located. While the company is not traded publicly, shares of the bio-refining plants are available on agriculture stock trading websites.

   POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels appointed its first president in 2015. The venture converts corn crop residue into cellulosic bio-ethanol, and is committed to make cellulosic bio-ethanol competitive with corn bio-ethanol, which currently dominates the US renewable liquid transportation fuel market.

   In late 2011 POET received a $105 million loan guarantee from the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   to build Project LIBERTY, the nation's first commercial-scale cellulosic (plant waste) ethanol bio-refinery. While some have criticized corn-based ethanol for driving up food prices, the LIBERTY plant will use corn farming waste, including stalks, husks, and cobs. The
   <company id="129948">
    US Department of Agriculture
   </company>
   has estimated that there are 1.3 billion tons of biomass available for ethanol production, which POET believes is enough to completely replace all oil imported into America.
