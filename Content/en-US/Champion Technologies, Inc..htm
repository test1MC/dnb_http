   Champion Technologies produces specialty chemicals and provides services that help oil and gas companies with productivity. Among its products are biocides to control bacteria, corrosion inhibitors, paraffin inhibitors, water clarifiers, and surfactants for cleaning. Its applications include keeping pipes clean, oil flowing, and liquids separated in support of production. It also provides engineering support for drillers in US shale plays. Champion was a subsidiary of Permian Mud Service. Seeking a deeper cash resource, in 2013 Permian Mud Service sold Champion Technologies and its related company Corsicana Technologies (collectively referred to as Champion Technologies) to
