   Conexant Systems' chips help consumer electronics connect with pictures and sound. The fabless company provides integrated circuits and subsystems for imaging, audio, video, and other media applications. Its system-on-chip products -- which combine multiple functions on a single device -- are found in multifunction printers, smartphones, and surveillance gear. The company also makes embedded modems, decoders, and reference designs. As a fabless company, Conexant only designs semiconductors, it does not manufacture them. After being taken private in 2011, Conexant filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and emerged after restructuring its debt.

  <p>
   Citing declining revenue, increasing costs, and debt, Conexant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2013. Sales dropped sharply in 2012 after it main customer, digital camera maker
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   , also filed for bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   A company managed by
   <company id="47147">
    Soros Fund Management
   </company>
   provided the debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to allow Conexant to remain in business during the bankruptcy proceedings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conexant left bankruptcy after restructuring debt, mainly by converting it to stock.

   Conexant was taken private in 2011 by investment firm Golden Gate Capital in a deal valued at around $200 million. It initially agreed to be bought by
   <company id="14785">
    Standard Microsystems
   </company>
   (SMSC), but Golden Gate Capital offered shareholders more money.

   Outside the US, it has offices in China, France, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.

  <p>
   Over the course of several years, Conexant has retooled its business through acquisitions and by spinning off or selling operations. It is now a much smaller company focused on the communications, consumer electronics, and computer markets -- all of which are subject to the ups and downs of consumer demand.
  </p>

  <p>
   Conexant Systems began as the semiconductor operation of Rockwell International (now
   <company id="11283">
    Rockwell Automation
   </company>
   ), the aerospace/military/automotive products powerhouse created over the first half of the 20th century via numerous mergers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rockwell's initial semiconductor products, introduced in the early 1960s, were modem integrated circuits. In 1975 the operation became Rockwell International's Microelectronics Division (renamed the Electronic Devices Division in 1977).
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next two decades, Rockwell struggled to define the chip unit's role within the company as it tried to clarify the company's overall direction in the wake of military spending cuts. In 1982 the business became Rockwell's Semiconductor Products Division (SPD). Two years later Rockwell SPD introduced the first commercial data modem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting in 1988 Rockwell's new CEO, Don Beall, spent billions on plant modernization and R&amp;D for the company's electronics segment. When Rockwell reorganized in 1990, the business became the company's Digital Communications Division with headquarters in Newport Beach, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 the operation (by then known as Rockwell's Telecommunications business unit) bought a chip-making plant from
   <company id="12460">
    Western Digital
   </company>
   . It became Rockwell Semiconductor Systems in 1995, with a focus on multimedia and wireless communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1990s the business introduced image sensors for video applications, chips for network and computer telephony products, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver engine for the commercial market. Beginning an acquisition binge, the company acquired Brooktree in 1996 and Hi-Media's broadband communications chipset business in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Rockwell moved to cut losses by spinning off its struggling and stodgy semiconductor business to shareholders as Conexant Systems. The spinoff coincided with the explosion of digital communications technologies and with a sharp upturn in chip sales. Rockwell Semiconductor Systems president Dwight Decker became Conexant's chairman and CEO, and Conexant turned a profit by late 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Conexant bought
   <company id="42500">
    Oak Technology
   </company>
   's wireless broadband chip business, as well as Microcosm Communications, a maker of ICs for fiber-optic communications (both acquisitions were UK-based). Later that year Conexant acquired Maker Communications, a top provider of networking processors, in a deal valued at about $1 billion. The company also acquired privately held chip maker HotRail for about $400 million. Late that year Conexant announced an IPO for its Network Access network infrastructure business, to take place in early 2001. (The unit was subsequently renamed
   <company id="102687">
    Mindspeed Technologies
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, amid slowing sales, the company cut its workforce by about 25%; Conexant also announced it would spin off Mindspeed Technologies to shareholders in lieu of the planned IPO. (The Mindspeed spinoff was later pushed back to 2002; it was finally completed in mid-2003.) Later that year Conexant spun off its document imaging business -- which makes chips and related software for printers, scanners, multifunction peripherals, and digital cameras -- as privately held
   <company id="105723">
    ViewAhead Technology
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2001 Conexant announced that it would spin off its wireless communications chip business; in mid-2002 the unit was combined with rival outfit Alpha Industries to form
   <company id="11694">
    Skyworks Solutions
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 the company took another step toward a fabless production model by spinning off one of its production facilities as a foundry (contract manufacturing plant) for specialized silicon germanium (SiGe) semiconductors. Conexant owned nearly 40% in the resulting venture -- called
   <company id="113475">
    Jazz Semiconductor
   </company>
   -- with most of the rest held by investment firm
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   . (Carlyle paid Conexant $20 million cash and contributed $30 million toward the foundry's operations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Conexant struck a deal with ST Assembly Test Services (now
   <company id="99593">
    STATS ChipPAC
   </company>
   ), under which STATS bought a chip testing facility from Conexant, then supplied the company with test services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2002 Conexant acquired the video compression chip business of
   <company id="55438">
    GlobespanVirata
   </company>
   for about $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Conexant expanded its own offerings by acquiring the software modem operations of
   <company id="60826">
    PCTEL
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Conexant went on to pay more than $850 million to acquire the rest of GlobespanVirata early in 2004, at which point GlobespanVirata CEO Armando Geday succeeded Decker as CEO of Conexant. (Decker remained chairman.) When Geday resigned late in 2004, Decker resumed the CEO position.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conexant opened a new semiconductor design center in Taiwan in early 2005. That year the company completed a $110 million sale and leaseback of its headquarters office tower in Newport Beach, California; Mindspeed Technologies occupied the adjacent tower.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Conexant reached an agreement with
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   to settle patent litigation between TI and GlobespanVirata. As part of the settlement, Conexant paid $70 million to TI. Later that year the company acquired the packet switching business of
   <company id="53112">
    Zarlink Semiconductor
   </company>
   for $5 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decker decided to retire as CEO in 2007, while remaining non-executive chairman of the company. Daniel Artusi, former CEO of
   <company id="59229">
    Silicon Laboratories
   </company>
   and
   <company id="138503">
    ColdWatt
   </company>
   , was appointed president and CEO of Conexant in mid-2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Artusi's tenure was short-lived, however, as he resigned in April 2008 after initiating a significant restructuring in late 2007. Conexant named D. Scott Mercer, a director since 2003, to succeed Artusi as CEO and promoted Christian Scherp, SVP of worldwide sales, to president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decker resigned as chairman later that year and was succeeded by Mercer. Decker remained as a director.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Conexant was taken private by equity investment firm
   <company id="159576">
    Golden Gate Capital
   </company>
   in a transaction valued at around $200 million.
