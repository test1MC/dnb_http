   MacroGenics aims its enhanced antibodies at annihilating diseased cells. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on developing monoclonal antibody-based therapeutic treatments for cancer as well as autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. MacroGenics has a handful of drug candidates in its pipeline and several others in pre-clinical development. Lead candidate margetuximab is being developed as an intravenous drug that would kill tumor cells in breast, gastroesophageal and bladder cancer patients. Meanwhile, antibody MGA271 is being tested for treating a variety of tumor types.

   MacroGenics has created a number of candidates based on its proprietary Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) platform, which harnesses the body's immune system to destroy cancerous cells. MGD006 is being studied for its effects on myeloid leukemia, while MGD007 is being tested for colorectal cancer. In partnership with

  <p>
   MacroGenics hasn't generated revenues from product sales yet, but it does receive revenue from grants and collaborations. As such, earnings tend to rise and fall based on such fluid factors as upfront fees and research and development activity. Revenue declined 18% to $48 million in 2014; this was partially due to a decline in grants related to Dengue virus research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss increased to $38 million in 2014 (versus $261,000 in 2013) as a result of the decreased revenue and an increase in research and development expenses. MacroGenics began clinical manufacturing activities for two products that year, started preparing for advancing margetuximab to phase 3 study, and expanded its phase 1 study of MGA271.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has incurred significant losses since its beginning, and it expects to continue incurring losses as it pursues development and commercialization of its product candidates. As of the end of 2014, its accumulated deficit totaled some $214 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow has also been increasing. In 2014 it more than doubled to $32 million.

  <p>
   To advance the process of getting its products to the market, MacroGenics has partnered up with a number of other biopharmaceuticals. These collaborations expand the breadth of its candidates and have brought in a significant portion of MacroGenics' earnings. During 2014, the company entered into licensing agreements with Janssen Biotech (for the development and commercialization of MGD011) and Takeda (for the development and commercialization of MGD010).
