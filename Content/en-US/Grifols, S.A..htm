   This company is feeling sanguine about its products. Literally. Grifols produces plasma derivatives (plasma proteins for therapeutic use). Its biosciences division operates plasma collection centers and processing facilities. Its diagnostic division manufactures devices, instrumentation, and reagents for clinical analysis labs, and markets products and equipment for blood banks and transfusion centers. Its hospital division develops pharmaceutical products and medical devices used in hospital pharmacies. Grifols is present in more than 100 countries with three-quarters of its sales coming from international markets.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to its own products, the company distributes diagnostic equipment and reagents manufactured by other companies. It also provides raw materials and manufacturing services to third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the plasma products industry, being vertically integrated means controlling the collection, processing, and distribution of blood products, as well as the manufacturing and distribution of the equipment and supplies used in each of those steps. Grifols has achieved such integration to become the largest plasma product provider in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bioscience segment is Grifols' largest and accounts for about 90% of revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   Grifols reaches customers in more than 100 countries from its home base in Spain; it has subsidiaries in 25 countries. While its network spans Europe, Asia, and the Americas, the US and Canada make up about 60% of revenue.

  <p>
   Grifols sells to hospitals and other healthcare providers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs), and other distributors. In Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Japan, third-party distributors handle the work while the company's own sales reps handle the rest.

  <p>
   The company's revenue has grown steadily for years. In 2013 it rose another 5% as bioscience sales were higher around the world. That segment carried the company as a slight increase in the hospital segment was offset by a decline in diagnostics due to the termination of some distribution agreements. Net income fared even better with a 34% uptick after the company refinanced its long-term debt in 2012 and recorded a 13% drop in finance expenses. Cash from operations grew 13% due to the increases elsewhere along with improvements in inventory management and efficiency.

  <p>
   Grifols works to extend its products into personalized medicine, rare diseases, and conditions like cirrhosis and Alzheimer's that demand immediate care. It also expands through acquisitions. In 2013 it purchased a 60% stake in Spanish biotech Progenika, which has operations in the US, Europe, and the Middle East. It has also been opening new plasma fractionation plants in the US and Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Grifols stepped in to save Araclon Biotech, a spin-off from the University of Zaragoza that specializes in research and development projects related to the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases (vascular dementia, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis), by acquiring a 51% stake in the company. The investment enabled Araclon Biotech to continue to promote its projects and remain viable.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Novartis' diagnostic business and its line of blood donor screening molecular tests. The same year it also purchased half of Kiro Robotics, a spin-off from MONDRAGON, that specializes in hospital machinery automation. Grifols will promote the robot in Spain and international markets beginning in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired parts of two European biotech companies.
