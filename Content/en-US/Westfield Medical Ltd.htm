   Westfield Medical is good for one thing, one time only, but it's been good at it for more than a generation. For more than three decades, the UK manufacturer has been making single-use sterilization barrier systems for hospital sterile service departments, hospital sterilization and disinfection units, and theater sterile supplies units. Its products include sterilization bags and pouches, as well as wraps, tray liners, heat-sealing equipment, sterilization trays and baskets, and tapes. The company also makes products according to clients' specifications and offers on-site repair services. It distributes its products through wholesalers and medical retailers. Westfield Medical is a subsidiary of

   Westfield Medical works to meet growing demands for infection control through its ongoing process of developing its range of products with new materials and manufacturing processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company manages to maintain margins and production efficiencies with specification and quality as key drivers. This is evidenced by the fact that the company was at the vanguard in obtaining BSI (
   <company id="134520">
    The British Standards Institution
   </company>
   ) approval for all of its products as well as CE registration - a mandatory mark for about 70% of the products sold on the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and EU market - for class I non-sterile devices.

  <p>
   In a move to enhance its customer service, Westfield Medical has staffed factory-trained service engineers to service, calibrate, and repair Netherlands-based Famos BV-produced heat sealers and sterilization equipment.
