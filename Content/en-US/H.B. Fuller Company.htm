   H.B. Fuller has "stuck to its knitting," which ironically is glue, for more than a century. Long known for making adhesives, sealants, and specialty chemicals, the company markets its products in some 40 countries. Industrial adhesives are its core product offering, and customers include companies in the assembly, packaging, automotive, woodworking, and nonwoven textiles industries. Other products include construction materials, principally ceramic tile installation products (such as grouts, mortars, and sealers) and HVAC insulating coatings (duct sealants, fungicidal coatings, and weather barriers).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company formulates, manufactures, and market adhesives, sealants, and other specialty chemical products. Its adhesives are used in creating a range of products, including food and beverage containers, disposable diapers, windows, doors, flooring, appliances, sportswear, footwear, multi-wall bags, textiles, water filtration products, and insulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   It manages its business through five operating segments: Americas Adhesives, Construction Products, EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East and Africa), Engineering Adhesives, and Asia/Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Americas Adhesives segment includes a full range of specialty adhesives such as thermoplastic, thermoset, reactive, water-based and solvent-based products, and accounts for about 40% of H.B. Fuller's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The EIMEA segment has the same range of products as the Americas Adhesives operating segment, and accounts for more than 25% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Asia/Pacific segment's portfolio (more than 10%) also includes caulks and sealants for the consumer market and professional trade, sold through retailers, primarily in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Construction Products segment (more than 10%) includes products used for tile setting (adhesives, grouts, mortars, sealers, levelers, etc.), heating, ventilation and air conditioning and insulation applications (duct sealants, weather barriers and fungicidal coatings, and block fillers).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineering Adhesives segment (more than 10%) produces and supplies high performance industrial adhesives to the transportation, electronics, medical, clean energy, appliance, and heavy machinery markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   H.B. Fuller has manufacturing facilities in 21 locations across the  US, and at 24 plants in 19 other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Malaysia, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost 60% of the company's of total sales are generated outside of the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   H.B. Fuller sells products primarily through a direct sales force and also through distributors to a range of customers including manufacturers of food and beverages, hygiene products, clothing, appliances, filters, construction materials, wood flooring, furniture, cabinetry, windows, doors, tissue and towel, packaging, electronics, automobiles, corrugation, tube winding, tapes and labels. Sales operations span almost 40 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region, India, the Middle East and Africa.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2016 (ended November) by 0.5%, primarily due to a 3.9% increase in sales volume, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in currency transactions and a 1.6% drop in product pricing. Stronger revenue from the Engineering Adhesive segment also lifted sales (up 23% on 2015, thanks to revenue from newly acquired companies).
  </p>
  <p>
   H.B. Fuller's net income rose by 43% in fiscal 2016 to $124.1 million due to a major drop in special charges for costs related to its Business Integration Project compared to the previous year. (The Business Integration Project includes the integration of industrial adhesives businesses acquired in 2012 and improving the profitability and future growth prospects of the EIMEA operating segment).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow generated by operating activities from continuing operations was $195.7 million in 2016 (compared to $210.5 million a year earlier) due to a drop in net income related to higher depreciation and amortization expense, payments of severance (not present in 2015) as part of its Business Integration Project, and lower accruals for employee incentive plans.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to enhance its existing operations while expanding its presence through new products, new market entries, and acquisitions. H.B. Fuller has made a point as well of making its adhesive products more specialized to compete in the global marketplace. Despite a sluggish economic environment, the company has continued to invest in growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, the company approved a restructuring plan related to organizational changes and other actions to optimize operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company stabilized the supply chain in its North America region following the implementation of the SAP platform, and the company plans to begin its global implementation, by implementing SAP in its smaller segments beginning in 2017 in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it expanded TEC product line to include preformed components and UL-approved in-floor heat system and launched new water-based pressure sensitive adhesives for returnable bottles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at the boom in online shopping, the company also began providing a line of universally compatible adhesive solutions, targeted specifically to improve the effectiveness of e-commerce packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2011 the company has invested more than $100 million in its global manufacturing and technical capabilities footprint. It has invested in new or upgraded facilities all over the world, including China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Portugal and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing geographically, in 2015 it opened new facilities in Germany and Indonesia. In 2014 the company opened a new $10 million manufacturing facility to support the expansion of its business in the Andean Region of South America. The plant is located in Rionegro, near Medellin, Colombia. The new site will provide increased production capacity, a new technical laboratory for hygienic products and give the company better access to the Colombia's second largest airport.
  </p>
  <p>
   H.B. Fuller's R&amp;D is focused on designing and developing new polymers and new formulations. In 2016, it spent $28.6 million on R&amp;D, compared to $26.2 million a year earlier.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Expanding its portfolio, in 2016 the company acquired Illinois-based Cyberbond, a global provider of industrial adhesives for the electronics, medical, audio equipment, automotive, and structural markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also bought Advanced Adhesives, a provider of industrial adhesives in Australia and New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Supporting H.B. Fuller's growth strategy for emerging markets, in fiscal 2015, the company acquired Continental Products Limited, a provider of industrial adhesives to the East and Central Africa markets, and Tonsan Adhesive Inc, the largest independent engineering adhesives provider in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company acquired ProSpec Construction Products, strengthening H.B. Fuller's position in the southeastern and western US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1887, armed with a wood stove and an iron kettle, Harvey Benjamin Fuller Sr. began making wet paste to sell to paperhangers in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company became incorporated as the Fuller Manufacturing Company with $600 in capital from three Minneapolis lawyers. It began marketing glue to shoe companies, bookbinders, and other customers and producing ink for the city's schools. In 1888 Fuller's son Albert joined his father, instantly doubling the firm's workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the 1892 acquisition of competitor Minnesota Paste Company, Fuller grew largely through sales spurred by a series of inventions. Fuller's two cold-water products, a dry wall cleaner and dry paste, proved wildly successful. In 1905 the company was shipping to Australia, Germany, and the UK. Fuller's son Harvey Jr. joined the company in 1909.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1915 Fuller reincorporated as the H.B. Fuller Company. During WWI it supplied adhesives for canned goods shipped to the troops, but business fell off after the war. Harvey Sr. died in 1921. Despite facing possible bankruptcy, Harvey Jr. made a fateful decision to hire a full-time chemist. With Ray Burgess' inventions, the company achieved record sales by the end of the 1920s.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the stock market crashed, Fuller acquired the Selvasize Company, makers of a combination wallpaper- and plaster-adhesive. Fuller rode out the Depression with the success of new products such as Ice Proof (a glue resistant to cold water) and Nu-Type Hot Pick-Up (used in automated labeling). However, in 1937 the company learned that three salespeople had been undercutting orders through a phantom firm, which they then claimed to represent. Fuller's sales dropped almost $50,000 the following year. In 1939 Harvey Jr. suffered a stroke.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1941 competitor Paisley Products of Chicago offered to buy the company for $50,000. Instead, Elmer Andersen (a business whiz who had joined the company as a salesman in the mid-1930s) persuaded Harvey to turn the reins over to him and give him a majority stake. WWII began, bringing numerous government contracts to the company. During and after the war, H.B. Fuller decentralized operations by opening branch plants beginning with Kansas City in 1943. By 1950 H.B. Fuller was the fourth-largest adhesives company in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andersen went on to become a state senator and eventually governor of Minnesota. Under the leadership of Al Vigard in the 1950s and 1960s, the company expanded into Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, and other countries. H.B. Fuller went public in 1968. In 1971 Tony Andersen (Elmer's son) took over and further pushed international sales. From 1971 to 1980, the company made some two dozen acquisitions -- about half in foreign countries -- and increased sales fivefold. In 1980 Andersen began revamping the company, which had become inefficient because of its geographic expansion. By 1985 earnings were solid again.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 the company suffered adverse publicity after social activists accused it of marketing its Resistol glue in Latin America while knowing that street kids were sniffing the glue. In 1997 H.B. Fuller entered a joint venture with Switzerland's
   <company id="91778">
    EMS-Chemie Holding AG
   </company>
   to combine their automotive coatings, sealants, and adhesives businesses. CEO Walter Kissing, whose efforts to reduce costs in the 1990s failed to improve margins, retired in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Andersen retired as chairman and Al Stroucken, a former
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   executive, took the helm. Stroucken quickly announced a restructuring that would reduce the company's plant operations and lay off 10% of its workforce. From 2001-2003, the company eliminated 20% of its manufacturing plants and cut more than 550 employees. It restructured its adhesives business, which was run through four geographic regions, into one global unit. The company also reduced its product offerings by half, allowing it to deliver products on time more consistently.
  </p>
  <p>
   While H.B. Fuller did increase sales in 2003 over the previous year, that improvement was due mainly to the weakened dollar (against the Euro and other foreign currencies) and the resulting exchange differences. Sales volume decreased, as did prices. Revenues increased again in 2004, partly due to the same trend; however, the company also benefited from the increased sales volume of global adhesives and specialty products and from its February 2004 acquisition of the adhesives business of Portugese chemical firm Probos.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to accounting irregularities during 1999 through 2004, H.B. Fuller conducted an internal investigation into the finances of its Chilean operations in 2005. As a result, the company made minor adjustments in its 2004 financial statements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 the firm combined its Chinese and Japanese adhesives businesses with those of
   <company id="52362">
    Sekisui Chemical
   </company>
   through joint ventures. Three years later H.B. Fuller acquired a business in Egypt, called Egymelt, to establish a presence in North Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reorganized its business segments in 2007. H.B. Fuller rearranged its operations along geographic lines, merging the former Global Adhesives and Full Valu/Specialty segments into regional operations. The new segments are Asia/Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The move followed a gradual coming-together of the company's product groups. Fuller had worked to make its adhesive products more specialized and less of a commodity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jim Owens was named president and CEO of H.B. Fuller in 2010. He replaced Michele Volpi, who resigned from the company. Owens was previously SVP of H.B. Fullers' Americas operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company bought a 20% stake that Sekisui Chemical had held in its Chinese operations for $8.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired the global industrial adhesives business of
   <company id="91780">
    Forbo
   </company>
   in 2012. The $394 million cash deal expanded H.B. Fuller's position in the international adhesives industry, increasing H.B. Fuller's business in China by as much as 50% and strengthening its position in such markets as packaging and durable assembly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the firm bought Engent, Inc., a provider of manufacturing, research and development services to the electronics industry, based in Norcross, Georgia. The deal added development capabilities, testing resources, and technical support infrastructure, increasing H.B. Fuller's capabilities in a wide range of microelectronic assembly technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company sold its Central American paints business to Colombia-based paints company Compania Global de Pinturas (Pintuco), part of Grupo Mundial, for $120 million. Pintuco has a strong market position in Central America and H.B. Fuller wanted to focus on its core adhesives operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solidifying its position in the South American adhesives industry, in 2013 the company bought Plexbond Química S/A, a provider of chemical polyurethane specialties and polyester resins based in Curitiba, Brazil.
