   David Yurman, founder and owner of the namesake company, knows that while diamonds are a girl's best friend, she also can be pretty chummy with gold and silver pieces of well-crafted jewelry. The company makes classic bracelets, chains, earrings, necklaces, rings, jewel-encrusted watches, eyewear, and fragrances; it caters to a high-end clientele and celebrities the likes of Charlize Theron and Brad Pitt. Some 35 David Yurman jewelry boutiques stretch from New York City to Beverly Hills to Las Vegas to Houston. The jewelry retailer also sells its pieces on a website hosted by

    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   and through several catalogs. Its bridal collection features Yurman's signature cable accents.
