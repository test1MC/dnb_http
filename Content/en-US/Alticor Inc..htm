  <p>
   The company's success depends on setting up Independent Business Owners (IBOs) to sell its name-brand products, but more importantly build its network. The company has been accused of focusing on new IBO recruitment rather than on selling and developing new products or services. Although individuals are required to pay a membership fee, Amway asserts that they can then buy its products and sell them at a 20% to 25% markup. IBOs that recruit get a cut from the sales made by those members.
  </p>
  <p>
   The direct-selling business model is popular; Amway reaches across North America and Europe. Its focus, however, is increasingly on Asia's fertile market. Sales from its Amway China and India units are anticipated to jump by double-digits as consumers increase retail spending. The company deepens its presence by outsourcing its manufacturing operations to third parties in the Asia/Pacific region as well as by aligning its product design and branding around their cultures.
  </p>
  <p>
   To this end, Amway is investing $335 million in manufacturing and research and development expansion. The initiative involves upgrading four factories in the US, building a new manufacturing facility in India, and adding second sites in both China and Vietnam. In 2013 Amway broke ground on a new $95-million production plant in Tamil Nadu, India, set for completion in 2015. Its second plant in China will be located in Guangzhou; the $75-million facility is slated for completion by 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alticor continues to invest in its supply chain, manufacturing, and scientific resources to ensure distributors have access to products when and where they need them.
