   Great Lakes Cheese understands the power of provolone, the charm of cheddar, and the goodness of gruyere. Each year the company makes about 165 million pounds of cheese. The cheesemaker distributes natural and processed cheeses and cheese spreads, including varieties such as cheddar, Colby, Swiss, mozzarella, and provolone. It also makes the premium Adams Reserve New York Cheddar. Great Lakes Cheese packages shredded, chunk, and sliced cheese for deli, bulk, and foodservice sale under the Great Lakes, Adams Reserve, and private-label brands. Chairman Hans Epprecht, a Swiss immigrant, founded the firm in 1958 as a Cleveland bulk-cheese distributor. Epprecht (80%) and Great Lakes employees (20%) own the company.
