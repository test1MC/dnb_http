   Disease detection is the name of Meridian Bioscience's game. The company makes immunodiagnostic test kits and sample transport media for reference laboratories, hospitals, and doctors' offices. Its products analyze blood, urine, and other body fluid and tissue samples to diagnose such maladies as respiratory illness (pneumonia, influenza), gastrointestinal disease (ulcers, diarrhea), viruses (mononucleosis, chicken pox), and parasitic diseases. The company's Life Science division makes and sells biological supplies including antigens, antibodies, and reagents used by research labs and other diagnostics firms; it also provides contract manufacturing of proteins and other biologics for drug developers.

  <p>
   Meridian Bioscience makes some 200 medical diagnostic products, and sales of those items make up about 80% of revenue. Top selling products include tests for gastrointestinal toxins
   <em>
    C. difficile
   </em>
   (antibiotic-associated diarrhea) and
   <em>
    H. pylori
   </em>
   (stomach ulcers).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's rising Life Science division markets antibodies and antigens (proteins and molecules that stimulate the immune system) and biological reagents (testing substances) under three main brands: BIODESIGN, Viral Antigens, and OEM Concepts. Meridian sells its life science products primarily in bulk to other diagnostics companies for use in their own products. The fourth Life Science operation (biologics contract manufacturing) develops and makes clinical-grade biologicals for pharmaceutical and biotech companies on a contract basis. Sales from this division increased by 11% from 2011 to 2012.

   The company uses a direct sales force and distributors (including top customers
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11473">
    Thermo Fisher Scientific
   </company>
   , each accounting for more than 10% of annual revenues) to market its products in the core US and Canadian markets. Meridian Bioscience's offerings are sold through independent distributors in some 60 countries outside of North America.

  <p>
   As global demand for fast and accurate diagnostic products increases, the firm works to expand in the market through research and development efforts. Meridian Bioscience develops new diagnostics products both in-house and with partners. The company also benefits from market situations where rapid diagnostics are beneficial; years ago, it received a boost in its respiratory test sales in due to the global outbreak of H1N1 influenza.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Meridian's products have so far been based on immunodiagnostics (using immune responses to detect the presence of disease), it has development efforts afoot in the growing and highly competitive field of molecular diagnostics (i.e. genetic testing) as well. The company launched its first molecular test, the illumigene
   <em>
    C. difficile
   </em>
   test, in late 2010. As the number of molecular tests in the marketplace grows, Meridian hopes the new offering will reduce competitive pressures faced recently within its traditional
   <em>
    C. difficile
   </em>
   product line.

   Meridian Bioscience primarily expands its Life Science unit through acquisitions. In 2010 the division broadened its operations through the $23 million purchase of the Bioline group of companies, which added biological reagent offerings in European, Australian, and North American markets.

  <p>
   In 2016 Meridien acquired Magellan Biosciences and its Magellan Diagnostics subsidiary, which makes lead-poisoning blood tests. The $66 million purchase adds Magellan's pipeline of pediatric tests, which includes additional lead testing products.

  <p>
   Microbiology and diagnostics specialists William Motto and Jerry Ruyan launched Meridian Diagnostics in 1977, naming it for their desire to reach the highest point in diagnostic technology. The company began as a research and development lab, but soon developed a variety of commercial products, including test kits for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (a leading cause of death in AIDS patients) and mycoplasmal (or "walking") pneumonia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Meridian made key acquisitions to further its offerings, including the ImmunoCard rapid-response systems from Disease Detection International and the MonoSpot and Monolert mononucleosis diagnostics technologies from
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . Other acquisitions include tests for Lyme disease and the viruses that cause pediatric diarrhea.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of its entry into the life sciences market (spurred by its acquisitions of antibody reagent maker BIODESIGN in 1999 and antigens and test kits maker Viral Antigens in 2000), Meridian Diagnostics changed its name to Meridian Bioscience in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company expanded its life sciences division once again by purchasing OEM Concepts, a manufacturer of antibody products. The following year Meridian Bioscience combined BIODESIGN, Viral Antigens, Meridian Biologics, and OEM Concepts into a new Life Sciences business segment, with the former businesses becoming four distinct brands within that unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Life Sciences division expanded its operations in 2007 when it won a five-year contract with the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (part of the
   <company id="100358">
    NIH
   </company>
   ) to manufacture experimental vaccines; the contract was worth up to $12.2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company broadened the Life Science division by acquiring technologies and products, including proteins and antigens for applications in infectious disease and cardiac research, from private life sciences firm Vybion.
