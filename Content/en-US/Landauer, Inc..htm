   If your employees are glowing -- and not with joy -- Landauer can tell you why. Through its subsidiaries, Landauer manufactures and markets dosimeters (radiation detection monitors) used in nuclear plants, hospitals, and university and government laboratories. Landauer's services include distribution and collection of radiation monitors and exposure reporting. Its HomeBuyer's Preferred subsidiary provides residential radon monitoring services. Landauer also offers medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers through its GPS subsidiary.

   Landauer operates through three primary segments: Radiation Monitoring (73% of sales), Medical Physics (21%), and Medical Products (6%). Products and services of Landauer's Radiation Monitoring segment are marketed through five sales regions in the US and globally through international subsidiaries. All told, the segment has about 73,000 customers. To serve those customers, Landauer's primary facility in Illinois conducts dosimetry laboratory processing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Medical Physics segment provides radiology accessories and markets services through the integrated efforts of business development professionals and physicists. Physicists with GPS consider such issues as new technology and safety in consulting with other healthcare professionals to provide patients with the best outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its Medical Products segment, Landauer makes medical consumable accessories used in radiology, radiation therapy, and image guided surgery procedures. Products range from consumables used with MRI, CT, and mammography technologies to highly engineered passive reflective markers used during image guided surgery procedures.

  <p>
   After seeing its revenues peak at a record-high of $152 million in 2012, the company saw its revenues marginally drop to $150 million in 2013. The revenue drop for 2013 was driven by a 30% fall in Medical Products sales and 4% decline in US sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits also nosedived nearly 75% from $19 million in 2012 to $5 million in 2013. This was driven largely by a $23 million goodwill impairment charge incurred to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in its Medical Products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Landauer's cash flow from operations steadily increased from 2010 to 2012. However, operating cash flow decreased by $15 million in 2013 due to a decrease in accounts payable, an increase in prepaid taxes, and a spike in other assets.

  <p>
   To develop business for its Radiation Monitoring segment, Laundauer partners with dosimetry service providers in international markets. Landauer also creates new platforms and formats for its OSL technology to expand beyond its core medical market to markets that include nuclear power and tactical military monitoring. Tough economic times and the uncertainties of healthcare reform have challenged Landauer's medical customers with pricing pressures. More generally the company develops new business through acquisitions and joint ventures.
