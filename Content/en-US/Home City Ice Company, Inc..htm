   Home City Ice (HCI) has its business down cold. The company manufactures some 5,700 tons of ice per day in its three dozen ice-manufacturing plants. It operates a distribution network made up of about 55 centers and a fleet of more than 725 vehicles. HCI stocks up on ice in 88 freezers across the region and the network delivers the company's frozen product to individual customers and company-owned ice merchandising machines located in more than a dozen US states, primarily in the Midwest. The company dates back to 1896 and is owned by the Sedler family, which began its association with the company in the 1920s.

   A reliable distribution network is key in the ice business to avoid delivering water to customers. To avoid just that, HCI operates three dozen facilities across 13 states, with no one location representing more than 5% of its total capacity, to allow for a reliable source of supply in case of mechanical or power failures. About 80% of the ice maker's customers are within a 25 mile radius of a distribution center, enabling quick delivery.
