   Carnival in Rio wouldn't be the same celebration without Companhia de Bebidas das Américas - AmBev. Catering to Brazil's beer market, the company brews and bottles an array of brand name beers; major labels are Antarctica, Brahma, and Skol. AmBev also produces non-alcoholic beverages by

   and

  <p>
   Companhia de Bebidas das Américas - AmBev was born of a merger in 2000 between Companhia Cervejaria Brahma and Companhia Antarctica Paulista, both with origins dating back to the late 19th century. The merger was approved after months of dispute, primarily with rival brewer Companhia Cervejarias Kaiser and its primary stockholders,
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   and local Coca-Cola bottlers. Besides the usual complaint that the merger would give AmBev unfair monopoly powers in pricing and distribution, the merger opponents feared the deal would cause further difficulties for Coke in the region, including the loss of overall market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   The young company began selling shares on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   in September; it made its first acquisition the same month. AmBev, along with France's
   <company id="41774">
    Group Danone
   </company>
   , bought 57% of Uruguay's #2 brewer, Salus, in a deal that illustrated its eagerness to expand internationally. It then sold its Bavaria beer brand and five brewing facilities to Canadian brewing giant
   <company id="12519">
    Molson
   </company>
   for $98 million and future considerations; the deal was made to satisfy conditions of its original merger agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought about 95% of Uruguayan brewer Cervecería y Maltería Paysandú (also known as Cympay) in 2001 for $27.7 million. The deal, which included the popular Norteña and Prinz brands, doubled its share of the Uruguayan beer market, giving it a 48% market share in the country. The Cympay deal also benefited its mineral water business and gave AmBev additional vertical integration in malt, an important ingredient in beer production. Also in 2001 the company bought Paraguayan brewer Cervecería Internacional for $12 million as part of its plan to expand across South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 AmBev formed a joint venture with PepsiCo's Central American Bottling Corporation to sell its beers in Central America and the Caribbean. A year later, Beverage Associates Corp. (BAC) purchased from Heineken its 15% stake in Quilmes. Upon completion of the deal, AmBev acquired 9% of the Quilmes shares from BAC for nearly 60 million, as well as obtained a 36% voting stake in Quinsa, a holding company of Quilmes, Argentina's top brewer. AmBev in 2006 purchased BAC's remaining interest in Quinsa. Under the agreement, Quilmes manages AmBev's nondomestic assets and AmBev distributes Quilmes products in Brazil. Later in 2003 AmBev acquired Ecuador's second largest brewer, Cervecería SurAmericana.
  </p>
  <p>
   AmBev and Belgium brewer Interbrew merged in 2005 in a complex stock swap valued at $12 billion, forming Belgium-based InBev (now known as Anheuser-Busch InBev). Although a direct subsidiary of InBev, AmBev retained its South American headquarters and operations following the merger of Anheuser-Busch and InBev. The transaction followed Labatt's merger into AmBev in fall 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 AmBev, through Labatt, took over Canadian brewer Lakeport Brewing Income Fund. Within months, AmBev also bought out Brazil's fifth-largest brewer, Cervejarias Centra Indústria (Cintra), subsequently renamed Londrina Bebidas (Londrina) on the heels of selling off the Cintra brand name to Schincariol Participações e Representações.
