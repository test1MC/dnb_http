   As the current administration's pushes the nation's hospitals to go digital, Carestream is benefiting from the resulting upsurge in demand for IT products that manage and share patient data, such as picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). PACS (one of the company's primary product lines) allow hospitals to store, retrieve, manage, and distribute medical images captured with the company's DR and CR systems, including DR products sold under the DRX brand. Such PACS systems are an integral part of the electronic health record (EHR) system, for which hospitals receive federal incentives to install and use.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with PACS, Carestream's lines of products and services combine digital imaging, communications, networking, and other tools to help departments in hospitals become more efficient. It also offers informatics systems, practice management software, and other data management tools. Carestream's Image Suite 4 veterinary software contains order entry screens for breed, species and other identifiers. The newest version of Image Suite Software supports viewing of X-ray images on iPad mobile devices for veterinary practices across the globe.

   All of Carestream's X-ray film products are of the KODAK brand, for good reason. The company was previously part of
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak Company
   </company>
   (prior to being acquired by Onex in 2007). Onex operates Carestream as an independent subsidiary held through its Healthcare Holdings subsidiary. Carestream continues to license the KODAK brand for use with its own products.

   The company's Non-Destructive Testing operations provide imaging products for industrial tasks including aircraft inspections and assembly.

   <company id="111954">
    Cincinnati Children's Hospital
   </company>
   installed a new Carestream mobile X-ray system to provide rapid image capture in multiple critical care areas.

   The firm pared down its molecular imaging division in 2012 when it sold its preclinical in vivo imaging equipment operations to Bruker for an undisclosed price. And in 2012 it widened its IT offerings through the purchase of Genesis Digital Imaging, a Los Angeles-based imaging software developer that also distributes imaging systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   It launched a new cloud-based eHealth PACS and eHealth portal service in 2011, as well as several upgraded film and detector products. It also conducts occasional acquisitions to broaden its medical imaging equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Carestream expanded its range of conventional and digital x-ray systems through the acquisition of Quantum Medical Imaging.

   Onex acquired Carestream in 2007. The company was previously
