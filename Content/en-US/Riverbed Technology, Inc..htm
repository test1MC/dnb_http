   Riverbed sells its products through 2,500 channel partners and a sales force responsible for managing all direct and indirect sales within their regional territories. Major distributors include Arrow Electronics and Avnet, which accounted for 20% and 14% of its consolidated revenue in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $1.7 million on advertising in 2014 -- less than half what it spent in 2012.

  <p>
   In its last financial report before going private, Riverbed posted a 5% revenue increase in 2014. The company's 2014 revenue was $1.09 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2013. The increase in revenue came from a 13% increase in support and services revenue, which was partly offset by a 1% decrease in Product revenue. Sales slowed in the Application Acceleration product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company turned a $12.4 million loss in 2013 into a $71.2 million profit in 2014. Some profit came as Riverbed netted $57 million from the sale of its SteelStore product line to NetApp in 2014. Cash flow from operations rose by $10.2 million to $227.6 in 2014.
