   You want the truck driver behind you on the highway to be able to control his speed, and so does Williams Controls. The company's primary business is the manufacture of electronic throttle controls for commercial trucks, buses, RVs, off-highway equipment, and military applications. Williams Controls also makes pneumatic throttle controls for diesel heavy-duty vehicles.  Most of the company's products are sold directly to heavy-duty truck, transit bus, and off-road OEMs. However, it also sells through a network of independent distributors, which sell to smaller OEMs. The company makes more than half of its sales in the US. In late 2012 the company agreed to be acquired by

   gNorman Williams, who developed a water-cooling system for truck and trailer brake drums in 1937, founded Williams Controls to make parts for trucks and heavy-equipment engines. Auto parts maker Dana Corporation subsequently bought the company. Thomas Itin and others formed Williams Controls, Inc., in 1988 to acquire Dana's Williams Controls unit; they took it public the next year. In 1993 the enterprise expanded into light-truck appearance accessories when it acquired both Kenco Engineering and NMS-Auto Truck &amp; Accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s Williams Controls diversified by purchasing companies in such growth industries as electronics and telecommunications. In 1995 it acquired landscape-maintenance equipment makers Aptek Technologies, Hardee Manufacturing, and Agrotec. The company suffered a downturn in its heavy-equipment sector in 1996. That year Williams Controls picked up GeoFocus, a manufacturer of mapping software for global positioning systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Williams Controls exited the auto accessories business when it sold its Kenco/Williams subsidiary to Kenco Products in 1998. The next year the company bought the ProActive Pedals division of Active Tools Manufacturing for $6 million. Williams Controls decided in 2000 to divest its agricultural equipment businesses to focus on its transportation and communications operations. That year it agreed to sell its GeoFocus unit and its plastic injection-molding subsidiary, Premier Plastic Technologies (for a 7% stake in 3DM International).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 CEO Itin was replaced by Thomas Ziegler. Later that year the company sold its global positioning systems business to Sumitomo Corporation of America. After a deal to sell its plastics business fell through, Williams Controls shut down the unit's operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 private equity firm American Industrial Partners (AIP) invested a much-needed $10 million in Williams Controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the continuing effort to focus on core operations, late in 2003 Williams Controls sold its passenger and light truck electronic control business to
   <company id="12375">
    Teleflex
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Patrick Cavanagh assumed the CEO position in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company opened a manufacturing facility and a sales office in China, along with a sales office in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Williams Controls realigned some of its operations to improve efficiency and competitiveness. The company decided to outsource its die casting and machining operations to Asian suppliers. At the same time, the company relocated the assembly operations for its pneumatic products from Portland, Oregon, to a facility in China.
