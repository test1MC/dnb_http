   The folks at Paul Reed Smith Guitars (PRS) play right into their customers' hands. The company makes electric guitars and basses in more than 30 variations. PRS also sells guitar accessories such as pickups, strings, and straps. Founder and owner Paul Reed Smith began making guitars in the mid-1970s to earn extra credits from his college music professor. He then began hawking his wares backstage after area concerts. Finally, he took to the road visiting music dealers with two prototypes. By the time he returned, he had collected enough orders to make a go of the business. PRS guitars are made from woods such as maple, ash, mahogany, and rosewood and are bone-dried in custom kilns.
