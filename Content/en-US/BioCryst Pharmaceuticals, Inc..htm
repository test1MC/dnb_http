   BioCryst Pharmaceuticals is tackling the bad enzymes that spread disease. The firm creates small molecule compounds that inhibit enzymes associated with viral diseases, autoimmune conditions, and cancer. BioCryst's peramivir is a treatment for acute influenza that was developed with funding from the
   <company id="150448">
    Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   (HHS). Peramivir is marketed in Japan by
   <company id="56875">
    Shionogi
   </company>
   under the commercial name Rapiacta; in Korea, it is marketed by
   <company id="193259">
    Green Cross Corporation
   </company>
   under the name PeramiFlu. Rapivab was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   for the treatment of flu in 2014. Additional development programs include oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of angioedema and viral RNA polymerase inhibitor BCX4430.

  <p>
   Rapivab, which was also developed with funding from the HHS, is approved for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in adults who have been symptomatic for no longer than two days. BCX4430 is being explored as an antiviral under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the HHS.

  <p>
   BioCryst's headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina; its primary research facility is located in Raleigh, North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is working on construction of a new research facility.

  <p>
   BioCryst utilizes third parties to commercialize its products. In addition to partnerships with Shionogi and Green Cross for marketing peramivir in Asia, it has an agreement with Seqiris UK for the commercialization of rapivab in certain markets including the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses totaled $103,000 in 2015, down from $290,000 in 2014.

  <p>
   Before 2014, BioCryst earned its keep from royalties. It earned its first product revenues in 2014 with the launch of peramivir. In 2015, revenue rose 255% to $48 million, primarily due to an agreement granting Seqiris limited global rights for the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of rapivab. Revenues from rapivab sales also grew that year, and the company additionally received reimbursements for the development of peramivir and BCX4430.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the firm has incurred losses every year since its inception, and it expects to continue incurring losses as its R&amp;D expenses rise. In 2015, its net loss declined 5% to $43 million, largely due to the increased revenue (but offset by higher R&amp;D costs). At the end of 2015, its accumulated deficit totaled $511 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow has fluctuated over the past five years. In 2015, its outflow decreased 66% to $13 million.

  <p>
   BioCryst's strategies for growth include expanding its product pipeline, entering new markets for its existing products, and working with others on product distribution. In 2015 it entered into an agreement with CSL Limited for the manufacturing and commercialization of rapivab worldwide (except for in Israel, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan). CSL subsidiary Seqiris UK is commercializing the treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's R&amp;D costs have been rising -- they rose 40% to $73 million in 2015 -- as it continues its research on Hereditary angioedema and rapivab.
