   In recent years, Bush Industries has focused on reorganizing its business. In 2011 the company separated its North American operations into two units to encourage autonomy and individualized expansion strategies. Bush Industries spent 2010 rebranding its commercial division and restructuring its living unit to help its customers identify complementary pieces of furniture. The company's rebranding was aimed at focusing on the growing group of professionals who work out of their homes and need flexible office space.

   Additionally, the furniture maker rolled out several collections -- my|space by Bush Furniture, Bush Furniture Signature, Office Connect, and Workplace Solutions -- for ease in grouping pieces intended for specific life and work style needs.

  <p>
   It's focused on its BBF commercial furniture operating division. It introduced a new product line under the Realize name, opened a new showroom at the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and added a dozen independent representative groups to its nationwide coverage, such as Rytel Holland Contract, The Michela Group, Levine Calvano Furniture Group, Reps in Black, Scott Miller and Associates, and others.

  <p>
   Paul Bush and other family members founded Bush Industries in 1959 to make plastic and chrome bathroom accessories, including items such as towel bars and rings. Mechanical engineering skills honed in college had Bush pushing the ready-to-assemble (RTA) concept from the start. He bought out a cousin and other shareholders in 1970 and revamped the company as a furniture maker. The company introduced the first pedestal TV stand in the early 1970s. The bath business was sold in 1975, and Bush used the proceeds to expand into the manufacture of wood cabinets for consumer electronics. Sales in 1979 reached about $7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bush Industries went public in 1985, riding extensive growth from the market for PCs and VCRs and by adding innovative touches to a type of product long considered flimsy and déclassé. While competitors fashioned their RTA furniture cheaply to cut prices, Bush stressed stylish pieces that gave new looks to drawers and moldings. By 1990 sales had reached $110 million, despite a three-year earnings slide starting in 1987, attributed in part to a soft market, the cost of upgrading machinery, and the introduction of new product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made its first two acquisitions in 1990, when it purchased lower-priced RTA specialist Case-Casard and high-end preassembled home entertainment center maker Eric Morgan. Sales were fueled in the early 1990s by surging demand for home and commercial office furniture. In 1996 Bush bought ColorWorks, licensee for HydroGraFix, a film-based technology for decorating the surfaces of various consumer products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its European presence, the company formed Bush-Viotechnik in 1997 to complement ColorWorks and bought a majority stake in German furniture maker Röhr Gruppe, renamed Röhr-Bush. The following year it bought Fournier Furniture (a Virginia-based manufacturer) for $20 million. As part of a restructuring to bolster profits, in 1999 Bush reduced the lines offered by Röhr-Bush, contracted out its delivery and assembly services, and cut other costs in North America. In 2000 the company bought the remaining stake of Rohr-Bush.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stung by an economic slump and slowing sales, the company cut one-third of its workforce in 2001. In March 2004 Bush Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and underwent a major reorganization, which resulted in the resignation of former chairman and CEO, Paul Bush. The company was taken private by a group led by DDJ Capital Management LLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank in November 2004.
