   W. R. Grace &amp; Co. operates through two major segments. Grace Catalysts Technologies includes catalysts used in refining, petrochemical, and other chemical manufacturing processes. Grace Materials Technologies makes packaging technologies and engineered materials used in consumer, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. In 2016 the company spun off its Grace Construction Products segment (which makes concrete and cement products, including specialty construction chemicals and specialty building materials) and its Darex packaging business as GCP Applied Technologies.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Bankruptcy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Grace was in asbestos litigation-related bankruptcy for more than a decade before it emerged in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   A US district court in early 2012 approved Grace's reorganization plan, paving the way for an exit from a decade of bankruptcy. Grace had been wrestling with a reorganization and emergence from its bankruptcy plan for more than 10 years. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001 after an unexpected increase in asbestos litigation (injury claims nearly doubled in 2000). The company no longer makes asbestos products. Grace emerged from bankruptcy in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its reorganization plan calls for the setting up of two asbestos trusts to compensate personal injury claimants and property owners.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Grace conducts business in more than 40 countries and in more than 30 currencies. It has operations in Canada, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), Asia/Pacific, Latin America, and the US. In 2015 the EMEA region accounted for 32% of its total revenues; the US, 31%; and Asia/Pacific, 24%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates six manufacturing facilities, multiple sales offices, and two technical service centers in China. Grace has long had a presence in China, first entering the market in 1986 as the first wholly foreign owned company to do business there. It also maintains Asia/Pacific regional headquarters in Shanghai.
  </p>

  <p>
   Following the spin-off of its Grace Construction Products in 2016, the company has two segments - Grace Catalysts Technologies and Grace Materials Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Grace Catalysts Technologies unit includes the company's fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) refining technology, which helps "crack" the hydrocarbon chain in distilled crude oil to improve the quality of transportation fuels. Its FCC additives are used for applications such as reducing sulfur in gasoline, maximizing propylene production, and reducing refinery emissions. Grace is a global leader in FCC manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grace Materials Technologies includes packaging products and engineered materials, coatings and sealants used in consumer, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the spin-off of Grace Construction Products, the Grace Catalysts Technologies accounted for 38%, Materials Technologies 26%, and Construction Products 36% of the company's total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Grace uses a global direct sales force for its polyolefin catalysts, and it has geographically distributed its sales and technical service professionals to make them responsive to the needs of its geographically diverse customers. It employs country based direct sales forces that are dedicated to each product line and backed by application-centered technical customer services teams to market its Materials Technologies products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company maintains specialized direct sales and technical teams to support sales in over 100 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industries served includes Catalysts; Chemical Processing; Food and Beverage; General Industrial; Paints, Coatings and Inks; Personal Care; Pharma and Biotech; and Plastics and Rubber.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Grace's net revenues decreased by 6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Catalysts Technologies sales declined due to unfavorable currency translation, lower sales volumes  and lower pricing. FCC catalyst sales volumes decreased primarily due to the transition in commercial positions undertaken earlier in the year to strengthen their business in North America, the Middle East, and Asia, and the delayed timing of some new and existing customers increasing order volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Materials Technologies sales decreased due to unfavorable currency translation and lower sales volumes partially offset by improved pricing. (Sales volumes decreased in all regions except EMEA).
  </p>
  <p>
   Construction Products sales dropped due to unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by higher sales volumes and improved pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In  2015 Grace's net income was $144.2 million, decreased by 48% compared to 2014. This decrease was due to decrease in net sales, presence of restructuring cost associated with separation of Grace Construction product segment and increased Loss in Venezuela.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities improved by 101% due to the 2015 payment of $490 million to cash settle the PI Warrant (WRG Personal Injury Trust warrants) and the 2014 payments of $1.3 billion to resolve liabilities subject to its Chapter 11 filing, and $632 million to settle the deferred payment obligation to the PI Trust.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, the company announced to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. The two companies are Grace made up of Grace's Catalysts Technologies and Materials Technologies business segments (excluding the Darex packaging business), and GCP Applied Technologies, comprised of Grace's Construction Products business segment and the Darex packaging business. Grace believes that the separation will enhance the company's strategic focus, simplify its operations, and create strong financial profiles and distinct investment vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   During its struggle to exit bankruptcy protection, the company continued to push for a strategy of growth. It expanded manufacturing and sales operations in key regions (including China, India, the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe) to take advantage of growth in these markets. It also pursued global acquisitions to enhance its existing product offerings and penetrate desirable segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Grace's Pharma, Nutraceutical Business announced agreements to sell product lines associated with its chromatography instruments, columns, and related laboratory products businesses that are not aligned with the company's plans for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grace's joint venture with Al Dahra Agricultural Company is building a catalysts and additives plant in the Middle East to supply oil refiners in that market. In 2015 detailed engineering was underway, with operations expected to begin in 2018.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Grace bought
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   's Polyolefin Catalysts business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition includes LYNX high-activity polyethylene catalyst technologies that are used commercially in slurry processes for the production of high-density PE resins such as bimodal film and pipe. LYNX polypropylene catalyst technologies are used commercially in all major polypropylene process technologies including slurry, bulk loop, stirred gas, fluid gas, and stirred bulk. Grace acquired technologies, patents, trademarks, and production plants in Pasadena, Texas and Tarragona, Spain. The purchase is aligned with Grace's focus on its core catalysts and materials technologies. As a result of the deal, the company has the broadest portfolio of polyolefin catalyst technologies of any independent catalysts producer.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   W. R. Grace &amp; Co. grew from the businesses of Irishman William R. Grace, who fled the potato famine and moved to Peru in 1854 to charter ships trading guano fertilizer. In 1866 he moved his headquarters to New York and established shipping routes linking New York, South America, and Europe. The company traded fertilizer, agricultural products, and US manufactured goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grace, mayor of New York City in the 1880s, died in 1904. His son Joseph became president in 1907, and he expanded the firm's business in South America and started the Grace National Bank in 1916. The company entered aviation in 1928 in a joint venture with Pan American Airlines, forming Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra) to serve Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1945 Joseph's son Peter took the helm at age 32. He took the company public in 1953. The next year Grace expanded into chemicals, buying Davison Chemical and Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical (sealants, batteries, and packaging). Peter then sold Grace National Bank (1965), Panagra (1967), and the Grace Line (1969).
  </p>
  <p>
   Purchases during the 1960s and 1970s included American Breeders Service (1967), Herman's (56%, sporting goods, 1970; sold 1986), Baker &amp; Taylor (wholesale books, 1970), Sheplers (western wear, 1976; sold 1986), El Torito-La Fiesta Restaurants (1976; sold 1995), and home-improvement store Handy City (1976). Grace sold its agricultural and fertilizer businesses in 1988 and added three European water-treatment firms to its holdings in 1990. In 1992 it sold Baker &amp; Taylor and bought DuPont Canada's North American food-service packaging operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Peter Grace left in 1993 after nearly 50 years as CEO. J. P. Bolduc succeeded him but was brought down by a sexual harassment scandal two years later. Grace acquired Riggers Medizintechnik of Germany (dialysis products) and Florida-based Home Intensive Care and sold its oil field services and liquid storage and terminal businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grace began divesting businesses in 1995, selling its Dearborn business to Betz Laboratories and the plant biotechnology portion of its Agracetus subsidiary to Monsanto. That year the company reclassified its health care business as discontinued; that move resulted in a dramatic drop in revenues. Albert Costello, a veteran executive from drug firm American Cyanamid, succeeded Bolduc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company sold its biggest division, food packaging, to Sealed Air for about $4.9 billion in cash and stock (Grace shareholders wound up with more than 60% of Sealed Air). It also agreed to buy Imperial Chemical's Crosfield catalysts and silicas business but terminated the deal after US regulators raised antitrust issues. Grace relocated its headquarters to Columbia, Maryland, in 1999 and set up a $1 million financial education fund to settle an SEC lawsuit alleging the company socked away profits in the 1990s to mask poor earnings. The company upped its stake in Grace Chemicals K.K. (formerly Denka Grace), a Japanese joint venture to produce concrete admixture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grace continued to expand its presence in core markets in 2001; acquisitions included European companies Akzo-PQ Silicas (silica products) and Pieri S.A. (specialty construction chemicals). Also in 2001 Grace and Chevron Products (a unit of
   <company id="10328">
    Chevron
   </company>
   , formerly ChevronTexaco) formed catalyst developer Advanced Refining Technologies. In 2002 Grace acquired catalyst manufacturing assets from Sweden's Borealis A/S. The following year, Grace continued to expand internationally through the acquisition of German construction chemicals firm Tricosal Beton-Chemie.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to acquisitions, Grace grew in 2002 and 2003 through improved sales for catalysts used in refining and increased volume at its Performance Chemicals unit, especially in the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Grace acquired Chemind Construction Products, a maker of waterproofing coatings technologies used in the construction sector. Chemind is based in Australia and was added to Grace's Construction Products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it moved to acquire the remaining 50% of Grace Yapı Kimyasalları, a Turkey-based joint venture it formed in 1996 with conglomerate STFA Yatırım Holding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further growing its portfolio, in 2013 the company also bought
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   's global polypropylene licensing and catalysts business for $500 million.
