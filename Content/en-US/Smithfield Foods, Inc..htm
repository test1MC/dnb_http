   Whether you like Nathan's Famous hot dogs,

   ham steaks, or Armour pepperoni, it's all on the Smithfield Foods menu. The world's largest hog producer and pork processor, Smithfield includes more than a dozen major brands of fresh pork and value-added pork products including deli meats and prepared foods. Other brands include Eckrich, Cook's,
   <company id="108549">
    John Morrell
   </company>
   , Gwaltney, and Healthy Ones. The company operates primarily in the US, with limited business in Europe. It processes about 30 million hogs annually. Smithfield was acquired in 2013 by China's largest meat producer, WH Group, which also owns a majority stake in China's largest pork company

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has four reportable segments: Packaged Meats, Fresh Pork, Hog Production, and International.
  </p>
  <p>
   The largest segment, Packaged Meat, includes the US packaged meat operations and accounts for more than 40% of sales. The US Fresh Pork and Hog Production operations contribute about 30% and nearly 20%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   The International segment is comprised primarily of meat processing and distribution operations in Poland, Romania and the UK; hog production operations in Poland and Romania; and its interests in hog production plants in Mexico. That segment generates about 10% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Virginia-based Smithfield rings up 90% of its sales in the US. It has plants and hog production facilities across the US (primarily in Midwest and upper Southeast), as well as in Poland, Romania, and the UK.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company uses a private fleet of leased tractor trailers and independent common carriers and owner operators to distribute live hogs and meat products to its customers, and to move raw materials between plants for further processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smithfield sells its products to about 3,800 customers, including grocery stores, hotel chains, restaurants, hospitals, and other companies that further process the meat into other products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Parent WH Group reported 2015 revenue of $21 billion, with Smithfield contributing about two-thirds of that (roughly $14.5 billion). Smithfield's sales were down 4% that year as low hog prices resulted in a drop in fresh pork revenue.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's key strategy is based around its "One Smithfield" initiative, which in 2015 unified all of Smithfield's operating companies, brands, and marketing activities to maximize efficiencies, enable transparent and sustainable practices, and drive market share. It claims early success in sales and brand management from the initiative and expects to see improvements in transportation, logistics, and manufacturing through 2017.

  <p>
   In 2016 Smithfield acquired the largest pork processor in California, Clougherty, for $145 million. The deal strengthens Smithfield's presence in the Western US, adding regional brands such as Farmer John and Saag's Specialty Meats to its portfolio.

  <p>
   Joseph Luter's father and grandfather set up Smithfield Foods in 1936 and built it into a regional pork producer. Luter began to manage the business in 1962 after his father died. In 1969 he sold the company to conglomerate Liberty Equities for $20 million and was retained as its manager, but he was soon dismissed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smithfield Foods foundered in his absence and grew weak from overexpansion and non-pork diversifications. Luter bought the business back in 1975, paying a fraction of what he had sold it for. At that time the company was a wholesaler of pork and fish products and was operating 27 seafood restaurants. Luter trimmed the fat to pay down debt, leaving only the pork operations. He then began to expand in the pork business through acquisitions, including Gwaltney Packing in 1982, thereby doubling its size. Other purchases included pork processors
   <company id="108597">
    Patrick Cudahy
   </company>
   (1985) and Esskay (1986).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed a joint venture with pork producer Carroll's Foods in 1987 to help lessen its dependence on Midwestern hog farmers. To move toward higher-quality pork, the joint venture acquired North American rights from National Pig Development (a UK-based, family-owned firm) for a long and lean English breed -- the NPD hog, which became the basis for the company's flagship brand, Smithfield Lean Generation Pork.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company co-founded Circle Four Farms, a giant hog farm in Utah, in 1994 with partners Murphy's Family Farms, Carroll's, and Prestage Farms. (Two years later it bought out the other partners.) Smithfield Foods also bought regional processors Valleydale Foods (1993) and John Morrell (1995) and struggling
   <company id="40288">
    Lykes Meat Group
   </company>
   (1996), thereby transforming it into a company with a national presence. In 1997 the company was ticketed with $12.6 million in fines by the
   <company id="130205">
    EPA
   </company>
   for water violations. The fine was later lowered by $6 million by an appellate court.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 1998, Smithfield Foods went shopping abroad, starting with Canadian meat processor Canada's
   <company id="57809">
    Schneider Corporation
   </company>
   and Société Bretonne de Salaisons, France's largest private-label maker of hams and bacon. In 1999 Smithfield bought a controlling interest in Poland's largest meat and poultry processor, Animex; purchased a 32% stake in one of Canada's largest pork processors,
   <company id="130916">
    Mitchell's Gourmet Foods
   </company>
   ; and formed a joint venture in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company acquired Murphy Family Farms for about $460 million, doubling its pig production. Later in 2000 Smithfield Foods entered a brisk bidding war to acquire beef and pork giant IBP Fresh Meats, but lost out to
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Now with a taste for beef, in 2001 Smithfield acquired midsized beef processors
   <company id="41262">
    Moyer Packing Company
   </company>
   (MOPAC) and Packerland Holdings. The company bought neighboring country-ham maker The Smithfield Companies. Smithfield then bought 50% of case-ready meat company,
   <company id="53702">
    Pinnacle Foods
   </company>
   , later re-named it Pennexx. Later that year the company set to expanding its ready-to-eat and deli lineup by acquiring bankrupt Gorges/Quik-to-Fix Foods and RMH Foods. Smithfield began a joint venture in late 2001 with Artal Holland to distribute processed meat products in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lower hog prices in 2002 caused Smithfield's first quarter profits to plummet by 80% despite gains from its newly acquired beef operations. To fatten up its deli offerings, in 2002 the company purchased Italian foods maker
   <company id="139136">
    Stefano Foods
   </company>
   for $35.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2003 Smithfield owned 41% of Pennexx, and stood as the company's largest lender. Mounting losses at Pennexx caused it to default on its loans from Smithfield. As part of the lending agreement, Smithfield took possession of Pennexx's assets in June of 2003. It then renamed the company
   <company id="104218">
    Showcase Foods, Inc
   </company>
   , and rolled it into its beef operations. However, the investment was deemed a money-losing failure and Smithfield shuttered the business in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite cries of anti-trust, in late 2003 Smithfield spent $367 million to purchase the
   <company id="140289">
    Farmland Foods
   </company>
   pork production and processing businesses from ailing cooperative
   <company id="40149">
    Farmland Industries
   </company>
   . The purchase gave Smithfield control of 27% of the US pork industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   With an eye on its overseas operations, in early 2004 Smithfield spent $88 million to purchase
   <company id="11977">
    Hormel's
   </company>
   15% share of Spanish meat processor Campofrìo Alimentacion. Later in the year, it went on to purchase additional shares, bringing its ownership up to 22%. By the end of 2004 Smithfield had purchased Campofrìo's Polish meat processing unit, Morliny. When combined with its ownership of Animex, the acquisition gave Smithfield control over 10% of Poland's domestic meat industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Elsewhere in the world, during 2004 Smithfield acquired UK fresh and processed meat companies Norwich Food Company and Ridpath Pek, then combined the two companies into
   <company id="135159">
    Smithfield Foods Ltd.
   </company>
   However, after acquiring and merging several meat processors in Canada, Smithfield sold all of its Canadian operations in the form of
   <company id="57809">
    Schneider Corporation
   </company>
   to
   <company id="54131">
    Maple Leaf Foods
   </company>
   for $378 million in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a restructuring in 2004
   <company id="11642">
    Winn-Dixie Stores
   </company>
   sold its Dixie Packers meat processing plant to Smithfield. Along with the purchase came an agreement to supply the grocery retailer with products from the plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before Smithfield lost its 2000 bidding war for IBP to Tyson, the company had snapped up shares of IBP as leverage. Even though all the shares were eventually sold off, the
   <company id="150279">
    Department of Justice
   </company>
   took a dim view of a portion of the purchase and filed an anti-trust suit seeking $5.5 million. Admitting no wrongdoing, Smithfield settled the suit in 2004, agreeing to pay $2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Smithfield acquired MF Cattle Feeding, which has operations in Colorado and Idaho. Later that year MF and ContiGroup subsidiary ContiBeef formed a 50-50 joint venture cattle-feeding business named Five Rivers Ranch Cattle Feeding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Extending its reach into Europe, in 2005 Smithfield purchased French meat processor Jean Caby for $466 million. In 2006 it purchased
   <company id="11323">
    Sara Lee
   </company>
   's European meats business for $575 million and the assumption of about $39 million in pension liabilities. Smithfield financed the purchase through a 50-50 joint venture with
   <company id="104234">
    Oaktree Capital Management
   </company>
   . Smithfield combined the Sara Lee operations with Jean Caby and named the new joint venture Groupe Smithfield.
  </p>
  <p>
   Back home the company added to its holdings, as well. The company purchased Cook's Ham from
   <company id="10388">
    ConAgra
   </company>
   in 2006 for about $260 million. Later that year, it purchased the bulk of ConAgra's refrigerated meats business for $571 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal included the Eckrich, Armour, LunchMakers, Margherita, and Longmont brands. The Butterball brand was sold to Carolina Turkeys (now
   <company id="113933">
    Butterball, LLC
   </company>
   ), of which Smithfield owns 49%. Not part of the deal were the Brown 'N Serve, Hebrew National, Pemmican, and Slim Jim brands, which ConAgra retains.
  </p>
  <p>
   After 31 years as Smithfield's CEO and chairman, Joseph Luter stepped down as CEO in 2006. However, he remained as non-executive chairman of the company. President and COO, C. Larry Pope, a 25-year veteran of Smithfield, succeeded Luter as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taking heed of the advancing Internet, Smithfield's specialty foods group launched a Web site (smithfieldincentives.com) in 2006. Designed to appeal to corporate-gift-givers, the site offers gourmet food products, including Smithfield meat products, as well as a line of sweets, nuts, desserts, and chocolate. The same year, company sold its subsidiary, value-added meat-product company,
   <company id="109267">
    Quik-to-Fix Foods
   </company>
   , to foodservice supplier
   <company id="116983">
    Advance Food
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. Later that year, Smithfield's subsidiary Smithfield Packing closed a pork packing plant in Virginia as it consolidated its East Coast processing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company paid $810 million (including $125 million in debt) for it in 2007. As the US's #1 pork processor and marketer, Smithfield's takeover of Premium Standard (the nation's #2 pork producer) created a pig-production powerhouse. Premium Standard brought brands such as All Natural, Fresh &amp; Tender, Lundy's, Natural Excellence, and Premium Farms to the Smithfield roster.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company merged its Groupe Smithfield Holdings with Spanish meat processor
   <company id="93310">
    Campofrio Alimentacion
   </company>
   in 2008. The all-stock transaction created a leading European meat processor. Smithfield owns 37% of the combined companies, which operate under the Campofrio Food Group name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beef was, at one time, an important part of Smithfield's diet. The company was once one of the largest beef processors in the US. However, in 2008 it sold its beef operations, Smithfield Beef Group (now JBS Packerland), and its feedlot joint venture Five Rivers Ranch Cattle Feeding to Brazilian meat giant JBS. Smithfield used the proceeds ($565 million in cash) from the sale to pay down debt. To sell the feedlot joint venture, Smithfield bought out the 50% interest that was owned by ContiGroup for some 2 million shares of its stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to get back in the black following the economic downturn, Smithfield sold its 49% holding in turkey producer Butterball to majority owner Maxwell Farms for $175 million in 2010. Maxwell Farms subsequently sold a 50% stake in the venture to agribusiness giant Seaboard Corporation for $177 million. (The deal followed an earlier attempt by Smithfield to buy out Maxwell Farms' stake for $200 million.) Smithfield has been using the proceeds from the deal to pay down debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2013, Shaunghui International Holdings Ltd. (now WH Group Ltd.) acquired Smithfield Foods for $34 per share, in a deal valued at approximately $7.1 billion, including the assumption of Smithfield's debt. Shaunghui International Holdings is China's largest meat processing enterprise and its largest publicly traded meat products company.
