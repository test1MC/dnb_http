   Imagination Technologies Group (ITG) puts its imagination to work enriching electronic entertainment. The company designs audio and video chips that are licensed to semiconductor and consumer device makers for use in mobile communications, computing, and consumer electronics gear. Its POWERVR chips are used in graphics, video, and display applications, while its ENSIGMA communications chips are used in audio-based electronics, such as mobile phones and digital radios. Its META processor chips are designed for use in multi-function peripheral devices. ITG also develops consumer products that use its technology, primarily digital radios, through its PURE Digital division.

  <p>
   ITG is big into letting other companies run with its imagination -- as long as they pay for them. About two-thirds of ITG's revenue comes from royalties and 22% is from licensing. Besides the POWERVR and ENSIGMA chips, ITG has MIPS CPUs as well as FlowCloud chips for cloud device applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another 10% of revenue is generated by ITG's PURE unit. It integrates ITG's technologies digital radio and multi-room wireless audio products. The unit also seeks new markets for ITG.

  <p>
   ITG is based near London, but maintains sales and support in the US, Europe, Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. Customers in the US accounted for 60% of sales in 2015 (ended April), followed by Asian customers with about 20%.

  <p>
   Revenue increased 4% in 2015 (ended April) over 2014 for ITG. Revenue from royalties rose 9% in 2015, pushed by a higher average royalty rate that produced by a better mix of products. The company reported a loss for 2015 after a slight profit in 2014. The company spent more onresearch and development and sales and administrative activities in 2015. Cash flow from operations also decreased from 2014 to 2015.

   ITG more narrowly focused the efforts of the PURE unit to work on areas that are directly related to the overall company efforts. Attention has been gathered around digital radio and wireless multi-room speaker technologies. As part of that effort, PURE released the Jongo X Series of speakers, based on its Caskeid multiroom technology, and the Voca rechargeable Bluetooth speaker. The products are examples of applying ITG's expertise in those areas toward offerings that are relevant to the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another area, ITG partnered with TSMC, the Taiwain-based semiconductor manufacturer, to develop subsystems for sensors connected to the Internet of Things. The products in development combine audio capabilities and low power use and range across the value and price spectrum.

  <p>
   Derek Maclaren and his son Anthony established VideoLogic in 1985 to design PC cards that convert TV signals to digital video. It developed its first product, a full-motion digital video adapter, in 1989. That year UK broadcast services company Avesco bought VideoLogic for Â£10 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the PC market grew, VideoLogic continued to develop products, including the Mediaspace video capture card in 1992 and a multimedia video accelerator in 1994. Late in 1994 Avesco spun off VideoLogic, which soon agreed to license its technology to Compaq Computer (now part of
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   ). The next year VideoLogic and Japanese electronics giant
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   agreed to develop 3-D graphics cards for PCs and set-top boxes. As part of the deal, NEC bought a small stake in the company.

   CEO Geoff Shingles replaced Derek Maclaren as chairman in 1996 as VideoLogic's PowerVR 3-D graphics chips hit the market. At the end of the next year Anthony Maclaren retired as CEO. Hossein Yassaie, the company's technical director, replaced him. In 1998 SEGA Enterprises (now
   <company id="42010">
    SEGA Corporation
   </company>
   ) chose VideoLogic's PowerVR chip to power its Dreamcast video game system.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 VideoLogic began focusing on entertainment and consumer electronics and changed its name to Imagination Technologies. (One division of the company retained the VideoLogic name.) The next year the company acquired Ensigma, a designer of chips for audio electronics, and in 2000 it formed its Metagence Technologies division to design digital signal processing (DSP) cores for communications and entertainment device applications.
