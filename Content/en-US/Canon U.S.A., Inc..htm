   Canon U.S.A. established its own research and development group in 2012 to work on medical devices. The move ramped up and in 2015 the company established Canon BioMedical, a subsidiary for its worldwide biomedical business.

   Expanding beyond imaging, the new unit conduct development, manufacturing and marketing operations related to Canon's life science and molecular diagnostics platform and look for uses for Canon technology into other medical fields. Potential markets include life science, health care, and medical analysis. The company also will look for strategic partnerships to leverage its technologies.

   One such deal is with Spartan Bioscience, which develops on-demand DNA testing. Canon invested in Spartan to help pay for the R&amp;D of diagnostic testing products. Possible products include those for rapid genetic testing.

   Canon U.S. Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Canon U.S.A., is collaborating with T2 Biosystems to develop a diagnostic test panel for rapidly detecting Lyme disease, a tick-born bacterial infection that can cause joint inflammation, neurological disorders, and cognitive defects. Faster detection of Lyme disease can improve outcomes.
