   Repeat after Forbes: Capitalism is good! The company publishes the biweekly business magazine
   <em>
    Forbes
   </em>
   , long promoted as the "Capitalist Tool." It also publishes a handful of other magazines, including
   <em>
    ForbesLife
   </em>
   , a lifestyle magazine for business leaders. Forbes Web properties include sites such as Forbes.com, Investopedia.com, and RealClearPolitics.com. In addition, the company produces business-related conferences and publishes newsletters and custom magazines. Scottish immigrant and journalist B.C. Forbes launched
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   in 1917. Chairman and former CEO Malcolm "Steve" Forbes is B.C.'s grandson.  Forbes is majority-owned by private equity firm Elevation Partners.

  <p>
   In addition to its flagship magazine, Forbes has international editions such as
   <em>
    Forbes Asia
   </em>
   , and about ten other local-language editions. While
   <em>
    Forbes
   </em>
   has a North American circulation of of more than 900,000, its global print editions together reach a worldwide audience of more than 6 million readers. The company also produces TV programming (such as
   <em>
    Forbes on FOX
   </em>
   through a partnership with
   <company id="112317">
    FOX News
   </company>
   ). Its Forbes Newsletter Group publishes and edits newsletters such as
   <em>
    Forbes Growth Investor
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Forbes/Lehmann Income Securities Investor

   In an industry plagued by a decrease in advertising revenues, Forbes has taken cost-cutting measures in recent years, including layoffs and combining its print and Web staffs (both sales and editorial). In 2011 the company launched a redesign of Forbes.com with re-architectured channel pages such as business, investing, and technology.

   Scottish immigrant B.C. Forbes launched
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   ("devoted to doers and doings") in 1917. Son Malcolm began to focus on the family business after being badly wounded in WWII. Malcolm convinced B.C. to have
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   introduce an annual feature highlighting top corporations in 1949, a feature that would evolve into the in-depth
   <i>
    Forbes 500
   </i>
   issue. Malcolm's brother Bruce ran the business following the death of B.C. in 1954 and was succeeded by Malcolm in 1964.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next 25 years the bon vivant Malcolm built the magazine into a leading business publication. In 1986 his company acquired the struggling history magazine
   <i>
    American Heritage
   </i>
   and turned it into a fast-growing publication. Malcolm persuaded Caspar Weinberger, the former defense secretary, to become publisher of
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   in 1989. Malcolm died in 1990, and his eldest son Steve, deputy editor-in-chief of
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   since 1982, took over the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   continued to prosper under Steve's leadership, with its advertising revenue far outpacing that of archrival
   <i>
    FORTUNE
   </i>
   . In 1995 Steve Forbes threw his hat into the ring as a presidential candidate, a boon for
   <i>
    Forbes'
   </i>
   visibility. In 1997 Forbes sold its Forbes Newspapers to MediaNews Group's North Jersey Newspapers and bought the New York Times Company's custom publishing unit. The next year Forbes named West Coast high-tech evangelist Rich Karlgaard
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   publisher (Weinberger is now chairman).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Forbes named James Berrien (former head of American Express Travelers Cheque Group) as president of
   <i>
    Forbes
   </i>
   magazine. In 2000 Forbes sold its academic custom publishing division to Thomson Learning. The company teamed with the WPP Group in 2001 to create a custom publishing venture called the Custom Media Group.
   <i>
    Forbes ASAP
   </i>
   , the company's magazine focused on the digital economy, was shut down in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company established a
   <em>
    Forbes Russia
   </em>
   edition in 2004, and shortly thereafter tragedy struck when the magazine's editor, Paul Klebnikov, was shot and killed while leaving the Moscow office
  </p>
  <p>
   Caspar Weinberger died in 2006. Weinberger was chairman and a regular
   <em>
    Forbes
   </em>
   columnist until is death at age 88. Also that year Elevation Partners invested about $300 million in the publisher.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Forbes put its more than 50-year-old
   <em>
    American Heritage
   </em>
   title up for sale.  In the absence of a buyer the company decided to cease publication of the title. In 2008 the company merged its print and Web staffs in order to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company hired Mike Perlis as its new CEO in 2010. Steve Forbes continue to serve as chairman and editor in chief of
   <em>
    Forbes
   </em>
   magazine.
