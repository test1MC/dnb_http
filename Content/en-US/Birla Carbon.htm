   Columbian Chemicals likes to be in the black -- carbon black, that is. The
   <company id="138355">
    Aditya Birla Management Corporation
   </company>
   company manufactures carbon black, a material used in the production of rubber, plastic, liquid, and other industrial applications, including inks and coatings, rubber goods (especially tires), and plastics. Columbian's carbon blacks come in two grades: industrial (sold under the brand names Raven, Conductex, and Copeblack) and rubber (Statex and Furnex). Carbon black can also be used as an ingredient in fuel cells. Columbian is a part of Aditya Birla Management Corporation's carbon black business, Birla Carbon.

   Boosting its global market share, India's
   <company id="138355">
    Aditya Birla Management Corporation
   </company>
   acquired Columbian Chemicals for about $875 million in 2011. The deal made the Indian company the world's largest carbon black producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The purchase doubled Aditya Birla Management Corporation's global carbon black production capacity from 1 million metric tons to 2 million metric tons, and complemented the operations of
   <company id="138358">
    Aditya Birla Nuvo
   </company>
   . The deal also gave the parent company a foothold in North and South American carbon black markets, and strengthened its position in Europe and in emerging markets. With the addition of Columbian, the parent company now ranks as the world's leading carbon black producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   After acquiring Columbian, Aditya Birla Group moved to unify its global carbon black businesses under one umbrella starting in 2012. Columbian Chemicals, now a division of Birla Carbon, continues to operate as a separate legal entity but reports to the top  management team in India. Birla Carbon's footprint extends across 12 countries with 17 manufacturing facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2012, the company began an expansion evaluation at its manufacturing facility in Ontario, Canada. The company will confirm the feasibility of a new production capacity (for an estimated 45,000 metric tons of carbon black) and a state-of-the-art energy center.
