   Hayward Industries, a manufacturer of swimming pool equipment, encourages folks to take the plunge. Its work is divided between residential pool products; commercial pools; and flow control. The residential arm, the industry's largest, produces cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps, and other pool-related accessories, including safety barriers and vacuum release systems. It also distributes fiber-optic lighting designed to illuminate pools and backyards. The commercial division caters to pool professionals, and the flow control division makes thermoplastic valves and process controls.

  <p>
   Stationed in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Hayward operates in North America, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through its sales organizations, distributors, and over 3,000 dealer partners. Hayward also markets its products in Asia, Australia, Latin America, and the Middle East through its subsidiary, Hayward Meridian, via a network of Advantage distributors.

  <p>
   Much of the company's substantial share of residential pool market share is attributable to its growing global presence and stream of strategic acquisitions. Over the years Hayward has opened a new sales and marketing office in Shanghai. The move enabled Hayward to capture demand in China as well as serves as a base for its Asia operations.

   Simultaneously, Hayward invests heavily in new patented product development. Its launches have included an ornamental pump design, energy-efficient SunRay and King Ray pool skimmers, and its Stratum VRS (vacuum release system), which helps prevent entrapment by suction. The company has also made strides in improving its supply chain by encouraging vendors to conform to its just-in-time manufacturing practices.

  <p>
   Hayward also uses acquisitions as a means for enhancing its product mix. In late 2013 it obtained California-based Poolvergnuegen, a leading manufacturer and marketer of pool cleaners branded under The PoolCleaner name.
