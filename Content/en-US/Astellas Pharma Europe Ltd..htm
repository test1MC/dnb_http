   Revenues for Astellas Pharma Europe rose 36% to Â¥264.3 billion in 2014, representing 22% of total global Astellas sales. Sales of Betmiga and Xtandi, both launched in 2013, helped contribute to the rise. Additionally, sales of Vesicare and other products including Mycamine grew, while sales of Program and Eligard increased primarily due to foreign exchange rate impact.

  <p>
   Though still two of its biggest sellers, the company is seeing the effects of patent expirations on Omnic and Prograf in the form of slumping sales from increased generic competition. It is counting on sales from its newer drugs, including urology treatments Vesicare and Eligard, as well as a once-daily version of Prograf called Advagraf, to help make up some of those sales. Astellas Pharma Europe is also building up its development pipeline in areas including transplantation, infectious disease, oncology, neurology, and inflammation and immunology disorders to help counter the effect of patent expirations.

   In 2014, the European Commission approved Xtandi (enzalutamide) for the treatment of adult men with prostrate cancer.
