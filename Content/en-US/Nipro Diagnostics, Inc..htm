   Whether home or abroad, Trividia Health (formerly Nipro Diagnostics) makes sure diabetics are kept healthy with the help of a little Sidekick. The firm makes blood glucose monitoring systems and disposable supplies for diabetics, which it sells through retail pharmacies, mass merchandisers, managed care companies, mail service providers, and distributors around the globe. Trividia markets its testing systems and blood monitors through those distribution channels in two ways, under its own brand names -- including Sidekick, TRUEtrack Smart System, and TRUEread -- and through co-branded partnerships. Nipro Corporation sold Nipro Diagnostics to China-based Sinocare Group for some $273 million in early 2016.

   The then-named Home Diagnostics agreed to the $215 million public share tender offer takeover in 2010 as a way to increase its product offerings and geographic scope with Nipro's complementary line of diabetes products, which include dialysis syringes, tubing, and needles. Shortly after the acquisition was complete, Nipro announced it would merge the former Home Diagnostics with another of its business units, Nipro Diabetes Systems, to form a new company called Nipro Diagnostics.

   The company works to enhance its offerings by developing products that increase convenience and ease-of-use for diabetics. Nipro Diagnostics is also focusing its efforts on expanding in the managed care market. By contracting with pharmacy benefits managers, regional health plans, and state Medicaid programs, the company can more effectively reach the managed care members.
