   ConvaTec winds its way around wicked wounds. The company makes wound cleansers, dressings, bandages, wound hydration products, and a negative pressure wound therapy system. Its products are designed to foster the management and healing of wounds and address such issues as wound dryness and severity. ConvaTec's additional products include ostomy pouching systems, which allow patients with artificial openings (or stomas) to dispose of bodily waste into attachable pouches. It also makes lines of continence, critical care, and infusion products. ConvaTec, which manufactures its products in Europe and the US and distributes worldwide, is owned by private equity firms Nordic Capital and Avista Capital Partners.

  <p>
   Ostomy and wound care are the company's largest segments, respectively accounting for 36% and 31% of sales in 2013. In addition to its Esteem and Natura-branded ostomy pouching systems, the ostomy division makes and sells accessories and skin care products including skin barrier strips and adhesive removal wipes. The wound care division is focused on advanced, moist wound healing materials such as hydrocolloid, hydrofiber, and antimicrobial dressings; such products are sold under brands including AQUACEL and DuoDERM.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its smaller infusion and industrial sales division (part of the Unomedical subsidiary), the firm makes infusion systems that are primarily sold to insulin pump manufacturers; the unit also sells single-use medical supplies to original equipment manufacturers. Infusion brands include Quick-set, mio, Sure-T, and Comfort. Unomedical's continence and critical care division makes fecal management and urinary continence systems, as well as patient monitors, sterile single-use catheters, wound drainage systems, and airway management devices.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConvaTec has operations in nearly 40 countries, including about a dozen manufacturing and warehouse facilities in eight countries (Belarus, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, Slovakia, the UK, and the US), while its products are sold in more than 100 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConvaTec employs direct sales forces, which market its wares to wholesale distributors, delivery providers, and health care facilities in the US, Germany, France, Spain, and the UK. The company's products are marketed in other countries through third-party representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConvaTec has about 30 owned or managed warehouse location, as well as 30 external distribution centers in small country markets. In the UK and the US, the company distributes certain medical supplies directly to consumers through its Amcare and 180 Medical home delivery service units.
  </p>

  <p>
   ConvaTec reported a 3% increase in revenues in 2013 to about $1.7 billion from some $1.6 billion in 2012 due to growth in its Continence &amp; Critical Care segment. Overall sales in emerging markets also contributed to rising revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   However expenses from moving the company's corporate HQ, impairment of assets, and increased sales and marketing expenses lead to increased net loss of $174 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, cash from operations grew by $40 million to $229 million due to cost control measures and contributions from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConvaTec grows its business through new product development and ongoing research to support the use of its existing products. The company has annual R&amp;D expenses between $45 million and $55 million. It also acquires and licenses technologies from other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched Clear Zinc skin care protectant for diaper rash and other incontinence-associated skin issues. It also launched Ostomysecrets in Europe (including establishing e-commerce web sites in the UK, Germany, and Italy).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also works to retain and grow its business through customer relationship management, brand expansion into new markets, and marketing programs geared towards high-growth markets. ConvaTec hopes to also increase sales to industrial customers, who use the company's products as components within their own products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConvaTec makes a regular stream of small acquisitions to expand its product and service offerings, as well as its geographic presence. In 2014 the company purchased Symbius Medical, a home medical supply company, to improve its home delivery services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConvaTec began in 1978 as a Squibb division that focused on developing ostomy care products. ConvaTec later became part of
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Meyers Squibb
   </company>
   's miscellaneous healthcare products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, as part of its efforts to focus on pharmaceuticals, in 2008 BMS sold ConvaTec to two private equity firms, Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital, for some $4.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after the sale, ConvaTec acquired Nordic Capital's Danish medical equipment company Unomedical to expand into Europe and the infusion market, though it had to divest the Unomedical wound care division in early 2009 to satisfy the EU Competition Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also divested Unomedical's custom procedure pack division in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired AbViser medical, adding to its critical care offerings with an abdominal pressure monitoring system. It also purchased Trio Healthcare, a UK maker of ostomy devices, and 180 Medical, a US ostomy supply firm. The purchase of 180 Medical established ConvaTec's presence in the US home delivery market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To balance its expansion measures, the company occasionally divests assets. In 2012, for instance, its Unomedical unit sold its electrodes product line to Denmark-based device maker Ambu. In addition, ConvaTec is working to control expenses by rationalizing its manufacturing and distribution facilities and by streamlining procurement and other operational processes.
