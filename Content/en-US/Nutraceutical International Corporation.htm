  <p>
   The vertically integrated company is engaged in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale (through its own stores and those operated by others) of its branded nutritional supplements. It manufactures about 80% of its branded products. Third-party manufacturers supply the balance, including supplements, herbs, and body care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also distributes some products for other manufacturers. Its Monarch Nutraceuticals subsidiary manufactures bulk ingredients used in its own products and sold to other manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Retailing is only one corner of its sales; more comes from selling its products in other retail stores including independent health and natural food stores; health and natural food stores affiliated with local, regional, and national chains (such as
   <company id="10952">
    Whole Foods Markets
   </company>
   ); and vitamin store chains such as the
   <company id="60695">
    Vitamin Shoppe
   </company>
   and
   <company id="15942">
    GNC
   </company>
   stores.

  <p>
   Nutraceutical International has posted several years of revenue increases and fiscal 2016 (ended September) was no exception. The 8% increase, to $233 million, was driven by branded product sales growth, both abroad and in the US. Net income also grew, rising 22% to $18.7 million, due to the higher revenue.

  <p>
   Formed with the goal of consolidating a fragmented industry, Nutraceutical International has steadily bulked up its product lines and manufacturing and distribution capacity through more than 50 acquisitions since 1993. In fiscal 2016 (ended September), it acquired two businesses -- certain operating assets of Dynamic Health Laboratories and Aubrey Organics (for a total of $26.2 million in cash).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focused on introducing new products and packages to its growing consumer base. During fiscal 2016 it introduced some 200 new stock keeping units (SKUs), bringing its total to some 17,500 individual SKUs.
