   Ducati puts up its Dukes when it deals with Monsters. Ducati Motor, whose red racing machines are known as "Dukes," builds Monster high-performance motorcycles; it also makes sports bikes (Multistrada and SportClassic) and a branded line of clothing. Many "Ducatists" prefer performance over comfort, but Ducati has expanded into new markets with products such as touring bikes and a supermoto model. It operates more than 150 Ducati Stores in major Italian cities, as well as in Cape Town, Frankfurt, London, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo. Italy and the US are the company's largest single markets.

   is buying Ducati from Investindustrial Group subsidiary International Motorcycles for an undisclosed amount.

  <p>
   Bologna's Ducati family founded Ducati Motor Holding in 1926 as the Società Radio Brevetti Ducati, a builder of radio equipment. During WWII, the company's plant in Bologna was destroyed. In 1946 the Ducati brothers began producing a small motor to be attached to bicycles. The company soon put the motor on a special frame of its own and produced its first motorcycle, the miniature Cucciolo.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cucciolo, and later full-sized models, established the Ducati name in the world of motorcycles. During the 1960s Ducati bewitched fans with its 450 Mark 3D, capable of speeds in excess of 100 mph. Claudio and Gianfranco Castiglioni bought Ducati in 1983 and moved the company into the Cagiva Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company excelled at racing during the 1990s, it didn't fare well financially under Cagiva Group's leadership. In 1996 investment firm Texas Pacific Group became Ducati's largest shareholder and turned the company around.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ducati is riding a strategy that combines the characteristics of its traditional high-performance/racing motorcycle with those of a touring machine. With its affiliate, Gio.Ca.Moto, Ducati has entered the market for high-performance motorcycle accessories. After having been a privately owned company since 1926, Ducati went public in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shifting gears from the racetrack to the Internet, the company sold the entire first year's production of its MH900e motorcycle through the Web in just a few hours on January 1, 2000. The last surviving founder of the company, Bruno Cavalieri Ducati, died in 2001 at the age of 96.
