   Even if your favorite restaurant is closed for the day, you can still try to reserve a table through OpenTable. The firm provides online restaurant reservations, seating more than 16 million diners per month via online bookings across more than 32,000 restaurants. The service is free to diners, but OpenTable charges participating restaurants an installation and monthly license fee for its Electronic Reservation Book (ERB), a computerized reservation system. Since its founding in 1998, OpenTable has seated more than 800 million diners. In 2014 online travel group
