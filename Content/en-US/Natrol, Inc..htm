   From supporting your sleep to bolstering your bulk-up, Natrol turns to nature for its cures. The company, a subsidiary of India-based Aurobindo Pharma, manufactures and markets a variety of health-related products, including dietary supplements, herbal teas, nutraceutical ingredients, and sports nutrition products. The firm sells its products online and through supermarkets, drugstores, retail chains, and health food stores in the US and abroad. Some of Natrol's biggest selling brands include its Natrol supplements, the Laci Le Beau dieter's teas, the Prolab Nutrition sports nutrition products, and the Promensil and Trinovin supplements for menopausal women and prostate health, respectively.

  <p>
   Natrol filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014 the day after judges consolidated several class action suits that had been filed against the firm. The legal actions, filed in California, Illinois, and New York, accused the company of falsely marketing its joint relief products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, the US arm of Aurobindo Pharma acquired Natrol -- including its manufacturing assets, personnel, commercial infrastructure, and nutraceutical brands -- for $132.5 million.

  <p>
   The Natrol brand focuses on supplements that are in high demand as well as specialty niche and proprietary formulations. In the US, its core strategy has been to build brands within the channels of distribution that are appropriate for each brand and to develop increased brand awareness and strong brand recognition among consumers. It also pursues acquisitions and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   Natrol's second largest brand umbrella is MRI, which develops markets and distributes sports nutrition products (NO2, Black Powder, CE2, Pro-Nos, HSP Active, WAR and Anabolic Switch). The Prolab sports nutrition line is targeted at body builders and physical fitness enthusiasts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to broaden its customer base, Natrol's website is designed with an eye toward roping in more retail consumers. The site offers its line of products for sale online as well as various "tools" meant to help potential buyers determine which of its supplements are best suited to them. Natrol also has its own
