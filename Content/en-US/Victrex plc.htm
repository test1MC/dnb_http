   Victrex's secret to success is its polyether ether ketone (PEEK) polymer. The company's primary product, the PEEK polymer is a thermoplastic that Victrex markets to the world. The company's products are used in aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, industrial, medical and semiconductor industry. Among the qualities imparted by PEEK are strength, wear resistance, high-temperature performance, and even radiation resistance. Victrex has plants in the UK and sells its products in more than 40 countries worldwide. The company also operates a biomaterials unit, Invibio Biomaterial Solutions, which provides access to specialized biocompatible PEEK-based materials and services for medical device manufacturers.

   In fiscal 2014 Victrex's revenues grew by 14% due to higher Victrex Polymer Solutions and Invibio Biomaterial Solutions sales, led by a 36% in Asia/Pacific revenues. The company's net income increased by 10% as the result of higher revenues and a decline in operating expenses.

  <p>
   Victrex is looking to steadily transform itself from its historic manufacturing and polymer sales focus into a more integrated global solutions provider, including working with customers on short, medium, and long term development programs. This strategy is supported by a significant investment in new production capacity, due to come online in 2015. The increased capacity will open the door to commercial discussions with a wider range of potential customers.

   Victrex has collaborated with Tri-Mack Plastics Manufacturing, a molder of high temperature thermoplastic resins and composites for the aerospace sector, to deliver unique structural aircraft products. Through this alliance, in 2014 Victrex launched a new polyaryletherketone (PAEK)-based polymer and an innovative hybrid molding technology. This allows engineers to overmold a PAEK-based composite with fiber-reinforced PEEK injection molding materials to design stronger, lower-cost components that are up to 60% lighter than typical metal and thermoset systems.
