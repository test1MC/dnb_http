   Hearst has had success keeping costs down and managing the transition from print to digital.  Hearst Magazines formed a unit called Hearst Magazines Digital Media, through which it publishes apps and digital editions of its magazines. Included in the enhanced digital issues for the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Droid platform is special content and games based on its brands. These efforts follow Hearst's formation of a joint venture with

  <p>
   William Randolph Hearst, son of a California mining magnate, started as a reporter -- having been expelled from Harvard in 1884 for playing jokes on professors. In 1887 he became editor of the
   <i>
    San Francisco Examiner,
   </i>
   which his father had obtained as payment for a gambling debt. In 1895 he bought the
   <i>
    New York Morning Journal
   </i>
   and competed against Joseph Pulitzer's
   <em>
    New York World
   </em>
   . The "yellow journalism" resulting from that rivalry characterized American-style reporting at the turn of the century.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hearst branched into magazines (1903), film (1913), and radio (1928). Also during this time it created the Hearst International News Service (it was sold to E.W. Scripps' United Press in 1958 to form United Press International). By 1935 Hearst was at its peak, with newspapers in 19 cities, the largest syndicate (King Features), international news and photo services, 13 magazines, eight radio stations, and two motion picture companies. Two years later Hearst relinquished control of the company to avoid bankruptcy, selling movie companies, radio stations, magazines, and, later, most of his San Simeon estate. (Hearst's rise and fall inspired the 1941 film
   <i>
    Citizen Kane.
   </i>
   )
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1948 Hearst became the owner of one of the US's first TV stations, WBAL-TV in Baltimore. When Hearst died in 1951, company veteran Richard Berlin became CEO. Berlin sold off failing newspapers, moved into television, and acquired more magazines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frank Bennack, tapped as CEO in 1979, expanded the company, acquiring newspapers, publishing firms (notably William Morrow, 1981), TV stations, magazines (
   <i>
    Redbook,
   </i>
   1982;
   <i>
    Esquire,
   </i>
   1986), and 20% of cable sports network ESPN (1991). Hearst branched into video via a joint venture with Capital Cities/ABC (1981) and helped launch the Lifetime and Arts &amp; Entertainment cable channels (1984).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Hearst joined with Continental Cablevision to launch a New England cable news network (sold to
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   in 2009). The following year Hearst brought on board former Federal Communications Commission chairman Alfred Sikes, who quickly moved the company onto the Internet. In 1996 Randolph A. Hearst passed the title of chairman to nephew George Hearst (the last surviving son of the founder, Randolph died in 2000). Broadcaster Argyle Television merged with Hearst's TV holdings in 1997 to form publicly traded Hearst-Argyle Television.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Hearst combined its HomeArts website with Women.com to create one of the largest online networks for women. In addition, it joined with
   <company id="104036">
    Miramax Films
   </company>
   to publish entertainment magazine
   <i>
    Talk
   </i>
   (shut down in 2001) and Oprah Winfrey's
   <company id="42591">
    Harpo Entertainment
   </company>
   to publish
   <i>
    O, The Oprah Magazine
   </i>
   (launched in 2000). The company sold its book publishing operations to News Corp.'s
   <company id="43658">
    HarperCollins
   </company>
   unit in 1999. It also agreed to buy the
   <i>
    San Francisco Chronicle
   </i>
   from rival Chronicle Publishing. That deal was called into question over concerns that the
   <i>
    San Francisco Examiner
   </i>
   would not survive and the city would be left with one major paper. To resolve the issue, the next year Hearst sold the
   <i>
    Examiner
   </i>
   to ExIn (a group of investors affiliated with the Ted Fang family and other owners of the
   <i>
    San Francisco Independent
   </i>
   ). Also in 2000 Hearst bought the UK magazines of
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner + Jahr
   </company>
   , the newspaper and magazine unit of German media juggernaut
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Hearst gained a 30% stake in
   <company id="52464">
    iVillage
   </company>
   following that company's purchase of rival Women.com Networks. In mid-2002 Victor Ganzi took over as CEO and president following Bennack's retirement from these positions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the selling power of its popular
   <i>
    Cosmopolitan
   </i>
   magazine, the company capitalized with a TV channel in Spain based on the magazine. It then added another one in Latin America. Hearst hasn't been so lucky when trying to take the trend in the other direction. The firm launched
   <i>
    Lifetime
   </i>
   magazine in 2003 with women's cable channel Lifetime. However, the magazine fared poorly and ceased publication in late 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hearst further expanded its potent stable of magazines in 2003 by purchasing
   <i>
    Seventeen
   </i>
   magazine from
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   . In addition to the magazine, the deal (valued at $182 million) included the purchase of
   <i>
    Teen
   </i>
   magazine and school marketing business Cover Concepts. Hearst also became a major player in yellow page publishing with its 2004 purchase of White Directory Publishers, one of the largest telephone directory companies in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its 25% stake in women's Web network
   <company id="52464">
    iVillage
   </company>
   . Also that year Hearst backed
   <company id="41223">
    MediaNews
   </company>
   when that company paid $1 billion to acquire four newspapers (including the
   <em>
    San Jose Mercury News
   </em>
   , the
   <em>
    Contra Costa Times
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    St. Paul Pioneer Press)
   </em>
   from
   <company id="10971">
    McClatchy
   </company>
   .  Hearst purchased a 30% interest in MediaNews Group the next year - a carefully structured investment that did not include any of MediaNews' San Francisco holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Hearst ponied up about $100 million to acquire
   <company id="117850">
    UGO Entertainment
   </company>
   , which operates a website targeting young men in the 18-34 demographic with a mix of movie reviews, sports stories, video game previews, and racy pictorials. (It sold all but a minority stake in UGO to News Corp.'s
   <company id="61331">
    IGN Entertainment
   </company>
   in 2011.) In 2008 Hearst ceased publication of
   <em>
    CosmoGirl
   </em>
   and consolidated its teen publishing activities into
   <em>
    Seventeen
   </em>
   (the
   <em>
    CosmoGirl
   </em>
   brand continues to operate at cosmogirl.com).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2008 Hearst partnered with
   <company id="139296">
    MSN
   </company>
   to launch online food destination Delish.com. Also that year the company partnered with real estate website
   <company id="148451">
    Zillow.com
   </company>
   and other newspaper companies to launch an online real estate advertising network. This follows Hearst's 2008 partnership with
   <company id="163382">
    Gannett
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12184">
    New York Times
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="163305">
    tronc
   </company>
   to form quadrantONE, a national online advertising network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former president and CEO Victor Ganzi resigned from his position in 2008. The company cited "irreconcilable policy differences with the Board of Trustees about the future direction of the company" as the reason for his leaving. Vice chairman (and previous company head) Frank Bennack reassumed the role of CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Hearst published the last print edition of its
   <em>
    Seattle Post-Intelligencer
   </em>
   in response to the massive decline in newspaper advertising and newsstand sales. Hearst had owned the newspaper, which has had operating losses for nearly a decade, since 1921; it now operates a Web-only version, and is the largest American newspaper to make the leap from print to the exclusively digital format. The company additionally responded to hard times with job cuts and renting office space in its building.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company instead boosted its involvement in television broadcasting in 2009, when it acquired the remaining shares it didn't already own in Hearst Television (formerly Hearst-Argyle). The business operates about 30 TV stations in about two dozen markets. The buyout offer valued the business at more than $400 million. (Shareholders had previously rejected a $600 million buyout in 2007 before the recession began to have a negative impact on advertising revenue and Hearst Television's stock price.) Also in 2009 Hearst's A&amp;E expanded when it acquired cable network
   <company id="47291">
    Lifetime Entertainment Services
   </company>
   . The deal added women's networks Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network, and Lifetime Real Women into the fold.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Hearst sold its 50% stake in
   <company id="127196">
    SmartMoney
   </company>
   to
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   (the financial news publisher had previously been a joint venture between Hearst and Dow Jones). Later that year Hearst acquired digital marketing firm iCrossing. In 2011 it acquired several magazines from French publisher
   <company id="41009">
    Lagardère
   </company>
   , including the rights to
   <em>
    Elle
   </em>
   magazine outside of France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company Chairman George R. Hearst, Jr.,  is a grandson of founder William Randolph Hearst. Although the company no longer owns Hearst Castle (deeded to the State of California in 1951), it has extensive real estate holdings. Projects include the Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, California, and the Hearst Tower in New York. In addition, The Hearst Foundation and the William Randolph Hearst Foundation are independent private philanthropies operating separately from The Hearst Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon his death William Randolph Hearst left 99% of the company's common stock to two charitable trusts controlled by a 13-member board that includes five family and eight nonfamily members. The will includes a clause that allows the trustees to disinherit any heir who contests the will.
