   Although bearings and seals are core product lines, the company isn't just focused on traditional hardware. It is increasingly launching performance-based products that help to extend the lifecycle of those bearings and seals. Recent products include a portable, user-friendly technology for performing bearing grease condition assessments directly in the field. It offers a hydraulic-driven lubricator that eliminates the need for manual lubrication of construction and off-highway equipment attachments. And the product line perhaps showing the most promising growth is its "smart" condition monitoring systems, which consist of hardware and software, and in some cases sensors, that work together to collect, store, and analyze data.

   SKF USA markets its condition monitoring systems particularly to alternative energy customers in the US, a market that is experiencing good growth as a result of tightening environmental regulations.
