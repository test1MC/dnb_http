  <p>
   Disc Makers has found innovative ways to deal with the music industry downturn. In addition to discs, the company produces promotional materials, such as T-shirts, hats, postcards, and stickers. It also offers Web hosting services.

  <p>
   While CD sales in general have been plummeting in recent years thanks to digital music's rise in popularity, independent artists still find merit in distributing physical albums, and Disc Makers has managed to expand.
