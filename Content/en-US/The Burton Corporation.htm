   The Burton Corporation made snowboards before boardsports became extreme. The company, doing business as Burton Snowboards, is the world's leading snowboard manufacturer. It also makes a growing lineup of men's, women's, and youth snowboarding apparel, eyewear, boots, bindings, and packs under its namesake, as well as the AK, Anon, and RED brands. The company operates through a network of about a dozen retail shops and factory outlets in the US, Austria, and Japan. It also sells gear through sporting goods stores and online retailers, such as

    Altrec.com
   </company>
   and
   <company id="133992">
    Snow &amp; Rock Sports
   </company>
   . Taking to the beach, Burton owns surfboard maker Channel Island Surfboards, whose goods are available at surf shops worldwide.

   To promote the sport of snowboarding and its own snowboards, Burton owns and runs five of the largest snowboard events in the world: the US Open, Canadian Open, European Open, Australian Open, and the Asian Open. It also sponsors world-class athletes, including Shaun White and Mark McMorris. The popularity of boardsports has soared, fueled by the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia and broad media coverage of professional events and colorful competitors. In 2013, Burton selected Danny Davis as a head-to-toe Burton athlete with a deal that included outerwear, apparel, and equipment.

   Burton strategically aims to spur sales in part by expanding its snowboarding offerings for younger kids. The company in 2012 launched a lineup of smaller gear with graphics that appeal to children. Targeting demand outside the sport, Burton teamed up with adidas to design a co-branded line of streetwear-inspired cold-weather clothing and shoes for men. The limited-edition collection launched in late 2010 at adidas Originals and Burton flagship stores. Burton has also turned to marketing through a mobile app that engages users by offering to push notifications of fresh snowfall alerts.

   In 2014 the company closed its warehouse operations in New York and Quebec, to focus on centralizing its distribution operations at its facility in Columbus, Ohio. In 2013 it opened new stores in the Washington, DC metro area and in New Jersey.

   After receiving a $20,000 inheritance, Jake Burton Carpenter left his Park Avenue investment job in 1977 at age 23 to start Burton Snowboards (he later dropped Carpenter as his last name to avoid confusion). Burton's desire to surf down mountains started in the late 1960s, when he received a Snurfer for Christmas. Invented by Sherman Poppen in 1965, the Snurfer consisted of two skis bound together with a rope attached to the front for steering. Although marketing blunders caused the Snurfer to fizzle, Burton never forgot the device. Using a friend's woodshop, he began work in 1977 to build a better Snurfer.

   The first three years were tough, as Burton spent about $100,000 and sold fewer than 1,500 snowboards. Still determined to succeed, Burton took on extra jobs and converted a house and barn in Manchester, Vermont, into his factory, headquarters, and showroom. By the early 1980s sales were growing steadily, but the real break came in 1983, when Vermont's Stratton Mountain became the first ski resort to allow snowboarders. For the rest of the decade, Burton sent employees to more than 300 resorts to lobby for his new sport.

   By the 1990s snowboarding had reached the mainstream, although the sport retained its independent, rugged image. A horde of competitors was spawned (by 1995 there were about 300 snowboard companies), but Burton Snowboards retained its place as the leader. The sport became an Olympic event in 1998, yet preserved its rebel image when the gold medal winner, Ross Rebagliati, tested positive for marijuana. The following year Burton Snowboards launched a shoe line under the Gravis label aimed at its core snowboarding audience. In 2000 the company completely redesigned its boot manufacturing system to produce half-size snowboard boots in addition to whole sizes.

   Burton Snowboards introduced the Junkyard in 2001, a snowboard without bindings known as a snowdeck. For the first time in its history, the company cut its workforce by 10%, or about 60 employees, in April 2002. The company blamed poor weather conditions for decreased sales.

   Burton Snowboards moved its Analog brand apparel operations to California in May 2004. Analog was originally the company's line of high-end outerwear that was expanded in late 2003 to include jeans, shirts, and jackets. The move brings the streetwear line closer to the "trenches" of the surfing and skateboarding industries.

   In August the company acquired snowboard brands Forum (snowboards), Foursquare (outerwear), Jeenyus (snowboards), and Special Blend (outerwear) from sports gear and apparel maker Four Star Distribution.

   In December 2005, Burton launched the Bluetooth-enabled Audex jacket, which was developed jointly with

   . The jacket allows wearers to enjoy hands-free communication and entertainment using Bluetooth technology.

   At the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, Burton sponsored snowboarders Shaun White and Hannah Teter, both of whom won Olympic gold medals.

   The snowboard maker took to the beach in 2006 with its acquisition of Santa Barbara, California-based Channel Island Surfboards.

   In May 2010 CEO Laurent Potdevin resigned to pursue other opportunities. Potdevin had been with Burton for 15 years.
