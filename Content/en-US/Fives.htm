   Fives has grown through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it picked up Lund Engineering, an engineering firm known for designing and building electro-mechanical equipment for the manufacture of composite aerospace structures and components. In the same year, Fives obtained Bryant Grinder's technology and intellectual property, expanding its expertise to the design and manufacture of high-precision/high-production inner-outer diameter grinders.
