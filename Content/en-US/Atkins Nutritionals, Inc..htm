   Atkins Nutritionals wants to help people reach their "happy" weight and pitches its plans and products to help get them there. The company makes an assortment of nutrition bars, shakes, drink, snacks, and a line of frozen meals (which include low-carb pasta entrees) that adhere to its low-carbohydrate gospel. Its plans provide guides for customers to direct their diets. Atkins also offers access to a library of nutritional information. The company's branded food products are sold in grocery stores and other retail outlets such as

   At its height in 2003, the diet's waning popularity was apparent by 2005 and the company's $300 million of debt led to a bankruptcy protection filing. The reorganized company emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, having closed four of its five offices, trimmed its bulging product line, and relaunched its Web site. It began focusing on what it called the superior nutrition of high protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, and low sugar.

   During the glory days, Atkins partnered with restaurants and food companies to offer Atkins-branded products ranging from steak dinners to low-carb ice cream. The deals weighed heavily on the company as the public moved on to other diet plans. A public stock offering, rumored in 2004, never materialized and the company laid off 40% of its staff that year.
