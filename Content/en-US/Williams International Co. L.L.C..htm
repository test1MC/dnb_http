   Williams International provides jet-powered propulsion. The privately-owned company manufactures general aviation gas turbine engines. Williams' line of powerful, efficient gas turbine and turbofan engines are designed for trainer aircraft and private business jets, traditionally flown by piston engines. Williams' engines also supply industrial and military small scale craft, such as drones used for naval gunnery practice. Its engines propel high profile projects like Tomahawk cruise missiles and subsonic target drones. Guarding its market share, the engine builder also offers maintenance and aftermarket parts services.

   Although defense spending is expected to decline in the near future, Williams may benefit from an increased interest in unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV). The company has provided turbojets for unmanned aircraft to defense contractors such as
