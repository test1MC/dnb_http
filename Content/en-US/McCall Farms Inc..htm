   Generations of southern boys and girls have grown up on McCall Farms' butter beans, collard greens, and pickled peaches. The company farms and cans 40 different products including tomatoes, okra, corn, squash, beans, peas, peaches, peanuts, and greens. Items are sold in mostly the southeastern US. The company's produce is grown on McCall's 2,000-acre South Carolina farm; contract farmers in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina cultivate another 18,000 acres. The company offers foods under the Margaret Holmes and Glory Foods brands and also makes private-label and food service products. Under the Peanut Patch brand name, McCall makes and markets the hard-to-find traditional southern treat -- boiled peanuts.

   Increasing its presence in its home state of South Carolina, McCall Farms expanded its manufacturing capabilities in Florence County in 2014, investing some $4 million in the expansion. The production facility doubles the company's manufacturing capacity and consolidates all operations for Bruce's Yams, which it acquired two years before.
