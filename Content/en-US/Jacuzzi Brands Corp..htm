   If hot tubs really were time machines Jacuzzi would be the name brand of hydrotherapeutic time travel. For more than 50 years Jacuzzi Brands has made the eponymous jetted baths, spas, and showers that soothe the aches and pains of residential and commercial customers around the world. Besides offering luxury spas and showers, Jacuzzi also makes luxury toilets, sinks and accessories, towel rings and bars, bath pillows, and even luxury mattresses, bedding, and accessories through JelSleep. Owned by investment firm

   , Jacuzzi now boasts more than 250 patents on its products.

   Jacuzzi products are sold mostly through spa, pool, and bath dealers. It also recently expanded its focus to selling directly to builders. The company's famous hot tubs can be found in homes, hotels, spa resorts, and aboard cruise ships.

   In 2015, Jacuzzi entered a distribution partnership with

    Ferguson Enterprises

   , the largest wholesale distributor of residential and commercial plumbing supplies, which would begin exclusively offering Jacuzzi Luxury Bath products to Jacuzzi's wholesale channel.

   In February 2013, Jacuzzi purchased Vista, California-based Dimension One Spas to expand its product and brand lines. The company would be called New Dimension One Spas and operate as a separate unit from Jacuzzi. The deal came less than eight months after Jacuzzi purchased ThermoSpas Hot Tub Products in mid-2012.

   Jacuzzi Brands expanded its product line in 2010 with the launch of its bedding collection. Under the terms of a licensing agreement, the line is manufactured and marketed by JelSleep Inc. The bedding line of sheets, blankets, and pillows complements Jacuzzi's mattress products, which feature coil, foam, air, and latex options.

  <p>
   The Jacuzzi family started its business in 1915 to make airplane propellers and industrial pumps. When a family member needed hydrotherapy in 1956, engineers at Jacuzzi created a whirlpool effect using a company pump. The company later began selling small, portable pumps for use in homes and hospitals. Roy Jacuzzi joined the family business in the late 1960s; he patented the "hydromassage" system and introduced his first whirlpool bathtub, called the Roman Bath, in 1968. Jacuzzi boomed during the whirlpool craze that followed in the 1970s, and New York construction company Kidde bought Jacuzzi in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded by Walter Kidde in 1900, Kidde expanded throughout the 20th century, going into everything from fire extinguishers to equipment for military tanks. By 1987, when Kidde was acquired in turn by UK-based conglomerate
   <company id="41784">
    Hanson
   </company>
   , it had grown to encompass more than 100 businesses, including Bear (archery equipment), Ertl (toys), Rexair (vacuum cleaners), Spartus (clocks), Universal Gym Equipment, and Valley Recreation Products (pinball machines and pool tables).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Hanson spun off a company containing 34 of its US businesses -- including Jacuzzi -- to its shareholders as USI. After recording a loss in its first fiscal year, USI pared down debt over the next couple of years by divesting businesses including Bear, Valley Recreation, Spartus, and the golf equipment units Tommy Armour Golf and Odyssey Sports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, USI also kept acquiring companies to bolster its core businesses. In 1997, for example, it bought a
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens AG
   </company>
   lighting unit and UK-based Spear &amp; Jackson (lawn and garden tools). The next year USI bought Zurn Industries for $745 million to expand its lineup of bathtub and plumbing products
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 USI bought
   <company id="10754">
    Huffy's
   </company>
   True Temper hardware unit,
   <company id="11307">
    SPX Corporation's
   </company>
   Dual-Lite line (emergency lights, exit signs, and central inverter systems), and UK-based Spring Ram (bathroom and kitchen products). It also sold Ertl and Keller Ladders that year. USI continued to pare operations in 2000, selling 81% of its USI Diversified unit to Citicorp Venture Capital for about $600 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the late 1990s the growth-by-acquisition strategy provided a portfolio of diverse companies with recognizable brand-name products. By 2000, however, the company found itself staggering under a giant debt load, and it began selling off businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting in 2001 and 2002, USI divested the companies in its lawn and garden and lighting segments. The company sold or shuttered several units -- Ames True Temper, Lighting Corporation of America, Selkirk Group, and SiTeco Lighting -- that accounted for more than half of sales. In 2003 USI changed its name to Jacuzzi Brands, Inc., and began using JZZ as its ticker symbol. It subsequently restructured and closed some production plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company decided to let go of Rexair, selling the subsidiary to Rhone Capital for about $170 million. At the same time, the company decided to exit the commercial plumbing market, selling Eljer to affiliates of
   <company id="111610">
    Sun Capital
   </company>
   . Jacuzzi Brands retained a majority stake in toolmaker
   <company id="117304">
    Spear &amp; Jackson
   </company>
   until mid-2006, when it completely divested its holdings in that company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was taken private by
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Management
   </company>
   in 2007. Apollo also moved Jacuzzi's headquarters from Florida to California.
