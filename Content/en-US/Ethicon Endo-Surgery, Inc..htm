  <p>
   In 2015 EES agreed to a strategic collaboration with
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   , working with the Life Sciences team on advancing surgical robotics to benefit surgeons, patients and health care systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product innovation is a key to the company's growth. In 2015 the company introduced the new ECHELON FLEX Powered Vascular Stapler, which enables the most precise placement on fragile vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 EES introduced three new endocutter and energy products designed to help address the unique challenges of bariatric procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. It also launched new portfolio of STRATAFIX Knotless Tissue Control Devices, a wound closure technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   EES often forms marketing and distribution agreements with other key medical device manufacturers, such as Neoprobe, a maker of oncology and cardiovascular surgical and diagnostic products. In 2013 the company teamed up with electrosurgery market leader MEGADYNE to increase choice and access to a broad energy portfolio across multiple energy platforms, from monopolar and standard bipolar offered by MEGADYNE to advanced bipolar and ultrasonic offered by EES.

  <p>
   In 2016, EES acquired NeuWave Medical, a medical device company specializing in soft tissue microwave ablation systems. Its probes and related items advance EES' portfolio of minimally invasive surgical oncology products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early the following year, EES acquired Megadyne Medical Products, which develops and makes electrosurgical tools including monopolar and bipolar electrodes, generators, and smoke evacuation systems.

  <p>
   The rise in energy device sales can partly be attributed to EES's expansion efforts. For instance the company added the EnSeal product line through the 2008 acquisition of SurgRx, which complemented Ethicon Endo-Surgery's existing line of Harmonic ultrasonic instruments. It has also added new items to the Harmonic line, such as the Harmonic Focus long curved shears, designed to give surgeons easier access to the internal organs of obese patients, added in 2010. Late the next year EES acquired Minnesota-based SterilMed, a private company that reprocesses and remanufactures medical devices. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
