   Klaussner Furniture has been ranked by industry publication
   <em>
    Furniture Today
   </em>
   as the nation's fourth largest residential furniture manufacturer with estimated sales of $500 million. It's working to maintain its ranking by turning to a luxury clientele. To this end, Klaussner boasts a permanent 90,000-sq.-ft. showroom in High Point, North Carolina, so that furniture market buyers can shop its full lineup.
  </p>

   The company is also pursuing niche furniture markets. Klaussner introduced Comfort Design, a business focused on making high-end leather and fabric upholstery. The Comfort Design collection includes reclining chairs and stationary sofas and sectionals. To cater to the growing number of customers with media rooms, Klaussner has rolled out home-theater seating and motion sofas.
