   VIA found viable businesses both inside and outside the PC. VIA Technologies took on
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   for market leadership in PC chipsets -- clusters of components that connect a computer's microprocessor to its other parts. VIA's chipsets work with microprocessors made by both Intel and
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   , and can be configured to work with various types of memory chips. Meanwhile, VIA's graphics chip venture took it into the market for core logic chipsets used in graphics applications. The fabless semiconductor company also entered the networking chip niche with its introduction of Ethernet controllers and other devices, and it continues to develop low-budget microprocessors for use in inexpensive PCs.

   VIA Technologies was founded in 1987. In its early years it made logic chips for workstations. By the time current president and CEO Wen Chi Chen joined the company in 1992, it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Chen -- a former
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   design engineer known for his devout Christian beliefs and simple lifestyle -- moved the company from Fremont, California, to Taiwan's high-tech corridor, where VIA's operation initially consisted of a few engineers working out of a single small apartment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The move to Taiwan allowed VIA to take advantage of lower production costs and thus remain competitive despite the tight margins of the chipset business. The company also benefited from proximity to -- and constant feedback from -- its major customers (a factor Chen cited as crucial to VIA's string of successful product rollouts). A milestone in the company's success came in 1995, when VIA won a major contract to supply
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   with chipsets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company entered the budget microprocessor business with its acquisitions of
   <company id="16430">
    Cyrix
   </company>
   (from
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   , which exited the microprocessor business altogether) and Centaur Technology (from
   <company id="13785">
    Integrated Device Technology
   </company>
   ). When Intel abandoned its Timna project that year, the market for budget microprocessors was essentially left to VIA alone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year VIA again capitalized on an Intel miscue. While the chip giant suffered an embarrassing series of delays for its Camino chipsets, VIA doubled its market share to draw even with Intel in the chipset race.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2000 VIA announced that it would establish a joint venture with chip maker S3 (later
   <company id="16156">
    SONICblue
   </company>
   , now defunct) to take over S3's graphics chip operations. The venture was completed in the opening days of 2001. Later that year the company debuted its "Samuel" microprocessor, designed to compete with low-end chips, including
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   's Athlon and Intel's Celeron.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2001 Intel sued VIA, claiming that VIA's Pentium 4-compatible chipsets violated several Intel patents. VIA countersued, claiming that Intel's chipsets violated VIA's own patents. Intel's legal actions led some PC motherboard makers to balk at using VIA's chipsets; VIA introduced its own line of motherboards late in 2001. (The companies finally agreed to a comprehensive legal settlement of these issues in 2003.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company expanded into other product lines, debuting designs for components such as network switch controllers, as well as for larger gear such as TV set-top boxes. It also purchased the CDMA chipset business of LSI Logic (now
   <company id="13932">
    LSI Corp.
   </company>
   ) to break into the market for chips used in cellular phones. Also that year VIA bought Freehand DSP, a Sweden-based firm that specialized in DSP core designs for voice communications chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   While in litigation with Intel, VIA also became the leading maker of chipsets compatible with the microprocessors of
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   . At the 2003 legal settlement with Intel, the company said it would not renew its Intel license and would begin developing its own central processing units with new specifications.
