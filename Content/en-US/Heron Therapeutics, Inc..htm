   Heron Therapeutics (formerly A. P. Pharma) wants to hit patients where it hurts. The company develops bioerodible polymers for injectable and implantable drug delivery. Its Biochronomer technology delivers medication directly to the site where the drug is needed. Heron's leading drug candidate, SUSTOL, could ease chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The company's development programs include HTX-011 for the management of post-operative pain, HTX-019 for the prevention of CINV and HTX-003 for management of chronic pain and opioid addiction. Its drug candidates combine approved therapeutics with its bioerodible polymers.

  <p>
   In mid 2015 Heron reported positive, top-line results from its Phase 3 MAGIC study and resubmitted its New Drug Application (NDA) for SUSTOL to the FDA. HTX-019, also being developed for the prevention of CINV, has the potential to become the first polysorbate 80-free, intravenous formulation of aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. Heron intends to file an NDA for HTX-019 using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in 2016. HTX-011, Heron's long-acting formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam, is currently being evaluated in two Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of post-operative pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heron expects to report results from both of these trials in the second half of 2015. HTX-003, a long-acting formulation of buprenorphine, is being developed for the management of chronic pain and opioid addiction.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2014, the company had 16 issued US patents and an additional 42 issued (or registered) foreign patents.

In 2014 Heron's net loss increased primarily due to growth in research and development expenses, which accounted for 73% of the total operating expenses. The company had an accumulated deficit of $315.2 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   The company's business strategy includes the entry into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of Heron's products and product candidates. Heron intends to continue to seek patent protection for the product candidates in its research and development programs by filing patent applications in the US and elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Heron initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of SUSTOL (APF530), its lead product candidate for the prevention of CINV associated with moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The company intends to establish a direct sales force if SUSTOL is approved by the FDA..

   To fund its R&amp;D work Heron Therapeutics had earned royalties from the sales of topical products that use its Microsponge technology; however, it sold the rights to these royalties in 2006. The sale earned $25 million, which will be applied to its lead drug candidate trials. Those products include
