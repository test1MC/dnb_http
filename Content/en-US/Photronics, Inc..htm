   Photronics is a company behind the photomasks. The company is the biggest maker of high-precision quartz photomasks, a key tool in the process for manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) and flat-panel displays (FPDs) for TVs, computer displays, and mobile phones. Photomasks carry microscopic images of electronic circuits and are used as stencils to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers during the manufacture of ICs and FPDs. Photronics also provides maintenance for etching systems, as well as research and consulting in techniques for wafer cleaning and etching. About 70% of the company's sales are from customers in Asia.

  <p>
   Photronics gets three-quarters of its revenue from making photomasks for integrated circuits and the rest from photomasks for flat panel displays.

  <p>
   Photronics' products are made at nine manufacturing plants - one in South Korea, two in Europe (Germany and Wales), three in Taiwan, and three in the US (Connecticut, Idaho, and Texas). The company plans to open a facility for research and development and manufacturing in Xiamen, China in 2018.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 40% of Photronics' revenue comes from customers in Taiwan and about 30% from Korean manufacturers. US customers generate about a quarter of sales. The company gets less than 1% of sales from China and other Asian countries.

   Photronics has about 600 customers with its five biggest customers accounting for half of its company's sales. The company's sales might become even more concentrated because of consolidation in the semiconductor manufacturing business. Customers include

   After two years of sales growth, Photronics posted an 8% decline in 2016 (ended October) at $483 million compared to about $524 million in 2015. The integrated circuit (IC) business slid 13% lower (down $56 million) while the flat panel unit posted a robust 15% sales increase (up about $16 million). The IC drop outweighed the flat panel increase around the world as sales fell in all geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Photronics saw reduced demand for its high-end IC products, photomasks of 45nm and smaller, amid slumps for memory and logic masks. Sales of its IC mainstream technology products also fell. High-end flat panel masks, which carry higher prices than mainstream products, drove that unit's sales higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a $46 million profit in 2016, a 4% increase from 2015. Its expenses in 2016 were lower, including a smaller tax bill. Cash from operations fell to about $122 million in 2016 from $133 million in 2015 because of lower reduced year-to-year operating income, offset somewhat by net cash favorable changes in accrual accounts.

   Photronics has had minimal sales in China, but it is investing to change that. The company is building a research and develop center and a manufacturing facility in Xiamen, China. It is devoting $160 million in cash and transferred capital to the project, which, like its other plants around the world, is to serve customers in the local market. China has had little in the way of home-grown semiconductor manufacturing, but a government-backed effort is trying to change that. With little photomask competition, Photronics stands to benefit from a semiconductor factory build out in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   New designs for semiconductors, which are getting smaller, and flat panels, which are using new materials, offer growth possibilities for Photronics. It refines its technologies to meet the chip industry trend of fitting ever more transistors on smaller spaces. In flat panels, there is an industry shift to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) screens. AMOLED displays offers better resolution and have been used in smaller screens such as for watches and mobile phones. As the technology migrates to bigger screens, Photronics stands to gain as it builds out its high-end flat panel photomask technologies.

   Photronics Inc. acquired

    Infinite Graphics Inc.
   </company>
   in 2016, helping to expand manufacturing capabilities. The deal includes intellectual property from Infinite Graphics for emerging technologies and 3D structures such as micro lens arrays, true gray scale imaging, texturing, and biomimicry.

  <p>
   Constantine (Deno) Macricostas, who came to the US from Greece in 1954 as an exchange student, and four partners started Photronic Labs in a garage in 1969. Weary of infighting, Macricostas left the firm in 1972 but bought it two years later with the help of banker (and later long-time board member) Michael Yomazzo and a loan from the Small Business Administration. The company went public in 1987 and changed its name to Photronics in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   A string of acquisitions, starting with Beta Squared in 1990, increased the company's customer base. In 1993 it became the #1 independent photomask maker in the US with the purchase of Toppan Printronics, the US operations of
   <company id="52340">
    Toppan Printing
   </company>
   . The deal gave Toppan Printing a stake in Photronics, which Photronics bought back five years later.
