   For more than a century, C.F. Sauer has been adding a little spice to life. In addition to a stable of spices, the company produces and wholesales seasonings, extracts, and flavorings. C.F. Sauer offers an increasing lineup of mixes for baking in a bag, microwave steaming, grilling, and slow cooking. Products are sold under its namesake label, as well as the Duke's, Bama, Spice Hunter, Gold Medal, and Mrs. Filbert's brands to retail food stores and food service operators, such as restaurants and concessionaires. C.F. Sauer, which operates several plants (including one that makes its packaging), also provides private-label and blending services for food processors. The company has been family-owned since 1887.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1887 by pharmacist Conrad Frederick (thus the C.F.) Sauer, Sr. His entrepreneurial spirit was piqued when he noticed that flavoring extracts made up much of the drugstore business. Sauer introduced a line of packaged flavoring extracts for the grand sum of 13 cents.

  <p>
   C.F. Sauer may have started out selling small bottles of vanilla extract to grocery and drugstore customers, but it has moved forward by both identifying and eliminating opportunities. Its last major acquisitions, Mrs. Filbert's Mayonnaise and The Spice Hunter, were made in 1999. Resizing itself, C.F. Sauer removed margarine from its pantry in mid-2011. The company sold two margarine production plants in Kansas and Virginia, and their assets, to
   <company id="142721">
    Bunge North America.
   </company>
   The plants had the capacity to produce almost 400 million pounds of margarine annually. The deal freed C.F. Sauer to invest in adding to and repackaging such lines as its Duke's (its top-seller) and Bama Mayonnaise, The Spice Hunter, and C.F. Sauer condiments. All-natural seasoning blends, organic salts, rubs, and seasonings for grilling meats are among its launches.
