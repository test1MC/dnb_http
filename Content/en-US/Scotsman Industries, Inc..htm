   Scotsman Industries' mantra could very well be "ice, ice, baby." The company is the world's largest commercial ice machine maker, with more than 300 models of Scotsman and Ice-O-Matic ice machines, dispensers, filtration systems, and storage bins. Its Prodigy cuber is an award winner in the foodservice industry. With distributors in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Scotsman's products are used in hotels, as well as laboratories, restaurants, schools, and supermarkets. For every machine sold to a healthcare facility, the company gives $2 to a clean water charity. Scotsman Industries is part of Italian foodservice equipment maker

   Scotsman grew into an industry leader through technology development that led to cleaner ice and more energy-efficient products. Its Prodigy cubers and Nugget Ice machines decrease both utility costs and water usage, while the AquaArmor and Watersense systems inhibit microbes and keep machines cleaner longer.

   In addition to its commercial ice products, Scotsman offers products to the residential market, including wine storage units, companion refrigerators, and home ice machines.
