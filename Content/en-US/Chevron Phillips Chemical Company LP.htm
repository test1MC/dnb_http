   Among the world's largest petrochemical firms, Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) produces ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, and polypropylene -- sometimes used as building blocks for the company's other products such as pipe. Chevron Phillips Chemical also produces aromatics such as benzene and styrene, specialty chemicals such as acetylene black (a form of carbon black), and mining chemicals. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP is CPChem's wholly-owned, primary US operating subsidiary. CPChem is 50% owned by

  <p>
   CPChem is growing its complex of chemical plants, taking advantage of the deep pockets of its multinational parents, increased demand for chemical products (especially in Asia), and the abundance of chemical raw materials generated by natural gas production in North American shale basins.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company completed an expansion of its normal alpha olefins capacity at its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown. Alpha olefins are used in synthetic motor oils, lubricants, surfactants, and other specialty applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its infrastructure, during 2014 CPChem completed the construction of a 1-hexene plant (the world's largest) at the company's Cedar Bayou complex in Baytown, Texas, with a design capacity of 250,000 metric tons per year. The product 1-hexene is a component used in the manufacture of polyethylene, a plastic resin commonly converted into film, plastic pipe, milk jugs, detergent bottles, and food and beverage containers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 CPChem completed an ethylene expansion at its Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, to take advantage of chemical supply from nearby oil and gas basins, the company committed $6 billion to build a 1.5-million-metric-tons/year (3.3 billion pounds/year) ethane cracker and two ethylene derivatives facilities on the US Gulf Coast. The two new polyethylene facilities will each have an annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons (1.1 billion pounds). The projects are due to be completed in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2015 the company sold its its Ryton polyphenylene sulfide business to
   <company id="47385">
    Solvay
   </company>
   for $220 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2011, to expand its portfolio in Europe, the company acquired a polyalphaolefin plant in Beringen, Belgium, from
   <company id="156600">
    Neste Oil
   </company>
   . The acquisition also added to the company's existing production of polyalphaolefins (PAOs), which are used in high-performance lubricants.
  </p>
  <p>
   A coin toss determined whose name would go first when Chevron and Phillips Petroleum (now Phillips 66) formed 50-50 joint venture Chevron Phillips Chemical Company in 2000.
