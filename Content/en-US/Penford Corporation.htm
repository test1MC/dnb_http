   Penford Corporation doesn't mind its reputation for being stiff and starchy -- that's how it makes its money. The company makes carbohydrate-based specialty starches used by the paper, packaging, and food industries. Paper and packaging manufacturers use the specialty starches and film-forming ingredients from Penford's industrial ingredients segment to improve the strength and quality of containers and magazine and catalog paper. The company's food ingredients segment makes starches and dextrins that improve the crispness, texture, and shelf life of various food products (including pet food and treats). Penford was acquired by food ingredients maker

    Ingredion
   </company>
   in 2015.
