   Lavazza knows a thing or two about coffee. The company, in business for more than 100 years, is one of the leading coffee roasters and sellers in Italy and does business abroad as well. Lavazza makes coffee for home use, institutional customers, and restaurants; it's sold under brands Lavazza, Café Espresso, Quality Oré, and others. Lavazza began to make hot chocolate, as well, through its purchase of Ercom in 2010. The company operates training centers around the world to teach baristas the finer points of making a cup of espresso and to "promote the coffee culture." Established in 1895 by Luigi Lavazza, the company is controlled and run by the fourth generation of Lavazza's descendants.

  <p>
   Luigi Lavazza left his father's farm in 1885 for Turin where he apprenticed with a grocer and studied chemistry. By 1894 he had opened his own grocery business; he soon was specializing in coffee. His business flourished, and in 1910 Lavazza started blending different grades and varieties of coffee. Customers began to identify his consistent blends. In 1933 the senior Lavazza handed management of the company over to his sons Beppe, Mario, and Pericle.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the company survived Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's freeze on coffee imports by switching to other grocery products, but after the war it returned to coffee. By offering pre-packaged coffee (instead of bulk coffee weighed out by the grocer), Lavazza promoted its brand more effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1955 Beppe's son Emilio Lavazza was the third generation of the family to work for the company, and he was soon joined by cousin Alberto. In 1962 the company introduced its first decaffeinated espresso -- Lavazza Dek. During the 1960s and 1970s, the company tweaked its packaging, product lines, and advertising. It dominated the Italian market, and it was content to stay at home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with consolidation among Italy's retailers and maturation of its market, in the 1980s Lavazza chose to expand its reach rather than its product lines. Its first subsidiary was launched in France in 1982, followed by Germany in 1987. As Italian foods reached new levels of popularity and specialty coffee was fast becoming chic, Lavazza's US subsidiary opened in 1988, with a focus on food service sales. Subsidiaries in Austria (1989), the UK (1990), and Spain (1999) followed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A small string of acquisitions in 1989 (including Unoper, whose small espresso machines used pre-measured coffee) ultimately formed the backbone of Lavazza's Espresso Point system geared towards vending sites (offices, hotels, trains). In 1993 Lavazza France acquired a major Parisian coffee roaster, Henry Large. During the 1990s the fourth generation of Lavazzas began working for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 1999 the company's Spanish subsidiary acquired a chain of coffee shops, with plans to export that country's style of café to other European countries. In 2000 Lavazza announced it would begin trading green coffee beans through www.eGreenCoffee.com, the first Internet coffee trading site. The site is no longer connected with Lavazza.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired 80% of German company, Coffee Development Systems in 2003; it acquired the other 20% in 2005. Also in 2005 it acquired France's Cafés du Vieuz Pecheur (Poccardi brand).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, it introduced Lavazza BLUE, an improved coffee-brewing system designed for the home, the office, and in vending areas. The system is available worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lavazza added hot chocolate and sorbet mixes to its products portfolio in early 2010 through its purchase of Ercom.
