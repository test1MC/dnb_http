   Orchids Paper Products hopes to leave its end users smelling like a rose. The company makes bulk tissue paper and converts it into bathroom tissue, paper napkins, and paper towels for the consumer market. Most of the company's products are sold as private-label items by discount retailers; Orchids Paper products also are sold under the company's Colortex and Velvet brands.

   . Orchids Paper sells most of its products within a 500-mile radius of its manufacturing plant in northeastern Oklahoma.

  <p>
   Orchids divides its business into two lines: converted products and parent rolls. Converted products account for 97% of its revenue and include paper towels, bathroom tissue, and paper napkins.

  <p>
   The company sells its products to value retailers, generally known as "dollar" stores, grocery stores, grocery wholesalers, and cooperatives. Its sales efforts are focused on an area within 500 miles of its facility in northeast Oklahoma, which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Nebraska, and Iowa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Major customers include
   <company id="13220">
    Dollar General
   </company>
   (accounting for 40% of its converted product sales in 2014),
   <company id="10546">
    Family Dollar
   </company>
   (11%), and
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   (9%). In 2014 Orchids spent $292 million on advertising.

  <p>
   Orchids has enjoyed several straight years of steady growth. Revenues jumped 23% from $116 million in 2013 to reach a millstone high of $143 million in 2014. The historic growth was attributed to a 26% spike in sales from converted products due to its efforts on new product development in the mid and premium tier markets. Additional revenue from a previous acquisition also contributed to the growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orchids' profits, however, dropped 29% from $13 million in 2013 to $9 million in 2014 due to higher expenses and business costs. This was due to higher expenses related to an acquisition coupled with higher fiber costs and increased production expenses associated with its converting and paper production operations.

  <p>
   Orchids has been focused on increasing efficiency by producing its own parent rolls, which is the material processed into its other products, such as tissue. The move is an effort to limit the the company's reliance on outside sources for parent rolls and the subsequent price fluctuations that have characterized that market in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward, the company plans to maximize production with its older equipment in a strategic move that deviates from typical paper product makers that have been shutting down older equipment. Orchids has also invested in new equipment. The result of these efforts will be an increase in capacity that the company hopes to sell through new channels, namely grocery and drug store chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2015, its specific focus was on the timely start-up of its new paper machine and new converting line in Oklahoma.

  <p>
   In order to enhance its West Coast operations, Orchids in 2014 entered into a strategic alliance with Fabrica de Papel San Francisco. Based in Baja California, Mexico, Fabrica is a low-cost manufacturer of high-quality tissue paper products. As part of the alliance, Orchids acquired Fabrica's US business, including certain manufacturing assets and access to 18,000 metric tons of capacity each year. Products are now produced at Fabrica's facility in Mexicali, Mexico, and shipped directly to Orchids' US customers.
