   This LORD knows about adhesives and vibration control products. LORD is a leading maker of adhesives (for rubber-to-metal bonding for engine mounts, bushings, and hoses); coatings (to protect metal, rubber, plastic, ceramic, and wood against corrosion, severe temperatures, chemical attack, and abrasion); and vibration, motion, and noise control (for aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications). Its magneto-rheological (MR) technology alters fluids for better lubricity and viscosity in mechanical management. The company was founded in 1924 by Hugh Lord.

  <p>
   LORD markets products under brand names such as Aeroglaze, Chemlok, Flocklok, Fusor, LORD, and Versilok. The company's adhesives group serves a wide variety of industries, providing products that include composite bonding for the aerospace market, rubber-to-substrate bonding for the automotive sector, adhesion enhancers and metal-to-metal bonding for industrial clients, and rubber-to-substrate bonding for solar energy and wind power.
  </p>
  <p>
   The coatings group offers protective products for the aerospace, automotive, industrial, oil and gas, and solar energy markets. LORD's MR group boasts a large list of patents related to additives, lubricants, and suspension aids that prevent the corrosion of seals, gaskets, and metal components by iron particles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's specialty chemicals group includes rare rubber ingredients. It claims to be the only maker of quinone dioxime rubber curatives in the US and the world's only maker of chlorosulfonated polyethylene aqueous latex and butyl latex or BL100. Customers for these products include aerospace, automotive, and industrial firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The vibration and motion control group partners with aerospace/defense, automotive, and industrial clients to create new applications or consult in the selection of existing products. Products in this group include military suspensions, balancing systems, automotive suspensions, couplings, and dampers. LORD also markets products specifically designed for the oil and gas, solar energy, and wind power markets.

  <p>
   LORD expands through the use of acquisitions and by launching new offices in emerging markets. In 2014 it acquired New York-based Stellar Technology, a firm that designs and manufactures custom sensing equipment for the oil and gas, aerospace, and industrial markets. Its pressure, load, force, torque, displacement and temperature products were complementary to LORD's existing capabilities in sensing systems and motion control technologies. The acquisition is expected to position both companies for quicker technology commercialization across their respective markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the fall of 2013, LORD opened its Dubai office, which supports business efforts to meet customer and supplier demands in the aerospace, construction, infrastructure, and transportation sectors throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) market. A year later, in 2014, LORD launched new offices in the major metropolitan regions of Houston and Shenzhen, China.
