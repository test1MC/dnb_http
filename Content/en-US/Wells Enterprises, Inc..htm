  <p>
   The company is taking a larger bite out of the ice cream market by launching a selection of new cones, snack-size frozen bars, and ice cream flavors. Its Blue Bunny Sweet Freedom line, made with the Truvia brand of stevia-based sweetener, boasts no sugar and lower fat and carbs than traditional offerings. Targeting demand for premium ice cream bars, the company collaborates with Cadbury to introduce new products dipped in chocolate. Wells has also teamed up with celebrity cake baker Chef Duff Goldman to offer cake-and-ice cream inspired treats.

  <p>
   Founded as a small-town dairy in 1913 by the late Fred H. Wells with $250, the company has grown through acquisitions to achieve a national presence in the US. In 2011 the ice cream maker changed its name from Wells' Dairy to Wells Enterprises as it expanded the Blue Bunny ice cream brand.
