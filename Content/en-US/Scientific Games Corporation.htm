   -This company wants you to take a chance on its games. Scientific Games is a leading supplier of instant-win lottery tickets used by lotteries throughout the US and in Europe. It also offers a number of related services, including ticket design and fulfillment, marketing support, and inventory management. Scientific Games also makes lottery terminals and manages online lottery systems for about a dozen jurisdictions in the US. In addition, the company makes gaming systems used for betting on sports.
   <company id="40291">
    MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
   </company>
   , an investment vehicle controlled by financier Ron Perelman, owns almost 30% of Scientific Games.

  <p>
   Scientific Games derives a substantial and growing portion of its revenue from operations outside the US. In fiscal 2012 the company derived about 53% of its revenue from sales to customers outside of the US, serving customers in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, Spain, and Switzerland.

  <p>
   The company reports its operations in three segments: Printed Products Group (instant ticket design and manufacturing and related services); Lottery Systems Group (software, support, equipment, and data communication services to lotteries); and Diversified Gaming Group (services and systems to gaming machine providers and other gaming companies). Its Printed Products Group is its largest revenue-generator, accounting for more than half of sales.

  <p>
   As a leading supplier of lottery tickets and related services, Scientific Games plays an important role in helping state governments and other jurisdictions establish and operate successful lotteries. Most of its lottery business depends on long-term service contracts with state governments and other lottery operators that are awarded based on the company's ability to deliver services at a low cost.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenue increased by 7% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to increased revenue from sales and service revenue. Scientific Games attributed some of the growth in revenue to the acquisition of Barcrest, which increased its revenue by $26.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the increase in revenue, Scientific Games posted a net loss in fiscal 2012 due to increased operating expenses.

  <p>
   The company grows through strategic acquisition to expand its global presence and to gain access to technology. In 2013 Scientific Games acquired WMS Industries Inc. ('WMS'), a leading supplier of gaming machines and interactive gaming systems and content, for $1.5 billion. WMS serves the gaming industry in the US and international jurisdictions by designing, manufacturing, and marketing games, video and mechanical reel-spinning gaming machines and video lottery terminals, and by placing leased participation gaming machines in regulated gaming venues.

   In 2014 it added

  <p>
   United Tote acquired Autotote Systems, a privately held maker of automatic wagering systems, in 1989, but was forced to divest its pari-mutuel racetrack operations in 1992 as the result of antitrust legislation. Thus Autotote was born.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its first year the company signed a contract to supply 10,000 lottery terminals to a horse-racing lottery in Italy. The next year it signed a deal with Del Mar Thoroughbred Club in California, one of the biggest racetracks in the US, and acquired the ETAG Group of Switzerland, a leading supplier of computerized wagering systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autotote sold its casino/race and sports wagering service business in 1996. It secured a contract to equip and manage the Connecticut Lottery in 1997 and the next year won its largest contract (to provide up to 20,000 terminals to Sisal Sport Italia) and was awarded a seven-year contract to provide services to the Montana State Lottery. The company was awarded additional lottery contracts in Vermont in 1999, New Hampshire in 2000, and Iowa and Maine in 2001. The company bought lottery systems firm Scientific Games for about $308 million in 2000. Autotote integrated the company the following year and took its name as the new corporate moniker. The company bought a 65% stake in Serigrafica Chilena S.A. (Serchi), giving it access to Latin America's phone card and instant win market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Scientific Games acquired game and lottery ticket designer MDI Entertainment for $18.5 million. Also that year, the company acquired
   <company id="13812">
    International Game Technology
   </company>
   's online lottery operations for $143 million. The following year Scientific Games bought Printpool Honsel GmbH, the exclusive instant lottery ticket supplier for Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company signed a $7 million contract with the New Mexico Gaming Control Board in 2006 to monitor and manage that state's 3,000 gaming machines and a $12 million contract to supply instant ticket games to Washington State. That same year it purchased the online assets of Swedish firm EssNet for $60 million, adding customers in parts of Germany and Australia where it didn't already operate along with national lotteries in Hungary, Norway, and other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Scientific Games sold its racing business to UK betting company
   <company id="102469">
    Sportech
   </company>
   in order to focus on its core lottery and gaming operations. Also that year Michael Chambrello replaced Joseph Wright as CEO of the company. Later that year Chambrello was replaced by Lorne Weil, and Chambrello switched roles to head the company's efforts in the Asia/Pacific region.
