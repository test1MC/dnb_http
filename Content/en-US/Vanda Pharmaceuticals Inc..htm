   Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company that is developing several drugs for disorders of the central nervous system. The company's first commercial drug was schizophrenia treatment Fanapt (iloperidone). Another drug, Hetlioz (tasimelteon), was launched in the US in 2014 for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder; it received European Commission approval in 2015. Other drug candidates are treatments for sleep disorders, including insomnia and sleep apnea, as well as anxiety and depression. Vanda typically licenses development and commercialization rights for its compounds from (and to) companies including

   ,
   <company id="10509">

   , and

   .

  <p>
   Vanda's product pipeline includes Tradipitant, which is in development for the treatment of chronic itching in atopic dermatitis; Trichostatin A for the treatment of cancer; and AQW051 for the treatment of schizophrenia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fanapt accounts for 60% of the company's revenue, while Hetlioz brings in the remaining 40%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Vanda commercializes its two products in the US and Canada. Its distribution partners launched Fanapt in Israel and Mexico in 2014. Vanda began rolling out Hetlioz in Europe in 2016.

  <p>
   Fanapt and Hetlioz are marketed in the US and Canada. Vanda's top six customers, all based in the US, accounted for 94% of its revenue in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $3.4 million on branded advertising in 2015, down from $5 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While Fanapt sales provided steady growth for the firm since its 2009 FDA approval, revenue really grew when the company launched Hetlioz in 2014. In fiscal 2015, revenue more than doubled to $110 million. Also contributing to that growth was the firm's acquisition of the commercial rights of Fanapt in the US and Canada from Novartis.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company returned to the red in 2015 when it lost a net $40 million due to higher research and development activities. At the end of 2015, Vanda had an accumulated deficit of $327.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has been fluctuating for the past five years. After reporting a cash outflow in 2014, Vanda had a cash inflow of $12 million in 2015 due to cash generated from government and other rebates and accounts payable.

  <p>
   Vanda intends to pursue additional partnership agreements to extend its product marketing efforts internationally, as well as to commercialize other product candidates once they are approved. The company intends to develop or license additional product candidates, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its two drugs bringing in a modest $100 million in sales in 2015 (in particular, Fanapt sales have never been that strong), the company is also seeking options such as a possible sale in the lively M&amp;A market.

  <p>
   The company was established in 2003 by Dr. Mihael Polymeropoulos, Vanda's CEO and a former researcher for Novartis.
