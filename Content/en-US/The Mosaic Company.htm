   <company id="116224">
    Canpotex
   </company>
   (an offshore marketing and logistics company owned by Saskatchewan-based potash producers), 12%; Canada, 8%; India, 4%; China, Mexico, Colombia, each 2%; and Australia, Japan, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina, each 1%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in three segments: Phosphates, Potash, and International Distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Phosphates segment (44% of Mosaic's 2015 revenues) produces phosphate and marketers of phosphate-based animal feed ingredients in the US. In 2015 the company produced 9.5 million tons of phosphate nutrients. Its phosphates production accounts for  14% of world annual output and 79% of North American annual production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Phosphates segment produced 8 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Potash segment produces potash and sells potash throughout North America and internationally, principally as fertilizer, but also for use in industrial applications and, to a lesser degree, as animal feed ingredients. It accounts for 13% of estimated global annual potash production and 43% of estimated North American annual potash production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The International Distribution segment consists of sales offices, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouses in Brazil, Paraguay, India, and China. The segment serves as a distribution outlet for Mosaic's Phosphates and Potash segments, but also purchases and markets certain products from other suppliers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells phosphate-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout North America and internationally. Its distribution activities include sales offices, port terminals and warehouses in the US, Canada, and several other key international countries. In addition, international distribution activities include blending, bagging or production facilities in Brazil, China, India, and Paraguay.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of the US and Canada, they market their Phosphates segments products through our own international distribution activities as well as a sales force focused on geographies outside of North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Potash Segment sell potash throughout North America and internationally, principally as fertilizer, but also for use in industrial applications and, to a lesser degree, as animal feed ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosaic markets its Canadian potash outside of the US and Canada through Canpotex, an export association. It also markets much of its phosphates through the
   <company id="113504">
    Phosphate Chemicals Export Association
   </company>
   (PhosChem).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells products to wholesale distributors, retail chains, cooperatives, independent retailers, and national accounts.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 net revenues decreased by 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Phosphates segment's net sales were comparable to the same period in 2014. Lower average selling prices had a negative impact on net sales, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the Potash segment decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes that resulted in a decline in net sales partially offset by a favorable impact of $40 million from selling prices. Although average selling prices were down over the prior year, prices had a favorable impact on net sales driven by the mix of sales as international average selling prices were higher than during the prior year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The International Distribution segment's revenues increased primarily due to higher sales volumes that resulted in a favorable impact of  $650 million, partially offset by the negative impact from lower selling prices of  $280 million compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosaic's net income decreased by 3% in 2015 was due to the decline in net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 cash from operating activities dropped by 15%.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company was looking to continue to expand its potash production facilities in line with its view of the long-term fundamentals of increasing global demand in that business. Mosaic's plans to increase annual operational capacity for finished product of 5 million tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   in 2015, the company made contributions of $225 million to the Ma'aden Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company , their joint venture with Saudi Arabian Mining Company and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation  to develop, own and operate integrated phosphate production facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following a 2014 deal with Saudi Arabian Mining Company and
   <company id="53868">
    Saudi Basic Industries Corporation
   </company>
   to form a phosphate production joint venture, (Ma'aden Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company) the company announced plans to further expand its MicroEssentials capacity (its premium micronutrient product) through an integrated phosphate production facility in Saudi Arabia. Global demand for MicroEssentials continues to grow and exceed their current production capacity. When the current expansion is complete, it will have capacity to produce 3.5 million tonnes of the product. Mosaic owns 25% of the joint venture and markets 25% of its production. The joint venture offers an additional source of phosphate crop nutrients and facilitate access to key customers in India and elsewhere in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company invested $225 million in the Ma'aden Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosaic's potash expansion projects in Saskatchewan, Canada, are proceeding toward completion, with highly successful capacity proving runs completed at Esterhazy and Colonsay, and with the K3 mine shafts at Esterhazy nearing their final depth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Mosaic took steps to optimize its business portfolio by exiting the fertilizer distribution business in Chile and Argentina and stopped muriate of potash production at the Carlsbad, New Mexico, mine.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company sold its salt operations at the Hersey, Michigan mine for $55 million. It also closed its low producing potash operations at Hersey allowing the company to focus on higher producing potash mines.

  <p>
   In late 2016, Mosaic agreed to buy Brazil-based
   <company id="95034">
    Vale
   </company>
   's fertilizer business for $2.5 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired the phosphate business of
   <company id="40088">
    CF Industries
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion in cash plus $200 million to fund CF Industries' asset retirement obligation escrow. Ad part of the deal, Mosaic gained the 22,000-acre South Pasture phosphate mine and beneficiation plant in Hardee County, Florida, a phosphate manufacturing plant in Plant City, Florida, and an ammonia terminal and finished product warehouse facilities in Tampa. The CF Industries' facilities produce 1.8 million tonnes of phosphate fertilizer per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company was seeking to take advantage of global growth in middle classes in emerging markets where higher per-capita incomes are driving the demand for more meat and dairy and the grain needed to produce them. It invested nearly $900 million in capital spending for potash expansions in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosaic also made gains in its phosphates business in 2011. It sold some of its operations in Brazil, which helped fund an investment of another phosphates source in Peru that Mosaic believes will bolster the company's position as one of the world's leading integrated phosphate producers. Mosaic bought a 35% interest in a joint venture with Vale and
   <company id="56032">
    Mitsui &amp; Co.
   </company>
   in the Miski Mayo mine in Peru for $385 million. Production of phosphate rock, estimated at 4 million tons per year, began that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosaic was originally created through the merger of
   <company id="10766">
    IMC Global
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   's former crop nutrition unit in 2004. In 2011 Cargill divested  its 64% of Mosaic shares to its shareholders and debtholders in a $24 billion transaction, splitting off Mosaic and ending its status as a majority-owned company.
