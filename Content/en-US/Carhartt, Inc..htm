   Real workers don't leave home without first donning their Carhartts. The clothing company makes rugged overalls, flame-resistant workwear, outerwear, sweatshirts, sportswear, and pants favored by farmers and other hard-working people. Most of Carhartt's items, sold to men, women, and children, are made in US factories; the rest are produced in Canada and Europe. Besides its own shops, Carhartt's apparel is carried by major chains, including

    Bass Pro Shops
   </company>
   and
   <company id="59471">
    Cabela's
   </company>
   and international retailers in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia. The family of founder Hamilton Carhartt owns the firm, which was founded in 1889.

        <p>
   As part of Carhartt's retail strategy, the apparel company is expanding prudently, looking for underpenetrated markets, such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Boston. In addition, Carhartt in 2014 opened its second Oregon-based company-owned retail store; it carries over 270 styles of men's, women's, and kids' apparel. That same year, Carhartt opened its first Pennsylvania company-owned retail store, located inside Homestead, Pennsylvania's Waterfront Outdoor Shopping Mall.
  </p>
        <p>
   Throughout 2015, Carhartt plans to open a flagship retail store in Detroit as the company has signed a long-term lease for a three-story, 51,000 sq. ft. building in Midtown Detroit.

        <p>
   Carhartt's core customers include carpenters, plumbers, ranchers, outdoor enthusiasts, and construction workers. Carhartt's high-end workwear became popular in the 1990s and has earned a following. The clothing company works to maintain its longtime customer base by producing high-quality apparel and footwear while others in the industry have opted to cut corners to boost their bottom line.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sells its products through major chain retailers the likes of Cabela's, Gempler's Dungarees, Work N Gear, Northwest Outlet, Rural King, SuperCasuals, and Boot Barn, as well as online.
