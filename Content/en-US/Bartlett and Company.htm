   When the cows come home, Bartlett and Company will be ready. The company's primary business is grain merchandising, but it also runs cattle feedlots, mills flour, and sells feed and fertilizer. Bartlett operates grain storage facilities, terminal elevators, and country elevators in the Midwestern US, including locations in Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. Bartlett also operates flour mills and feed stores in the Midwest, as well as along the East Coast. Its cattle operations are based in Texas and reach to Kansas. Bartlett and Company Grain Charitable Foundation makes financial gifts to local causes. Founded in 1907 as Bartlett Agri Enterprises, the company is still owned by the founding Bartlett family.

  <p>
   Bartlett and Company operates its business through three companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bartlett Grain Company, which has operations in Mexico and the US, supplies processors the likes of flour mills, feed mills, soybean crushers, animal feed makers, and ethanol producers with a variety of products such as wheat, feed grains, soybeans, and food-grade corns.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Bartlett Milling Company maintains train and truck fleets to ship the bulk and bagged flour it produces at its flour mills located in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states. Its flour milling capacity exceeds 4 million pounds per day. On the side, the milling business makes feeds for livestock, horses, and pets that it sells through stores in the Carolinas and in Virginia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Representing one of the largest cattle feeders in the nation, Bartlett Cattle Company boasts a one-time feeding capacity of 100,000 head of cattle. It maintains a pair of feedlots: one outside Tulia, Texas, and one near Sublette in Southwest Kansas. Sales and procurement for Bartlett's cattle business is conducted from the Texas Panhandle city of Canyon.
  </p>
