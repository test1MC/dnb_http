   KUKA is an industrial manufacturer that makes just about everything for the factory, including robots. The company provides factory machinery used in the aerospace, automotive, electrical, electronics, metalworking, plastics, and solar power industries. Its robotics and systems divisions provide planning and project management services and equip manufacturing plants with machines such as industrial robots, special welding machines, factory automation equipment, and transfer lines. KUKA operates plants throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The company, which has dozens of subsidiaries around the world, gets about 60% of its sales in Europe.

  <p>
   Founded in 1872 in Karlsruhe, Germany, as Patronenhülsenfabrik Henri Ehrmann &amp; Cie., the company took over Heinrich Wilhelm Lorenz, an industrial company based in the same city, in 1878. The growing company went public in 1889. Around 1900 the company began manufacturing packaging machines, expansion joints, and metal hoses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transitioning into machine engineering in 1919, the company added typewriters, sewing machines, and multiple die presses (used to press metal sheets) to its product range. The Quandt family acquired the majority interest in the company in 1928.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII began for Germany in 1939, and in 1940 the company began the production of spooling frames used to make chemical fibers; it soon added the manufacture of spray dryers (1941) as well. The company managed to survive the war, and in 1949 renamed itself Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Quandt family continued to control the company during the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1970 combined KUKA GmbH (defense-related products), which they also owned, and the company to form Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe Augsburg Aktiengesellschaft -- which shortened to IWKA AG. IWKA became a holding company in 1979 by converting its divisions into independent businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became a limited partnership in 1980 after the Quandt family sold its stake in the firm. Despite the Quandts' exit, expansion continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s as the firm continued to seek out and buy midsized companies in its core areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 IWKA bought more than 20 enterprises. It also sold off its defense companies Henschel (armored vehicles) and KUKA (30mm cannon-armed turrets) to
   <company id="91285">
    Rheinmetall AG
   </company>
   (Germany). The company continued to grow in 2000 by taking over Jagenberg AG's packaging technology. The purchase transformed IWKA into one of the world's leading suppliers of packaging machines. After IWKA's buying spree of 1999, its sales increased but profits declined as the acquisitions were digested.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to strengthen its core activities, IWKA sold its interests in defense technology to Rheinmetall in 2000; Rheinmetall, in turn, sold its packaging interests to IWKA. The company continued to restructure its operations in 2001 and following years, gradually phasing out the Process Technology businesses. It sold three companies -- Bopp &amp; Reuther Messtechnik, WPD Wartungs- und Prüfungsdienst, and MARCON Ingenieurgesellschaft -- in 2004 to the managers of those companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 IWKA sold VAG-Armaturen and two related subsidiaries to EQUITA, a private equity firm that was part of the Harald Quandt Group, returning a business to the Quandt family interests. The following year the company sold the RMG Group, consisting of eight main companies in the natural gas distribution products business. The buyer was Triton, a European private equity house.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, US activist investor Guy Wyser-Pratte led a shareholder coup to oust chairman Hans Fahr. Wyser-Pratte made clear his intentions for the company to sell off its non-core businesses and to focus on robotics. A few weeks later, the largest shareholders announced a special meeting, at which a number of the supervisory board members resigned and were replaced with alternates, including the chairman. This was seen as a victory for Wyser-Pratte, who owned about 10% of KUKA. Rolf Bartke, a DaimlerChrysler executive, was elected chairman of the supervisory board. Following the boardroom shakeup, IWKA began radically restructuring its businesses, selling off more companies and dismantling its Manufacturing Technology and Process Technology divisions. Industrial automation became its core business.
  </p>
  <p>
   IWKA continued dismantling its Process Technology division in 2005, selling IWKA Balg- und Kompensatoren-Technologie and its subsidiaries (also known as the Flexible Solutions group) to Odewald &amp; Compagnie of Berlin, a private equity firm. In 2006 IWKA sold the last of its Process Technology businesses, Bopp &amp; Reuther Sicherheits- und Regelarmaturen Group, to Tequity, a Frankfurt-based private equity firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   IWKA discontinued its EX-CELL-O (machine manufacturing) group operations and sold the business to Maxcor, an American private equity firm. In 2006 the company sold its Boehringer tool manufacturing subsidiary to Maxcor, as well. Later that year the company sold J. W. Froehlich Maschinenfabrik and its UK subsidiary to an MBO group led by Josef W. Fröhlich, the founder and CEO of Froehlich Maschinenfabrik.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 IWKA acquired the OmniMove division of IC Industrial Consulting, another German firm. OmniMove specialized in mobile platform systems. IWKA combined the business with its Kuka Roboter robotics subsidiary. The company then sold ARO-Gruppe, a manufacturer of welding tongs, to
   <company id="133738">
    Langley Holdings
   </company>
   . The business had about 600 employees and annual sales of €100 million, with operations around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company sold the Packaging Technology division to the private equity firm of Odewald &amp; Compagnie for around €255 million. The 20 companies in the division had combined sales of about €400 million in 2006 and employed more than 2,500 people in the Americas, Asia, and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   With divestitures concluded and the company focused on very specific areas of industrial automation technologies, IWKA's shareholders voted in 2007 to change the company's name to KUKA AG. The change was completed later that year.
