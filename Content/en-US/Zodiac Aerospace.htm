   Zodiac Aerospace has its eye on the sky. The company, formerly Groupe Zodiac, makes aerospace equipment for commercial aircraft, helicopters, and space applications. It operates through three main business areas: Cabin Interiors (cabin fittings), Aircraft Systems (fuel circulation, monitoring, and control systems), and AeroSafety &amp; Technology (evacuation systems and airbags). With about three-quarters of its workforce based outside of France, Zodiac maintains production facilities near some of the largest aeronautics manufacturers in the world, particularly in North America and Europe. The Domange and Marechal families together own about 25% of the company, equal to 40% of its voting rights.

  <p>
   French balloonist Maurice Mallet, who set a world record for the longest flight with his three-day trip from Paris to Wahlen (Germany) in 1892, founded the company that would become Zodiac in 1896. With an eye toward leisure and corporate (advertising) users, Mallet built his first collapsible balloon, the Zodiac I, in 1909. By the time WWI came along, the company had tried its hand at monoplanes, biplanes, hydroplanes, and even engines. It refocused on balloons at the start of the war, however, because the French thought they would be useful for bombing. When results were less than spectacular, the company turned its attention back to airplanes and was delivering two a week by 1916.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zodiac (formally Société Zodiac, Anciens Établissements Aéronautiques Maurice Mallet) struggled after the war, but survived by supplying various French government entities with observation balloons, semi-rigid airships, and motorized balloons. Its watershed moment came in 1934 when engineer Pierre Debroutelle designed a two-seat inflatable kayak. Before long WWII interrupted, but Debroutelle continued to work on his boats in secret using scrap balloon fabric. Zodiac's inflatables garnered some military contracts after the war, but it wasn't until Dr. Alain Bombard crossed both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic in a Zodiac that the craft became popular among civilian users.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company established a subsidiary in Spain in 1964 and formed a US subsidiary in 1970. It shortened its name to Zodiac in 1965 as its international sales grew. Zodiac struggled in the early 1970s, but established subsidiaries in Argentina, Germany, Greece, and Italy in the latter half of the decade. It also bolstered its aerospace operations with the acquisition of Aérazur and EFA (1978). Zodiac added subsidiaries in the UK and the Netherlands in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zodiac built its businesses through acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s. Notable purchases included Air Cruisers (aircraft escape slides, flotation devices, rafts; 1987), Pioneer (parachutes, 1988), Muskin (above-ground pools, 1991), and Weber Aircraft (aircraft seating, 1992). Zodiac also bought a majority stake in aircraft seat maker Sicma Aero Seat in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the aircraft sanitary systems business with its 1998 acquisition of MAG Aerospace. The next year it continued the acquisitive trend with the addition of Intertechnique (aircraft oxygen and fuel systems) from Dassault. In 2000 Zodiac's Weber Aircraft subsidiary bought Simula's airline seats unit, Airline Interiors. Zodiac added to its aerospace operations again in 2002 with the purchase of US-based ESCO, a maker of arresting systems for commercial and military aircraft. The next year Zodiac acquired the airbag division (Simula Automotive Safety Devices) of Simula.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zodiac made a number of buys for its marine segment in 2004, including Canadian pool company Vogue, French pool-heater manufacturer PSA, and Finnish firm Evac, which makes toilet systems for marine and aircraft use.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group in 2005 acquired US-based Polaris Pool Systems, the leading manufacturer of automated swimming pool cleaners, from private-equity firm
   <company id="118791">
    Quad-C Management
   </company>
   . Zodiac plans to utilize Polaris Pool's extensive US distribution network for complementary group products. Also that year Zodiac acquired US-based
   <company id="47616">
    C&amp;D Zodiac
   </company>
   , a maker of aircraft cabin equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, citing a poor fit with the rest of its operations, Zodiac sold its telephony division (turnkey network solutions for voice mail, pre-payment services, and voice portals) to eServGlobal Ltd. of Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Zodiac bought the aerospace and defense operations of France's Enertec. The acquired business -- which concentrates the collection, storage, and processing of civil and military aerospace data -- was absorbed into Zodiac's IN-SNEC, a telemetry subsidiary that is part of Zodiac's Technology division.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its
   <company id="137466">
    Zodiac Marine &amp; Pool
   </company>
   business to
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   in 2007. The division had been responsible for nearly 20% of sales. Also that year it added three businesses to its galleys and equipment portfolio in 2008: Dutch-based Driessen (air cargo equipment and in-flight trolleys), US-based The Richards Corp./TIA (airline galley equipment), and French-based Adder (passenger cabin equipment).
  </p>
  <p>
   Zodiac Aerospace rejected a bid to be acquired by France-based aerospace engine maker
   <company id="90795">
    Safran
   </company>
   in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year Zodiac Aerospace purchased Germany's Sell GmbH from
   <company id="57728">
    Premium Aircraft Interiors Group
   </company>
   . The deal for the designer and manufacturer of aircraft galleys deepens the company's footprint in commercial aircraft galleys and electrical galley inserts, as well as strengthen its relationship with Airbus.
