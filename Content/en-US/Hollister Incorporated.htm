   The products Hollister makes may not be fun to use, but they are necessary. The employee-owned company develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices used for wound, continence, bowel, and ostomy care as well as tube fasteners and various related accessories. Its vast range of products include catheters, collection devices, and wound dressings. The company has manufacturing centers in Missouri and Virginia in the US and in Denmark, Ireland, and India. It distributes products in more than 90 countries worldwide. John Dickinson Schneider founded the company in 1921 as JDS Printer Craftsman.

   Hollister also spreads the word about its products by providing continuing education courses to medical professionals looking to increase their knowledge about continence, ostomy, and wound care. Courses are offered online, through journal articles, and at conferences and workshops. Company division Hollister Wound Care develops products and education programs related to the science and technology of wound healing, while Hollister Bowel Care provides such products as catheter systems Actiflo and Instaflo as well as fecal collectors.

   The company has grown its operations both organically and through acquisitions; it expands its existing product lines by introducing new or next-generation medical devices on a fairly regular basis. In 2014 it introduced two new hydrophilic intermittent catheters -- the VaPro Plus and the Apogee HC.

   Also that year the company announced plans to invest â‚¬80 million in its manufacturing facility in Ireland.
