   No snickering about the name -- Bimbo Bakeries USA (BBU) is serious about making breads, cakes, and cookies. Its name is a shortened version of the Spanish word bambino, or small child; growing up, the US subsidiary of Mexico's baking behemoth
   <company id="95052">
    Grupo Bimbo
   </company>
   secures a big presence in the states. It operates through 70-plus bakeries and boasts 13,000-plus distribution routes. Other goods manufactured and marketed by BBU include tortillas, bagels, English muffins, pizza crust, and a variety of snacks. Its bakeries sell the lineup under a slew of name brands; among them, Bimbo, Boboli, Mrs Baird's, Oroweat, Old Country, Weber's, Francisco, Tia Rosa, and Marinela. BBU accounts for about 45% of Grupo Bimbo's sales.

   Sales growth moderated at Bimbo Bakeries USA (BBU) in 2013 versus 2012, rising just 1%, while operating income more than doubled over the same period. (In the previous annual comparison sales jumped 47% driven by the purchase of the Sara Lee business and volume recovery in the US.) US sales accounted for 45% of parent

   's 2013 sales. (The US, along with Mexico, are Bimbo's two largest markets.) BBU increased its market penetration and the volume of products sold in the US in 2013.

  <p>
   To meet increased production and distribution demands the baked goods company has announced plans to build a new bakery in Topeka, Kansas to serve the Southeast. In early 2014, BBU's new bakery in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania began operation, as did a new plant in Texas in 2013. The integration of the Sara Lee business is continuing in 2014 with a focus on lowering costs and increasing efficiency.

  <p>
   Bimbo Bakeries USA is a leader in premium breads, English muffins, and, as one might expect given its Mexican parentage, Bimbo boasts the #1 portfolio of Hispanic brands. Bimbo has grown its product portfolio and retail reach through acquisitions.

   In a move to further its reach, parent Grupo Bimbo in late 2011 acquired

    Sara Lee

   's North American bakery business for $709 million. The purchase added more than 40 plants and some 4,700 distribution routes to BBU's existing business. Grupo Bimbo also gained the rights to use the Sara Lee brand name globally for fresh-baked goods, with the exception of Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

   Previously, BBU's parent company in 2009 acquired the US'
