   Castle Brands hopes to earn a king's ransom selling imported distilled spirits. Among its brands are Tierras tequila, Pallini liqueur, Jefferson's bourbon, Brady's Irish cream liqueur, Betts &amp; Scholl wine, and Knappogue Castle Whiskey. As part of its business, the company also owns 60% of Celtic Crossing Irish liqueur. Castle Brands distributes its products nationwide and in a dozen international markets, as well as in duty-free markets. Castle Brands boasts marketing and distribution rights for other brands, such as Gosling's Rum and Travis Hasse's Original Apple Pie Liqueur. Castle Brands, formed in 2003, mainly contracts with other firms to distill and bottle its products.

  <p>
   New York-based Castle Brands supplies its products globally. International markets -- such as Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the UK, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates -- account for about 15% of sales.

   Sales rose some 16% for Castle Brands to $48.1 million in fiscal 2014 (ended March) versus 2013. Several of its brands (specifically Gosling's, Jefferson's, Clontarf, and Brady's) helped to drive growth during the reporting period. International case sales as a percentage of total case sales also inched up to 21% in 2014 as compared to about 19% in 2013. While Irish whiskey sales saw a bump in international markets, vodka sales slipped due to continued price competition. Losses mounted, however, with Castle Brands logging an $8.9 million net income loss in 2014 versus a $5.4 million loss in 2013. Increased operating expenses combined with rising interest expenses were offset in part by 2014's double-digit sales increases. And while cash flow from operations increased in 2011, Castle Brands has also suffered a downward trend in cash flow for several years, dropping $800,000 in 2014 to $5.8 million.

   Castle Brands'
   <em>
    modus operandi
   </em>
   consists of building distribution relationships and investing in marketing to create brand recognition in the already highly competitive alcoholic beverage market. US distributor behemoth
   <company id="40436">
    Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits
   </company>
   is the company's largest customer, accounting for about 32% of Castle Brands' 2014 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead of focusing its efforts on being a volume-oriented business, the key to Castle Brands' growth strategy is developing its portfolio of premium spirits and wine brands. The company is achieving this through strategic relationships and acquisitions. To this end, Castle Brands in late 2010 formed a joint venture -- Drink Pie, LLC -- to manufacture and market the Travis Hasse's Original Apple Pie Liqueur and Cherry Pie Liqueur line of spirits. The company is working to extend the distribution reach for the liqueur; its liqueur business generated some 10% of sales in 2014. To expand its cellar of premium wines, Castle Brands acquired US-based Betts &amp; Scholl in 2009. It paid $1 million in cash and company stock for the upscale winemaker. The purchase spurred Castle Brands in 2010 to create a fine wine division, through which midyear the firm inked a deal with Grand Cru Selections, a fine wine distributor in New York City, to import and market Cerbaie Brunello di Montalcino wine across the US.

  <p>
   Cases of liquor sold internationally dropped due to competition from wholesalers and increased price competition within the company's vodka segment.
