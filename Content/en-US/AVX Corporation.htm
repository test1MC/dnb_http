   </company>
   (which owns a controlling stake in the company), such as ceramic and tantalum capacitors that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy in electronic devices. The interconnect segment makes electronic connectors for automotive and medical electronics applications. Asia is its largest market.

        <p>
   The company has manufacturing facilities in some 10 countries and research and development centers in the Czech Republic, France, Israel, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   It generates about 42% of sales from Asia; the Americas and Europe each contribute about half of the remaining share. Europe was the only region to grow in fiscal 2012, the result of a strong European automotive market.

   AVX's revenue fell 6% in 2015 (ended March) to $1.35 billion. A 10% drop in the sales of Tantalum Components reflected softer as customers carefully managed inventory. Sales of Ceramic Components increased 5%, demonstrating opportunities in the automotive, computer, industrial and telecommunications equipment markets. In KDP and KCD Resale, sales dropped 22% on lower demand from cellular device customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   While revenue fell, net income leaped 77% higher to $225.8 million in 2015. The company attributed the increase to its focus on selling passive components with higher margins and lower manufacturing and overhead costs. AVX's cost of sales was about $140,000 million lower in 2015 than 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations turned around to close 2015 at $197 million from a negative cash flow of $79 million in 2014.
