   Terex makes a variety of cranes, aerial platforms, and construction and materials processing equipment. Its construction business makes compaction equipment, such as compact track loaders and excavators, as well as road building products. Another arm makes aerial lifts, from articulating to telescopic booms, used in industrial and construction overhead jobs. Terex products are sold in more than 100 countries around the globe to the construction, forestry, and recycling, shipping, and utility industries, under brands Terex, Genie, and Powerscreen.

  <p>
   The company makes and sells its construction and materials processing equipment across five operating segments. Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) generated about 33% of total revenues in 2015. The company's newest segment, Material Handling &amp; Port Solutions (MHPS) accounted for 22% of total sales. MHPS makes industrial cranes and industrial crane components under the Demag and Gottwald brand names. In 2016, however, Terex agreed to sell its MHPS segment to
   <company id="138465">
    Konecranes
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cranes segment generated 25% of revenues, while Construction earned 10%, and Materials Processing brings in 10%.

  <p>
   Terex sells its products through a worldwide network of dealers, rental companies, independent distributors, major accounts, and direct sales to clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's broad range of equipment is used by various industries, including the construction, infrastructure, manufacturing, shipping, transportation, refining, energy, utility, quarrying and mining industries.
  </p>

  <p>
   Terex's revenues decreased 10% from $7.3 billion in 2014 to $6.5 billion in 2015, and its net income declined 54% from $319 million to $146 million during that same time period. Its operating cash flow has fluctuated wildly over the years; after increasing in 2014 it declined by $198 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were fueled by lower net sales across all segments, with the largest declines coming from Material Handling  and Port Solutions (MHPS), Aerial Work Platforms (AWP), and Construction. This was the result of the disposition of businesses in its MHPS and Construction segments and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.

  <p>
   Terex's growth plan involves targeting developing markets with a slew of specialty machinery and industrial equipment using acquisitions and joint ventures. It has a joint venture in Russia, partnering with Russian Machines, a seller of road construction machinery operating in 14 regions throughout the country. Terex also has a 65% stake in Jinan, China-based boom crawler-maker Shandong Topower Heavy Machinery. Other forays into China include launching the Terex Port Equipment facility in Xiamen and the Aerial Work Platforms (Genie brand) factory in Changzhou.

  <p>
   It is also looking to address complexity reduction in our company through Portfolio Management (streamlining product portfolios), Simplification (process and system optimization), and Financial Efficiency (working capital, capital structure, and tax efficiency).

   In 2016, Terex agreed to sell its MHPS segment to
   <company id="138465">
    Konecranes
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion. It expects the deal will be completed by early 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2014 the company sold its trucking business to
   <company id="127550">
    Volvo Construction Equipment Corporation
   </company>
   for $160 million. The business manufactured and sold off-highway rigid and articulated haul trucks. Included in the deal was a manufacturing facility in Motherwell, Scotland.

   Real estate entrepreneur Randolph Lenz moved into heavy equipment manufacturing with the purchase of bankrupt snowplow maker FWD Corporation in 1981. That was followed the same year with the acquisition of Northwest Engineering, a maker of construction equipment started in the 1920s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 the company acquired Terex USA, the North American distributor of parts for off-highway Terex trucks, from
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   , and later Terex Equipment, the UK-based truck maker. The company changed its corporate name to Terex Corporation in 1987. That year Terex entered the mobile-crane market with the purchase of Koehring Cranes. Terex acquired mining-truck maker Unit Rig in 1988 and trailer maker Fruehauf in 1989. It moved into aerial work platforms in 1991 with the acquisition of Mark Industries and picked up the forklift business of Clark Equipment the following year. (Clark invented the forklift truck in 1928.)
