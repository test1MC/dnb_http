   mpany, or Taminco for short, is a leading manufacturer of alkylamines, a key chemical building block found in a wide variety of products. Alkylamines are used to make agricultural chemicals, animal feed additives, fuel additives, synthetic fibers, and chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Taminco also makes amine-based derivatives used in pharmaceuticals, detergents, insecticides, paint, rubber, performance solvents, and water and gas treatment. Altogether, it has seven production facilities (two in Europe; two in the US, in Florida and Louisiana; and three in China) and sales offices in almost 20 countries worldwide. The company, spun off from
   <company id="93837">
    UCB
   </company>
   in 2003, went public in 2013; it was acquired by Eastman Chemical in 2014.

   Taminco raised $236 million in its initial public offering; it plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt. (The company has about $900 million of debt, all of which was secured.)

   Taminco groups its products into three segments: functional amines, specialty amines, and crop protection. Functional amines, which accounted for about 45% of sales in 2011, consist of basic alkylamines and solvents used in many end markets. Specialty amines, which accounted for about 40% of sales in 2011, use the chemicals made by the functional amines segment as raw materials to produce alkylamine derivatives. Its customers are typically major international corporations. Finally, the crop protection segment, which accounted for about 15% of sales in 2011, manufactures alkylamine derivatives, active ingredients, and products used to control insects, worms, and weeds for the agricultural industry. Customers in this segment range from large agribusiness corporations, such as

    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   , to farms such as
   <company id="40256">
    Simplot
   </company>
   .

   As a vertically integrated manufacturer, Taminco makes both alkylamine and alkylamine derivatives and is able to benefit from cost consolidation. As such, the company is looking to expand its vertically integrated production approach to all of its worldwide operations. It recently expanded production of alkylamine derivatives at both of its US plants and is expanding the production capacity of methylamine at its Florida plant by 2015. (The two US plants were bought from
   <company id="10042">
    Air Products
   </company>
   in 2006.) One of its plants in China is a joint venture with
   <company id="107164">
    Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company
   </company>
   . Its seven plants have a combined production capacity of more than 1.3 million tons. However, the company closed its Brazilian plant, its only facility in South America, in 2011.
