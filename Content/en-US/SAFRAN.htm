  <p>
   SAFRAN has achieved significant growth over the last few years. In its fiscal 2014, revenue increased by 6% compared to 2013. The growth was attributed to a 9% uptick in revenue from aircraft equipment segment and a 7% spike in aerospace propulsion segment revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a net loss of â‚¬1.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to foreign exchange losses that it incurred and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. (Note the company restated its 2013 annual numbers due to changes in accounting policies.)
