   One new product launched in 2010 was the Aquilion One CT system, which is designed to serve the pediatric market. The system uses lower levels of radiation, which also reduces the need for patient sedation. TAMS is also working to reduce radiation exposure levels for patients of all ages, as well as to reduce scanning times for products such as its brain MR imaging devices.

   TAMS paid some $273 million to acquire one of its partner technology firms,
