   It produces private-label products as a contract manufacturer and uses a direct sales model to retailers, food distribution companies, and large institutional food service companies. More than half of sales are in foodservice; the remainder is split between retail and industrial customers who use edible oil products as ingredients in foods they make for resale. As part of its business, Ventura Foods offers its customers a full range of marketing programs and promotional materials, such as national flyers, point-of-sale materials, recipe brochures, and more.

   Ventura Foods has identified the Asia-Pacific region as a key market and ready for expansion. In 2014, the company tapped a unit of D&amp;L Industries to develop and produce specialty oils and ingredients to export and sell locally. The venture sources goods at the Philippine firm's plant in Quezon City.
