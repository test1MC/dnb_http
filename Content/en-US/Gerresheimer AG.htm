   Gerresheimer's mission is clear. Through
   <company id="91199">
    Gerresheimer Glas
   </company>
   and other operating subsidiaries, Gerresheimer produces specialty glass and plastic products for pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. The company makes molded and tubular glass, including syringes, ampoules (sealed sample bottles), vials, and laboratory glassware for companies in Europe and the Americas. It also makes glass bottles for cosmetics and beverage companies. The company's plastic products consist mainly of drug delivery systems like inhalers, insulin pens, and syringes. Gerresheimer crafts its products at some 40 production plants located in its key markets and Asia; it operates in the US through its
   <company id="123328">

   </company>
   unit.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Gerresheimer has more than 40 plants spanning Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Europe accounted for 34% of total net sales in fiscal 2015; whereas, Germany and Americas accounted for 24% and 23%, respectively. The remainder came from the emerging markets of Chile, Philippines, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan.

  <p>
   Gerresheimer's business is organized into three reporting and operating divisions: Plastics and Devices (47% of net sales), Primary Packaging Glass (46%), and Life Science Research (7%).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products through distributors. It primarily targets the pharmaceutical, diagnostics, and medical technology sectors.

  <p>
   Gerresheimer's revenues increased 7% from 2014 to 2015 and its net income skyrocketed by 57% primarily due to a 15% spike in Life Science Research sales. The growth was also attributed to upticks in sales from its Plastics and Devices (8%) and Primary Packaging Glass (4%) segments. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   Gerresheimer hopes to see revenue in all of its business units rebound as consumer markets -- which directly affect its cosmetics and life sciences research customers -- strengthen with the global economy. The company is also banking on its ever-increasing presence in economically-expanding countries like Chile, Philippines, Bangladesh, and Kazakhstan to drive some of its growth.

   To streamline its operations, the company sold its glass tubing business to
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   in late 2015. Glass tubing is an intermediate product which Gerresheimer manufactures mainly for its own plants; in turn, those tubes are used to manufacture ampoules, vials, cartridges, and glass syringes. In conjunction with the deal, Corning and Gerresheimer also entered into a 10-year supply agreement for borosilicate tubing.
