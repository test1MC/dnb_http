   <company id="11030">
    Mylan
   </company>
   . Mylan Pharmaceuticals offers more than 200 generic prescription products developed in-house and through distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. Mylan devotes most of its research and development efforts to the creation of extended oral dosages. Its sister company Mylan Technologies develops transdermal and polymer film patches. Its products are sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers, distributors, mail order pharmacies, and drugstore chains.

  <p>
   Mylan Pharmaceuticals is part of Mylan's generics business, which delivers nearly 90% of total revenue.

  <p>
   Mylan Pharmaceuticals is hoping to take full advantage of its manufacturing capacity of some 35 million doses as an aging population combined with efforts to reduce health care costs, and the resultant reliance on less-expensive generics continue to fuel demand in that industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focused on filling a niche by bringing generics to the US market that are difficult to formulate or manufacture, or for which the ingredients are difficult to obtain. Past examples of such drugs are pain medication fentanyl, epilepsy treatment levetiracetam, psychiatric drug divalproex, and over-active bladder medication oxybutynin. Those drugs (and others like them) continue to contribute to the company's bottom-line, even several years after their initial launch, because competition remains limited due to their high barriers to entry.
