   Stoneridge makes sure your vehicle's electrical system can send power to all the places where it needs to go -- whether it's an automobile, medium- or heavy-duty truck, or agricultural/off-highway vehicle. The company's electronics unit makes electronic control units, instrumentation displays, and driver information and electrical distribution systems. Its control devices segment products monitor and measure specific functions of a vehicle, using switches, control actuation devices, and sensors. Stonebridge also has a PST segment that makes vehicle security alarms and tracking devices.

  <p>
   Stonebridge's revenues fell 30% to $661 million in 2014 as it posted a net loss of $47 million for that year. (Note: the company restated its 2013 financial numbers due to the selling of its former wiring segment.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The net loss for 2014 was mainly due to goodwill impairment losses suffered from lower future sales and earnings growth projections stemming from significant weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market. Net income was also affected by higher costs of goods primarily due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates and from loss on early extinguishment of debt.

  <p>
   Stonebridge is focused on streamlining its operations for growth. In 2014 the company sold its wiring business to Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., for $66 million. The transaction included six manufacturing facilities located in Portland, Indiana; Chihuahua, Mexico; Saltillo, Mexico; and Monclova, Mexico; as well as an engineering and administrative center located in Warren, Ohio. The transaction emphasized the company's strategy to focus more on the development of its advanced technology products and engineered product applications
