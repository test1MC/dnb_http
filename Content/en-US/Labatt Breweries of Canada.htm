   Labatt Breweries of Canada has been true blue to lovers of its brew for more than 160 years. The company is one of Canada's most well-known brewers, producing about 60 local and global beer brands, including the first "iced" beer, Labatt Blue. As a subsidiary of
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   , it distributes Budweiser, Beck's, and Stella Artois, in addition to Labatt Blue, its mainstay product, to customers from Newfoundland to British Columbia. Labatt Blue garners more than 40% of the Canadian beer market; it is the country's top selling beer and the #1 Canadian beer worldwide. The company's other brands include Leffe, Hoegaarden, Staropramen, and Alexander Keith. Labatt operates seven production plants in Canada.

  <p>
   John Labatt arrived in London, Ontario, from England in 1833. The farmer gained a reputation for the malting barley he sold to a local innkeeper's brewery. Labatt teamed up with master brewer Samuel Eccles and bought a stake in the innkeeper's brewery in 1847.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the beginning the partners produced only three brands of beer (X, XX, XXX). In 1854 Labatt gained full control of the brewery. When the Great Western Railway came, he started shipping his products to nearby cities. Labatt died in 1866, leaving the brewery to his wife and son John II.
  </p>
  <p>
   John II modernized the company and expanded operations as far as the Northwest Territories. He died in 1915, a year before Prohibition in Canada bankrupted all but 15 of Ontario's 65 breweries. Labatt survived because of a loophole in the law that allowed the production of alcohol for export.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1920s and 1930s, Labatt became known for its generous employee benefits, including paid vacations and insurance. After WWII Labatt went public and began a period of rapid expansion, acquiring Toronto-based Copland Brewing in 1946. Ten years later W. H. R. Jarvis became the first non-family president of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1965 Labatt had a brewing capacity of 1.3 million barrels. Shortly thereafter the company began diversifying into food. Throughout this period then Brascan (now
   <company id="48103">
    Brookfield Asset Management
   </company>
   ) acquired increasing interest in Labatt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1980 the company made a deal with Anheuser-Busch to brew Budweiser in Canada, where it immediately captured about 8% of the market. With its leadership in beer intact, Labatt went on a decade-long shopping spree, acquiring an interest in the
   <company id="46710">
    Toronto Blue Jays
   </company>
   and several food and entertainment companies. Because Canada's antitrust laws threatened to block further Canadian expansion, Labatt began purchasing US businesses, including Johanna Farms (dairy, 1985) and Latrobe Brewing (Rolling Rock beer, 1987). The company bought 77.5% ownership of Birra Moretti and Prinz Brau (Italy, brewing, 1989). The food group acquired Black Diamond cheese (1990) and the Canadian license for
   <company id="13233">
    Häagen-Dazs
   </company>
   (1991).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Labatt sold several food subsidiaries, including JLFoods, Miracle Feeds, and Everfresh.
   <company id="10124">
    Archer Daniels Midland
   </company>
   purchased the company's Ogilvie Mills (flour milling).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 and 1993 Labatt's Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series. Also in 1993 Labatt introduced "iced beer," made from a new patented process that it licenses to other brewers. The company sued rival brewers
   <company id="42382">
    Molson
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55826">
    Miller
   </company>
   (US), alleging misuse of the term "iced beer." Also in 1993 Canada and the US began talks to ease cross-border beer sales. Soon after, Labatt introduced its bargain beer, Wildcat, to protect its share of the Canadian market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tension peaked between management and shareholders after Toronto-based holding company Brascan, Labatt's biggest shareholder, sold its stake in the company in 1993. Management moved to adopt a poison pill to avert unwanted takeover bids. But in 1994 shareholders vetoed the poison pill -- the first such defeat in Canadian history. Undeterred, CEO George Taylor continued to pursue Labatt's two primary segments: beer and broadcasting/sports. The company added ownership of the Toronto Argonauts (Canadian Football League) and NTN Canada (both since sold).
  </p>
  <p>
   Labatt raised eyebrows in 1994 when it paid a generous $510 million for a 22% stake in Mexico's

   </company>
   , brewer of popular beers such as Dos Equis and Tecate. (FEMSA Cerveza is now owned by

   </company>
   .) The following year the company became truly international with its acquisition by Interbrew and the subsequent merger of Interbrew and Ambev, forming InBev in 2004. That year the company also sold off its interest in the

   and ended a joint venture with
