   Ixia nixes network glitches. The company designs network validation testing hardware and software that provides visibility into traffic performance and also addresses the network applications. Hardware consists of optical and electrical interface cards and the chassis to hold them. Its software tests the functionality of video, voice, conformance, and security across ethernet, wi-fi, and 3G/LTE equipment and networks. Ixia primarily serves network equipment manufacturers (
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco
   </company>
   ), service providers (
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T

    Bloomberg

    US Army
   </company>
   ), and its contractors (
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   ). In 2017 Ixia agreed to be acquired by Keysight Technologies, a provider of electronic measurement equipment, for $1.6 billion.</p>

   In 2015, Ixia's revenue rose increased 11% to $517 million from $464 the year before on higher sales in products and services. The company shipped a higher volume of high-speed Ethernet interface cards in 2015.

        <p>
   Net income rose to about $6 million in 2015 following a loss of $41 million in 2014. The profit turned on higher revenue, settlement proceeds for costs previously charged to a restructuring line item, and a favorable lease buyout.

   Ixia's goal of being a leader in network test and visibility capabilities involves expanding its product base through acquisitions and internal research and development. R&amp;D is a big focus; the company spends about 25% of annual revenue on it and also operates Ixia Labs, a technology development incubator.

   Ixia frequently adds to its product portfolio through acquisitions. In late 2013 it bought Net Optics, a provider of network visibility hardware and software, for $190 million in cash. The year before it network optimization systems provider Anue Systems for $145 million to strengthen its capabilities in validating wirelessly-delivered next-generation networks and applications. Later that year it bought network security testing company BreakingPoint Systems for $160 million, rounding out its network test and visibility product offerings. In 2011 Ixia paid more than $15 million for VeriWave, a performance testing company for wireless LAN and Wi-Fi enabled smart devices.

   Chairman Errol Ginsberg founded Ixia in 1997 "in rather humble digs above a Mexican restaurant" in Calabasas, California, about an hour north of Los Angeles. The company went public in 2000 in a $57.5 million IPO, but sales failed to top $100 million for three more years.

   In 2003 Ixia acquired G3 Nova Technology, a developer of VoIP test tools for enterprise call centers, communications networks, and network devices, for about $12 million in cash and stock. Two years later it bought Communication Machinery Corp. (CMC), a developer of Wi-Fi network testing tools, for $4 million in cash.

   In 2006 Ixia acquired the video telephony test products of
   <company id="139905">
    Dilithium Networks
   </company>
   for around $5 million in cash. With the acquisition, the company introduced a product based on the Dilithium Network Analyzer (DNA). The IxMobile Video Telephony test tools are focused on mobile wireless conformance, interoperability, capacity, and performance testing.

   <company id="60896">
    Agilent Technologies

   <company id="57299">
    Catapult Communications
   </company>
   for about $105 million in cash. The company sees Catapult's 3G and 4G wireless networking test products as complementary to its Internet protocol performance test systems and service verification platforms.
