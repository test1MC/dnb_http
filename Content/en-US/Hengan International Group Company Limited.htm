   This company is soaking up the profits -- among other things. Hengan International is one of China's leading personal hygiene and household paper products manufacturers. It makes Hearttex-branded tissue and toilet papers. The company also makes sanitary napkins under the brands Anerle and Anle, Anerle-branded disposable baby diapers, and disposable adult diapers under the Elderjoy name. Additionally, it makes Banitore-, Bandi-, and Comfitore-branded first-aid items and MissMay skin care and cleansing products. Founded in 1985, Hengan operates more than 150 sales offices throughout mainland China. The company is well-positioned to benefit from rising prosperity in China.

   The Chinese personal hygiene company's sales increased 9% in 2012 versus 2011, to nearly $2.4 billion. Net income rose 32% over the same period to $456.4 million. The sales gain was driven by an increase in tissue paper and sanitary napkin products, offset by a decline in revenue from disposable diapers, food and snacks, and skin care products.

   Hengan International, along with other Chinese and foreign baby diaper makers, is looking to increase its diaper making capacity by 20% and start selling Q-Mo, a more expensive range of products, in the later half of 2014 in response to Beijing's recent decision to reform China's one-child policy (introduced in 1980). The government's move has foreign firms, including US-based

   and Japan's

   , looking to expand in the huge and fast-growing Chinese market. Baby diaper's account for about 15% of the company's sales.
