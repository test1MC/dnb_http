   The maxim "one man's junk is another man's treasure" is a saying Jasper Engine Exchange takes to the bank. The company (dba Jasper Engines &amp; Transmissions; JASPER) is a remanufacturer of automotive drive train parts. Jasper takes worn out auto parts or "cores" and remanufactures them for sale to the automotive aftermarket. Products remanufactured by the company include gasoline and diesel engines, transmissions, and differentials (gears, axle assemblies). It also remanufactures high-performance engines and transmissions, marine engines, alternative fuel engines, and electric motors.

  <p>
   Jasper's main remanufacturing operations reside in Jasper, Indiana. It has more than 40 branch and distribution centers in Crawford County, Indiana and Willow Springs, Missouri, and exports its products to North America (Canada and Mexico), Europe, and Asia.

  <p>
   The company differentiates itself from other auto parts manufacturers, stressing that its remanufactured engines are outfitted not only with new but upgraded parts. Once upgrades and improvements are made, the components undergo testing for vacuum, compression, leaks, oil temperature, and pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jasper reports an annual production of more than 117,500 gas and diesel engines, transmissions, differentials and rear axle assemblies. Its  portfolio also includes performance engines and transmissions, marine engines, stern drives, outboard lower units and outboard powerheads, alternate fuel engines, and electric motors.
