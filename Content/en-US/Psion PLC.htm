   David Potter grew up in southeast Africa. He left to study physics on a scholarship at the University of Cambridge, where he received his doctorate and became a lecturer. With stock market winnings, he started Psion in 1980. (The company's name derives from Potter Scientific Instrument; the "on" was added for effect.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The nascent Psion developed computer games such as
   <i>
    Hungry Horace
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Horace Goes Skiing
   </i>
   . In 1984 it provided word processing and other business software for a computer released by Sinclair Research (later part of now defunct British PC maker Amstrad). That year Psion produced the world's first digital diary, the Psion Organiser.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increasingly complex devices followed. In 1989 Psion bought Dacom, a maker of modems for laptop computers. Following a failed foray into laptops, in 1991 Psion introduced its first palmtop computer, which featured word processing and database storage applications, and debuted Psion's EPOC operating system for handheld devices. Another version, released in 1993, featured a modem for sending data plus a microphone and speaker for recording dictation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Psion began developing handhelds (Workabout) for commercial and industrial markets in 1996. It also began licensing EPOC to other companies. The following year the company took a beating when competition from palmtop products running on Microsoft's new Windows CE operating system bit into sales and development costs cut into profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company formed
   <company id="58043">
    Symbian
   </company>
   , a joint venture with telecom equipment giants
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   , and Motorola, to further develop EPOC as the standard operating system for mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Psion started incorporating Sun Microsystems' Java programming language into EPOC in 1999. Also that year Japanese electronics giant
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   joined Symbian. Later in 1999 Palm formed an alliance with Symbian to place both Palm OS and EPOC on phones made by Nokia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Psion bought Canadian wireless network and software developer Teklogix International for $368 million. The company merged its newly acquired assets with its Enterprise Computing unit to form Psion Teklogix. After Motorola pulled out of a pact to develop wireless handhelds with Psion, the company phased out its Psion Digital division, which catered to the consumer market. Psion Digital contained its former Connect (PC modem cards), Mobile Computing (palmtop computers), and InfoMedia (digital radio receivers) units.
  </p>
  <p>
   After exiting the smartphone market, The company in 2001 began focusing on subsidiary Psion Teklogix (wireless handhelds for tracking inventory). Psion also formed the Signa Services subsidiary to provide wireless local-area network implementation services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Psion sold its Psion Software division to Visto in 2004. The company also sold its stake in Symbian to Nokia that year.
