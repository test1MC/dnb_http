   The slowing oil business and a problem project combines to cut revenue 25% in 2014 from 2013. Oil and gas companies put off purchases and delayed projects to deal with the lower prices for oil. Synectics also took a hit from poor performance on a large surveillance system integration and installation contract. That project not only cost the company money, it took management attention from developing new business. North America was the only segment to grow in 2014, with sales rising about 70% there.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower revenue resulted in a net loss for the company in 2014.
