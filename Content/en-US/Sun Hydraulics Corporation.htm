   It's not solar power that Sun Hydraulics delivers, but fluid power. The company makes screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves and custom manifolds used to control speed, force, and motion in fluid power systems. Cartridge valves offer a general purpose floating design that is unique in pressure capacity, reliability, reduced size, and installation. Sun Hydraulics' valves and manifolds are used in myriad industrial and mobile products, including construction, agricultural, and utility equipment, and, to a lesser extent, in machine tools and material handling equipment. The company operates through subsidiaries and distributors in the US, UK, Germany, Korea, China and India. The Americas represents almost 50% of sales.

  <p>
   Its products' worldwide manufacture and availability fuels the Floridian company's performance. Approximately 60% of sales are to customers outside of the US. About 20% of sales are buoyed by customers in the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   Sun's products are sold globally through a combination of wholly-owned companies, representative sales offices, and independent and authorized distributors. In addition to distributors, the company sells directly to other companies within the hydraulics industry, including competitors, which incorporate its products into their hydraulic products or systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company currently has 87 distributors, 56 of which are located outside the US. In 2015, sales to Sun's largest distributor represented less than 6% of net sales.

  <p>
   After achieving a milestone revenue total of $228 million in 2014, Sun saw its revenues drop 12% to $201 million in 2015. Profits also plunged from $44 million in 2014 to $33 million in 2015. The declines for 2015 were attributed to decreased sales across all its geographical segments, including the Americas (13%), Europe (11%), and the Asia/Pacific (9%). This was fueled by lower demand for capital goods equipment coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange rates for the year.

  <p>
   The company maintains a strategy of selectively expanding its core product, two-thirds of which are sold for breadth of mobile equipment applications and the remainder for fixed-in-place, or automation machinery, applications.  Emerging end markets include nontraditional sectors, such as animatronics, wind power, solar power, and amusement park rides.
