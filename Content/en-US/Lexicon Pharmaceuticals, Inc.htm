   Lexicon Pharmaceuticals works with some of the biggest words in the dictionary -- words like deoxyribonucleic acid. The drug development company is focused on a handful of potential medicines in clinical and pre-clinical research stages. Its candidates have been identified by its gene knockout technology and aim to treat conditions such as diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, carcinoid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and glaucoma, some of which are being researched through partnerships with other drugmakers. The company got its start with the development of knockout mice -- mice with DNA modified to disrupt, or "knock out" certain gene functions -- to study the potential effects of drugs on various genetic targets.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's lead candidates are telotristat etiprate (LX1032) for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and sotaglifozin (LX4211) for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Other candidates include LX1033 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and LX2931 for the treatment of autoimmune disease.

        <p>
   Lexicon owns some 26,000 sq. ft. of corporate and laboratory space in the Houston area. It leases an additional 42,000 sq. ft. of office and lab space near Princeton, New Jersey.

        <p>
   In late 2014, Lexicon entered into an agreement with
   <company id="152002">
    Ipsen Pharma
   </company>
   under which it granted Ipsen exclusive royalty-bearing licensing rights to commercialize telotristat etiprate outside of the US, Canada, and Japan. Lexicon received a $23 million initial payment. As such, Ipsen Pharma represented 94% of revenue in 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lexicon has made its designer mice available to other researchers and receives license and royalty fees from their sale. Other customers include research organizations affiliated with

   .

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Lexicon relies upon income from its drug development and licensing collaborations to fund its discovery work. As a result, like many development stage companies, Lexicon's revenues fluctuate from year to year depending on partnership payout levels. In 2014, revenue rose 928% to $22.8 million, primarily as a result of the company's license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has not turned a profit since its founding, and it doesn't expect to report positive net income until one or more of its candidates gains
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval. In 2014 net loss declined a modest 4% to $100 million as interest earnings rose and on sales of excess property and equipment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Operating cash outflow also decreased that year, declining 17% to $75 million.

   Lexicon's proprietary drug candidates include lead compounds LX1032 for carcinoid syndrome, LX4211 for type 2 diabetes, and LX1033 for irritable bowel syndrome. Over the years it has formed collaborations with other drug companies to further development of its candidates, such as
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11326">
    Schering-Plough
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition to working with pharmaceuticals, the company seeks to collaborate with research institutes and schools to capitalize on its drug target discoveries.

        <p>
   In late 2014, the company entered into an agreement with Ipsen Pharma granting Ipsen exclusive royalty-bearing licensing rights to commercialize telotristat etiprate outside of the US, Canada, and Japan. The following year, Lexicon and Bristol-Myers Squibb selected a development candidate for the treatment of neuropathic pain as part of their drug discovery and development partnership.
