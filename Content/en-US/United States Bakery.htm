   Man may not live by bread alone, but we could do pretty well with products from the ovens of United States Bakery. The company, also known as Franz Family Bakery, owns and operates nine regional bakeries, as well as a chain of some 50 bakery thrift stores, located in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. In addition to selling baked goods at its retail and thrift outlets, United States Bakery sells a variety of breads, pastries, bagels, donuts, and cookies to grocery stores, restaurants, food manufacturers and foodservice providers. It also offers private-label services. United States Bakery was founded in 1906 by Engelbert and Joseph Franz and is still owned and operated by the fourth generation of Franz family members.
