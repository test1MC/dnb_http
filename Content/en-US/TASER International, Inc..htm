   TASER International's weapons aim to take perps down but not out. The company is well known for designing and manufacturing various non-lethal TASER lines of stun guns, including its best-selling TASER X26. These electronic control devices (ECDs) are geared at the law enforcement, corrections, military, and private security markets, as well as consumers. The company also offers AXON wearable video cameras for officers and a hosted product called Evidence.com that allows digital evidence to be viewed, shared, and managed from a Web browser. Products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force, distribution partners, and online store and third-party resellers.

  <p>
   Worldwide, more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies in more than 150 countries have purchased TASER brand products for testing or deployment. More than a dozen US state correctional agencies from Oregon to Tennessee also use TASER devices. On the military side, TASER International develops products for both the US (including the

   </company>
   ) and certain foreign allies through contracts. The US generates 80% of its sales.

  <p>
   TASER International's most popular product is the TASER X26 with shaped pulse technology, which is geared toward the law enforcement, corrections, military, and private security markets. It generates about 40% of the company's total sales. On the consumer side, its primary product is the TASER C2, a compact device that provides the same NMI effectiveness as the market-leading TASER X26 law enforcement version. Private citizens who buy the C2 for their own personal defense must undergo identification verification before the device is activated.

  <p>
   TASER International has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $165 million in 2014. Profits also reached almost $20 million in 2014, another company milestone. In addition, its operating cash flow has skyrocketed the last five years, soaring from only $732 thousand in 2010 to $35 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was driven by the introduction of its new TASER X26P smart weapon and significant growth from its AXON product line. It also was helped by the absence of litigation expenses for the year.

  <p>
   In addition to product line extensions, TASER International is putting significant R&amp;D time and money into technology-based products, an area that it views as likely to sustain the most growth. Its TASER Cam is a video recording device that captures both video and audio of TASER use incidents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also developed its officer video and digital evidence management system, consisting of the AXON tactical computer (an earpiece with imager, speaker, and microphone built in) and Evidence.com hosted site (from which agencies and legal professionals can quickly and securely access key evidence data). The company is poised for explosive growth within these segments as a growing number of police departments across the US place orders for body cameras that officers can wear to document their interactions with the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geographically, the company is heavily dependent on the US market for sales. However, it is working to diversify that base by increasing marketing of its products in such places as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and various parts of Europe. Wholly-owned subsidiary TASER International Europe SE was established to facilitate sales and provide customer service to European customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, in 2015 the company purchased Tactical Safety Responses Limited (TSR), a licensed distributor of smart weapons and body cameras in the UK.
