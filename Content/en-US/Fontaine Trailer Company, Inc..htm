   Marmon's Highway Technologies division and its parent company's CEO Warren Buffett are dedicated to the trucking industry. They recognize that the demand for domestic freight hauling will increase over the next decade, and that outsourcing business to emerging countries like China will only get more difficult, especially in regard to logistics. Companies will need to develop tighter supply chains, and that is where trucking gets its competitive edge.
