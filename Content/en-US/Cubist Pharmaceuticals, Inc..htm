   Fighting infection is a modern art at Cubist Pharmaceuticals. The company develops antimicrobial agents to treat drug-resistant bacterial strains, including methicillin-resistant
   <em>
    Staphylococcus aureus
   </em>
   (MRSA), typically found in hospitals and other health care institutions. Its flagship product Cubicin (daptomycin for injection) is an
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved intravenous antibiotic to fight MRSA infections of the skin and blood. Cubist also markets Entereg, a drug to speed patient recovery following bowel resection surgery, in the US. Cubist's pipeline includes candidates in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development. In early 2015

   bought Cubist in a $9.5 billion deal.

  <p>
   The sale provides Cubist with access Merck's sheer strength and market size. On the other hand, Cubist provides Merck with a stronger foothold in hospital acute care and antibiotic resistance.

  <p>
   Third-party manufacturers produce the company's active ingredients and finished products. Cubist also outsources the warehousing and distribution of its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cubicin has been the company's main source of revenue since its launch in 2003. With approval in more than 70 countries, sales of the drug have climbed steadily over the years. Other products include Entereg, a drug sold to hospitals in the US. Cubist has also co-promoted

   ' Dificid antibiotic for
   <em>
    C. difficile
   </em>
   associated diarrhea (CDAD) in the US through an agreement lasting until mid-2013. Anticipating the expiration of the agreement, Cubist agreed to acquire Optimer in July 2013, and the purchase closed in October.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounts for more than 90% of Cubist's annual revenues. Outside the US, its products are commercially available in more than 50 countries.

  <p>
   The company uses its own hospital-focused sales force to market the drug in the US; internationally, it relies upon distribution agreements with such companies as
   <company id="52941">

   in Europe, the Asia/Pacific region, and certain Central American, South American, and Middle Eastern countries;

   Major customers include wholesale distributors

   . The three companies each account for about 20% of annual revenues.

  <p>
   Cubist's revenues grew 23% to $926 million in 2012, primarily due to a 16% increase in sales of Cubicin in the US and a 38% increase in international Cubicin sales (through marketing partners). Entereg and Dificid sales also rose that year. Net income jumped 367% to $154 million due to higher revenues and interest income. While profits have alternated between growth and decline in recent years, the company's revenues have steadily increased over the last five years.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's primary growth strategy revolves around increasing sales of Cubicin and Entereg both in the US and internationally, with the goal of achieving $2 billion in revenues by 2017. Cubicin's sales have increased over the years as Cubist has expanded promotional efforts and territories for the drug. It is also working to expand the number of approved indications for Cubicin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cubist also looks to grow by adding new product offerings through internal R&amp;D programs, as well as through occasional partnerships and acquisitions. For instance, in 2011 it entered the Dificid co-promotion agreement with Optimer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cubist's own R&amp;D pipeline includes several drug candidates in various stages of development, including one aiming to treat CDAD, an IV antibiotic candidate for multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections and pneumonia, and a potential treatment for opioid-induced constipation (OIC). The company expanded its R&amp;D capacity at its headquarters location during 2012 by opening a new research lab.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company added its second commercial product, Entereg, in 2011 by acquiring struggling drug development firm Adolor. Adolor also had products under development, including the OIC candidate in late-stage clinical trials. The $330 million deal included cash and shareholder contingent payment rights on drug candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it added the Dificid antibiotic through the $550 million purchase of Optimer Pharmaceuticals. Cubist already marketed Dificid through a distribution agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company entered an option agreement through which Cubist may acquire development firm Adynxx, should the entity's lead pain medication reach certain development milestones.
