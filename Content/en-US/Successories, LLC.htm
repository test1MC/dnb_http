   At a time when workplace cynicism is in vogue, Successories is the anti-Dilbert. The company makes personal motivation and self-improvement items, including awards, books, coffee mugs, computer and desk accessories, framed desk and wall decor, greeting cards, and pens. Products produced by Successories are sold through the millions of catalogs it mails each year, its Web site, and a handful of retail stores in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, and Texas. Successories was founded in 1985 by Arnold (Mac) Anderson. It published its first catalog in 1988, went public in 1990, and was taken private in 2003. TWS Partnership acquired the company in June 2009.

   Mac Anderson, a collector of inspirational sayings, founded McCord Travel in 1980. He sold McCord in 1984 but hung on to its interest in motivational products and renamed those operations Celex (Celebrating Excellence). Celex began by selling wall plaques and other gifts to corporations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celex grew rapidly as it expanded both its product lines and its target markets. The retail stores expanded its reach beyond corporations to general consumers looking for a motivational boost. However, insufficient management controls led to inventory problems, including difficulties with order fulfillment and inventory discrepancies. Celex shuffled management and introduced new inventory control systems. In 1996 it changed its name to Successories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Successories bought catalog company British Links Golf Classics in 1996 and in 1997 licensed the
   <i>
    Golf Digest
   </i>
   name from The New York Times Company for a golf-related catalog. In 1998, though, amid rising costs, the company halted European expansion and ended a kiosk arrangement with Waldenbooks. Successories also started to convert its company-owned stores into franchises. The next year company president Gary Rovansek became CEO, and director Jack Miller replaced Anderson as chairman. In 2000 the company discontinued its golf catalog. The company's franchised store count has steadily fallen since 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon Successories' announcement (in February 2003) that it would merge with S.I. Acquisition, Rovansek resigned. John Carroll (SVP, COO, and CFO) was named president and CEO. In June 2003 Successories went private upon the completion of its merger with S.I. Acquisition LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Years later, in June 2009, TWS Partnership purchased Successories and its co-founders (brothers Ted and Warren Struhl) became the co-CEOs for Successories.
