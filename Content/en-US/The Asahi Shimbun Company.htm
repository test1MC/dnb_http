   The Asahi Shimbun Company is one of Japan's leading media conglomerates with interests in publishing, printing, and broadcasting. Its flagship
   <em>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </em>
   is the #2 newspaper in Japan behind
   <i>
    Yomiuri Shimbun
   </i>
   . It also has regional papers and special interest publications, as well as an international edition published in partnership with
   <company id="51064">
    International Herald Tribune
   </company>
   (a subsidiary of
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times Company
   </company>
   ). In addition to publishing, Asahi Shimbun owns a third of national broadcaster
   <company id="103267">
    TV Asahi
   </company>
   . Other operations include advertising and commercial printing. The
   <em>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </em>
   was established by Ryohei Murayama in 1879. The Murayama and Ueno families continue to control Asahi Shimbun.

   Ryohei Murayama, the son of a wealthy merchant in Osaka, published the first issue of
   <i>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </i>
   in 1879. The four-page paper was intended to provide news in an easy-to-read format for the general public. Riichi Ueno later joined Murayama, and together in 1881 they purchased the paper outright from their backers. By 1883 it was the most widely read newspaper in Japan. It expanded to Tokyo in 1888 and became the first Japanese newspaper publisher to have foreign correspondents in Europe and the US.

   A sharp critic of the government and the military, Asahi Shimbun defied the government censorship during the Rice Riots of 1918 (when housewives plundered the warehouses of rice merchants who were speculating on rice prices). The company successfully launched two weeklies in the 1920s,
   <i>
    Shukan Asahi
   </i>
   (1922) and
   <i>
    Asahi Graph
   </i>
   (1923). Its criticism of the armed forces led to a military boycott of
   <i>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </i>
   in the 1930s, culminating in an assault on its Tokyo office by army officers in 1936. Military censorship stifled the newspaper's reporting during WWII, and following the war the company's executives admitted their complicity in publishing misleading information and resigned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regaining its standing as the "people's organ," the company launched its English-language
   <i>
    Asahi Evening News
   </i>
   and the English-language review,
   <i>
    Japan Quarterly,
   </i>
   in the 1950s. Asahi Shimbun became the first publisher in the world to use facsimile and offset printing to publish daily newspapers in 1959.
  </p>
  <p>
   Major investigative pieces became the hallmark of
   <i>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </i>
   in the 1970s and 1980s. The paper exposed collusion between government, big business, and the civil service, such as the Lockheed scandal involving under-the-table payments to Japanese politicians. In 1988
   <i>
    Asahi Shimbun
   </i>
   broke the "Recruit Affair," another bribery scandal that led to the resignation of then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other top politicians. Its journalistic drive continued into the 1990s, breaking the 1992 story of Â¥500 million in kickbacks to Japanese political kingmaker Shin Kanemaru in connection to scandals centering on parcel delivery service Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. (The news touched off a nationwide political reform movement.)

   In 1995 Asahi Shimbun scored an exclusive when it was the first to beam images of the Sakhalin (Russia) earthquake around the world. SOFTBANK and News Corp. sold their shares of Asahi National Broadcasting (TV Asahi) to Asahi Shimbun in 1997 to promote future cooperation of Japanese TV programming for Japan Sky Broadcasting (JSkyB), a satellite broadcasting network started by the two heavyweights. Asahi Shimbun president Muneyuki Matsushita died in 1999 and was replaced by Shinichi Hakoshima, the company's senior managing director. The next year TV Asahi went public to finance its conversion to digital broadcasting standards. In 2001 the firm joined the
   <i>
    International Herald Tribune
   </i>
   to publish a new English-language paper to replace the
   <i>
    Asahi Evening News.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Kotaro Akiyama replaced Hakoshima as president in 2005.
