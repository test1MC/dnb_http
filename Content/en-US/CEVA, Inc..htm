   CEVA has a fever for semiconductor design. CEVA specializes in technology -- both integrated circuit and software designs -- used in cell phones, handheld computers, MP3 players, and other wireless devices, as well as smart TVs and set-top boxes. It licenses its silicon intellectual property (SIP) designs to such industry heavyweights as
   <company id="55961">
    LG
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="111702">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   . CEVA's SIP has been shipped in more than 7 billion devices to date; about 30% of handsets shipped worldwide each year contain its SIP. Most of CEVA's revenue comes from outside the US.

  <p>
   CEVA generates revenue from licensing and royalties. Licensing accounts for 54% of revenue and royalties bring in the other 45%. Customers find it more efficient to license technology from CEVA and similar companies than develop it on their own.

  <p>
   Headquartered in California, the company has research and development operations in Israel and Ireland. Other offices are located in China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEVA generates nearly three-quarters of its revenue from the Asia-Pacific region, including sales to customers in China (50% of total revenue). US customers account for 16% of revenue.

   CEVA's revenue and profit increased in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand for the company's LTE technology helped drive revenue to $59.5 million, a 17% increase from 2014. Intellectual property related to Bluetooth technology and contributions from RiveraWaves (acquired in 2014) also propelled revenue growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose to $6.27 million in 2014, compared to a loss of $819,000 in 2014.

  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to about $19.3 million in 2015, compared to $9 million in 2014.

   CEVA operates in a highly competitive sector of the semiconductor industry and aims to expand its business reach beyond cellular baseband markets. It sees a growing demand for high-performance and low-power digital signal processor (DSP) and application-specific platforms incorporating DSP cores for other applications such as wireless infrastructure, computational photography, computer vision, Bluetooth, the Internet of Things, machine-to-machine applications, and storage. As such, the company continues to invest in new technologies to enter new markets and capitalize on its relationships with semiconductor and OEM licensees that develop CEVA-based products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 CEVA expanded its partnership with Spreadtrum for technology for mid-market and high-end smartphones. Spreadtrum's latest 64-bit Octa-Core LTE SoC platform, the SC9860, integrates several CEVA DSPs. It enables signal processing workloads, including LTE Cat-7 baseband, audio and voice, sensor fusion, and always-on.

  <p>
   Brian Long and Peter McManamon founded Silicon Systems in 1993. Long's background included a stint at
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and 17 years with
   <company id="10462">
    Digital Equipment
   </company>
   ; McManamon co-founded a large-screen projector company. Silicon Systems was aided early on by seed capital from Enterprise Ireland, a government-run development agency, plus its first customer,
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   . Long took advantage of his previous contact with the Switzerland-based semiconductor giant to secure early contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next five years, Silicon Systems honed its design skills in a number of technologies, performing contract work for STMicroelectronics and other chip manufacturers. During this period the company retained ownership and licensing rights to its intellectual property, which incorporated expertise in digital, analog, and mixed-signal chips, as well as in software design.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silicon Systems narrowed its focus in 1998, deciding to concentrate on technology for mobile devices. That year
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   invested in the company, trading $16 million for a 23% stake (reduced to 19% after the company's public offering, and subsequently divested).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Silicon Systems changed its name to Parthus Technologies and acquired the Global Positioning System (GPS) division of electronics maker
   <company id="14718">
    Symmetricom
   </company>
   . Later that year the company went public, listing on both the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange in what was at that time the largest technology float by an Irish company. The offering made the reticent Long (he was often accused of being too modest about the company's achievements) one of the richest men in Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parthus secured a number of major contracts in 2000, including licensing deals for its NavStream GPS with
   <company id="56243">
    ARM Holdings
   </company>
   , and for its processor design for wireless devices (InfoStream) with Motorola, Inc., and
   <company id="47010">
    Psion
   </company>
   . The next year the company bought privately held Chicory Systems (technology for speeding up mobile Internet applications) in a cash and stock deal valued at about $41 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company combined its operations with Ceva, the IP licensing arm of
   <company id="16944">
    DSP Group
   </company>
   , to form a new company called ParthusCeva. Parthus president Kevin Fielding became CEO of the combined company. Fielding stepped down in 2003; Long became interim CEO for a few months until industry veteran Chet Silvestri succeeded him as president and CEO. That same year the company changed its name from ParthusCeva to CEVA. Silvestri added the post of chairman in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silvestri resigned as chairman and CEO the following year, leaving CEVA's board altogether. Co-founder Peter McManamon replaced him as chairman and EVP/GM Gideon Wertheizer was promoted to CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and associated products to GloNav, a fabless semiconductor startup, in return for an equity stake of about 20% in the firm. GloNav also licensed the CEVA-TeakLite digital signal processor core for the development of its GPS chipsets. At the end of 2007, however,
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   acquired GloNav, and CEVA divested its 20% stake.
