   There's nothing cloudy about this company's goal: continuous availability. Stratus Technologies makes fault-tolerant servers that can be configured with its proprietary Avance High Availability software. Its systems are sold under the ftServer, V Series, and Continuum brands. Stratus offers product support and managed service programs covering continuous availability and recovery. The company's products are used by banks and other financial services providers; it also serves the government, health care, and manufacturing markets, among others. Customers have included

   . Stratus is owned by Siris Capital Group.

   Siris Capital Group bought Stratus for $532 million in 2014. Stratus expected investment from Siris to accelerate development of its software and cloud businesses.

   Stratus touts its remote monitoring and management services as being crucial to its ability to reinvent itself as more than a hardware company. Stratus developed the lower-cost ftServer system in order to transition away from its legacy (and high cost) V Series and Continuum systems. The addition of software that runs on non-Stratus servers gives the company access to the small business market, as well.
