   When people pick up smoking, British American Tobacco (BAT) picks up steam. BAT is the world's second-largest publicly-traded tobacco company by market share (after
   <company id="55957">
    Philip Morris International
   </company>
   ). The company rolls more than 660 billion cigarettes a year, sold in 200 markets across 60-plus countries. BAT's five global cigarette brands -- Dunhill, Kent, Rothmans, Lucky Strike, and Pall Mall -- account for more than a third of group sales. BAT also produces loose tobacco and regional cigarette brands, giving it a portfolio of more than 200 brands overall. It owns 42% of
   <company id="55935">
    Reynolds American
   </company>
   , the #2 US cigarette maker created by the merger of BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson unit with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. BAT holds about 30% of India's
   <company id="140680">
    ITC
   </company>
   , as well.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sources its product from more than 100,000 tobacco farmers worldwide. BAT contributed about £30 billion worth of excise and other taxes to governments worldwide in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   BAT's five Global Drive Brands (GDBs) include Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, and Rothmans.

  <p>
   BAT generated 28% of its total revenue from sales in the Asia-Pacific region in 2014, while sales from the Americas; Western Europe; and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) regions contributed 21%, 24%, and 27% to total revenue, respectively.

  <p>
   BAT sells its product through retailers, wholesalers, distributors, and logistics providers. About 50% of its global volume is sold by retailers that are supplied by direct distribution or exclusive distributors.

  </p>
  <p>
   BAT has struggled to grow its revenues and profits over the past few years as cigarette and tobacco product sales have been dampened worldwide with decreasing use rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue fell by 8% to £13.97 billion ($21.7 billion) in 2014, mostly because of unfavorable foreign exchange rates across its international markets. Not counting this, however, BAT's revenue rose by nearly 3%, as its price mix increased by 4% during the year. The cigarette maker recorded volume growth in Bangladesh, China, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela; while cigarette sales volumes in Brazil, Russia, Vietnam, and Western Europe shrank by around 1%. The strength of its GDBs drove its share growth higher by 10 basis points in key markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining revenue in 2014 caused BAT's net income to fall by nearly 20% to £3.39 billion ($5 billion), while the company's operating cash fell by 8% to £4.9 billion ($7.6 billion) as cash earnings shrank during the year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BAT in 2015 continued to invest in high-growth markets, with a focus on Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also pledged to continue introducing differentiated products and next-generation tobacco products, such as its recent Vype brand e-cigarettes and Voke, a nicotine inhalation product licensed as medicine in the UK; the company reported that its innovations made up nearly 50% of its Global Drive Brand (GDBs) volume during 2014. The company planned to launch its new tobacco heating product in test markets in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with struggling sales in recent years, the firm has had to cut back operations in several markets to keep its profits stable. In 2014 it closed factories in Australia, Colombia, and Congo, while restructuring factories in Argentina, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, and Switzerland. In past years the company has cut costs by closing and downsizing its operations in other countries, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, Poland, as well as combining businesses in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. All told, the cigarette maker has scaled back the number of factories it operates to 44, from 83 (including acquisitions) in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cigarette industry continues to consolidate, adding possible challenges for BAT in the future. BAT's equity stake in rival Reynolds helps to hedge its bets, but it comes with its own set of challenges. In 2014, for example,
   <company id="55935">
    Reynolds American Inc.
   </company>
   acquired smaller cigarette maker
   <company id="55993">
    Lorillard
   </company>
   , forcing BAT to make a $4.7 billion investment to keep its 42% equity stake in the enlarged Reynolds.
  </p>
  <p>
   To mitigate this challenge and bolster its market presence in the tobacco industry, in 2016 the company agreed to acquire the remaining shares in Reynolds American, about 58%, for $49.4 billion.

   , about 58%, for $49.4 billion. The deal, upon approval, will bring BAT 100% ownership of Reynolds' Camel, Doral, Eclipse, Pall Mall, and Newport cigarette brands, as well as other tobacco products.

   In fall 2011 it purchased Colombia's second-largest cigarette maker, Productora Tabacalera de Colombia (Protabaco) for $452 million. Protabaco's brands include Mustang (the country's #2 selling cigarette), Premier, and President. The deal elevates BAT from third place to second in Colombia's cigarette market.

  <p>
   After a year of vicious price-cutting between Imperial Tobacco (UK) and James Buchanan Duke's American Tobacco in the UK, Imperial counterattacked in the US. To end the cigarette price war in the UK, the firms created British American Tobacco (BAT) in 1902. The truce granted Imperial the British market, American the US market, and they jointly owned BAT in the rest of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Duke in control, BAT expanded into new markets. In China it was selling 25 billion cigarettes a year by 1920. When the Communist revolution ended BAT's operations in China, the company lost more than 25% of its sales (although China later reemerged as a major export market for the company's cigarettes).
  </p>
  <p>
   A 1911 US antitrust action forced American to sell its interest in BAT and opened the US market to the company. BAT purchased US cigarette manufacturer Brown &amp; Williamson in 1927 and continued to grow through geographic expansion until the 1960s. In 1973 BAT and Imperial each regained control of its own brands in the UK and Continental Europe. Imperial sold the last of its stake in BAT in 1980.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fearing that mounting public concern over smoking would limit the cigarette market, BAT acquired nontobacco businesses; it changed its name to B.A.T Industries in 1976. The acquisitions of retailers Saks (1973), Argos (UK, 1979), Marshall Field (1982), and later, insurance firms, diversified the company's sales base. After a 1989 hostile takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith, it sold its retail operations, and retained its tobacco and financial services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 B.A.T acquired the former American Tobacco for $1 billion. In 1997 the company acquired Cigarrera de Moderna (with 50% of Mexico's cigarette sales) and formed a joint venture with the Turkish tobacco state enterprise, Tekel.
  </p>
  <p>
   B.A.T's tobacco operations were spun off in 1998 as British American Tobacco (BAT). The financial services operations were merged with Zurich Insurance in a transaction that created two holding companies: Allied Zurich (UK) and Zurich Allied (Switzerland). With the changes, Martin Broughton became chairman of BAT.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 1999 paid $8.2 billion to buy Dutch cigarette company Rothmans International (Rothmans, Dunhill) from Switzerland's Compagnie Financiere Richemont and South Africa's Rembrandt Group -- both controlled by Anton Rupert. With the purchase, BAT received a controlling stake in Canada's Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges (RBH).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 BAT bought the 58% of Canada's
   <l1>
    Imasco
   </l1>
   it didn't already own. Imasco sold off its financial services and BAT received Imasco's Imperial Tobacco unit (not related to the UK's Imperial Brands) in the deal. (Formerly called Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada, Imasco was created in 1908 with help from BAT.) BAT also unloaded its share of RBH via a public offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 BAT bought the 40.5% of its BAT Australasia subsidiary (formed in 1999 through the Rothmans merger) it didn't already own. Broughton announced that year that the Chinese government had approved development plans that would allow the company to build a factory in China. The company also announced it would build the first foreign-owned cigarette factory in South Korea, at that time the world's #8 tobacco market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increasing its Latin American regional presence, BAT purchased a controlling stake in Peru's top tobacco company, Tabacalera Nacional, and several of its suppliers in 2003. However, two months later BAT said it would not make the million-dollar investment in the company. The announcement came soon after Peru raised taxes on cigarettes. By the end of the year, BAT had purchased tobacco manufacturer Ente Tabacchi Italiani S.p.A. from the Italian government. BAT sold the distribution end of its Italian business to
   <company id="103129">
    Compañía de Distribución Integral Logista
   </company>
   in 2004, the same year that Broughton retired; the company named Jan du Plessis as chairman and Paul Adams as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2009 the company acquired an 85% stake in Indonesia's fourth largest cigarette maker PT Bentoel Internasional Investama Tbk for £303 million ($494 million) from Rajawali Group. Later that year Richard Burrows became chairman; he replaced du Plessis, who had become chairman of
   <company id="41798">
    Rio Tinto
   </company>
   . Replacing Adams, Nicandro Durante became CEO in early 2011. BAT in fall 2011 acquired Colombia's second-largest cigarette maker, Productora Tabacalera de Colombia (Protabaco) for $452 million.
