   AVANIR Pharmaceuticals doesn't have anything against tears, it just wants them to be triggered by emotions instead of central nervous system disorders. Its main drug NUEDEXTA treats pseudobulbar affect -- the involuntary crying or laughing experienced by some people with neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, or following brain injury or stroke. NUEDEXTA is also in late-stage trials for diabetic neuropathic pain. AVANIR had an earlier success with its development of OTC cold sore cream Abreva, which

    GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare
   </company>
   markets in North America. The company receives royalty revenues from GSK and other licensees around the world. AVANIR was acquired by Japan's

    Otsuka Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   in early 2015.

  <p>
   Otsuka, which makes schizophrenia and depression drug Abilify, is looking to grow its presence in the US, the largest market for pharmaceuticals. AVANIR operates as a subsidiary of Otsuka after the acquisition, which is valued at some $3.5 billion. The companies will work together to develop and market central nervous system-related treatments in the US.

  <p>
   NUEDEXTA is sold in the US and approved in the EU. AVANIR is assessing commercialization plans for Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The drug is also in trials to treat a variety of neurological symptoms associated with Parkinson's, Alzheimers, and multiple sclerosis. AVANIR's other candidates are being evaluated for the treatment of neurological disorders (AVP-786) and migraine (AVP-825).

  <p>
   AVANIR also markets

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets NUEDEXTA in the US and intends to sell it in Europe as well. It markets Abreva in the US and Canada under license from GSK. Once its Breath Powered intranasal migraine candidate is approved, AVANIR will sell it throughout North America.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AVANIR uses third-party distributors to sell NUEDEXTA in the US to physicians specializing in psychiatry, neurology, geriatric medicine, and internal medicine as well as to inpatient and outpatient mental health centers.

  <p>
   With NUEDEXTA hitting its stride in the market, the company saw an 83% revenue spike in 2013. With increased sales, however, came increased product costs and sales and marketing and general corporate expenses. AVANIR also paid about $26 million to in-license AVP-825. At the end of fiscal 2013, in September, it had an accumulated deficit of $500 million. Cash used in operations in 2013 went up 78% as the company paid out for operating expenses and for an upfront payment of $20 million for AVP-825.

  <p>
   To improve its position, AVANIR is seeking commercialization partners for NUEXTA in Europe. The company also continues testing its approved product for other uses and testing additional neurological candidates. It also looks to in-license promising and approved drugs. To that end, in 2013 AVANIR signed a co-promotion deal with Merck to sell that company's diabetes treatment in long-term care facilities, where it already has established relationships.
