   Wind farms have gotten a lot more pervasive, thanks to Gamesa Corporaci贸n Tecnol贸gica. The company is one of the top manufacturers of wind turbines in the world, having installed about 27,000 MW of wind turbines in more than 40 countries around the globe. It manufactures nacelles, towers, blades, root joints, blade moulds, generators, and gearboxes. It also develops, constructs, and sells wind farms and has installed 6,000 MW and has an 18,000 MW capacity in Asia, Europe, and the US. In addition, Gamesa provides engineering and maintenance services on its equipment. The company was founded in 1976.

  <p>
   The company has production centers in the wind markets of Brazil, China, India, Spain, and the US. Latin America is the company's biggest market, accounting for 32% of sales. The US accounts for 20%, while Europe and other countries contribute 27%.

   Gamesa saw its revenues fall 10% from $3.92 billion 2011 to $3.52 billion 2012. After years of profitability, the company also suffered a net loss of $871 million during 2012.

  <p>
   Fueled by the Global Wind Energy Council's (GWEC) forecast that wind energy and its installation rates increase significantly in the years ahead, the company is making strategic acquisitions, forging alliances, expanding production facilities, building its core capabilities, and focusing on emerging markets. It has a particular eye on Latin America (Mexico and Brazil) as a region ripe for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a net loss for 2012, the company is focused on trimming its workforce and reducing costs by closing facilities. In 2012 Gamesa discontinued its wind farm development operations in the US due to the high costs of gas prices and regulatory volatility.
