   DeRoyal Industries helps doctors give their patients DeRoyal treatment. The company makes medical equipment and supplies for the surgical, acute care, orthopedic, and wound care markets. Its surgical and acute care product lines include custom procedural trays, anesthesia and temperature monitors, birthing and neonatal items, cardiovascular care supplies, and endoscopy products, as well as systems devoted to the disposal of medical waste. Orthopedic products include braces and splints, immobilizers, positioners, and other patient care and rehabilitation items, as well as orthopedic implants. The wound care segment offers wound dressings and burn treatments. DeRoyal is owned by chairman and founder Pete DeBusk.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   DeRoyal operates more than two dozen facilities in five countries (the US, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, and Guatemala) and five US states (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia). The company sells its products around the globe. Its main distribution center is located at its headquarters in Powell, Tennessee; manufacturing operations are also concentrated in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   To enhance European sales, DeRoyal opened a new sales and marketing office in Dublin, Ireland, during 2012. In 2013 it partnered with a UK-based third-party logistics firm, Seabourne Group, to speed up distribution processes in the region.

  <p>
   The company's 25,000 products are made through five business divisions. The surgical and acute care unit is responsible for product used by hospital surgery, obstetric, and general care units. Its orthopedic division makes braces and patient protection goods, while the orthopedic implant unit offers plates, screws, and fragmentation systems for bone and joint repair. The company's final two divisions provide wound care dressings and OEM services.
  </p>
  <p>
   DeRoyal is an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for its own products, as well as a manufacturer of medical, industrial, and consumer products for external clients. That distinction gives DeRoyal the ability to handle contract manufacturing for suppliers inside and outside the medical industry. Along with producing medical equipment, DeRoyal's facilities provide goods in specialty segments such as plastics, textiles, electronics, and metals.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support medical professionals who use its equipment, the company offers web-based tools including DeRoyal Order Connection and DeRoyal PACK Management (supply management), DeRoyal Orthopedic Protocol Guidelines (documentation and billing tips), and eRoyal Billing Index (reimbursement lookup assistance).

  <p>
   DeRoyal has an international sales force of about 200 representatives; it also farms out distribution to third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to customers in the health care market, including hospitals and physicians, DeRoyal serves a growing number of customers in the electronics, aerospace, and lawn and garden markets through its OEM division.

  <p>
   DeRoyal expands by conducting internal product development efforts, as well as by acquiring innovative technologies and businesses. For instance it entered the orthopedic fracture repair implant market in 2011, and added several new products to the line in 2012. The company is one of the many medical device companies expecting to benefit from the aging US population, which will lead to increased demand for many of the products the company supplies, such as its orthopedic supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also widens its offerings by entering partnerships with other manufacturers, such as an agreement reached in 2012 to act as the exclusive international distributor of products made by Flagship Surgical. To simplify customer ordering and tracking processes, as well as to help consumers understand reimbursement and clinical information, DeRoyal is also improving its online equipment and care management tools.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on core operations, DeRoyal divested its Plastics Development unit in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, in 2012.
