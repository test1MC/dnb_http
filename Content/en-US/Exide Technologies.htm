   Select, Absolyte, and Sonnenschein make up some of the company's brand names. Exide traces its roots back to 1888 when Thomas Edison founded The Electric Storage Battery Company.

  <p>
   Exide voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the summer of 2013 in order to reduce its debt and restructure to better compete in its market. It has been pained by increased production costs, strong competition, and a slow European economy. The company emerged from bankruptcy in mid-2015 and reduced its debt by approximately $600 million.

   In the Americas, Exide sells aftermarket transportation products through various distribution channels, including mass merchandisers, auto parts outlets, wholesale distributors, and battery specialists. It sells its OEM transportation replacement products principally through dealer networks. In Europe and other countries, Exide sells OEM batteries to the light vehicle, light commercial vehicle and commercial vehicle industries.

   In addition to its internal efforts to improve revenues, the company is pursuing collaborative partnerships and alliances to expand its advanced battery technology and product offerings. Along with any efforts to expand, though, the company's supply costs have been rising. To cushion itself against such instability, Exide takes pricing actions and tries to obtain higher captive spent battery return rates. As the primary material in Exide's batteries, lead accounts for about 50% of the cost of goods produced.

   Exide got its start in 1888 when Thomas Edison founded The Electric Storage Battery Company (ESB) in Gloucester, New Jersey, to develop a backup battery for steam engines and dynamos. By 1890 ESB had installed the first practical battery backup in a Philadelphia utility, and that year it also provided batteries for the US's first streetcars. Sales picked up as the versatility of the battery was recognized, and in 1898 ESB batteries powered the US Navy's first submarine. The company was soon the world's top battery maker.

   The Exide brand name (short for "excellent oxide") debuted in 1900, and the firsts kept coming: the first automobile ignition battery (1903), the batteries used in the first transcontinental telephone services (1915), and the batteries used for the first air-conditioned train (1931).
