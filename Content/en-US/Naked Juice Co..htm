   may dominate the juice market, but Naked Juice makes a splash with its juices. The company, a subsidiary of
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   and part of its Americas beverage arm, focuses on preservative-free (thus "naked"), no-sugar-added juices, smoothies, and other beverages. Its Naked Juice line is spiked with combinations of proteins, probiotics, vitamins, and herbs and it's divided among seven functional families, such as Well Being and Antioxidant. Its products are sold throughout the US at health food stores and neighborhood markets, as well as major food retailers and club stores. Naked Juices are also available in Canada and the UK.

   While parent

   does not break out financials specifically for Naked Juice, the company's
   <company id="161393">
    PepsiCo Americas Beverages
   </company>
   segment posted 2% decreases in revenue in 2013. It attributes the decline to sales slips across its carbonated soft drinks (5% decreases) and its non-carbonated beverages (down 2%). The latter reflected a high single-digit decline in its overall water portfolio.
