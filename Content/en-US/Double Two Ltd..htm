   Double Two is banking safely on the success of its shirts, not on a four-the-hard-way crap shoot. Originally called Double Two because of an innovative design that included two sets of collars and two sets of cuffs, the company has since evolved into a designer and producer of a full range of men's and women's apparel. As a result, its products include pants, skirts, jeans, and suits, though its focus remains primarily on dress shirts for both sexes. Double Two is a sister company to uniforms and corporate clothing maker
   <company id="134074">
    Wm. Sugdens &amp; Sons
   </company>
   . Both of these apparel companies are owned by
   <company id="134063">
    The Wakefield Shirt Group
   </company>
   , which shares its executives across the three companies.
