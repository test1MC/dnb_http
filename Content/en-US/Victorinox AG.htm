   The business of Victorinox is cutting-edge. Victorinox is better known as the maker of the iconic Swiss Army Knife. Victorinox, founded in 1884, also makes men's and women's apparel, Swiss Air Force watches, professional and consumer Victorinox Cutlery, and Swiss Army Brand products, such as watches, writing instruments, and sunglasses. The multi-tool Swiss Army Knives are made in the company's factory in Ibach. It also licenses the Victorinox name for fragrances, travel gear, and accessories. Its products are distributed to retailers and wholesalers worldwide, and in the US Victorinox operates a flagship Swiss Army retail store in New York City's SoHo district.

   The company launches new products to commemorate its numerous milestone anniversaries. For instance, Victorinox in 2014 debuted its Inox watch collection to Indian consumers in Kochi to mark its 130th anniversary. It also created a 52-piece line of Swiss Army Knives in 2014 under the Delemont Collection name. For its 125th anniversary, the company rolled out several special editions of its products to spark interest among consumers. It crafted an anniversary collection that comprises items from six of its product groups, including knives, cutlery, timepieces, apparel, travel bags, and fragrances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Forming marketing alliances with culinary talents also helps Victorinox create buzz around its products. Victorinox partnered with executive chef Daniel Humm to help peddle its cutlery.
  </p>

   Staying on top of technology, the company produces a Presentation Master knife, complete with Bluetooth connectivity, that boasts a fold-out USB flash drive, laser pointer, fingerprint scanner, nail file, and screwdriver.

   . TRG Accessories had produced Swiss Army-brand luggage under a Victorinox license for more than a decade.

  <p>
   Charles Forschner &amp; Sons was founded in 1855 in New Britain, Connecticut, as a manufacturer of butcher scales. After Forschner's death in 1877 his son Richard changed the company name to RH Forschner and moved it to New York. The company began offering imported German cutlery to its butcher customers in 1921. Economic turmoil leading up to WWII forced the company to find another knife supplier. Forschner found Victorinox, a small cutlery producer and marketer based in Ibach, Switzerland. It produced high-quality professional cutlery as well as the Original Swiss Army Knife. Forschner became a major customer for Victorinox's Swiss Army Knife in 1937 and sales took off in 1947 as returning GIs looked for the multi-function red knives they'd seen during their European tours of duty.
  </p>
  <p>
   RH Forschner became the exclusive US distributor of the knives in 1972. Investor Louis Marx bought the company in 1974. It stopped selling scales the next year and switched from selling pocketknives to wholesalers to selling directly to retailers. Without a cent spent on advertising, the Swiss Army Knife became a cult item, and sales rose from $800,000 in 1974 to $11 million in 1981. Marx took RH Forschner public as the Forschner Group in 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
   Forschner branched into Swiss Army Brand watches and sunglasses in 1989. It signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Victorinox for Canada in 1992 and added the Caribbean in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Swiss Army Brands, Inc. (SABI) in 1996. The next year SABI introduced (and then discontinued) sports watches under the name Allenby and Co., Outfitters. The company discontinued its Cuisine de France cutlery subsidiary in 1997. SABI reported losses and charges of about $11 million in 1996 and 1997 for restructuring and discontinued products but returned to profitability in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 SABI launched a $10 million ad campaign to promote a single brand image for the company's diverse lines of products. It introduced Swiss Air Force watches in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   President Rick Taggart was named CEO in 1999, and Victorinox increased its stake in the company by buying shares from Marx. Also in 1999 SABI bought Bear MGC Cutlery, a multi-tool and knife manufacturer and the watch business of Swiss competitor S.A.W. Company. In July 2000 the company (along with Victorinox) acquired Xantia, its primary watch manufacturer and assembler.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taggart resigned in April 2001 to be succeeded as CEO by chairman Peter Gilson and as president by SVP Jeffrey Turner. In October of that year SABI and Victorinox formed an international watch company, Victorinox Swiss Army Watch AG. Also in 2001 Marx sold the rest of his stake in SABI to Victorinox, and the company opened a retail store in New York City. In 2002 Victorinox bought all the outstanding shares of SABI it didn't already own. Gilson and Turner resigned, and Victorinox put Susanne Rechner (who had engineered the turnaround of the company's watch division) in charge; she became SABI's president.
