   You might say that the Volex Group is on an extended power trip. Volex manufactures electrical power cords, custom and standard cable assemblies, radio frequency connectors and assemblies, high-speed copper cable assemblies, and fiber optic cable assemblies, all of which serve four key markets: consumer products (Volex's largest revenue generator); telecommunications/data communications; healthcare; and a slew of industrial applications. The company operates multiple manufacturing units worldwide, supported by sales and engineering offices dotting Asia, the Americas, and Europe.

  <p>
   The company has its operations across 16 countries worldwide and operates from nine manufacturing facilities with 18 sales and support offices spanning Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Asia (excluding India) accounts for 61% of its revenue. Other major markets include North America (21%), Europe (14%), India (2%), and South America (2%).

  <p>
   Volex operates through two segments. Its Power segment (65% of net ales) designs and manufactures power cords that are sold to the manufacturers of a broad range of electrical and electronic devices and appliances. Its Data segment (35%) designs and manufactures a broad range of cables and connectors -- ranging from high speed copper cables to complex customized optical cable assemblies -- that transfer electronic and optical data.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, the company's revenues increased 6% due to additional sales to existing customers and new customers from investments within its salesforce. Volex suffered three straight years of net losses from 2013 to 2015.

  <p>
   According to Volex, the consumer electronics industry is projected to increase at an annual growth rate of almost 7% from 2014 to 2018. As such, it is targeting this sector to attract additional customers, especially in China and North America. 3D printers is a key product line the company intends to focus on going forward.
