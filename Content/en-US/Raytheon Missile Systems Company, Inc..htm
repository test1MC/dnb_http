   MS is one of four divisions owned by Raytheon. Other Raytheon segments include
   <company id="142720">
    Integrated Defense Systems
   </company>
   ;
   <company id="103891">
    Intelligence, Information and Services
   </company>
   ; and
   <company id="143401">
    Space and Airborne Systems
   </company>
   . MS is its parent company's largest segment, generating more than 20% of revenues.

   Other MS principal product lines include Air &amp; Missile Defense Systems (AMDS), which manufactures standard and advanced missiles and unmanned systems, as well as its Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV; non-explosive warhead that uses a missile as a boost vehicle) that is designed to collide with an incoming warhead. Land combat products include the laser-guided rocket and the shoulder-launched multipurpose assault weapon, among others.
  </p>
        <p>
   Land Warfare Systems (LWS) offers integrated mission solutions in the land domain for the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="150625">
    Marine Corps
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Drawing on its capabilities in advanced airframes, guidance/navigation systems, and high-resolution sensors, the company is able to develop and support its weapons systems. Heightened awareness of terrorist threats, as well as the pugnacity of North Korea, have given cause for increased interest in defensive missile systems. MS partners with leading defense, weapons, and electronic communications companies, and works for the US armed forces to develop strategic missile systems for the US and as many as 40 allied nations.

   As the conflict continues in the Middle East, cuts in the defense budget have been made by the Obama administration. Traditional weapons have been eschewed for high-tech systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and advanced sensors. MS is in a better position to survive the budget cuts than many of its competitors, due to its product line up. The new defense budget supports technology and products that increase the military's speed, flexibility, and precision, which characterize many of the Missile System's offerings. The segment has seen demand increase for its Standard Missile-3 interceptor, and has won contracts to manufacture a small guided bomb for the US Air Force and an artillery shell for the US Army.
