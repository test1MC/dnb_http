   Got gas? With no embarrassment, Luxfer Gas Cylinders has. The company makes aluminum and composite high-pressure gas cylinders. Its lineup offers compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles, CO2 and mixed-gas cylinders for beverages, extinguishers for fire, as well as life-support cylinders for medical and recreational scuba markets, and paintball cylinders for players. Luxfer's manufacturing process uses hydraulic rams to shape aluminum billets into hollow shells, which are closed and threaded. The lightweight results are ideal for high-pressure storage of gases. Luxfer, a part of UK-based Luxfer Holdings, operates eight plants in North America, Europe, and Asia, serving customers in more than 50 countries.

  <p>
   Luxfer makes its gas cylinders at two US plants along with single plants in the UK, France, Germany, Canada, and China. It participates in a 50/50 joint venture to product gas cylinders in India as well as alternative fuels joint ventures in India and South Korea; the company also has distribution centers in Italy and Australia.

  <p>
   In 2014 Luxfer's parent, Luxfer Group, purchased Vexxel Composites, a maker of high-pressure composite cylinders for containment of compressed natural gas (CNG). The company will become a part of Luxfer Gas Cylinders, and the deal added a new facility purpose-built for the manufacture of new composite cylinder products. These products will be targeted primarily at the class 8 heavy-duty truck market, where a high rate of conversion from diesel to CNG is widely anticipated.
