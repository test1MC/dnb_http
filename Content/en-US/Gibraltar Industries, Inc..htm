  <p>
   Despite experiencing a 4% bump in revenue from 2013 to 2014, Gibraltar experienced a net loss of $82 million during 2014. The loss was primarily due to intangible asset impairment charges of $108 million it paid due to lower estimated fair values of certain operating units in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by a 10% bump in Residential Products sales. This was fueled by a spike in volume, an increase in pricing to customers, and additional sales generated by an acquisition completed in late 2013.

  <p>
   A key component of Gibraltar's growth strategy involves the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it purchased RBI Solar, Inc. and Rough Brothers Manufacturing Inc. (collectively RBI) for $130 million. The transaction will enable Gibraltar to leverage its expertise in structural metals manufacturing and materials sourcing to meet the fast-growing global demand for solar racking products. RBI is a North American provider of photovoltaic (PV) solar racking components and products.
