   Not all toffee is special and not all chocolate is choice, unless we're talking about Thorntons. The chocolate- and toffee-maker owns 370 sweets shops and franchises about another 260 throughout the UK and Ireland. The stores offer premium and hand-crafted boxed chocolates, hampers, gift boxes, corporate gifts, and seasonal candies. It makes both organic and diabetic confections. Some of the Thornton shops double as cafes where patrons can get coffee, pastries, and sandwiches. The company sells sweets through its catalog and via its website, as well as at stores operated by other retailers. Thorntons in mid-2015 agreed to be acquired by Italian chocolate maker

   Founded by J. W. Thornton in 1911, Thorntons is the #1 brand of boxed chocolate in the UK. The company operates in two segments. The Retail segment (50% of net sales) consists of its stores, franchises, and consumer direct operations, while its FMCG segment (50%) encompasses its UK commercial and international trading channels and manufacturing operations.

  <p>
   Thorntons' revenues increased 1% from 2013 to 2014 due to increased sales from FMCG (Franchise and Consumer Direct) division, partially offset by decreased sales from retail division. UK commercial sales increased 10% and international sales spiked by 5% during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the rise in revenue, Thorntons experienced a 71% sure in net income for 2014, mainly as a result of a sharp decrease in operating expenses.

  <p>
   Going forward the firm is focused on the continued development of new products, improving retail and commercial sales, and selectively developing export markets. It aims to maintain a multi-channel retail presence to ensure its products are available to consumers wherever and however they choose to shop.
