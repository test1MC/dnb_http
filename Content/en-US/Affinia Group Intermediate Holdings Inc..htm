  <p>
   The company saw its revenues jump 8% from 2012 to 2013. The growth for 2013 was driven by a 9% increase in its filtration segment due to increased sales in its North American and Asia operations driven by increased volume as a result of market growth and new business with existing customers. European sales increased in 2013 due to higher sales in Poland along with favorable currency translation effects in Poland. Increased Venezuela filter sales were the main contributor to the increase in South America sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Affinia posted net income of $10 million in 2013 after posting net losses in 2011 and 2012. The positive net income for 2013 was attributed to the absence of losses from discontinued operations, as opposed to other years.

  <p>
   With the sale of its Brake North America and Asia group in 2012, and the announced signing of an agreement to sell its Chassis group in 2014, the company is focused on operating strictly as a Filtration segment and Affinia South America segment company. (Affinia agreed to sell its chassis operations to

    Federal-Mogul
   </company>
   in January 2014.)

   to form Affinia. In mid-2010 Affinia filed to go public, but remains privately owned.
