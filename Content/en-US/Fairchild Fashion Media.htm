   Fairchild Fashion Media is all the rage. The publisher produces the bible of the fashion industry, trade magazine
   <em>
    Women's Wear Daily
   </em>
   (WWD), as well as WWD.com. WWD is known as the paper of record for executives in the fashion, retail, and beauty industries. Other holdings include
   <em>
    M
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Footwear News
   </em>
   (FN). Fairchild also produces conferences through Fairchild Summits, while its Fairchild Books produces textbooks and educational resources for students of fashion, merchandising, retail, and interior design. The company was founded in Chicago by Louis Fairchild in 1892. In 2014 Penske Media agreed to acquire Fairchild Fashion Media from
   <company id="57226">
    Condé Nast
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   In 2012 the company re-launched
   <em>
    M
   </em>
   , a quarterly magazine for men who care about fashion.
   <em>
    M
   </em>
   took the place of
   <em>
    Menswear
   </em>
   , combining the strength of its dedicated audience with the legacy and recognition of the
   <em>
    M
   </em>
   name, a popular men's magazine published by Fairchild in the 1980s and 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    M
   </em>
   magazine expands its editorial focus beyond fashion to take a journalistic look at what is happening in the broader modern culture.
