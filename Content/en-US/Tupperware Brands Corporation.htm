   Tupperware Brands Corporation (TBC) makes and sells household products and beauty items. TBC deploys a salesforce of about 3 million people across some 100 countries. The company also sells its products online. Brands include Armand Dupree, Avroy Shlain,
   <company id="12756">
    BeautiControl
   </company>
   , Fuller, NaturCare, Nutrimetics, Nuvo, and, of course, Tupperware. Its BeautiControl unit sells beauty and skin care products and fragrances in North America, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific region. Tupperware parties became synonymous with American suburban life in the 1950s, when independent salespeople organized gatherings to sell their plasticware.
  </p>

  <p>
   TBC operates five business segments, mostly based on geographic market. Its largest is the Asia/Pacific segment, which generated 34% of TBC's total sales during 2015 and sells beauty and personal care products under the NaturCare, Nutrimetics, and Fuller brands. The Europe segment (26% of sales), which counts the broader EMEA region, sells beauty and personal care products under the Avroy Shlain and Nutrimetics brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Tupperware North America segment (15% of sales), what Tupperware is best known for, focuses on developing and marketing preparation, storage, and serving solutions for kitchen and home. TBC's Beauty North America segment (12% of sales) makes and markets premium cosmetics, skin care, and personal care products under the BeautiControl brand in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico; and the Armand Dupree and Fuller Cosmetics brands in Mexico and Central America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's South America segment (13% of sales) sells housewares and beauty products under the Fuller, Nuvo, and Tupperware brands.

  <p>
   Consumer products company TBC enjoys a global reach, with 91% of its sales coming from outside the US in 2015. About 34% of its sales came from the Asia Pacific region, while 27% came from North America and 26% came from the EMEA region. The rest of its sales came from South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tupperware's manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Brazil, Belgium, China, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Venezuela, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   TBC distributes its products worldwide primarily through a direct-to-consumer method, whereas an independent sales force sells its products directly to consumers outside traditional retail store locations. At the end of 2015, it boasted some 2,000 distributors, 101,700 managers, and 3.1 million dealers worldwide. TBC's direct sales force logged 25 million Tupperware parties worldwide in 2014, up incrementally from 24 million in 2013, 22 million in 2012, and 21 million in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company promotes its products through brochures that are either mailed or given to party participants. Some business units tap a campaign merchandising system, whereby the company's independent sales force members sell through brochures generated every two or three weeks. TBC supports its sales through promotions, sales and training aids, and motivational conferences for the sales force. The direct seller also uses catalogs and television and magazine advertising to increase its sales levels with hard-to-reach customers and generate leads for sales and new dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   TBC has been cutting back on advertising in recent years. It spent $13.4 million on advertising in 2015, down from $19.9 million and $25.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   TBC has struggled to grow its sales and profits over the past few years as its Beauty business in North America and its traditional business in Europe have declined 30% to 40% since 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue dove 12% to $2.28 billion during 2015 with unfavorable foreign exchange rates causing sales declines in all segments but the Tupperware North America segment (which enjoyed 1% sales growth). Most of the sales decline came from a 17% decline in European division sales with lower emerging market sales and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Its Beauty North America division's sales fell 17% (or 6% after excluding FX rates) as it again struggled with a smaller sales force in Fuller, Mexico with disappointing sales force and field manager recruitment and retention rates. Asia Pacific sales grew 1% after FX adjustments mostly thanks to higher sales volumes in China and other emerging markets in the region. South America sales fell 20% with poor FX effects, but grew by 25% after excluding FX effects thanks to higher prices, mostly in Argentina and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining revenue in 2015 caused TBC's net income to tumble 13% to $185.8 million, while the company's operating cash levels dropped 21% to $225.7 million as it generated less in cash earnings caused in large part by weaker foreign exchange rates in relation to the US dollar.

  <p>
   TBC in 2016 continued its focus on four key success drivers to grow its business, including: Developing innovative and well-designed products, creating entertaining selling situations, offering its sales force compelling earnings and opportunities for leadership development, and deploying dynamic direct selling fundamentals.
  </p>
  <p>
   With an eye on energizing its sales force and boosting sales, TBC launched its "iROAR" program in 2014 to promote inspirational leaders, which follows a Recruit, Onboard, Activate, and Retain agenda designed "improve messaging, training, and execution through internal management to its sales force leadership. The idea was to "treat each new recruit as if she were its last," dedicating the company's management to her success.
  </p>
  <p>
   While many consider the Tupperware brand to be something of an American institution, more than 90% of the company's sales for the brand are generated outside the US, and a whopping two-thirds of sales are generated in emerging markets rather than established ones, (as of early 2016). TBC has pushed into new and developing markets (such as China, Eastern Europe, India, Japan, and Indonesia), offering region-specific products such as Kimono Keepers. The direct seller often targets areas where jobs are scarce and family ties are strong -- the better for developing its sales network.
  </p>
  <p>
   New product development is a key driver for TBC's success. As part of its strategy, the company continues to focus on market penetration worldwide, leveraging research and development to roll out new products. In recent years, TBC launched the Blossom serving range, Crystalwave Generation II microwave reheatable line, Tupperware MicroCook microwave cooking line, and VentSmart refrigerator storage line. It also developed new skin care and fragrances, such as Bio Joven Ginseng Energizing Anti-Wrinkle Facial Treatment and Armand Dupree Red, among many others.

  <p>
   TBC built its global beauty presence through one strategic acquisition made in 2005. The company doubled its sales force of independent consultants who sell beauty and personal care products in the Asia/Pacific region and Latin America with the acquisition of
   <company id="11323">
    Sara Lee Corporation
   </company>
   's international direct-selling unit. As part of the deal, TBC paid $557 million and acquired the direct-selling unit's staff of 884,000 consultants. Soon after, the company changed its name from Tupperware Corporation to Tupperware Brands Corporation to reflect its growing portfolio of brands.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Earl Tupper was a self-styled inventor with only a high school education when he went to work for DuPont in the 1930s. He left DuPont in 1938 to start his own company, taking with him an unwanted, smelly chunk of polyethylene, a by-product of the oil refining process. Tupper eventually developed his own refining process, and in 1942 he created a clear, lightweight, unbreakable, odorless, nontoxic plastic, which he called Poly-T.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tupper continued to do contract work for DuPont during the war, making parts for gas masks and Navy signal lamps. He continued to work with Poly-T and founded Tupperware in 1946. The next year, inspired by a paint can lid, Tupper developed the Tupperware Seal, which creates an airtight, partial vacuum. The Tupperware food storage container was born and began to move onto retail shelves.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, a secretary in Detroit named Brownie Wise was selling Stanley Home Products' appliances through parties at her home to raise money for her son's medical bills. (The party system was actually developed in the 1920s to introduce communities to aluminum cookware.) Wise added a Tupperware set to her product mix, and sales took off. By the early 1950s Tupperware parties began to spread.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wise, hired as VP and general manager, became Tupperware's inspirational leader. In 1951 all Tupperware products were removed from retail shelves, and subsidiary Tupperware Home Parties was officially founded. By 1954 sales multiplied 25 times and the company had about 9,000 independent sellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1958 Tupperware expanded into Canada. That year Wise left and Tupper sold the company to Rexall Drug. In 1969 Rexall became Dart Industries; by this time Tupperware had entered Western Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia. In 1976 international sales pushed revenue past $500 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1980 Dart merged with Kraft to become Dart and Kraft, Inc. By 1984 sales began to slip due to the number of women entering the workforce. Tupperware introduced a catalog and revised the party plan to include gatherings in the workplace. Dart and Kraft split in 1986, and Dart became Premark International. Tupperware's national ad campaign the next year inadvertently increased the sales of retail competitors such as Rubbermaid. By 1990 sales were slowing across the US, Latin America, and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tupperware restructured in 1992 and former Avon executive Rick Goings became president. Wall Street's belief that Tupperware was languishing as a subsidiary led to its spinoff from Premark as a public company in 1996. Tupperware established operations in China that year and began holding parties in Russia in 1997. The Asian economic crisis and domestic organizational problems led to slumping sales in 1997 and 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company experimented with new sales channels in 1998 and 1999, including infomercials, mall kiosks, a website, and catalogs. Tupperware made the best of Asia's troubled economy in 1998 by recruiting laid-off workers and launching "I Save With Tupperware" campaigns to help consumers stretch food budgets. German direct seller Vorwerk bought an 11% stake in Tupperware in 2000 (and sold it in early 2005). In October 2000 Tupperware purchased cosmetics company BeautiControl.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tupperware's first foray into store retailing was short-lived. The company began selling some products in SuperTarget stores in October 2001, but the negative impact felt by Tupperware's direct sales channel quickly prompted the company to pull the items from Target stores' shelves in June 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2005 the company acquired Sara Lee Corporation's direct selling businesses -- International Beauty -- and at the same time changed its name from Tupperware Corp. to Tupperware Brands Corporation. The acquisition boosted the direct seller's sales force at the time to about 1.9 million independent consultants.
