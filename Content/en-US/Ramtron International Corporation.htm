   Ramtron International provides the F-RAM needed to watch
   <em>
    Tron
   </em>
   in the palm of your hand. Ramtron designs ferroelectric random-access memories (F-RAMs), which it touts as providing better performance than other kinds of memory chips and which are used in products such as power meters, laser printers, and handheld devices. It partners with
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="58590">
    Infineon
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   , among others. The company sells directly and through distributors, including
   <company id="51320">
    Future Electronics
   </company>
   , Mouser (a subsidiary of
   <company id="41641">
    TTI
   </company>
   ), and
   <company id="53860">
    Tokyo Electron Device
   </company>
   . Most of Ramtron's sales come from outside the US. In 2012 the company agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="10428">
    Cypress Semiconductor
   </company>
   in a $3.10 per share deal with a total value of around $110 million.

   Infineon owned about 19% of Ramtron and transferred that equity stake, which included common stock and a warrant, to
   <company id="149240">
    Qimonda
   </company>
   , its memory device spinoff. In late 2006 Qimonda sold the entire stake to institutional investors and other accredited investors in a private transaction.

   Ramtron exited the memory module business in 2005. The company sold its Mushkin subsidiary to the unit's general manager for around $1.8 million. The Mushkin business provides DRAM modules, which are incorporated into switches, servers, and workstations.

   Also in 2005 Ramtron acquired Goal Semiconductor for about $2 million in cash and approximately 1.95 million shares of common stock. Goal Semi was a fabless developer of data acquisition and signal processing semiconductors for the embedded market, with a product line including microcontrollers and high-voltage digital-to-analog converters. Ramtron packages Goal Semi's mixed-signal devices as companion products to its FRAM parts.
