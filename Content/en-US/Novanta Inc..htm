   Novanta's business is laser focused. The company (formerly GSI Group) uses its expertise in laser and motion control technologies to design and manufacture sets of products that are geared at different markets. Sealed CO2 lasers, fiber lasers, and specialty lasers are sold primarily to the industrial and scientific markets. Novanta supplies lasers, optics, encoders, and air bearing spindles to the electronics, medical, and aerospace markets for high-precision cutting, drilling, marking, and measuring. Formerly known as GSI Group since 1999, the company changed its name to Novanta in mid-2016.

  <p>
   Novanta operates from nearly 30 locations in Europe, the Asia/Pacific, and the US. Geographically, the US generates its largest amount of sales (41%), followed by Europe (28%), and China and other countries in the Asia/Pacific region (17%).
  </p>

  <p>
   Novanta conducts business through three primary segments: laser products (45% of net sales), vision technologies (33%), and precision motion (12%).
  </p>

  <p>
   The company sells its products worldwide through a direct sales force and through resellers or distributors who in turn sell to OEMs that integrate Novanta's products into their own systems.
  </p>

  <p>
   Novanta's revenues climbed 2% from $365 million in 2014 to $374 million in 2015. The growth was fueled by increased sales from its vision technologies and precision motion segments, particularly within the US. The spike in laser products revenue for 2015 was fueled by additional demand for its laser beam delivery and CO2 lasers products. Precision motion segment sales were up in 2015 due to higher demand for encoders products, partially offset by a decline in revenue from its air bearing spindles products.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a net loss of $25 million in 2014 (due mainly to a non-cash impairment charge of $41 million and acquisition-related operating expenses), Novanta posted $36 million in positive net income for 2015. This was chiefly due to the absence of that impairment charge in 2015. Novanta's cash flow from operations has also fluctuated over the years; after rising in 2013, it fell by almost $7 million to $43 million in 2014 and fell to $33 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Novanta's general strategy includes focusing on scanning products, fiber lasers, and medical components and building more business in emerging markets through creating more internal sales channels and developing relationships with external channel partners. Also key to that strategy is acquisitions and divesting non-core businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a net loss of $25 million in 2014, Novanta in 2015 implemented a program to eliminate redundant costs (as a result of acquisition and divestiture activities) to better align its operations.

  <p>
   In early 2015, Novanta acquired Applimotion for $14 million in cash in a deal that enhanced its strategic position in precision motion segment control by enabling the company to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novanta in 2014 acquired an assortment of companies (JADAK, JADAK Technologies, and Advance Data Capture Corporation). The businesses collectively acted as a New York-based provider of optical data collection and machine vision technologies to OEM medical device manufacturers. Novanta made the transaction for nearly $94 million in cash.
