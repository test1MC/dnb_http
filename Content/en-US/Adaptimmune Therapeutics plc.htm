   Adaptimmune Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical focusing on cancer-fighting immunotherapy products. Its T-cell receptor (TCR) candidates are unique in that they target intracellular as well as extracellular cancer antigens. The firm is in the early stages of testing its NY-ESO candidate, which it is developing in partnership with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ; its pipeline also includes MAGE A-10, which targets breast or lung cancer. Immunotherapy, in which a patient's immune system is used to attack cancer cells, has gained popularity for fighting certain types of cancer; Adaptimmune believes it has the potential to become the primary treatment for recurring tumors or resistant cancer types. The firm went public in 2015.

  <p>
   Adaptimmune raised $191.3 million in its May 2015 initial public offering (more than the $137.3 million it expected to raise). It plans to use the funds received to advance the development and testing of its MAGE A-10 TCR candidate, as well as other TCR candidates, as well as for general corporate processes.

  <p>
   Adaptimmune has generated losses since its founding in 2008, as it works to bring its TCR candidates to market. In fiscal 2013 and 2014, it lost £5.6 million and £7.5 million, respectively. It expects to continue incurring losses as it focuses on R&amp;D programs and eventually bringing its candidates to market.

  <p>
   The company has laid out several primary strategies as it works to become a global oncology business. Among these strategies is to accelerate the trials of its NY-ESO TCR candidate in the US and Europe, as well as to develop its MAGE A-10 and other candidates. While GSK is funding the development of NY-ESO, the company also has numerous candidates which it is developing on its own. Adaptimmune also intends to expand its portfolio of intellectual property, which includes proprietary methods and knowledge in the field of TCRs.
