   Nanometrics works on a nano scale for electronics manufacturers that need their goods to measure up. The company provides thin-film metrology and inspection systems used by makers of precision electronic gear. These stand-alone, integrated, and tabletop measurement devices gauge the thickness and consistency of film materials used in making semiconductors, LEDs, data storage components, and power management components. Its systems are used throughout the fabrication process, from substrate manufacturing to advanced wafer-scale packaging. Top customers include
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="57841">
    SK Hynix
   </company>
   . Nanometrics generates the majority of its sales in Asia.

  <p>
   Nanometrics gets 65% of its revenue from its automated systems with integrated systems accounting for 9%, and its materials characterization systems, 6%. The remaining 20% of revenue comes from the company's service operations.

  <p>
   The US represents less than a quarter of sales. Most of the company's customers are in Asia, where most of the world's semiconductors and electronics are made. South Korea (home to top customers Samsung and SK Hynix) is its largest market, with about 25% of sales. With a 120% growth rate in 2014, China is a major source of revenue at 17%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nanometrics' metrology and inspection systems are made at a plant in California. The company uses contract manufacturers for subassembly capabilities in China, Israel, Japan, and the UK.

  <p>
   Customers include semiconductor manufacturers and equipment suppliers, producers of HB-LEDs, solar PVs, data storage devices, silicon wafers, and photomasks. Its top 3 customers -- Samsung Electronics, Intel, and Hynix Semiconductor - together account for about two-thirds of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nanometics sells its products through a direct sales force from sales and support offices in China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UK.

  <p>
   Revenue increased 15% in 2014 to reach $166.4 million compared to $144.3 million in 2013 as capital spending in the semiconductor industry rose. More than three-quarters of the revenue increase came from automated systems. The company's net loss in 2014 was $31 million, more than the net loss of $14 million in 2013. Nanometrics took a $2.3 million restructuring charge in 2014 for consolidation of its UK operations. Implementation of an enterprise resource management program increased depreciation.

  <p>
   Nanometrics was incorporated in 1975 and has been publicly traded since 1984. In 2006 the company acquired
   <company id="105803">
    Accent Optical Technologies
   </company>
   , a supplier of semiconductor process control and metrology equipment, for around $81 million in stock and assumed debt. Following the merger, previous Nanometrics shareholders owned approximately 73% of the combined company and Accent Optical shareholders owned about 27%. Also that year the company acquired
   <company id="118821">
    Soluris
   </company>
   , a supplier of overlay and critical-dimension measurement equipment, for $7 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Nanometrics sold two product lines picked up in those two acquisitions. The DiVA instrument line, previously acquired by Accent Optical, was sold to Auriga Measurement Systems of the US. The Yosemite metrology system, previously developed by Soluris, was sold to SNU Precision of South Korea. Nanometrics decided those products were not core to its product strategy, concluding that DiVA was a mature product (posting annual sales of less than $1 million) with no technical synergy with the metrology equipment business, and development of Yosemite had ceased following the acquisition of Soluris, since the product serves a market outside of Nanometrics' product focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its portfolio of metrology products in 2008, the company acquired the assets of Tevet Process Control Technologies, a supplier of integrated metrology systems for manufacturing semiconductors and solar cells, for about $3.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Nanometrics bought Germany-based Nanda Technologies, a maker of fully automated wafer inspection systems, for $23 million in cash. With the acquisition, Nanometrics added a differentiated macro defect inspection technology to its portfolio of metrology products.
