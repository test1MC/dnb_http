   For Federal-Mogul, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. The company makes components used in cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles, as well as in energy, industrial, and other transportation equipment. Its products include pistons, spark plugs, ignition coils, bearings, gaskets, seals, and brake pads sold under brand names such as Champion, Federal-Mogul, Fel-Pro, Glyco, and Moog. Federal-Mogul has manufacturing and distribution facilities in 25 countries worldwide; customers include global automakers

   , and

   . Federal-Mogul also distributes its own and other company's auto parts to aftermarket customers. More than 60% of sales come from outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Federal-Mogul operates almost 225 worldwide manufacturing facilities, technical and distribution centers, as well as sales and administration offices in 25 countries. The US represents its largest market, generating 38% of its total revenue; Germany is next in line, representing 24% of sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   Federal-Mogul has divided its operations into two segments to focus on two distinct customer sets. Its powertrain segment (58% of net sales) makes and sells original equipment products for automotive, heavy duty, and industrial applications. The motor parts segment (42%) distributes products in the global vehicle aftermarket and also serves original equipment (OE/OES) manufacturers with vehicle products like brakes, chassis, wipers, and other vehicle components.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has achieved unprecedented revenue growth over the years, while posting net losses. Revenues peaked at $7.42 billion in 2015, a company milestone. Its net loss shrank from $168 million in 2014 to $110 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was attributed to a 2% spike in motorparts sales and surges in sales from Mexico (10%) and India (2%). Its overall growth over the years was attributed to additional revenue from previous acquisitions.

  <p>
   Federal-Mogul is taking steps to maintain its flexibility and reduce its dependence on cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles by applying its core products in other areas. For example, it has expanded into the aerospace (brake products for airplanes), railroad (piston rings for locomotives), and off-shore and marine markets (large bore rings and seals). Its push into power generation (large bearings for windmills) has included acquisitions of piston ring suppliers, which has expanded Federal-Mogul's presence in commercial engines and wind energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Federal-Mogul has a number of joint ventures and alliances, allowing it to expand its geographic reach into emerging markets, including the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries, as well as South Korea and Turkey. Federal-Mogul maintains a controlling interest in just over half of its almost 30 joint ventures in 13 countries. These partnerships also allow the company to lower manufacturing costs, broaden its customer base, and develop and extend its product lines. Federal-Mogul works closely with customers to develop products specific to their needs, utilizing its research and development centers in major global auto manufacturing locations including the US, Germany, UK, France, China, and Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its business in China, the company's powertrain unit opened a new systems protection manufacturing facility in Changshu, China -- measuring some 7,000-sq.-meters -- to support domestic customers in the automotive, high-speed rail, and aviation sectors.

   The company has recently achieved historic revenue growth, in part, through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired

  <p>
   In 1899 J. Howard Muzzy and Edward Lyon formed the Muzzy-Lyon Company, and later, subsidiary Mogul Metal Company. The two modified a printer's typecasting machine and developed a process for making die-cast engine bearings. Their first big order came in 1910, when Buick ordered 10,000 connecting rod bearings for the Buick 10. In 1924 Mogul Metal merged with Federal Bearing and Bushing to become Federal-Mogul Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1941 Federal-Mogul had about 50 factories dedicated to the war effort, and by 1945 sales had doubled from prewar levels. In 1955 the company acquired Bower Roller Bearing Company and changed its name to Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, Inc. By the late 1950s it had nearly 100 distribution centers and sales had quadrupled in 10 years.
