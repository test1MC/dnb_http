   Vaxon Biotech is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of  cancers and related malignancies. Disease targets include breast, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The company's claim to fame is its development of optimized cryptic peptide antigens (substances that trigger protein responses in the immune system), which have shown early progress in the immune response against these cancers. The company's development products are classified as therapeutic vaccines and are developed to trigger the immune system to attack malignant cells in solid tumors while steering clear from normal cells. The Paris-based, private company was founded in 2004.

  <p>
   Vaxon Biotech specializes in anti-tumor immunotherapy, which uses a unique, therapeutic approach designed to stimulate the immune system and get it to target and destroy tumors, or at least halt their development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm has four products under development, including two in clinical development and two with pre-clinical status. The most advanced product in its portfolio, Vx- 001, is a peptide based vaccine for HLA-A2-positive patients with TERT-expressing tumors. Since 2012 it has been in phase IIB trials -- which are being conducted in eight European countries -- for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Vaxon's Vx-006 product is a polypeptide designed to treat solid tumors. Vx-006 is in a phase I clinical study designed to examine toxicity and measure the immune response induced by the product, with results expected some time in early 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been granted exclusive worldwide license for three patents since 2004, and has filed for seven more patents in its own name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vaxon Biotech's investors include private equity firm XLife; Gij Ile-de-France, an early-stage funding provider for biotech companies; and seed-capital company Inserm Transfert Initiative.
