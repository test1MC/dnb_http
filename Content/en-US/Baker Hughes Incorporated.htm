   Looking to see a rebound from the major slump in crude prices, in 2016
   <company id="10634">
    GE

   made a move to create a $32 billion oil business by combining its petroleum-related operations (
   <company id="139604">

  <p>
   In 2015 Baker Hughes' net revenues was $15.74 billion, a decrease of 36% compared to 2014 due to a drop in revenues from all of the company's reportable segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from North America decreased by 50% ($6.07 billion) due to sharp reduction in commodity prices which severely impacted onshore North America exploration and production companies as a result of the higher lifting cost per barrel of many of these producers. The lower activity levels and deteriorating pricing conditions were the main drivers for the revenue decline in this segment. All product lines have been unfavorably impacted by the drop in activity, with production chemicals, deepwater operations and artificial lift showing the most resilience.
  </p>
  <p>
   EARC revenues dropped 26% ($1.14 billion), driven mainly by activity declines and unfavorable pricing. Revenue was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates. The deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa in 2014 also contributed to the decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   MEAP revenues decreased by $1.02 billion (23% down on 2014) due to lower activity across most of Asia (in particular China, Australia and Vietnam) and reduced revenue in Iraq. The revenue decline in Iraq is attributed to reduced activity (a 34% decline in rig count). Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable pricing across the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin America revenues decreased by $437 million (20%) due to activity declines across the region as a result of customer budgetary constraints (mainly in the Andean area where the rig count declined by 46%). This reduction was partially offset by revenue growth in Brazil from share gains in the drilling services product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Services revenues decrease by $149 million (11%), driven primarily by reduced activity and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Baker Hughes' net loss was $1.97 billion, down $3.68 billion compared to 2014. This huge loss was mainly due to decrease in net sales and impairment and restructuring charges associated with asset impairments, workforce reductions, facility closures, and contract terminations.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year cash from operating activities was $1.79 billion, a decrease of 1.15 billion compared to 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company has grown through product innovation (it developed the first oil well drill bit for rock in 1909), strategic alliances, and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, faced by slumping oil prices that were dragging down demand for its services, in 2015 the company, to adapt to changing market conditions and align its cost structure with near-term activity levels, recorded charges totaling $830 million towards cost structure. This included closing several facilities across the world and cutting the global workforce by 7,000, as well as the write-down of excess machinery and equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company routinely evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses that enhance its current operations or expand its operations into new markets or product lines. It also sells business operations that are not considered part of its core business. In 2014, it paid $314 million for acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major industry consolidation move, in 2014 the company agreed to be acquired by rival oil service giant
   <company id="10697">
    Halliburton
   </company>
   for about $35 billion, but the parties terminated the merger deal after opposition from US and European antitrust regulators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Baker Hughes increased its R&amp;D spend to $483 million (from $631 million and $497 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively) and introduced more than 200 products or product enhancements, including the SureTrak steerable drilling liner service and the SHADOW series of frac plugs with disintegrating frac balls. The company installed its LEAP adaptive production system in 2015. It delivered 300% greater oil production and 200% greater natural gas production at the first field trial compared to the previous artificial lift product.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014 it opened the $60 million Artificial Lift Research and Technology Center in Claremore, Oklahoma.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its portfolio, in 2014 Baker Hughes signed an agreement with
   <company id="90747">
    CGG
   </company>
   for RoqSCAN technology offered by CGG. RoqSCAN is a real-time, fully portable, quantitative and automated rock properties and mineralogical analyzer.

   In 2014 Baker Hughes purchased (for about $250 million) the pipeline and specialty services business of
   <company id="14286">
    Weatherford
   </company>
   , which added subsea pipeline commissioning services and ultrasonic in-line inspection technologies to Baker's portfolio. Earlier that year it acquired Texas-based oilfield software company Perfomix.

  <p>
   Howard Hughes Sr. and partner Walter Sharp opened a plant in Houston, and their company, Sharp &amp; Hughes, soon had a near monopoly on rock bits. When Sharp died in 1912, Hughes bought his partner's half of the company, incorporating as Hughes Tool. Hughes held 73 patents when he died in 1924; the company passed to Howard Hughes Jr.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is estimated that between 1924 and 1972 Hughes Tool provided Hughes Jr. with $745 million in pretax profits, which he used to diversify into movies (RKO), airlines (TWA), and Las Vegas casinos. In 1972 he sold the company to the public for $150 million. After 1972 the company expanded into tools for aboveground oil production. In 1974, under the new leadership of chairman James Leach, Hughes bought the oil field equipment business of Borg-Warner.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1913 drilling contractor Carl Baker organized the Baker Casing Shoe Company in California to collect royalties on his three oil tool inventions. The firm began to make its own products in 1918, and during the 1920s it expanded nationally, opened global trade, and formed Baker Oil Tools (1928). The company grew in the late 1940s and the 1950s as oil drilling boomed.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of Baker Hughes' major acquisitions came in 2010 when, in a major industry consolidation, it acquired oil field services titan
   <company id="12054">
    BJ Services
   </company>
   for $6.9 billion. The acquisition expanded Baker Hughes' portfolio, adding pressure pumping to its product offering, giving it a stronger platform for international growth, and the ability to better compete for large integrated project contracts in the unconventional gas and deepwater markets. In particular, the purchase strengthened the company's integrated services and expanded its reservoir capabilities.
