   Cutera has a handle on hairy situations and a firm plan for flabby faces. The company makes lasers for medical and aesthetic use in doctors' offices and spas. Cutera markets its

    FDA

   -approved devices for hair removal and treatments to reduce pigmented lesions (age and sun spots), wrinkles, and veins. Products are sold under the names CoolGlide, Solera, and Xeo. Its Titan line of products use deep tissue heating to firm up saggy skin. Other products provide body contouring for fat reduction and tattoo removal. In the US, the company markets its products through a direct sales force and through distributors; in more than 40 other countries it relies on a small sales group and distributors. Cutera also sells a limited number of products online.

  <p>
   Cutera boasts more than 30 issued US patents and a handful of pending US patent applications. Beyond dermatologists and plastic surgeons, Cutera sells its products to gynecologists, primary care physicians, and medically supervised spas. Its products portfolio has grown by its adding upgrade options and expanding its international reach. To support equipment sales, the company offers upgrade, hand-piece refill, dermal filler, and cosmetic pharmaceutical products, as well as equipment support services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its CoolGlide, Solera, Xeo, and Titan lines, the company sells products under the brand names Cutera, Enlighten, Excel, GenesisPlus, and TruSculpt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product sales account for some three-fourths of Cutera's total revenues.

  <p>
   The US is Cutera's largest market, accounting for more than half of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has service support offices in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland. In 40-plus other countries, it works with a network of distributors and third-party service providers.

   Cutera markets and sells its products in the US through its own sales organization of about 35 representatives; abroad, it also has a direct sales force, with some 30 representatives, as well as a network of distributors. The company sells a limited number of its products, such as its Titan hand piece refills, online.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm markets its products by making office visits, attending trade shows, presenting workshops and webinars, and by publishing in trade journals.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Cutera's revenue rose 21% to $94.8 million. That gain was due to higher product sales, which rose 34% (largely due to the launches of new products under the Enlighten and Excel HR brands, but partially offset by declining sales of legacy products); service revenue remained relatively flat that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company has been operating at a loss for the past few years. Net loss, which had fallen to $10.6 million in 2014 due to a one-time impairment charge related to an acquisition, recovered somewhat to $4.4 million in 2015.

  <p>
   The multi-billion dollar aesthetic market is expected to grow at some $2 billion annually, with tattoo removal, hair removal, and skin rejuvenation as some of the leading drivers of that growth. Cutera is positioned to take advantage of this market growth; it aims to boost its product sales through the introduction of new technologies and by gaining approvals for additional uses for its existing best-sellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   By obtaining more approvals for additional treatments from the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   , Cutera continues to make money on an existing device without having to start the R&amp;D process from scratch. Some of Cutera's more recent product introductions include the GenesisPlus, which builds on the company's existing Genesis platform to treat toenail fungus and to provide skin rejuvenation, as well as the Excel V, a vascular device to treat a wide variety of cosmetic vascular conditions (such as visible blood vessels). The Excel V complements the company's previous Excel Laser treatment, which is also used to treat vascular conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Cutera launched PICO Genesis, a non-thermal procedure to treat pigmentary skin conditions.
