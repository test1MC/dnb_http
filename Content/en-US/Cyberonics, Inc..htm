   It may sound futuristic, but Cyberonics is all about treating an age-old neurological disorder. The firm is the maker of the first medical device to gain clearance by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   for treating epilepsy. Its Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy system (VNS Therapy) is a pacemaker-like device that connects to the vagus nerve in the neck and delivers intermittent signals to the brain to control epileptic seizures. Physicians can program the signals by computer, and patients can start or stop signals with hand-held magnets. The firm also has CE marking for its VITARIA System for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Cyberonics merged with Italian medical device firm
   <company id="135958">
    Sorin
   </company>
   to create
   <company id="163422">
    LivaNova
   </company>
   in 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The merger with Sorin, an Italian firm that specializes in pacemakers and heart valves, was one of Cyberonics' most significant moves to expand. The combined firm, LivaNova, has global reach and expertise in neuromodulation and the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Cyberonics survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of LivaNova.

  <p>
   Cyberonics' VNS Therapy is also used for treating depression that has been treatment-resistant. Additionally, the firm sells the AspireSR generator, a technology used with the VNS Therapy system.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's dependence on insurance reimbursement means that shifts in standard rates paid by the
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services
   </company>
   (CMS), which many other insurers follow, have the potential to impact revenues in a positive or negative manner. At least that applies to the VNS Therapy system when it is used for treating epilepsy. Medicare has denied coverage for those seeking VNS Therapy for depression, although some state Medicaid agencies cover it for depression, as do a few private payers. Cyberonics has not given up obtaining more federal and private insurance coverage for VNS Therapy for depression and is engaged in further studies it hopes will convince Medicare and other third-party payers of its efficacy as a therapy for depression that is resistant to medication and other treatment efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's newest product is like VNS Therapy for the heart. The programmable VITARIA System delivers autonomic regulation therapy to improve the heart's function, reducing risk among patients with chronic heart failure.

  <p>
   Cyberonics has facilities in Houston (manufacturing and corporate); Austin, Texas (warehousing and distribution); and Costa Rica (manufacturing); it also has administrative and sales offices in Europe, China, and Hong Kong.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has distribution agreements with distributors covering other parts of North and South America, Asia, and the Middle East. It market its products in more than 70 countries but the US accounts for some 80% of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cyberonics employs a direct sales force in the US and in some European countries, and it utilizes distributors elsewhere. Its marketing efforts target neurologists, surgeons, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients. The VNS Therapy system has been implanted in some 96,000 patients globally. The company relies on reimbursement from private and government insurance entities for more than three-fourths of its device sales; the
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare
   </company>
   (CMS) alone account for 25% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cyberonics has enjoyed increasing revenue for the past several years. In fiscal 2015 (ended April), net revenue increased 3% to $291.6 million, due to higher unit sales and higher prices per unit; sales were up in the US and internationally. The higher-priced AspireSR generator also saw a rise in sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue increases have driven up net income; in 2015 Cyberonics' revenue bump helped move net income up 3% to $57.9 million, with an assist from foreign currency exchange rates. Cash flow from operations grew 47% to $79.7 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a result of its dependence on reimbursement for its financial health, Cyberonics' strategic focus is on widening the use of its products through marketing, research, and technology enhancement efforts. The company also introduces next-generation versions of its VNS Therapy system to incorporate greater functionality and ease of use. Improvements have included longer battery life, improved electronics, and simplified programming features.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other products the company is focused on are its VITARIA System for the treatment of heart failure symptoms (approved in the European Economic Area) and the ProGuardian System, an in-home epilepsy monitoring system to alert patients or caregivers of oncoming epileptic seizures (under development).
  </p>
  <p>
   Further strategic initiatives for Cyberonics are increasing market penetration in the US and increasing international sales; sales outside the US total around 20% of total product sales, with the largest markets being the UK, France, and Germany. The company also seeks opportunities for licensing its technology to third parties as an additional source of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cyberonics also takes opportunities to invest in promising medical start-ups. It holds stakes in development-stage companies cerbomed, which is developing a non-invasive treatment for epilepsy; and ImThera, which is working on a treatment for sleep apnea.
