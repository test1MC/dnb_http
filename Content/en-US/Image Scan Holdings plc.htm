   Image Scan Holdings offers a lot more than a blanket for security -- the company develops and makes Security and Industrial X-ray equipment that is stationary or portable (for rapid deployment) and captures 2D or 3D images. Through operating subsidiary 3DX-Ray Limited, the company offers its 2D &amp; 3D FlatScan high resolution X-ray system, as well as its AXIS baggage scanners, and its MailScan for mail and parcels. Its Industrial scanners are used for production lines or laboratory applications. Its SVXi scans large items, including nuclear equipment and waste.

  <p>
   The company has a presence in the UK, the US, South Africa, Japan, and Taiwan. The UK contributed 21% of net sales; other major markets include EMEA (42%), Asia (32%), and the Americas (5%).

  <p>
   Image Scan's revenues decreased by 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was due to reduced security and industrial sales. Revenue from security decreased due to the delayed availability of new portable x-ray systems. In addition, the company's profits fell from 2014 to 2015 due to the decrease in revenues coupled with a spike in research and development expenses.

  <p>
   For future strategy, the company will focus on emerging markets and niche applications. Rather than going head-to-head with industry leaders in established markets, Image Scan is making its move into the nuclear sector and other niche markets; it will tackle emerging geographic markets such as China, and countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
