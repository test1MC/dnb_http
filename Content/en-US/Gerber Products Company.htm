The company, which had its beginnings in 1927 in Dorothy Gerber's kitchen, also makes baby formula, cereal, juices, and Gerber Graduates toddler food, along with baby bath and skin care products, bottles, teethers, pacifiers, breastfeeding accessories, spill-proof cups, and infant toys.

   Gerber is part of the Nestle Nutrition segment, which contributed 11% of fiscal year 2013 net revenue, has seen both organic and internal growth. The segment's infant nutrition business -- via its Wyeth Nutrition acquisition -- drove sales, particularly in infant formula and infant cereals.

   Focused on early childhood nutrition, Gerber sells the Good Start brand of infant formula. The first of its kind, the line is a partially hydrolyzed 100% whey protein routine formula for infants.

   Gerber is known for its glass baby-food jars, which have become part of American life. But while the food maker wants to hold onto its heritage, it opted to transition many of its products to plastic containers, citing cost savings. Indeed, the company provides its baby food varieties in plastic containers and is the only major baby-food company to do so. In response, consumers have been largely positive.

  <p>
   To cater to those who want to make their own baby foods, Gerber sells organic baby food under brand names Organic 1st Foods and Tender Harvest.
