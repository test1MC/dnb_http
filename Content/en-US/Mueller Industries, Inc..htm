   Only top brass make it at Mueller Industries -- that, and copper and aluminum. The company makes materials used to make Mueller tubes and fittings, bars and rods, forgings, extrusions, pipes, and valves. Mueller also resells a myriad of products, from brass and plastic plumbing valves to faucets and malleable iron fittings. Its work is divided between two segments: Plumbing and Refrigeration (a Standard Products Division, and European and Mexican Operations) and OEM (Industrial and Engineered Products Divisions, and Chinese joint venture Mueller-Xingrong).

  <p>
   Sales, largely in the US, are supported by manufacturing operations in the US, as well as in Canada, China, Mexico, and the UK. The plants make products for the housing starts, commercial construction, and repair and remodeling markets. In 2015 the US accounted for 72% of total sales; the UK, its second-largest market, generated 11%.

   Mueller sells to HVAC, plumbing, and refrigeration wholesalers and OEMs, housing construction and RV distributors, and building material retailers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells and markets its plumbing and refrigeration products through sales offices and distribution centers, and through sales agents. Its brass rod, nonferrous forgings, and impact extrusions products are sold directly to its OEM customers.

  <p>
   Mueller's revenues have fluctuated the last few years; after rising by 10% in 2014, its revenues declined by 11% in 2015. This was fueled by lower net selling prices of $222 million from its core copper tube and brass rod product lines in addition to lower unit sales from its core products within its OEM segment. Mueller's revenue stream for 2015 was also affected by the absence of $58 million in sales recorded by Primaflow, a business it sold during November 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits fell 13% from 2014 to 2015. This was fueled by additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of $7 million associated with businesses acquired in 2015 in addition to higher net periodic pension costs of $5 million and increased professional fees of $2 million related to the upgrade of an ERP system.

  <p>
   Mueller makes acquisitions to fortify its product portfolio and solidify its position within the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) market. In 2016, it agreed to purchase a 60% equity interest in Jungwoo Metal Ind. Co., LTD for approximately $21 million. Jungwoo is a manufacturer of copper-based pipe joining products headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, and serves markets worldwide.

   In 2015 the company obtained Turbotec Products, a maker of coaxial heat exchangers and twisted tubes for the HVAC, geothermal, refrigeration, swimming pool heat pump, marine, ice machine, commercial boiler, and heat reclamation markets. Also in 2015, Mueller picked up Sherwood Valve Products, a maker of valves and fluid control products for the HVAC, refrigeration, and compressed gas markets.
