   Sizmek lets advertisers truly size up the impact of their messages. The company's multiscreen services offer agencies and advertisers a variety of solutions to navigate the complexities of cross-platform advertising. Sizmek provides advertisers with start-to-finish creative services, ad delivery, marketing campaign management, and accurate analytics across various channels such as mobile, rich media, video, social, and search. It works to optimize an ad in the first place, optimize the context in which an ad appears, and build out an effective creative message.
