   Bringing class to glass, Viracon, a subsidiary of
   <company id="12643">
    Apogee Enterprises
   </company>

The company buys bulk, flat glass which then can be insulated, laminated, silk-screened, coated, or tempered for customers in the commercial and institutional glass market. Other end products include acoustical, blast-mitigating, heat-strengthened, spandrel, hurricane-resistant, and high-performance coated glass. Viracon has manufacturing facilities in Minnesota and Georgia. An international location resides in Brazil.

   Seven of the 10 largest buildings in the world have Viracon energy-efficient glass installed in them. Over the past 30-plus years, Viracon has installed some 500 million sq. ft. of glazing in 100,000 buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been building, buying, and expanding its facilities every few years since its first plant in Minnesota was completed in 1970. That location has grown from the one plant into a massive industrial complex. Viracon also has a 300,000-sq.-ft. silk-screen plant in Georgia. In early 2013 it closed its 210,000-sq.-ft. plant in Utah in order to streamline its operations and better align product demand with capacity. (It plans to reopen this facility in two years.)

   Viracon's parent stated that its Architectural Glass segment's 2014 net sales increased by 10% over 2013. This uptick was driven by improved mix and pricing and growth in its US and Brazilian businesses.
