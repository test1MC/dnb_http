  <p>
   API became a privately held company with the acquisition. As part of Lehman, it will have the liquidity and capital structure to put its growth plans into practice.

  </p>
  <p>
   EMS (18% of revenue) includes the products of its operating subsidiaries API Defense Inc., API Systems Inc., and SenDEC.

   In 2015 (ended November) sales at API inched up 2% to $232 million from about $227 million in 2014. SSM's revenue rose from the acquisition of Inmet and Weinschel.
  </p>
  <p>
   API lost about $22 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $19 million in 2014. The acquisition led to an increase in expenses. The company has posted losses in nine of the past 10 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses led to $12 million in cash flow from operations in 2015, up from $5.3 million in 2014.
