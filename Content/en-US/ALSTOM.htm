   Alstom is a French rail transport company renowned for its continent-shrinking high-speed trains, such as the TGV, AGV, Pendolino, and the English Channel-crossing Eurostar. Alstom's train operations are divided in two: mainline, comprising high-speed inter-city lines; and urban, comprising metros and trams. Both operations also provide everything a train needs to run, including rails, infrastructure, signaling, electrification, and services including parts and repairs, maintenance, and modernization. The TGV was the world's fastest passenger train from its launch in 1981 until 2013.
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   bought Alstom's Power segment for a total value of $10 billion.

        <p>
   Alstom makes around 45% of its revenue from sales of its trains. Its Services operation brings in over 20% of sales, while Signalling accounts for 17% and Systems 15%.
  </p>
        <p>
   It makes trains in a number of categories: tram, metro, suburban/regional, high speed, very high speed, and locomotive. Components include traction, bogie, and motor.
  </p>
        <p>
   Services carries out maintenance, modernization, and support services, and offers spare parts, repairs, and overhaul. Alstom's Signalling products are sold either as products or as solutions, and including signals for main lines, urban lines, and control and security options. Systems offers integrated solutions and infrastructure, such as electrification, electromechanical systems (gates for stations and platforms), and tracks.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Alstom's strength is in Europe, where it makes 46% of sales, but its international presence is growing: the Middle East &amp; Africa region provides 25% of sales, the Asia/Pacific region 17%, and the Americas 12%.

        </p>
        <p>
   The sell-off of its Power segment to General Electric in fiscal 2015 also meant Alstom saw the majority of its revenue disappear across the Atlantic. Revenue fell by 69% to €6.2 billion as a result.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended March), the remaining Transport segment (consisting of Trains, Services, Systems, and Signalling), saw sales climb 12% to €6.9 billion. Sales of trains slipped 5% to €3.1 billion, but growth in Services (23%, €1.5 billion in sales), Systems (49%, €1.0 billion), and Signalling (30%, €1.2 billion) more than compensated for the Trains deficit. The company's order intake increased 7% to €10.6 billion on the back of a major supply and maintenance contract signed in India, and several large intercity train orders in France and Belgium.
  </p>
        <p>
   By geography, Europe excluding France fell, but all other regions grew. The Americas and Middle East &amp; Africa regions brought in the exact same revenue in the financial period, at €1.055 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   The sale of the Power segment added €4 billion to the bottom line, helping Alstom to a net income of €3.0 billion for fiscal 2016. Without the disposal, Alstom would have recorded a net loss of €1.1 billion, an increase from a net loss of €814 million the previous year. This was partly due to a one-off €398 million impairment loss on assets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash from operations came in at an outflow of €2.2 billion in fiscal 2015 due to net changes in working capital

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Alstom is looking to increase revenue from its Services, Signalling, and Systems segments as a proportion to 60% of total sales by 2020.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company signed a $2 billion deal with
   <company id="40333">
    Amtrak
   </company>
   to design and build 28 new high-speed trains to run the Northeast Corridor between Washington DC and Boston. The trains will have a 186mph max speed (capped at 160mph due to track restrictions), and will be fitted with Alstom's Crash Energy Management system and an anticipative tilting system.
  </p>
        <p>
   Alstom sold off its Power segment to GE in 2015 for $10 billion, in a deal that saw the creation of three alliances with GE and the acquisition by Alstom of most of GE's Signalling business. The three alliances are: a Grid alliance between Alstom Grid and General Electric Digital Energy; a Renewables alliance, consisting of Alstom's hydro, offshore wind, and tidal businesses; and a Global Nuclear and French Steam alliance, that includes the production and services of the Arabelle steam turbine equipment for nuclear power plants worldwide. The acquired General Electric Signalling business strengthens Alstom's presence in North America and the global freight market.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company made moves to close its locomotive manufacturing site in France due to lower orders, but a timely €650 million order from the French government for 15 TGV Euroduplex trains and 20 locomotives will keep the plant open for a few more years at least.

   As part of the $10 billion sale of the Power segment to General Electric, Alstom acquired most of GE's Signalling business.
