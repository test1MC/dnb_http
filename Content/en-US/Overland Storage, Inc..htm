   Overland Storage has your backup. The company sells data storage systems, software, and related media to businesses of all sizes. Its most popular line, the tape-based NEO Series of products, protects data with nonstop operation, remote library management, and other features. SnapServer provides network-attached storage (NAS) and storage-area network (SAN) data management for remote offices and distributed enterprises, while the REO family of products offers backup and recovery. With more than 450,000 installations, the company sells to distributors, resellers, retailers, and manufacturers worldwide. Its distribution partners include

   and
   <company id="101209">
    SYNNEX
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   The US is its largest market, accounting for almost half of sales. The second-largest market for Overland Storage is Europe, which accounts for about 40% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company assembles its products at its plant in San Diego using parts (servers, tape drives, chassis, printed circuit boards, and integrated circuits) bought from third-party manufacturers. It also maintains sales offices in France, Germany, Singapore, and the UK.

  <p>
   Overland Storage sells its products through a worldwide distributor and reseller network. In the US, Ingram Micro, its subsidiary Promark Technology, and SYNNEX are its sole distributors, and it relies on 35 other distribution partners throughout Europe and Asia. For the resale market, its products are frequently packaged with other data processing systems or with other storage devices for a complete storage subsystem.

  <p>
   Unprofitable since fiscal 2005, Overland Storage lost more than $19 million in fiscal 2013 (year-end June) and expects more losses as it works to create a new business model. Revenues for the year were down almost 20% to $48 million. The company makes 60% of sales from products and 40% of sales from service, and both demand for products and services were down for the year.

  <p>
   A number of factors have contributed to a decline in Overland's revenues over time, none more significant than the loss of HP as its top customer. At one time Hewlett-Packard accounted for nearly 30% of revenues; HP no longer relies on Overland for the supply of tape libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Noting forecasts that the market for NAS products will grow by double-digit percentages through 2014, the company is tightening its focus on SnapServer. Noteworthy product releases in 2013 included the SnapSAN S3000, SnapSAN S5000, and SnapScale X2. In 2014 the company plans to launch product enhancements to all of its lines by introducing next-generation scale-out NAS products, cloud capabilities, and enterprise storage software.

  <p>
   Another way Overland Storage hopes to return to growth is through an acquisition. In 2014 it bought Germany-based Tandberg Data for an undisclosed amount. Tandberg Data supplies data storage and data protection products for small- and mid-sized businesses, and combining the two companies will expand its product offerings and global reach. Tandberg Data has a manufacturing plant in China and sales offices in China, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Singapore, the UAE, the UK, and the US (in Colorado.)
