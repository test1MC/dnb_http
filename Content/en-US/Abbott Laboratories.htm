   With activities ranging from filling baby bottles to making generic medications, Abbott Laboratories is a top health care products manufacturer. Its nutritional products division makes such well-known brands as Similac infant formula and the Ensure line of nutrition supplements, while its drug division sells branded generic medicines (such as antibiotics and gastroenterology medicines) in international markets. The company also makes diagnostic instruments (including tests and assays), vascular medical devices such as its Xience drug-eluting stents, and the FreeStyle diabetes care line, as well as eye care products. The company acquired medical device maker
   <company id="14778">

   </company>
   for $25 billion in early 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
   Abbott operates in five segments: Nutritional Products (the largest, accounting for some 35% of sales); Diagnostic (23% of sales), which makes tests, diagnostic products, and data management systems for labs; Established Pharmaceutical Products (18%), the branded generic arm; Vascular (14%), which makes devices for coronary, endovascular, and structural heart procedures; and Other (11%), which includes Abbott's

   and
   <company id="106133">
    Medical Optics

   operations.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Abbott's products are sold in more than 150 countries. The company earns about 30% of revenues in the domestic market, some 50% in emerging markets (especially Brazil, China, India, and Russia), and around 20% in non-US developed markets (including Canada, Western Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia).

  <p>
   Abbott conducts distribution operations both from its own distribution centers and from third-party distribution partners. Established pharmaceutical and nutritional customers include health care organizations, wholesalers, pharmacies, retailers, government agencies, and third-party distribution entities. Diagnostic and vascular products are sold to blood banks, hospitals, physicians, plasma protein therapeutic companies, government agencies, alternative testing sites, and commercial laboratories.

  <p>
   In the face of multiple challenges, Abbott has been standing strong in the global business market in recent years. However, in 2013 revenue decreased by 45%, from $39 billion to $21.8 billion, and decreased another 7% in 2014 to $20 billion; both years' declines were largely due to the spinoff of
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   and the loss of that unit's income from the books. Revenue recovered a modest 1% to $20.4 billion in 2015, thanks largely to increased sales of established pharmaceuticals (which were boosted by the 2014 acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm) and higher emerging markets sales. This growth was partially offset by declines in the Vascular, Diagnostics, and Other segments (which were negatively impacted by currency rates).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed revenue's lead over the past five years. In fiscal 2015, it nearly doubled, rising 94% to $4.4 billion due to the sales of its non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics pharmaceuticals business and its animal health business.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, cash flow from operations fell 19% to $3 billion; this drop was driven by asset sales and an increase in cash used in trade accounts payable and other liabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   Across the years, Abbott has made acquisitions and strategic alliances (in fields including research and marketing) to bolster its offerings and its geographic presence. It focuses on building country-specific portfolios to best meet the needs of each nation. For example, the company has more than 300 active branded generic development projects for emerging markets. In 2015 Abbott spent some $1.4 billion on research to discover and develop new products and processes or improve on existing products and processes. (That figure was up from the $1.3 billion in 2014.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the R&amp;D realm, Abbott is hard at work on developing next-generation Xience products that include Xience nano, a version of the product for use in small vessels, and Xience PRIME, a next-generation version Xience being tested in a range of sizes including small vessel and long lengths. In addition, Abbott has steadily grown its medical device offerings for other therapeutic applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other Vascular pipeline products include Absorb, the first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold device for the treatment of coronary artery disease; and MitraClip, a device designed to treat mitral regurgitation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Abbott is also widening its offering of clinical diagnostics tools, including the introduction of laboratory software to boost diagnostic data management capabilities. To boost its point-of-care diagnostics offerings, Abbott announced plans to buy
   <company id="104552">
    Alere
   </company>
   for $5.8 billion in early 2016. Alere makes tests for cancers, cardiovascular disease, and infections such as HIV and malaria, among others. After the acquisition deal was announced, Abbott had concerns about Alere, including its twice-delayed earnings report. It attempted to terminate the merger, but Alere rejected that request; Abbott remains committed to fulfilling its obligations in the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product development has also led to new nutritional product launches, such as new Ensure Complete shakes and Perfectly Simple (gluten and preservative-free) ZonePerfect protein bars. To further bolster the nutritional business, Abbott built a new manufacturing plant in Ohio, and opened its first nutritional R&amp;D center in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other products that have recently launched or are in development include cataract removal systems TECNIS and WHITESTAR Signature Pro, as well as the personalized LASIK treatment plan eye scanner iDESIGN Advanced WaveScan Studio System.

  <p>
   In 2015 Abbott sold its non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics operations to
   <company id="11030">
    Mylan
   </company>
   . The sale included a portfolio of more than 100 pharmaceutical products in markets including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; upon closing of the deal, Abbott received a 21% stake in the combined company. The company also sold its animal health business to
   <company id="162866">
    Zoetis
   </company>
   in early 2015. Furthering its focus on cardiovascular and diagnostic operations, Abbott is now selling its Abbott Medical Optics subsidiary to
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   for $4.3 billion.

  <p>
   The company doubled its operations in 2014 in Latin America and upped its commitment to fast-growing markets by paying around $3 billion, including debt, for CFR Pharmaceuticals. The Chile-based branded-pharmaceutical maker has manufacturing facilities in Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina. Later that year Abbott acquired a controlling stake of Russian pharmaceutical maker Veropharm. The $315 million deal added manufacturing capabilities in Russia and broadened Abbott's presence in that country. At year-end, Abbott bought private medical device company Topera ($250 million), a developer of electrophysiology technologies to detect and treat atrial fibrillation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Abbott bought the rest of Tendyne Holdings that it didn't already own for $225 million; it also agreed to buy Cephea Valve Technologies. Both of those medical device firm acquisitions will boost Abbott's portfolio of mitral valve replacement therapies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, Abbott announced a major deal to further grow its line of heart-related devices. It agreed to buy
   <company id="14778">
    St. Jude Medical
   </company>
   , which makes such products as heart catheters and defibrillators, in a deal valued at $25 billion. The combination of the two firms, which closed in early 2017, created one of the world's largest makers of cardiovascular devices.

   Dr. Wallace Abbott started making his dosimetric granule (a pill that supplied uniform quantities of drugs) at his home outside Chicago in 1888. Aggressive marketing earned Abbott the American Medical Association's criticism, though much of the medical profession supported him.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI, Abbott scientists synthesized anesthetics previously available only from Germany. Abbott improved its research capacity in 1922 by buying Dermatological Research Laboratories; in 1928 it bought John T. Milliken and its well-trained sales force. Abbott went public in 1929.

   Salesman DeWitt Clough became president in 1933. International operations began in the mid-1930s with branches in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and the UK.

   Abbott was integral to the WWII effort; the US made only 28 pounds of penicillin in 1943 before the company began to ratchet up production. Consumer, infant, and nutritional products (such as Selsun Blue shampoo, Murine eye drops, and Similac formula) joined the roster in the 1960s. The FDA banned Abbott's artificial sweetener Sucaryl in 1970, saying it might be carcinogenic, and in 1971 millions of intravenous solutions were recalled following contamination deaths.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Schoellhorn became CEO in 1979; profits increased but research and development was cut. In the 1980s Abbott began selling Japanese-developed pharmaceuticals in the US.
