   FGX International has set its sights on generating revenue through rose-colored glasses. The company designs nonprescription reading glasses and sunglasses and distributes them to drugstores, supermarkets, department stores, and mass merchandisers (such as
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10984">
    CVS
   </company>
   ) in the US and abroad. Its brand names include FosterGrant, Magnivision, Gargoyles, Anarchy, Angel, and Stylemark. It also sells sunglasses through licensing agreements under the Body Glove, C9 by Champion, Panama Jack, and Ironman labels. The company exited the costume jewelry niche in 2009 to focus on its core eyewear business. FGX International was acquired by ophthalmic products maker
   <company id="90714">
    Essilor International
   </company>
   in 2010.

  <p>
   Essilor paid nearly $20 per FGX share, amounting to about $575 million (including some $115 million in debt). Essilor, which has largely focused on the prescription eyewear business, has seen FGX as a vehicle for boosting its presence in the nonprescription market. Under Essilor's ownership, FGX aims to expand into Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.

   Based in Rhode Island, FGX is a global manufacturer and marketer of nonprescription reading glasses that distributes its products for sale through drugstores, grocery stores, department stores, and mass merchants. Besides Rhode Island, it has offices in the US in New York City and San Luis Obispo, California, and additional international offices in Toronto, Milan, Mexico City, England, and China.

  <p>
   To keep costs down, the company uses Asian contract manufacturers to make its products. FGX's international customers account for about 15% of sales.

   To further strengthen its core eyewear business, FGX closed down its costume jewelry unit, which made pieces under the Club Med name, and sold the unit's assets for about $1 million in 2009. The company then shuttered a warehouse and distribution center in California in 2010.

   FGX has kept its eye on growth opportunities while keeping operational expenses in check. With more than half of its revenue generated from sales of nonprescription glasses and having achieved a 40% market share in this eyewear category, FGX looks to grow that segment as its target customer ages and needs reading glasses. To that end, FGX acquired Florida-based Stylemark, a leading US distributor of nonprescription reading glasses and sunglasses. Stylemark's portfolio of licensed brands includes Dockers, Reebok, Hello Kitty, and several Disney properties. The late 2011 purchase added new customers to FGX's target demographic of 18- to 49-year-old market of men and women. Then, in 2015 the company acquired sunglasses company Three Hundred (dba Fabris Lane) and its online retail business Red Hot Sunglasses. Fabris Lane sells its products to retailers and opticians in 20 countries around the world and owns such brands as Monkey Monkey, Freedom Polarised, and Suuna.

   Previously, the company bought New York-based designer Corinne McCormack in 2009 to strengthen its position as a marketer of more fashion-forward eyewear. The deal was worth about $1.5 million in cash and included e-commerce firm Eye-Bar. Corinne McCormack makes nonprescription readers and sunglasses that are sold in more than 2,000 specialty and department stores, such as
