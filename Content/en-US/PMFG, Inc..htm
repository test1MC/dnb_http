   Even though its name has changed, PMFG (formerly Peerless Mfg.)&#160;is still without peer when it comes to making products that remove contaminants.&#160;It operates through two segments: environmental systems and process products. Its process products include separation filtration systems that&#160;remove solid and liquid contaminants from natural gas and saltwater aerosols from the air intakes of marine gas turbine and diesel engines. The segment&#160;also makes&#160;industrial noise control and heat transfer products.&#160;PMFG's environmental systems unit makes air pollution abatement products, primarily catalytic reduction systems used to convert nitrogen oxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels into nitrogen and water vapor.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In fiscal 2012 PMFG reported a revenue increase of 11%, thanks primarily to a 33% growth in process products revenues due to the acquisition of Burgess Manning GmbH (which contributed $8.3 million of revenues in 2012) and increased pressure product sales in Asia and the Middle East driven by a sales push in those regions. However, revenues from Environmental Systems decreased by 48% due to the lower level of new environmental projects awarded in late fiscal 2011 and early fiscal 2012 because of decreased construction of new gas-fired power generation facilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net loss of 117% in FY2012 was attributable to the increase in sales and marketing expenses due to increased commission and other selling related expenses associated with higher revenues in 2012, and increased engineering and project management expenses (up $0.6 million) due largely to the addition of international engineering and project management resources. General and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million in 2012, primarily due to the accelerated vesting of previously unvested restricted stock awards, increased costs of maintaining foreign offices, and additional costs associated with the acquisition of Burgess Manning GmbH. Other income and expense increased due to higher fair value of derivative liabilities associated with the conversion and redemption features of preferred stock during 2011.

        <p>
   PMFG's business strategy is to seek out opportunities in high-growth international markets, use technological innovation to address a broader range of pollutants, expand the company's technical expertise and manufacturing processes, and seek strategic acquisitions. The company serves customers from power generation, natural gas infrastructure, refining, and petrochemical processing industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Growing its manufacturing base in the US to support its global supply chain needs, in 2012 PMFG announced a plan to build a 80,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Denton, Texas to keep up with demand for environmental and process products equipment.
  </p>
        <p>
   PMFG opened a new subsidiary in Singapore in 2010, Peerless Asia Pacific, designed to strengthen its ability to manage projects throughout the Asia/ Pacific region. The company also signed an agreement with CEFCO Global Clean Energy in 2010 to manufacture equipment and process units incorporating the selective capture and removal of purified carbon gas, and the sequential capture and removal of mercury, metal, and particulate aerosols.

        <p>
   In late 2011, PMFG subsidiary Peerless Europe acquired Germany-based Burgess-Manning GmbH for $5.5 million. The company manufactures and markets custom-engineered systems and products for such markets as power plants, natural gas pipelines, and petrochemical plants. PMFG sees the combination of its Peerless Europe unit with Burgess-Manning as a way to widen its footprint in Central and Eastern Europe and broaden Burgess-Manning's product offerings.

        <p>
   In 2008 the company bought Nitram Energy, the parent company of Burgess-Manning, Bos-Hatten, and Alco Products, for $63 million. The deal helped to double PMFG's revenues and broaden the company's range of product offerings.
