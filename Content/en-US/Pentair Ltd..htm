   Pentair is perpetually pumped about water. Valves &amp; Controls manufactures water flow and filtration products for the residential and commercial construction projects and municipal markets. Pentair's Water Quality Systems segment segment makes custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics as well as thermal management systems used in industrial, communications, electronics, and energy industries. Although incorporated in Ireland, the US is its largest market, generating about 50% of its net sales each year. In mid-2016, Pentair agreed to sell its Valves &amp; Controls operations to

  <p>
   Pentair's revenue increased in 2014 primarily due to increases from its former Process Technologies and Technical Solutions segments. Its net income has fluctuated 2012; it decreased in 2014, mainly due to a loss on a sales and the impairment of discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth in Technical Solutions segment climbed 24% due to increased volume in the US, China, and Canada. Process Technologies spiked by 26% due to higher sales of certain pool products serving North American residential housing and increased demand for global food and beverage products.

  <p>
   A key component to Pentair's growth strategy has involved getting its cost structure under control. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, it initiated and continued certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing its fixed cost structure and realigning its business.
