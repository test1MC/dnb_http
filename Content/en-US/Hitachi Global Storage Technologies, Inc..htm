   Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST) makes external and internal hard-disk and solid-state drives for a wide range of IT products, from laptops to servers. Its data storage product portfolio ranges from 3.5-inch computer drives to helium-filled hard disk drives to flash storage devices for such applications as database analytics and cloud computing. HGST sells through distributors such as
   <company id="48020">
    Ingram Micro
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   . The company has development and manufacturing operations in Asia and North America. While it retains the Hitachi name, the company was sold by

   in 2012 for about $4.3 billion in cash and stock.

  <p>
   HGST's strategy is to stay at the forefront of technology. The company in 2014 was the first to sell helium-filled hard disk drives, which enables more drives to packed in a stack. The result is up to 10 terabytes of storage. It has sold more than one million helium-filled HDDs. HGST also has expanded its product line with flash storage, a growing medium for data intensive applications. The company has worked with Intel to develop solid state drives (flash) for enterprise-level use in servers, workstations, and storage systems. Besides working with Intel, HGST has made flash a focus of acquisitions.

  <p>
   In 2015, the company bought Amplidata, a developer of object storage software for public and private cloud data centers for some $267 million. The acquisition pushes HGST further into higher value data storage platforms and systems in cloud data centers. Other recent acquisitions included Virident, a provider of server-side flash storage solutions for virtualization, database, cloud computing, and webscale applications; and sTec, a provider of enterprise solid state drives.
