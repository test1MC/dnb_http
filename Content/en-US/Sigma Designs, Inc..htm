   Headquartered in California, the company has sales and R&amp;D offices in China, Denmark, France, Germany, Singapore, The Netherlands, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Additional sales support offices are in Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, and the company has a distribution center in Singapore. About 40% of revenue comes from customers in China with customers in Taiwan and the US supplying about 20% each.

   Sigma Designs has a direct sales force in Denmark, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. It relies on distributors and partners; about 15% of sales comes from Sunjet Components Corp. The company has an extended sales cycle that ranges from nine to 18 months, depending on the level of technical expertise required.

  <p>
   Sigma Designs reported a 21% revenue increase in 2016 (ended January), hitting $227 million, compared to $188 million in 2015. Sales of the company's products for smart TVs led the way with a 110% increase. Sigma Designs was able to raise the average selling price 154% on its smart TV devices because of increased use of more expensive chipsets used in ultra-high definition TVs. The revenue jump could have been higher, but the company shipped fewer smart TV products because of falling demand for its older legacy products. Sigma Designs also reported a 49% revenue leap from its internet of things devices, which had an 86% increase in unit shipments to customers in Asia and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for net income, Sigma Designs broke a four year streak of losses and posted a $16,000 profit in 2016. A one-time payment put it in the black and the company warned that losses probably would resume as it continues to spend aggressively on research and development and sales and marketing to gain market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell to $780,000 in 2016 from $16 million in 2015 because of changes in operating assets and liabilities and cash paid in connection with an acquisition.

  <p>
   Sigma Designs operates in a highly competitive segment of the semiconductor industry, facing off against such microchip giants as
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   . It is typical in the industry for the average selling prices of devices to fall steadily, due to competitive pressure and the requirements of customers, so the company must continually roll out new products and increase the unit volume sales of its products to offset the pricing declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is pressing its position in the smart TV market, rolling out further enhancement to its chips. In its home automation/internet of things business, it hopes that the Bretelon acquisition will help it enter new markets.

  <p>
   Sigma Designs bolstered its internet of things capabilities with the acquisition of Bretelon, a developer of mobile internet of things technology. In particular, the move adds outdoor applications to the internet of things business.
