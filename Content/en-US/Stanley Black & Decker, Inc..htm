   in 2010.
  </p>

  <p>
   Stanley Black &amp; Decker operates its business through three segments: Tools &amp; Storage (which generated 64% of 2015 sales), Security (19%), and Industrial (17%).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company combined the Construction &amp; Do-It-Yourself business with certain complementary elements of the Industrial and Automotive Repair and Healthcare businesses (formerly part of the Industrial and Security segments, respectively) to form the Tools &amp; Storage business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Tools &amp; Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools and Hand Tools &amp; Storage businesses. The Power Tools business includes professional products, consumer products and power tool accessories. The Hand Tools &amp; Storage business sells measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. Storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products
  </p>
  <p>
   The Security segment houses the Convergent Security Solutions (CSS) and Mechanical Access Solutions (MAS) businesses. The Industrial segment consists of its Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses. The Infrastructure operation consists of the Oil &amp; Gas and the Hydraulics businesses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Tools &amp; Storage segment sells its products to professional end users, industrial users, distributors and retail consumers. The majority of sales are distributed through retailers, including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Security segment, the CSS business sells to consumers, retailers, educational, financial and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and industrial customers. Products are sold predominantly on a direct sales basis. The MAS business sells and installs automatic doors, commercial hardware, locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems, keying systems, tubular, and mortise door locksets. MAS sell to commercial customers primarily through direct and independent distribution channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Industrial segment, the Engineered Fastening business primarily sells engineered fasteners designed for specific industrial applications. The Infrastructure businesses sells to the oil and natural gas pipeline industry and other industrial customers. The products and services are primarily distributed through a direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stanley Black &amp; Decker spent $101.7 million on advertising in 2015 compared to $121.5 million in 2014. Cooperative advertising costs with customers came in at $211.9 million in 2015, compared to $206.5 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, sales to US home centers and mass merchants accounted for 21% of revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 net sales decreased by $166.8 million compared to 2014. The primary reason was due to negative impacts from foreign currency. Net sales of the Security segment and Industrial segment decreased, partially offset by increased Tools &amp; Storage segment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stanley Black &amp; Decker's net income increased by 16% due to decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower sales. (The decline in the selling, general and administrative costs reflected the positive impacts of volume leverage and cost controls).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $114 million compared to 2014, primarily due to change in accrued expenses and accounts receivables.

  <p>
   Beyond tools, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been diversifying into higher growth and higher profit businesses, such as security and health care, to lessen its reliance on big-box retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company stated in 2015 that its long-term financial objective of 4-6% organic annual revenue growth and double-digit total revenue growth could be achieved through a combination of: fostering growth in its newer engineered fastening, infrastructure, and security businesses; strengthening its presence in emerging markets; selectively choosing markets were its brand and value proposition is valuable and have room for growth; strategically acquiring companies that bolster or complement its services (mostly in the tool industry). Stanley Black &amp; Decker also re-emphasized in 2015 its desire to foster a "true organic growth culture" by encouraging innovation and by becoming a more digitally enabled enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs and drive efficiency throughout its supply chain, Stanley Black &amp; Decker continued in 2015 to employ its Stanley Fulfillment System (SFS). The SFS uses continuous improvement strategies that work in unison, and include: sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenues, earnings and cash flow growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also focused on growing organically, including increasing its presence in emerging markets, with a goal of generating greater than 20% of annual revenues from those markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stanley Black &amp; Decker is looking to improve the operating results of the Security business and planned to reevaluate its recovery progress and strategic fit by the end of 2016.

   <company id="10214">
    Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company traces its roots back to 1843, when Frederick Stanley opened a bolt shop in a converted early-19th-century armory in New Britain, Connecticut. In 1852 he teamed with his brother and five friends to form The Stanley Works to cast, form, and manufacture various types of metal.
