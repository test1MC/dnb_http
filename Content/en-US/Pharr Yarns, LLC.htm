   Pharr Yarns spins yarn for use in a number of products including apparel, carpets, conveyor belts, industrial filters, military and fire fighting uniforms, and work gloves. Its high performance engineered yarn is used in technical, commercial, protective, and industrial applications, as it is resistant to fire, chemicals, and/or cuts. These technical fabrics are sold under brand names such as Kevlar, Torcon, and Dynnema. The company's carpet yarn division supplies yarn to manufacturers of rugs and carpets. The company has manufacturing facilities throughout the US.

   Industrial spun yarn offers strength needed in clothing used by rescue workers and fabrics used in the aerospace industry. Commercial yarns serve the automotive, aircraft, and rug and wall covering markets. Active wear is made from apparel yarns that offer moisture management, friction-free, and antimicrobial properties.
