   Mitsui Chemicals America develops technologies and materials harmonizing with the global environment while maintaining competitive advantage in its business domains: The parent company has been making efforts to develop the business through several measures, including mergers and acquisitions. With the increased efforts to develop shale gas in the US, the company has been working toward development of a major petrochemicals project. In addition to projects in North America, the parent company is expanding its operations in South America and other parts of the Americas. Among its strategic goals is to bolster its ADMER operations in the US. It is also striving to meet product specifications for its customer in the US, which are becoming increasingly more stringent.

   Group is targeting production expansion of its polypropylene for automotive materials, made in eight major world markets (Japan, US, Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, Thailand, and China). In 2015, polypropylene compound production capacity reached 1 million tons per year which reflected an increase in North and Central America demand and output.
  </p>
  <p>
   In North America and Mexico, the group plans to reinforce its supply capacity at a pace faster than market growth. Its basic approach is to continue investing steadily while monitoring conditions in each region.
