   "Do you copy?" and "Roger that" might be snippets of conversation heard over two-way radios and other devices made by Motorola Solutions. The company's radios and wireless broadband products are used by government, public safety, and first-responder agencies to communicate and deploy personnel. Commercial and industrial customers use products from Motorola Solutions to stay in touch in mobile work forces. Besides two-way radios the company makes vehicle-mounted radios, body cameras, headsets, and other devices and develops software systems to hook them together. Some 60% of sales are to customers in the US. Motorola Solutions traces its roots to the 1930s when Motorola started out making radios for police cars.

   Revenue slipped 3% in 2015 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion in 2014. Declines in sales to customers in Europe, Africa, and Latin America more than offset a 4% increase in US sales and better sales in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income tumbled 53% lower in 2015 down to $610 million from $1.3 billion in 2014. The reduced sales were joined by a loss from discontinued operations to slash profit.

   Motorola narrowed its focus to communications for public safety and commercial users when it sold its enterprise business to
   <company id="15351">
    Zebra Technologies
   </company>
   . The move cut Motorola's revenue to about $6 billion. The company wants to expand the products it sells for first-responders, police and fire departments, and public safety-oriented other government functions to other markets with similar communications needs. Markets include hospitality, mining, classified communications, military, transportation, education, and utility.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has made strategic investments in several companies to extend its technologies into new areas. The companies include CyPhy Works, a developer of advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones. The investment is part of Motorola's strategy to connect its with real-time data and intelligence. Other companies in which Motorola has invested are VocalZoom, a developer of sensors for speech enhancement, and SceneDoc, maker of mobile investigative software.

   In services, the company has expanded lifecycle management contracts, which enable customers to receive software updates and provide continuing revenue to Motorola.
  </p>

   Motorola is investing in public safety broadband networks based on the LTE standard. After delays as standards were finalized, the company expects to see higher public safety LTE revenues in 2015, with international customers leading the way.

   Motorola received a $1 billion infusion in summer 2015 with an investment by

    Airwave

   , the largest private operator of a public safety network in the world. It delivers voice and data communications to more than 300 public service agencies in Great Britain. The acquisition expands Motorola's managed and support services business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Motorola expanded its cloud computing offerings with its acquisition of PublicEngines, a privately held provider of cloud-based crime analysis, predictive policing, and citizen engagement capabilities. Also in 2015. Motorola bought Emergency CallWorks, a privately held provider of Next-Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1) call-taking software for public safety.

  <p>
   Motorola got its start in 1928 when Paul Galvin, then 33, founded Galvin Manufacturing in Chicago to make battery eliminators so early radios could run on household current instead of batteries. The following year Galvin began making car radio receivers and trying to develop a mobile radio for the police. In 1940 the company developed the first handheld two-way radio for the US Army.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1947 Galvin renamed the company Motorola, after its car radios. In the late 1950s Motorola started making integrated circuits and microprocessors, stepping outside its auto industry mainstay. When Galvin died in 1959, his son Robert became CEO. The company's purchase that year of a hospital communications systems maker led it to produce some of the first pagers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years the company has expanded and contracted, evening launching a satellite system to handle its communications.m An early leader in cell phones, the company failed to make the transition to smart phone. Eventually, the company divested parts of the business to again focus on communications oriented toward public safety applications.
