   During its first decade in business, Spanx sales have reached about $150 million annually. Looking to expand its target audience beyond women, Spanx in 2010 developed a line of undershirts for men that feel like a wetsuit. Styles include V-necks, crew necks, and tanks. Springboarding from the success of its Zoned Performance and cotton compression undershirts, Spanx quickly added a line of bottoms for men. In 2011 the firm launched Mama Spanx, a new range of control underwear for pregnant women.

   In recent years, Spanx has added another target audience: plus-size women. As a result, the company distributes its products to niche retailers the likes of
