   If you're in the market for a forklift, call Toyota Industries. Those on the hunt for a Corolla should call
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota Motor
   </company>
   . Toyota Industries builds forklifts and other lift trucks, automotive parts (engines, air-conditioning compressors, and electronics), looms (which established the company in 1926), and chip package substrates. It also offers logistics services. The company does make three Toyota-brand passenger vehicles -- the Vitz (or Yaris in the US), the RAV4, and the Mark X ZiO (only sold in Asia). Toyota Industries has more than 20 production plants in Asia, Europe, and North America. Its largest shareholders are Toyota Motor, which owns nearly 25% of the company, and
   <company id="52326">
    DENSO
   </company>
   , which has a 9% stake.

  <p>
   Toyota Industries operates through five segments -- automotive, materials handling, logistics, textile machinery, and other (chip package substrates). Automotive and materials handling together make up the bulk of sales (almost 90% in fiscal 2015). The automotive division, which accounts for around half of the group's overall sales, manufactures vehicles, diesel and gasoline engines, car air-conditioning compressors, and electronics components. The materials handling division, which accounts for 40% of sales, makes industrial vehicles under four brand names -- Aichi, BT, Raymond, and Toyota.
  </p>
  <p>
   Logistics, which accounts for 5% of sales in 2015, is made up of four subsidiaries in Japan -- Advanced Logistics Solutions, Asahi Security, Taikoh Transportation, and Wanbishi Archives. These logistics companies offer freight trucking, operate distribution centers, store documents, and provide cash management and security services. Textile machinery (loom manufacturing) and other (chip package substrates) combined account for 3% of sales.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, Toyota Industries' revenues increased by 8% due to growth across all segments except for textile machinery. Its net income increased 26% from 2014 to 2015 due to the increased sales, along with cost reduction efforts, rise in dividends income, and interest income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Materials handling equipment sales spiked 16% in 2015 resulting from the launch of new products worldwide; growth in the North America, European, and Chinese markets; and increased sales of lift trucks. In addition, its logistics segment increased by 7%, resulting from a rise in the sales of its commissioned logistics operations. Its automobile business also jumped by 5% due to growth in the North American and Chinese markets.

  <p>
   Pursuing business expansion is the cornerstone of Toyota Industries' strategy for promoting its portfolio of products and services. Hybrid and electric powered technologies, which are lighter weight and more energy efficient than the industries' current offerings, figure prominently on the company's workbench.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toyota Industries is integrating a slew of such green technologies into its automotive and materials handling products specifically in hopes of appealing to customers in North America and China. Simultaneously, Toyota Industries is taking every opportunity to target developing economies, such as Eastern Europe, China, India, and Latin America that promise strong demand, by expanding its sales network.

  <p>
   In 2013 Toyota Industries made a move to strengthen its forklift portfolio when it acquired
   <company id="12905">
    Cascade Corporation
   </company>
   for $759 million. Cascade makes a variety of forklift attachments, handling forks, cylinders, and other related parts to dealers and manufacturers of lift trucks in North America, Europe, China, and the Asia/Pacific region. It now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Industries.
