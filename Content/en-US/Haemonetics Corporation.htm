   Haemonetics helps health care providers keep track of blood. The company develops and produces automated blood collection systems that collect and process whole blood, taking only the components (such as plasma or red blood cells) needed and returning the remainder to the donors. Typically these systems, sold under the Cell Saver, TEG, and OrthoPAT brands, are bought and used by plasma centers and blood banks. Haemonetics also makes hospital systems that collect and re-infuse a patient's own blood during surgery; these are sold under the cardioPAT and Cell Saver brand names. Additionally, the company sells information management software and provides consulting services to blood banks and hospitals.

  <p>
   More than 80% of the company's revenues come from the sale of single-use disposable products that work with its specialized blood collection and processing systems. The balance of revenues comes from sales and maintenance of its systems and software products, and consulting services. It also rents equipment to some customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Haemonetics products are divided into four segments: Plasma, blood center, hospital, and software solutions. The blood center segment (which makes blood collection and processing devices and related consumables) is the largest operating division and accounts for about 40% of sales, while the plasma segment (collection devices and consumables) accounts for about 35%. The hospital segment, which includes blood salvage and blood-demand diagnostic equipment and consumables, accounts for 15% of sales, while IT platforms and consulting services provided by the software solutions segment account for 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hospital product line includes such brand names as Cell Saver, TEG, and OrthoPAT.

  <p>
   Haemonetics products are sold in about 100 countries primarily in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, with sales in the US market accounting for half of annual revenues. The company has manufacturing facilities in the US, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, and Switzerland and is supplied by third-party manufacturers in Japan and Thailand.
  </p>

  <p>
   Haemonetics markets its products and services worldwide through a direct sales force and distributors. It has direct sales forces in the primary markets of the US, Europe, and Japan, though it also maintains a direct sales presence in Canada and China. It uses distributors to sell its products in South America, the Middle East, and other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's customers include plasma-derived pharmaceutical manufacturers, blood collection organizations, and hospitals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses were $4.5 million in 2014, up from $3.6 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Haemonetics has seen rising revenues over the past five years due to organic growth and acquisitions. However, revenue dropped 3% to $910 million in fiscal 2015 as disposables sales declined (namely whole blood disposables). This was partially offset by growth in plasma and diagnostics sales. Foreign exchange fluctuations also impacted earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has been declining, dropped 52% in fiscal 2015 as certain expenses rose (including research and development program costs). Cash flow from operations fell 9% to $127 million that year on the lower earnings.

  <p>
   Haemonetics is working to expand its product offerings to provide a comprehensive array of blood management solutions. It also aims to expand its geographic reach, especially in high-growth regions of the world. The company spent some $54 million on R&amp;D efforts in fiscal 2014 towards the development of new offerings, including a next-generation orthopedic surgery blood system and an automated whole blood collection system; it also grows through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to continue innovating its Cell Salvage, TEG, Plasma and Platelet apheresis platforms, including connecting them to software to bring added efficiency to its customers. Additionally, Haemonetics continues to invest in new commercial plasma products and services. It plans to bring its next-generation plasma collection device to the market in fiscal 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   New launches in 2015 included its DonorSpace comprehensive blood donor recruitment and retention software, SOLX red cell storage product with whole blood filtration, TEG 6s diagnostics device, and BloodTrack software in combination with its HaemoBank device.

  <p>
   Collecting and banking blood is easier when hospitals and banks have good software to manage the process. To meet that need, Haemonetics has built up its information management systems and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once it got certain IT purchases squared away, Haemonetics put its attention back on actual blood processing hardware. In 2013 it bought up the assets of Minnesota-based Hemerus Medical, a developer of innovative whole blood collection, processing, and storage equipment, in a deal worth some $27 million.

  <p>
   Allan Latham founded Haemonetics in 1971. Its first product was a blood processing machine sold to blood banks and hospitals. The company went public in 1979. Early in the 1980s the company introduced the Cell Saver automated blood-salvage system. The product debuted at a time when the possibility of contracting HIV from blood transfusions had become a serious health concern, and by 1988 sales topped $90 million. The company was bought in 1983 and was passed around between several owners, including

    Baxter International
   </company>
   , before going public again in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company formed key relationships with blood bank customers through which Haemonetics performed such management services as component collection, distribution, and donor recruitment; the move allowed the company to become more vertically integrated. The following year it acquired Santa Barbara, California-based Tri-Counties Blood Bank, which gave Haemonetics access to a distribution network of 24,000 annual units of red blood cells. A restructuring charge and discontinuation of some operations drained the company's bottom line in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's venture into blood bank operation was short-lived; by 1999 it exited that line when results didn't live up to expectations. The next year Haemonetics expanded its product line with its purchase of Transfusion Technologies. New devices included the Chairside Separator System, which separates donated blood into one unit of red blood cells and one unit of plasma.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Haemonetics began broadening its product line to include software and consulting solutions, offering blood banks and hospitals ways to improve efficiencies and manage their blood supply, as well as providing equipment.
