   <company id="46900">

   Pernod Ricard stays nimble in a changing marketplace by employing a bottom-up, decentralized business model. The parent company sets strategy but relies on the regional units, including Pernod Ricard USA, to implement the plans and respond quickly to trends and changing tastes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 its G.H. Mumm brand became the Official Champagne Sponsor of the Kentucky Derby and the Churchill Downs Racetrack, two of America's biggest horse races.

  <p>
   Pernod Ricard USA reiterated in 2015 that its strategy is to ensure that its premium brands excel in their categories, by growing its business with existing customers as well as by attracting new customers. The company planned to invest heavily in creating in-depth knowledge of consumer behavior and trends, strengthen its relationships with trade customers to create powerful routes to market, and focus on training, retaining, and hiring talent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Protecting its title as the #3 Premium and Prestige spirits maker in the US, the company has partnered with large distributors in recent years to expand its product reach and boost delivery time across the US. In 2014, for example, Pernod Ricard USA extended its relationship with
   <company id="40436">
    Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits
   </company>
   , the nation's largest spirits and wine distributor, to 33 state markets and made Southern the exclusive spirits broker for the company in some 17 states (mostly in the south). Also that year Pernod Ricard USA inked a deal with the nation's second-largest premium wine &amp; spirits distributor and longtime partner,
   <company id="125708">
    Republic National Distributing Company
   </company>
   , to be an exclusive distributor in eight markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Pernod Ricard USA continues to introduce new products stemming from its most popular brands. In 2014, responding to increased demand in the growing single malt whisky market, the company's Glenlivet brand introduced two new Nadurra expressions: The Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso and The Glenlivet Nadurra First Fill Selection.

   In July 2014, to strengthen its brand equity, Pernod Ricard USA purchased a significant majority stake in Avion Spirits LLC, which owns the ultrapremium tequila brand Avion, from its joint-venture partner Tequila Avion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, to expand its premium wine portfolio line further, the company acquired leading Sonoma wine brand Kenwood and related assets from
