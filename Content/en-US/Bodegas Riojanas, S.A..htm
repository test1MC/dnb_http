   Bodegas Riojanas brings full-bodied reds to dinner tables in Spain and abroad. From growing grapes to aging wine and bottling it, the company produces and distributes high-end wine from Spain's famed Rioja region. It owns more than 300 hectares (nearly 750 acres) of vineyards and two wineries (in Cenicero and San Vicente de la Sonsierra) that together house some 30,000 barrels and more than 4.5 million bottles. Bodegas Riojanas' top labels, which are sold throughout Europe and the Americas, include Cava, Rias Baixas, Rioja, and Toro. The founding Frías-Artecho and Artecho-Nieto families still help run the company, which was founded in 1890.
