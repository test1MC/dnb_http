   The nutty professor once wreaked havoc on furniture like that made by Kewaunee Scientific. The company makes furniture for laboratories, including wood and steel cabinets, fume hoods, and work surfaces. It also makes technical workstations, workbenches, and computer enclosures for local area networking applications. Kewaunee's primary customers are schools, health care institutions, and labs (pharmaceutical, biotech, industrial, chemical, and commercial research).&#160;The company's&#160;products are sold through

   , a school and lab products supplier, as well as through designated Kewaunee dealers. Kewaunee's subsidiaries in Singapore and India handle sales in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets.

   From its headquarters in North Carolina, Kewaunee maintains manufacturing facilities near its home office in the city of Statesville and overseas in Bangalore, India. Boasting a global reach, the furniture maker serves Asian and Middle Eastern markets through offices in Singapore and India.

        <p>
   Kewaunee has organized its business into two segments: Domestic Operations and International Operations. Its domestic business predominately designs, manufactures, and installs scientific and technical furniture. These products include steel and wood laboratory cabinetry, fume hoods, laminate casework, flexible systems, worksurfaces, workstations, workbenches, and computer enclosures. Kewaunee's International Operations segment comprises four foreign subsidiaries that provide the company's products and services, such as facility design, engineering, construction, and project management. The segment manages projects from planning to testing and laboratory commissioning.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Boosting international sales is a key component of Kewaunee's long-term strategy. Net sales rose 3% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011. The increase&#160;can be attributed&#160;to a 19%&#160;boost in sales among its International Operations&#160;segment as the regions showed signs of continued recovery. Net income dropped 44% during the same reporting period. The company points to declines in gross profit as competition heated up in the marketplace and Kewaunee logged higher costs for raw materials such as steel and epoxy resin. Operating expenses also rose due to an increase in depreciation expense and growth in International Operations.

        <p>
   Kewaunee sells its products to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, industrial, chemical, and commercial research laboratories, educational institutions, healthcare institutions, government entities, manufacturing facilities, and networking furniture users.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company relies on its dealers, commissioned agents, and a national distributor to sell its products. Kewaunee receives&#160;purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers. The company and its subsidiaries in India and Singapore also submit competitive bids for project work.
