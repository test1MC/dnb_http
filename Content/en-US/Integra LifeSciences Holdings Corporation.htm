   Integra LifeSciences, a regenerative medicine specialist, develops medical equipment for use in cranial procedures, small bone and joint reconstruction, and the repair and reconstruction of soft tissue. Integra makes surgical equipment, including bone fixation devices, spinal fixation systems, tissue ablation equipment, and drainage catheters used in neurosurgery and orthopedic reconstruction, as well as basic surgical instruments. Its products are marketed worldwide through direct sales and distributors. Integra operates in two segments: Specialty Surgical Solutions (the larger segment, it brings in some two-thirds of revenues) and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Specialty Surgical Solutions segment makes products in the area of dural repair, tissue ablation, precision tools, and neuro critical care. Meanwhile, the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments offers small bone repair and joint replacement hardware products for extremities, as well as private-label regenerative medicine technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are intended mainly for niche markets not targeted by larger medical device firms. Most of Integra's orthopedic products, for instance, are designed for orthopedic reconstruction of the extremities such as the feet and ankles (rather than the hip and knee replacement products offered by the likes of
   <company id="103803">
    Zimmer
   </company>
   and
   <company id="47954">
    DePuy
   </company>
   ). However, the company has reached those larger and more diverse markets through a select number of original equipment manufacturer deals with firms such as
   <company id="10981">
    Medtronic
   </company>
   and Zimmer.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's principal manufacturing and research facilities are located in the US (Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) and in France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Its distribution centers are in the US (Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania), Australia, Belgium, Canada, and France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Integra also has repair centers in the US (California, Massachusetts, and Ohio), Australia, and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for more than three-fourths of total revenue; Europe accounts for 12%.
  </p>

  <p>
   The group sells its products through an internal sales force and through distributors and wholesalers. It also markets some products domestically through strategic partnerships.

  <p>
   Integra's revenue had been on the rise until 2015, when revenue fell 5% to $883 million. That drop was due to the spin-off of SeaSpine Holdings; both segments actually had higher sales that year, thanks largely to a number of acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has been fluctuating for the past five years, dropped in 2015. The company lost a net $4 million that year as selling, general, and administrative spending increased (again, largely due to acquisition activity, as well as the spin-off of the spine business). Cash flow from operations has been rising; it increased 19% to $94 million due to decline in inventories and changes in liabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Integra has expanded its operations over the years through acquisitions, geographic expansion, and product R&amp;D efforts. It has expanded both its product lines and geographic reach through some 45 acquisitions since its formation, including recent additions of direct distribution assets in Australia and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of its growth efforts and string of acquisitions, the company has implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. It has consolidated manufacturing and distribution facilities. In 2015, Integra separated its orthobiologics and spinal fusion hardware business SeaSpine Holdings, which became a public company. The split will help both surviving entities operate in their respective arenas more effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, it has nearly completed the integration of a common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

  <p>
   Integra plans to launch its Omnigraft product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Integra reached an agreement to acquire
   <company id="46511">
    Derma Sciences
   </company>
   , a tissue regeneration company focused on advanced wound and burn care, for around $204 million in early 2017. It also plans to buy
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   's Codman neurosurgery business, which provides devices for areas including hydrocephaly, neurocritical care, and operative neurosurgery, for $1.05 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired TEI Biosciences and TEI Medical for $312 million. That purchase boosted its offerings in regenerative wound care and tissue repair. Integra also purchased a line of lower extremity implants from Metasurg that year, as well as the US rights to
   <company id="161782">
    Tornier
   </company>
   's Talari and Talaris XT ankle replacement products and its Futura toe replacement products. Finally, it acquired Italian distribution arm Tekmed Instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Integra gets a majority of its sales from its orthopedic segment and its neurosciences segment, each accounting for about 40% of sales; nearly one-third of those segment revenues come from regenerative medicine supplies. Traditional medical instruments such as surgical forceps, scopes, lights, and retractors account for about 20% of revenues.
