   Squeaky hinges are the stuff horror movie nightmares -- and WD-40's dreams -- are made of. The company's WD-40 product, used as a lubricant, rust preventative, and penetrant, is a staple in many homes. As well as unsticking locks and loosening rusted bolts, the omnipresent blue-and-yellow aerosol can contains the slippery stuff of myth, said to combat arthritis and attract fish. Its WD-40, 3-IN-ONE Oil, and Blue Works lubricants account for most of the company's sales. It also makes household cleaning and deodorizing products under the brands X-14, Carpet Fresh, No Vac, 1001, and 2000 Flushes and heavy-duty hand cleaners Lava and Solvol. WD-40 contracts with various companies to manufacture its products.

  <p>
   WD-40's net sales increased by $2.5 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2016 due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased by 5%. Of the $15.2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, $11.3 million came from the EMEA segment, which accounted for 36% of the company's total 2016 revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consolidated net sales for the WD-40 Specialist product line rose 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales in its largest segment, the Americas (which includes the US, Canada and Latin America) rose 2% thanks to strong promotional efforts for its Maintenance products (up 4%) which more than offset a 9% decline in the smaller Homecare and cleaning products business line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consolidated net income increased by $7.8 million, or 17%, despite the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, net income would have increased by $10.6 million, or 24%, for fiscal year 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year due to revenue growth and lower production costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operations was $60.6 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $55.1 million for fiscal year 2015 thanks to higher revenue and lower cost of products sold.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to expand geographically; maximize its position in the multi-purpose maintenance products segment through a research and development push; develop its businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and/or other strategic partnerships; and leverage its venerable WD-40 brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has conducted a long line of product acquisitions since 1995; prior to that date, it sold only its signature product. WD-40 has also been developing new product variations, including the WD-40 Smart Straw and No-Mess Pen precision applicators, WD-40 Trigger Pro, 3-IN-ONE Professional Garage Door Lube, and Spot Shot Pet Clean (a non-aerosol Spot Shot trigger product and a mildew stain remover under the X-14 brand). It has also launched the WD-40 Bike product line and formed WD-40 Bike Company LLC, a new business unit focused on the development of a comprehensive line of bicycle maintenance products for cyclists and mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is committed to innovation and renovation of its products for the growth of its brands and product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late fiscal 2015, the company launched WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw (a new innovative product) in the US.

  <p>
   Rocket Chemical Company was founded in 1952 by Norm Larsen and three investors (including Sam Crivello). Larsen developed WD-40, which stands for "water displacement, formulation successful on 40th attempt," in 1953 for General Dynamics' Convair unit. It was used to protect missile covers from corrosion. Soon General Dynamics' employees were sneaking the lubricant out of the plant for home use. By 1958 it was clear there was a consumer market for WD-40, and Rocket Chemical contracted with an aerosol packager to prepare it for the marketplace. By the mid-1960s the company suspended production of its other products to focus on WD-40. Sales topped $1 million in 1968. The company changed its name to WD-40 Company the next year, and it went public in 1973. By 1978 sales had reached $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 John Barry became chairman, and Gerald Schleif (who began as a marketing manager in 1969) became president and CEO. Schleif moved WD-40 away from its 30-year status as a single-product company by acquiring the 3-IN-ONE Oil business of UK-based Reckitt &amp; Colman (now
   <company id="42008">
    Reckitt Benckiser
   </company>
   ) in 1995. The following year the company launched its T.A.L. 5 synthetic lubricant. Schleif retired in 1997; Australian Garry Ridge replaced him. Sales in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Australia) slipped 14% in fiscal 1998 because of the Asian financial crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 WD-40 acquired
   <company id="12784">
    Block Drug Company
   </company>
   's Lava-brand heavy-duty hand cleaners and decided to stop marketing T.A.L. 5. The company bought Australia's Solvol-brand heavy-duty hand cleaning product lines (bar and liquid soaps and towels) in 2000 from
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing in its effort to broaden its range of brand-name products, in 2001 the company acquired HPD Holdings (dba Global Household Brands), maker of household cleaning products X-14 (hard surface cleaner), 2000 Flushes (toilet bowl cleaner), and Carpet Fresh (room and carpet deodorizer). The acquisition diversified WD-40's cleaning lineup -- which had included only Lava and Solvol hand cleaners -- with the established brand-name multi-use cleaners and deodorizers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2002 WD-40 acquired Heartland Corp., maker of Spot Shot carpet cleaner, in a $47 million deal. The company acquired the 1001 brand of carpet cleaning products from British consumer products manufacturer
   <company id="106475">

   </company>
   in 2004. The deal further enabled WD-40 to expand into the UK market.
