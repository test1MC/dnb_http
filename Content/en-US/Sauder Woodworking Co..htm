   To capture other markets, Sauder started manufacturing caskets and wood-grained ceilings. It also makes kitchen cabinets that are sold in North America by Swedish retailer

   To showcase its new and existing products, as well its Progressive Furniture products and expanded RTA categories, Sauder in 2013 extended the reach of its High Point, North Carolina, showroom by 5,500-sq.-ft. Now measuring nearly 30,000-sq.-ft., the showroom provides more room for Progressive Furniture to expand its accent and dining displays, while still giving ample room to host dealer traffic and meetings.

   In 2012 Sauder Funeral Products moved its funeral products manufacturing division to a larger 107,000-sq.-ft. facility on its Archbold, Ohio, campus. The move was spurred by strong casket sales and expanded product distribution.
