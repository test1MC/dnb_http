   Telular makes the technology behind security systems. The company's main product is its Telguard system that wirelessly transmits security alarm signals triggered at residential or commercial locations to an alarm company or other monitoring location. Telguard, marketed primarily in the US and Canada, is intended to provide an alternative to the more common wireline connections used in security systems. Telular's fixed cellular terminals enable the use of equipment designed for wired networks (including traditional phones, fax machines, and modems) over wireless networks.

   In mid-2013 Telular was taken private by Avista Capital Partners for $253 million. It had been a public company since 1994.

   The company, based in Chicago, generates almost all its revenue in the US.

   In 2015 Telular acquired SMARTLogix, a provider of petroleum management, inventory, and transportation logistic. SMARTLogix is part of the Telular SkyBitz division, the company's flagship brand for its commercial telematics service offering. The acquisition adds a platform for petroleum distributors to better manage their fleets and reduce costs.

  <p>
   Also in 2015 Telular bought two other telematics companies Reltima and GPS North America and were folded them into SkyBitz.

   Founded by William DeNicolo in 1986 to capitalize on a cellular interface device created by inventor Bill West, Telular originally built products for emergency communications and wireless alarms. In 1990 the firm signed a cross-license agreement with Motorola, whereby Motorola could use Telular's invention and Telular could use Motorola transceivers in its products. Telular went public in 1994.

   After years of costly litigation, Telular's principal patent was upheld in 1994 and 1995, but the company had less luck with patent protection in developing countries, which were adopting fully wireless telephone systems. In 1996 DeNicolo slashed employment and closed plants in Illinois and Puerto Rico before turning over the CEO post to longtime telecommunications industry executive Kenneth Millard.

   To speed up new wireless product development Telular bought radio specialist Wireless Domain in 1997. That year it signed a licensing agreement with the radio systems division of competitor

   . In 1998 Telular looked south of the border, inking a deal to supply fixed wireless terminals to Mexico's largest cellular company,

    Telcel
   </company>
   . The next year Telular brought to market fixed wireless terminals that could be used to connect PCs to the Internet. Development costs contributed to another year of losses in fiscal 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Telular turned things around in 2001 by more than doubling sales from the prior fiscal year and posting a profit for the first time in about a decade. Years of product development and marketing coupled with booming demand in developing regions for wireless service have contributed to the company's success. DeNicolo retired from the board and Millard was elected chairman that year. Millard stepped down as chairman, president, and CEO in 2005.
