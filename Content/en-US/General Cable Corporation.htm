   General Cable keeps power flowing and communication going. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes copper, aluminum, and fiber optic wire and cable products that are used in electrical transmission and distribution, power generation, and voice and data communications. Major brands include BICC (energy cables), Carol (temporary power cables), and NextGen (data communication cables). General Cable's products are sold to commercial, industrial, electric utility, telecom, military and government, retail, and OEM distributor customers worldwide. The company also makes copper and aluminum rod for other wire and cable manufacturers, and it integrates and installs high voltage systems on land and under water.

  <p>
   General Cable has more than 40 manufacturing facilities in some 22 countries around the world. The US accounts for 45% of its net sales.

  <p>
   With global R&amp;D, engineering, and manufacturing operations, General Cable divides its business into four geographic segments: North America, Europe, Latin America, and Africa/Asia Pacific. These segments account for fairly balanced portions of revenue. Each segment also operates high-tech laboratories that engage in everything from material compounding and electrical testing to specialty cable product development and rod fabrication.

  <p>
   General Cable has a regionally coordinated global direct sales force. Certain businesses operate under supply agreements for varying lengths of time. These agreements are generally strategic alliances with major utility customers around the world. General Cable is heavily dependent on its primary customer base of independent distributors and retailers, which account for a substantial share of it sales; contractors and OEMs account for a smaller portion.

  <p>
   General Cable experienced diminishing sales the last two years, with revenues dropping 29% from $5.98 billion in 2014 to $4.23 billion in 2015. The decline was fueled by reduced sales from almost all its segments. A decrease in metal-adjusted net sales was primarily due to decreased volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes on the translation of reported revenues. Volume, as measured by metal pounds sold, also decreased by 12% in 2015 compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also suffered three straight years of net losses. Its net loss of $136 million for 2015 was due to the lower revenue coupled with goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges related to its global restructuring plan. General Cable's operating cash flow has fluctuated wildly the last few years, increasing by 49% in 2015 due to favorable changes in receivables and accounts payable.

  <p>
   After experiencing net losses from 2013 to 2015, General Cable is working to cut costs. Throughout 2014 the company implemented a restructuring program designed to improve profitability in each of its reportable segments. The restructuring program is expected to result in ongoing annual savings of approximately $75 million, beginning in 2014 with full realization starting in early 2016. The restructuring program involves the closure of certain underperforming assets as well as the consolidation and realignment of other facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of this initiative, in 2015 General Cable sold a subsidiary in Spain and its Thailand operations for about $2 million and $88 million, respectively.

  <p>
   General Cable originated from some of the oldest names in the wiring business: Standard Underground Cable (founded by George Westinghouse) and Phillips Wire and Safety Cable Company, both founded in the 1800s. The companies supplied wire for historic events such as Samuel Morse's first telegram between Baltimore and Washington, DC, in 1844, the lighting of the Statute of Liberty in 1886, and the first Chicago World's Fair in 1892.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's best-known brand of nonmetallic sheathed cable, Romex, was invented at the company's Rome, New York, facility in 1922. Five years later, Phillips Wire and Standard Underground Cable joined to form General Cable Corporation. In 1935 the company's cables were used for power lines connecting the Hoover Dam to Los Angeles.
