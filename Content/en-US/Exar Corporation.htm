   Sales ran up about 30% in 2015 to $162 million for Exar. The acquisitions of Stretch (processor products) and iML (flat panel display products) helped boost revenue from industrial and embedded systems and high-end systems. But after two years in the black, a plunge took the company to a loss of about $45 million. The loss was attributed to higher operating costs from an impairment of intangibles and income taxes. Cash flow from operations also dove, from $851,000 positive to a negative $13.6 million.

  <p>
   Exar's acquisition of Integrated Memory Logic (iML) prompted the company to significantly restructure its operations in its fiscal 2015. Exar cut its headcount, which included staff reduction at its Hangzhou, China and Loveland, Colorado units. The result was the intangible assets impairment in 2015 that pushed the net loss deeper. Exar has re-oriented processes to reduce design time and increase the chance of success in the market. The company increased its research and development budget to $37 million in 2015 from $27 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Exar's $220 million acquisition of iML, provider of analog mixed-signal solutions for flat panel displays for TVs and tablets, buttresses Exar's intention to develop a large scale diversified analog mixed-signal business. Besides expanding Exar's portfolio, the deal expands its exposure in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan where most of iML's customers are.

  <p>
   The company also bought Stretch Inc., a provider of software configurable processors for video surveillance. The deal brings an end-to-end high-definition technology for digital and analog transmission of data from the camera to a recorder. Stretch's S6000 series and S7000 series products provide Exar a platform to integrate complex and high-value discrete components.
