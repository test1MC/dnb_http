   Aqualisa helps its customers clean up their act. The company makes showers and shower-related products (shower heads, shower valves, and digital, thermostatic, and electric showers). Showers marketed under the Quartz and Axis brand names can be turned on remotely, letting users know when "the water's fine." Its Aquavalve bi-metallic shower valve is more resistant to limescale buildup than conventional valves. In addition to operating in the UK, Aqualisa contracts with Malaysian manufacturers and is exploring the global export business. The Premier Collection (ilux Digital, HiQu Digital, HiQuXT and Futori) was shortlisted in the Best Bathroom Product category in the prestigious House Beautiful Awards 2013.

   Aqualisa works to keep its portfolio of products fresh. In 2014 it launched a new range of Quartz Digital and Visage Digital showers that includes new looks plus dual outlet systems branded as Quartz or Visage Digital Divert. Digital Divert allows users to switch from handset to drencher head or handset to bath fill -- all at the touch of a button. The 2014 collection of dual control valve (DCV) showers includes four different shower/bath configurations. Two single outlet designs offer a choice between a wall-mounted drencher shower head or adjustable shower head, whilst two divert configurations allow users to switch between a drencher shower head and adjustable shower head or, alternatively, between an adjustable shower head and a bath fill.
