   Windsor has earned the distinction as the brand leader across the largest categories of ethnic frozen foods, such as Asian, Mexican, and Italian. The company caters to US foodservice operators, chain restaurants, and industrial customers, as well as retail grocery, convenience, warehouse, and club stores such as Costco and Sam's Club.

   To give teeth to its Golden Tiger-branded Asian business, Windsor in 2011 bought Discovery Foods, based in California. The maker of frozen Asian snacks, appetizers, and entrees sells products under the Ling Ling, Tai Pei, and VIP brand names. While Windsor holds top positions in the Italian and Mexican frozen food segments, purchasing Discovery Foods positions the firm's Asian category for similar accolades.
