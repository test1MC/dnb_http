   Being all dried up is a good thing at Sunsweet Growers. The more than 400 member/grower-owned cooperative processes and markets dried fruit. Sunsweet produces one-third of the world's prunes (it processes more than 50,000 tons of prunes each year). Its other fruit products include prune and other juices, as well as dried apples, apricots, dates, cranberries, blueberries, mangoes, peaches, pears, pineapples, and more. Sunsweet, which has gotten into dietary supplement beverages, supplies its products to retail food and foodservice outlets worldwide. Sunsweet produces some 40,000 cases of dried fruit products every day. The co-op was founded in 1917 as the California Prune and Apricot Growers Association.

   To diversify its business and give its bottom line a boost, Sunsweet in 2011 acquired California-based Function Drinks, known for making functional beverages that have added nutrition. As part of the transaction, Sunsweet rolled Function Drinks into a newly formed subsidiary Disruptive Beverages Inc. (DBI). The cooperative is using DBI as the foundation for expanding its beverages portfolio.
