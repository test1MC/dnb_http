   Rémy Cointreau is the toast of the town (in more than 180 countries). Best known for producing cognac, which it has sold under the Rémy Martin brand since 1724, the distiller/vintner also produces high-end rums, liqueurs, and brandies. Divided by business divisions (cognac, liqueurs and spirits, and partner brands of Scotch whisky and vodka), its labels include Cointreau and Passoä liqueurs, and Mount Gay rum. It also distributes Charles Heidsieck and Piper-Heidsieck champagnes, and the US sparkling wine Piper Sonoma. Newer products are St-Rémy Cream (a cream-based brandy) and Cointreau Noir (an orange liqueur/cognac blend). The Hériard Dubreuil family controls 70% of the firm.

  <p>
   Founded in 1724 near Cognac, France, Rémy Martin began turning out fine brandies. After the French government in 1936 set up agricultural zones around Cognac to delineate production regions, Rémy Martin purchased a large tract of the best land (Grande Champagne) in order to concentrate on "fine champagne Cognac," the highest quality available.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distilled cognac exclusively and may not have changed except for the death of André Renaud, the company leader, in 1965. He left the business to his daughters - 51% to Anne-Marie Hériard Dubreuil and 49% to Geneviéve Cointreau, who had married Max Cointreau, one of the heirs to the Cointreau liqueur business. Their husbands became president and director-general, respectively. In 1969 Rémy Martin and Cointreau formed an alliance for worldwide distribution, allowing them to remain independent in a consolidating industry. (Cointreau had begun when brothers Edouard and Adolphe founded the company in 1849 near Angers, France. Its orange liqueur quickly became popular throughout France.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1973 Cointreau bought the aperitif Picon and also Saint James de Martinique's rum business. The company continued buying other lines of whiskey and liqueur, and introduced new products, including passion fruit-flavored Passoa in the 1980s. Family feuding in the Cointreau family throughout the decade led to sloppy distribution and other problems, and ultimately Max Cointreau would be forced out of the company's daily operations by brother Robert and cousin Pierre. Max Cointreau then went into politics, getting himself elected to a local office.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rémy Martin, meanwhile, extended its cognac distribution and added Krug champagne (1977) and De Luze wine purchasing and exportation (1980). By the late 1980s, the company was doing well enough to go shopping. It added champagnes Charles Heidsieck and Piper-Heidsieck, Italian liqueur Galliano (sold in 2006), and Mount Gay rum.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989, Max Cointreau was surprised to learn Rémy Martin and Cointreau had merged without his participation. The deal had been kept secret from Max and his sons, who soon sold their shares (19% of Cointreau and 49% of Rémy Martin) to competitor Grand Metropolitan. Rémy Cointreau bought the shares, about 20% of the company, in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1990s Rémy Cointreau enjoyed about $1.2 billion in sales and a worldwide distribution network. By 1998, however, with world cognac demand diminishing and the Asian financial crisis worsening (Japanese cognac consumption, a significant part of the firm's top line, nose-dived), losses reached upwards of $100 million. That year Dominique Hériard Dubreuil took over as chairman and CEO from her father. She instituted changes to bring the company back, selling Krug champagne in 1999 for about $165 million and forming Maxxium, a distribution joint venture with Highland Distillers and Fortune Brands' Jim Beam in 1999. (Eventually

   also became a partner.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, in a move to further cement its return to the top shelf, bought Bols and its Blue Curaçao liqueur in 2000 for about $500 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2005 sold a Polish vodka-making unit of Bols to

   (CEDC); the agreement also gives CEDC exclusive rights to sell Bols vodka in Poland and Russia and distribution of other Rémy Cointreau products in Poland. In 2006 Rémy disposed of subsid

   , the Dutch company famous for its Blue Curaçao liqueur, for US$271 million (€210 million). Other brands disposed of in the deal included Bols, Bokma, Coebergh, Corenwyn, and Pisang Ambon, as well as Galliano and Vaccari. The disposal also included Rémy's 33% interest in Advandis, the Bols joint venture production unit in the Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its Dutch sprits and liqueur brands, including the Bols, Bokma, Coebergh, Corenwyn and Pisang Ambon brands, as well as the Italian liqueurs Galliano and Vaccari for €170 million in cash. These moves were in line with the acceleration of the Rémy's strategy to refocus on key international brands in world markets with great potential such as the US and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company exited a joint venture that managed distribution of its product portfolio, Maxxium Worldwide. Formed with The Edrington Group of Scotland and US bourbon-maker Beam (once known as Fortune Brands) in 1999, the JV broadened Rémy Cointreau's access to lucrative markets. Maxxium, at one time, represented more than 55% of Rémy Cointreau's sales. Its contribution dwindled and, by 2007, represented slightly more than 10% of the company's total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its hard choices, Rémy Cointreau made good on its plan to divest its champagne division. Despite its brands' distinct strengths, champagne demand declined as the recession drained core markets in France, the UK and US, and Germany. Societe Europeenne de Participations Industrielles (EPI) purchased the champagne business for €412 million ($593 million) in mid-2011. Rémy Cointreau, however, retained sole distribution rights to the bubbly brands and reclassified the division into its partner brands.
