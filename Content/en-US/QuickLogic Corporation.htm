  <p>
   QuickLogic reported revenue of $26.1 million for fiscal 2013, almost double the $14.9 million it reported for revenue in fiscal 2012. However, the company has suffered a net loss of about $12 million in both of the past two fiscal periods. Its cash flow has also suffered in recent years despite the top line revenue growth.
