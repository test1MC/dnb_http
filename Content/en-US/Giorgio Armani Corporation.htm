   Oh, Gio! Giorgio Armani Corporation is the US arm of Italian fashion house
   <company id="54529">
    Giorgio Armani
   </company>
   , owned by designer Giorgio Armani. Founded in 1979, the US Armani generates about a fourth of its parent's sales, making and selling upscale apparel for men, women, juniors, and babies. Its retail network spans some 50 Armani Exchange stores, a dozen Giorgio Armani boutiques, and a couple of Armani/Casa and Armani/Fiori shops. The company also boasts a dozen-plus Emporio Armani stores and is expanding the banner. Giorgio Armani licenses its name to makers of perfume, cosmetics, watches, eyewear, jewelry, and accessories. A unit, Giorgio Armani Cosmetics operates within its own stores, as well as in

    Nordstrom

   and
   <company id="40406">
    Saks
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Based in New York, Giorgio Armani Corporation sells its namesake and licensed products nationwide through its own stores and through other high-end retailers.

  <p>
   Parent company Giorgio Armani Group is one of the world's top fashion and luxury goods groups. To support its business, it counts more than a dozen factories among its operations.

  <p>
   While privately owned Giorgio Armani doesn't report its financial performance, in recent years it has cited a slowdown in the US business that may exceed rivals

    Prada
   </company>
   and Marc Jacobs, part of
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH
   </company>
   . While demand in the Far East in recent years has helped to offset the decreases, sales growth at the parent company in 2013 slowed from its 16% growth in 2012. Demand has cooled in China and parts of Europe struggled to put the recession behind them.

   Giorgio Armani Corporation markets its top products through multiple mediums, such as television, the Internet, video media, and in print magazines.

  <p>
   The global luxury market is on the upswing. In 2013 and 2014, Giorgio Armani Corporation continued to open stores in New York and in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regardless, the US subsidiary may have missed opportunities from licensing certain product categories, notably clothing accessories. The company has introduced new labels, such as AX Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans, but claims modest success in marketing each brand's uniqueness to shoppers. The US subsidiary also sells Emporio Armani products online, as part of an ongoing strategy to expand through e-commerce.
