   Ferring Pharmaceuticals knows that birthing babies is hard work. The company develops and sells a variety of fertility products for the US market, including hormone treatments Bravelle, Menopur, and Endometrin. The company also develops and manufactures products to diagnose and treat ailments in the areas of urology, endocrinology, inflammation, oncology, and gastroenterology, including Euflexxa for osteoarthritis of the knee, prostate cancer treatment Firmagon, and Lysteda for heavy menstrual periods. Ferring Pharmaceuticals is owned by Swiss drugmaker Ferring Holding, which was founded in 1951 and expanded into the US in the early 1980s.

   Ferring Pharmaceuticals operates the Ferring Research Institute in California. The research and development center is focused on the development of peptide (amino acid compound) therapeutics, as well as drug delivery technologies. Ferring also has a research center, the Ferring International PharmaScience Center US, at its main New Jersey location.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to Bravelle, Menopur, and Endometrin, the company's hormone offerings include prescription meds Repronex and Novarel.

  <p>
   The global Ferring organization has manufacturing plants, R&amp;D centers, and marketing offices in some 50 countries in Europe (Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland), the Americas, Asia (China, India), and the Middle East (Israel). Ferring products are sold in more than 110 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US, Ferring Pharmaceuticals primarily provides sales and marketing services from its main office in Parsippany, New Jersey, for products manufactured at global Ferring Group locations. Other major US locations include facilities in Suffern, New York, and San Diego, California.

  <p>
   Ferring primarily expands its product offerings through the internal research and development of new compounds, particularly peptide-based drugs and biotechnology-derived medications. It also occasionally expands through acquisitions of new drug technologies, as well as by forming R&amp;D or distribution partnerships with other drug manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to update the labels for Menopur and Bravelle after a trial demonstrated that the treatments could safely be mixes and administered in a single injection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Ferring added to its operations in New Jersey by opening a new 25-acre operations center, including a manufacturing site, development laboratories, and a training center, in Parsippany.
