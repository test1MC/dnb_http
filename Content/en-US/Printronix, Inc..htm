   Printronix was started in 1974 by Robert Kleist and five others. An electrical engineer who helped design the first practical VCR, Kleist had previously helped form Dartex, a tape transport manufacturer (acquired by Tally), and Peripheral Business Equipment, a maker of data entry systems (merged with Peripheral Equipment). Printronix introduced its first product, a high-speed printer designed to be rugged enough for factory floors, in 1975, and in the mid-1970s the company introduced high-speed dot matrix printers for data processing departments. It unveiled an intelligent graphics printing feature in 1982.

   After establishing itself as one of the world's top 10 printer makers, the company was shaken in the mid-1980s by a slump in the computer market, a costly acquisition (printer manufacturer Anadex, 1984), and its failure to anticipate the market for PC printers. Printronix eventually introduced products for the PC market but couldn't compete against established manufacturers such as
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   and
   <company id="104699">
    Oki Data
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   At the onset of the 1990s, Printronix refocused on its original market. In 1991 it began making laser printers, and in 1992 it added thermal bar code printers to its product line. In 1994 Printronix won contracts from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11548">
    Unisys
   </company>
   that helped return it to the black for the first time since 1990.
