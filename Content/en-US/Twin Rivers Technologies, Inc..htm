   When Twin Rivers Technologies manufactures, it makes no bones about it. The company produces oleochemicals and other additives for food-manufacturing customers in North America and abroad. Its products include approximately 80 different types of fatty acids, glycerin, and methyl esters in food and industrial grades. Its food-grade products are made from edible tallow, cottonseed, soybeans, and sunflower and canola seeds. Twin Rivers also produces vegetable-oil-based biodiesel and ethanol. The company operates its business in the US and Canada. Twin Rivers is a subsidiary of the Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), a Malaysian government-owed agency in Kuala Lumpur.
