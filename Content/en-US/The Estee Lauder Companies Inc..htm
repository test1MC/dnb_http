Its products are sold through its network of upscale department stores, via specialty retailers, and online.

  <p>

  <p>
   Advertising and promotions are key in the ultra competitive personal care products market. The company's marketing creed is to provide "high-touch" service to build customer loyalty. Estée Lauder advertises on TV, in magazines and newspapers, on digital and social media sites, and on billboards and via direct mail. Promotional activities include in-store displays. The company's largest customer is department store operator
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   , representing about 10% of fiscal 2015 (ended June) sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other sales channels include the company's freestanding stores, upscale salons and spas, and duty-free shops in airports or on cruise ships.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $2.82 billion on advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development in fiscal 2016, up from $2.77 billion in fiscal 2015.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Estée Lauder's net revenue has been increasing for the last five years (2012-16), except for a marginal decrease in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   For fiscal 2016 net revenue increased by 4% to $11.3 billion due to higher net revenue from the Makeup and Fragrance segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Makeup segment's net revenue increased by 9% to $4.7 billion  due to higher sales of  $397 million accumulated from the makeup artist brands, Clinique, Smashbox, Tom Ford, and Estée Lauder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fragrance segment's net revenue increased by 5% to $1.48 billion, driven by higher net sales received from the luxury fragrances (Jo Malone London and Tom Ford), as well as incremental sales from thefiscal 2015 acquisitions of Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and the fiscal 2016 acquisition of By Kilian (approximately $134 million, combined).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been increasing for the last five years (2012-16), except for a decrease in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   The company focuses on geographic AND product portfolio expansion, and on strengthening its distribution. It is also pushing brand awareness and sales by expanding its digital presence (e-commerce and m-commerce, and digital and social media). The company also continues to build its makeup product category through the introduction of new product offerings, including new collections from makeup artist brands and Pure Color Sculpting lipstick from Estée Lauder and the fragrance category via new launches and innovation, such as Estée Lauder Modern Muse and new fragrances from Michael Kors and Tory Burch. In addition the company is continuing to expand its hair care brands both in salons and in other retail channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its ranking and market share, Estée Lauder and the Lauder family have been working to breathe new life into its flagship brand as competition has heated up. While Coty, Elizabeth Arden, and L'Oréal are enlisting the help of celebrities to elevate and give credibility to its brands, Estée Lauder sewed up its brand rejuvenation with a boost from fashion. The company is banking on a multi-year partnership with former Gucci Group creative director and fashion talent Tom Ford to continue its successful Tom Ford-inspired Estée Lauder line. The company has expanded its customer base to include younger shoppers through its M.A.C and Clinique cosmetics lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estée Lauder's geographic growth is focused on emerging markets and consumers who purchase in the travel retail channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home markets. The company is increasing its presence in countries such as China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico and South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy, Estée Lauder is shifting its category mix to more high-margin products that have global growth potential. To this end, the company is focused on skin care products -- its most profitable category. Also, Estée Lauder has been penning licensing agreements to boost its brand and reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched the Jo Malone London brand in China, at the Mitsukoshi store in Beijing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To underscore its panache for high-touch service and its growing portfolio of prestige brands, Estée Lauder in 2016 acquired by Kilian, the Paris-based prestige fragrance brand. In 2015 it acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a famous fragrance brand established by perfumer Frédéric Malle, and GLAMGLOW, a high-end skin care brand focusing on facial masks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014 the company acquired Le Labo, which specializes in distinctively French high-end fragrance and sensory items that have earned a loyal consumer following for its exclusivity and personalized service. With offices in London and New York, Le Labo has freestanding stores in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Hong Kong.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired RODIN olio lusso, a luxury skin care brand founded by New York stylist Linda Rodin.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Estée Lauder (then Josephine Esther Mentzer) started her beauty career by selling skin care products formulated by her Hungarian uncle, John Schotz, during the 1930s. Eventually she packaged and peddled her variations of his formulas, which included face cream and a cleansing oil.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the help of her husband, Joseph Lauder, she set up her first office in Queens, New York, in 1944, and added lipstick, eye shadow, and face powder to the line. Joseph oversaw production, and Estée sold her wares to beauty salons and department stores, using samples and gifts to win customers. Throughout the 1950s Estée traveled cross-country, at first to sell her line to high-profile department stores such as
   <company id="11064">
    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   , I. Magnin, and Saks, and later to train saleswomen in these stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estée Lauder created her first fragrance, Youth Dew perfume and bath oil, in 1953. In the late 1950s US cosmetics firms introduced European skin care lines with scientific names and supposedly advanced skin repair properties. Estée Lauder's contribution was Re-Nutriv cream, which sold for $115 a pound in 1960. The cream's advertising campaign established the sophisticated "Lauder look" -- an image that Estée herself cultivated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1964 Estée Lauder introduced Aramis, a fragrance for men, and in 1968, with the help of a
   <i>
    Vogue
   </i>
   editor, it launched Clinique, a hypoallergenic skin care line. In 1972 Estée's son Leonard became president; Estée remained CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estée Lauder created the Prescriptives skin care and makeup line for young professional women in 1979. Leonard was named CEO in 1983. By 1988 the company had captured a third of the US market in prestige cosmetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estée Lauder unveiled its Origins botanical cosmetics line in 1990. The company launched the All Skins cosmetics line in 1991 and in 1994 bought a controlling stake in hip Make-Up Art Cosmetics (M.A.C).
  </p>
  <p>
   Leonard became chairman in 1995. The company's IPO that year was structured to allow Estée and her son Ronald (previously an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of New York) to avoid a potential $95 million tax bill (inspiring a 1997 revision of the federal tax law). Filling out a busy year, Estée Lauder acquired the Bobbi Brown
   <i>
    essentials
   </i>
   line of cosmetics, bought botanical beauty products concern Aveda for $300 million (broadening its distribution into hair salons), and entered the mass market with its purchase of Sassaby (
   <i>
    jane
   </i>
   cosmetics, which was sold in early 2004). In 1998 Estée Lauder bought the rest of M.A.C and, despite potential conflict with the retailers on which it depends, launched a Clinique products Web site.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Estée Lauder bought rapidly growing Stila Cosmetics and Jo Malone Limited, a London-based seller of some 200 skin care and fragrance products. (The company sold Stila, a makeup artist brand, in 2006 to an affiliate of
   <company id="111610">
    Sun Capital Partners
   </company>
   , which is led by a former managing director of Elizabeth Arden in Australia.) Company president Fred Langhammer succeeded Leonard Lauder as CEO in 2000; Leonard remained chairman. Also in 2000 Estée Lauder bought a majority interest in Bumble and bumble, a hair salon and products company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Estée Lauder restructured by outsourcing gloss.com and closing some distribution channels, including the remaining in-store Tommy Hilfiger shops.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estée Lauder bought Paris-based Laboratories Darphin in May 2003, adding the high-end Darphin skin care line to its portfolio. In July 2003 Estée Lauder acquired the Rodan + Fields skin care line, launched by two dermatologists in 2002, bringing with it the Proactiv skin care line. It sold the line back to its owners in August 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Langhammer retired and assumed the role of chairman of global affairs in July 2004, when William Lauder was promoted to CEO. Also that year company founder Estée Lauder died of a heart attack at the age of 97.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the succession plan, first announced in November 2007, Fabrizio Freda joined Estée Lauder as its president and COO in March 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Estée Lauder teamed up with Somaly Mam Foundation and AFESIP to launch the Somaly Mam Beauty Salon in Cambodia.
