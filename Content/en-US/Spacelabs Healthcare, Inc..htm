        <p>
   Fiscal 2014 revenues for Spacelabs Healthcare decreased $9 million, or 4%, to $222.3 million from 2013's $231.3 million. The company attributes the decline to a delay in capital spending among North American clients that spurred an $8.7 million (or 5%) decrease.

   Spacelabs partners with some of the biggest hitters in the medical technology and security/defense industries to develop new products for its medical provider customers. They include
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12940">
    Cerner
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="106502">
    Meditech
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   , among many others. The company partnered with Blue-Zone Technologies, based outside Toronto, in 2013 to offer that company's Deltasorb anesthetic collection service to hospitals for eliminating the release of harmful halogenated anesthetics.

   Along with working with partner companies to expand its product line, Spacelabs makes occasional acquisitions. Over the years it has acquired and absorbed complementary technologies, such as Blease Medical and Del Mar Reynolds. It also forms alliances like the one it has with Uscom, a non-invasive cardiac monitoring company.

        <p>
   One way Spacelabs controls costs is by performing some research and development operations in China. Spacelabs is intent on developing a dedicated line of products for emerging markets. Indeed, it won a big contract with hospitals in Venezuela in 2012 to provide patient monitoring and connectivity products.

   Secure in its chosen industries, the company is focused on filling in niches and spreading the use of its products. It markets a neonatal monitoring suite and an enhanced information technology product to allow sharing of patient information throughout hospital networks. Spacelabs is working to spread the use of its ambulatory blood pressure monitors, which a patient wears while away from their doctor's office. Because many people experience blood pressure spikes from anxiety around doctors, the readings from ambulatory monitors are considered more useful. It also rolled out the ARKON Anesthesia System, a high-performance delivery method, in 2013.

   Curious as to how a company that worked with NASA became a health care company? Spacelabs was tapped by NASA in 1958 to resolve wireless monitoring of Gemini astronauts' vital signs. The company has since built on that Telemetry solution with a long history of firsts, innovations and developments. Beginning in the latter half of the century Spacelab focused on patient-centered service, Spacelabs Healthcare an extension of clinicians' care teams.
