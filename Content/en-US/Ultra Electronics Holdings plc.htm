   Ultra Electronics supplies electronic and electric systems to prime contractors and aerospace/defense, security, transportation, and energy customers around the world. Operationally, the company is organized into three divisions: Maritime &amp; Land s (intelligence, surveillance, communication, and combat equipment for submarines), Communications &amp; Security (IT systems for airports and mass transit and sensors and controls for nuclear reactors), and Aerospace &amp; Infrastructure (control and power distribution equipment for civil and military aircraft). About 71% of Ultra's revenue comes from outside the UK and the company is looking to extend its global reach.

  <p>
   In 2015 Ultra's revenue was £726 million, a 2% increase from 2014. The 7% revenue bump for Communications &amp; Security came from the acquisition of Herley in 2015 and the 2014 acquisition of Forensic Technology. Purchases of sonar-related products in the US and UK help the Martime &amp; Land segment. But funding delays on the Torpedo Warning System in the US and a reduction in rail power management revenue tamped down revenue growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped 20% to about £25 million in 2015 from 2014, when profit was dragged down by termination costs for a contract with Oman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities came in at about £48 million, 30% lower than the cash flow figure from 2014.

  <p>
   With a diversified portfolio targeting numerous niche markets in various geographic territories, Ultra boasts a long and consistent record of development and growth. The rise in its fortunes can partly be attributed to demand from its two single largest markets, the US and the UK, which also happen to have the largest and fourth-largest defense budgets in the world, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Ultra's strategy is to maximize revenue from countries with largest defense budgets -- hence its historical focus on the US and UK -- it sees potential in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region for growth and is therefore broadening its geographic reach. Government cuts in defense budgets have created an opportunity for Ultra to acquire defense companies as large defense contractors sell assets.

  <p>
   Acquisitions to add technologies and geographic markets have been a key part of Ultra's strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Ultra acquired the Electronic Products Division of Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, for £161.5 million. Renamed Ultra Electronics Herley, it designs and makes RF and microwave integrated systems and subsystems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Forensic Technology in 2014 for (Canadian) $94 million. Forensic Technology provides automated firearm ballistics identification and forensic analysis systems to law enforcement agencies in more than 65 countries.
