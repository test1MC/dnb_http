   Silicon Laboratories makes little translation machines. The company develops mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), which translate real-world analog signals (such as sound) into digital signals that can be processed by electronic products. Silicon Labs provides ICs used in set-top boxes, game consoles, portable electronics, industrial monitoring and control devices, and wireless handsets. Products include microcontrollers, clocks and oscillators, sensors, and broadcast communications chips. Top customers include

   Chinese companies make that country the biggest customer of Silicon Labs, supplying 44% of sales. The US is the next biggest market at 15%. Other notable country markets are Taiwan, 9%, and South Korea, 2%. The company has operations in the US, China, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UK.

   The company markets its products through a direct sales force and network of independent sales representatives and distributors. Silicon Lab's two largest customers are
   <company id="177616">
    Edom Technology
   </company>
   (20% of sales) and
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   (12%). In 2014 the firm reported advertising costs of 1.7 million, compared with $2 million and $1.7 million in 2013 and 2012.

  <p>
   Silicon Labs reported 2014 revenue of $621 million, a company record and a 7% increase from 2013. Net income, however, dropped 24% over the same period. The revenue rise was driven by market share gains and additional product revenue from the acquisition of Energy Micro. Unit volumes of products increased 5%, while average selling prices were stable compared with 2013. While China continued to be the biggest market for Silicon Labs devices, sales to US customers grew 31% in 2014. On the other hand, sales in South Korea dropped 40%.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the bottom line, higher costs for research and development (up 9%) and sales and marketing (up 18%) ate into the company's profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations came in at $137 million at the end of 2014, compared to $120 million at the close of 2013.

  <p>
   Silicon Labs is betting on the Internet of Things for its future. Chips and sensors that translate real-world data -- temperature, sound, light, and more -- for collection in digital databases are in the company's wheelhouse. Already, devices it makes for that market account for about half of its revenue. The company has been building with an eye on the IoT with a series of acquisitions that include Ember, Energy Micro, and Bluegiga. Of course, a number of other IC makers are rushing to make IoT devices and Silicon Labs is sure to run into formidable competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silicon Labs turns to its labs to develop new IoT products as well as those for other markets. The company typically spends around a quarter of its annual sales on research and development. The company primarily relies on

   to produce its ICs.

  <p>
   In 2015 Silicon Labs acquired Bluegiga Technologies Oy, a privately held provider of short-range wireless connectivity hardware and software for the Inetnet of Things (IoT). Bluegiga's wireless portfolio includes ultra-low-power Bluetooth Smart, Bluetooth Classic, and Wi-Fi modules, as well as software stacks, development tools and software development kits (SDKs) for a range of applications in industrial automation, consumer electronics, audio, automotive, retail, residential, and health and fitness. This strategic acquisition significantly expands Silicon Labs' wireless hardware and software solutions for the IoT.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2013 the company acquired Oslo, Norway-based Energy Micro AS, whose portfolio boasts the industry's most energy-efficient range of 32-bit microcontrollers. Silicon Labs paid $115 million up front for Energy Micro plus an additional $55 million later as deferred and "earn-out" consideration is the business grows as planned.
