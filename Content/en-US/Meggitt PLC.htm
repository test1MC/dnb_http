  <p>
   Meggitt is headquartered in the UK and has manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe, and North America, and has sales offices in Brazil, India and the Middle East. The US accounts for just over 50% of net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Customers are active in a range of industries, including commercial and military aerospace, engine manufacture, tracked military vehicles, navy shipbuilding, industrial gas turbines, off-shore oil platforms, petrochemical plants, ground refuelling, space launchers, and commercial transport. Its largest customer is Boeing, and the civil aerospace market accounts for 50% of sales.

  <p>
   In 2015, sales increased 6% on prior year to £1.6 billion due to strong growth in military revenue (primarily aftermarket) in the Control Systems segment, although this came after a particularly weak 2014. Aircraft Braking Systems and Sensing Systems also grew organically.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 3% on prior year to £182.1 million due to the increase in revenue, as well as a decrease in tax. Cash from operating activities was up 20% on 2014.

  <p>
   Meggitt is working to increase operational efficiency amid external headwinds on served markets. To that end, it is undertaking a six-stage, five-to-seven year program to reduce working capital and increase efficiency that has been launched at all major locations, with two having entered the important fourth stage where financial performance benefits are supposed to kick in. The company also carried out 400 layoffs in 2015, and two factories will be closed in 2017 and their operations consolidated within existing sites.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, Meggitt acquired the composites division of EADC from Greenbriar Equity Group for around $340 million. The acquired business produces aerospace components for jet engine and airframe applications; notable customers include
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="92387">
    Snecma
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   . Complementary to the EADC acquisition, Meggitt acquired Cobham plc, a supplier of extreme environment radomes and engine components for $200 million. The two acquisitions significantly bolster Meggitt's composites capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In also acquired in 2014 Precision Engine Controls Corporation (PECC), a subsidiary of United Technologies, for $44.2 million. PECC makes actuation systems and fuel metering valves for use in the manufacture of gas turbines in the oil and gas industry.

  <p>
   Meggitt traces its beginnings to the 1964 acquisition of Meggitt Engineering Limited by Willson Lathes Limited. In the early 1980s the company had annual sales of just £2 to £3 million ($3 to $4.5 million) and was losing money. Its fortune began to change in 1984 when businessmen Ken Coates and Nigel McCorkell left aerospace group Flight Refuelling (now
   <company id="57756">
    Cobham
   </company>
   ) and took control of the small firm. Credited as the savior of the company, Coates bought aerospace and electronics companies and merged them into Meggitt. The company went through a number of name changes until management settled on Meggitt PLC for the small machine tool group in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s Meggitt sold off more than 20 non-core businesses; it also acquired more than a dozen companies, including Endevco from Allied-Signal (1992), Snipe Target Systems from Cobham (1995), US-based Cartwright Electronics (1996), and Elastomeric Silicone Products (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   Coates died of cancer in 1998 at age 64. A Meggitt director since 1995 and former head of aerospace procurement for the UK's Armed Forces, Sir Donald Spiers became chairman that year. Acquisitions continued with the purchases of Hayes Targets (towed targets), Vibro-Meter (vibration-monitoring systems), and Heatric (compact heat exchangers).
  </p>
  <p>
   Meggitt acquired US-based Whittaker Corporation, a maker of aircraft components, for about $380 million in 1999. Meggitt sold Mobrey, its industrial controls division, that same year. Meggitt added two more US firms to its ranks in 2000 -- S-TEC Corporation (cockpit avionics) and S-TEC Unmanned Technologies (unmanned air vehicles).
  </p>
  <p>
   Meggitt announced a joint-venture (Integrated Target Services) with Cobham plc in 2001, to provide airborne targeting services. The same year it sold Meggitt Electronic Components Limited (MEC) to
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco
   </company>
   ; it also sold Wayfarer Transit Systems (transportation fare-handling equipment) in order to focus on core operations. On the acquisition front, Meggitt bought some radio frequency cable operations from
   <company id="13886">
    Kaman
   </company>
   and avionics from
   <company id="109919">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   in 2002. The company divested Meggitt Petroleum Systems (payment systems for gas pumps) in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meggitt further boosted its UK manufacturing operations with the purchase of Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group's Design and Manufacturing (D&amp;M) division in 2004. The division, which went for about $750 million, includes Braking Systems, Fluid Dynamics (hydraulics), Polymers &amp; Composites, and Aftermarket Services. In 2005 Meggitt acquired the fluid systems division of
   <company id="57756">
    Cobham plc
   </company>
   . The division makes products used in the treatment and handling of non-airborne specialty fluids and gases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its
   <company id="111547">
    Meggitt USA
   </company>
   subsidiary, Meggitt bought
   <company id="52458">
    Firearms Training Systems
   </company>
   (now known as Meggitt Training Systems) in 2006 for about $144 million. That same year Meggitt bought Keith Products of the US -- a maker of aircraft heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for use on business jets and general aviation aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meggitt acquired fellow aerospace company K&amp;F Industries in 2007 for almost $2 billion. K&amp;F brought aerospace and defense parts and services, such as wheels, brakes, flexible bladder fuel tanks, helicopter interiors, ice guards, and sealants to OEMs, as well as the aerospace aftermarket. K&amp;F's Engineered Fabrics enhanced military sales to helicopters and jets with its crashworthy fuel tanks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company purchased Denmark-based Ferroperm Piezoceramics A/S, a producer of advanced piezo-electric ceramic materials for sensing products, for over $14 million. Piezo-resistive and MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) sensors are used in situations requiring accurate measurement in analog or digital format. Later that year, Meggitt developed electrically-actuated carbon composite brakes, known as Ebrake, which were tested successfully by a
   <company id="42381">
    Bombardier
   </company>
   test aircraft -- a civil aviation first. (Control, timing, and sequencing are much more complex with electric braking.)
