   Kolbenschmidt Pierburg has found a great engine for international growth. The company is one of the world's largest piston makers. It also manufactures engine blocks, bearings, oil and water pumps, filters, valves, and camshafts, and develops air-supply modules, exhaust systems, and components for emission control. Its MS Motor Service unit provides aftermarket sales in more than 130 countries worldwide. Kolbenschmidt Pierburg's customers include major OEMs such as
   <company id="58357">

   ,
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="91295">
    Porsche
   </company>
   . The company -- formed after the 1998 merger of German manufacturers Kolbenschmidt and Pierburg -- oversees Rheinmetall's global automotive operations.

  <p>
   Even though Kolbenschmidt Pierburg was created in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1998 -- after a hard-fought merger between Metallgesellschaft and Rheinmetall -- the company's roots extend back nearly 100 years. For most of the 20th century, Karl Schmidt was a division (engine components) of German metals and engineering company Metallgesellschaft. But in 1984 Mettallgesellschaft decided to spin off Karl Schmidt as Kolbenschmidt and retain 60% ownership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kolbenschmidt's strategy was to provide parts all "around the engine" (engine blocks, bearings, and pistons), as well as steering wheels and airbags. Its first victory was a 1986 contract to supply aluminum pistons for Quad 4 engines for General Motors' Buick, Oldsmobile, and Cadillac lines. In 1990 Kolbenschmidt and Atsugi Unisia (Japan) formed a joint venture (60% Kolbenschmidt-owned) in Wisconsin to produce pistons for the North American auto market. The companies had shared technical expertise for a decade, and both hoped to double production capacity. Restructuring costs and weakened market conditions drove company profits down in the early 1990s. Kolbenschmidt was also hurt by vehicle makers' cost-cutting measures that reduced their number of suppliers and components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Metallgesellschaft decided to put its troubled Kolbenschmidt subsidiary on the market. While it had several suitors, UK engineering company T&amp;N proved to be the most tenacious. The sale never went through, however, and all T&amp;N could muster from its more than two years of bargaining was an option for 25% of the beleaguered Kolbenschmidt. Blocked by German cartel authorities, T&amp;N was forced to sit on its options and wait for an opportunity to buy up a controlling interest at a later date.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Rheinmetall stepped in for what would become another messy merger, one that would force two high-ranking executives to leave their respective companies. Rheinmetall planned to buy 25% of Kolbenschmidt and connect it with its Pierburg car parts division, but Kolbenschmidt balked and delayed talks. When the two companies came around to publicly announcing a merger, it seemed to be a done deal. Not so, as Kolbenschmidt cancelled the merger altogether. Rheinmetall then took an aggressive approach, raising its stake in Kolbenschmidt to 53.5%, thereby taking over the company in a boardroom coup. This caused the exit of Kolbenschmidt CEO Heinrich Binder; Pierburg's chief Wulf Warliz also left, apparently upset at how the takeover came off.
  </p>
  <p>
   A long time in the making, the merger finally became effective in 1998, and Kolbenschmidt Pierburg was in business. The new enterprise specialized in pistons and cylinder blocks (from the Kolbenschmidt side of the family) and air-fuel systems (from Pierburg). The following year Kolbenschmidt Pierburg bought US piston maker Zollner Pistons, which had more than 1,000 employees and about $120 million in revenue. The buy was strategically crucial for Kolbenschmidt Pierburg due to Zollner's position as a leading designer and manufacturer of pistons and power cylinder modules in NAFTA countries; it is also a major supplier to Ford, GM, Deere, and others.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Kolbenschmidt Pierburg set up a 50-50 joint venture with China's Shanghai Automobile Nonferrous Casting Plant to make and sell auto engine parts, pumps, steering parts, and cylinder heads. The venture is set to employ more than 1,100 workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Rheinmetall increased its ownership in Kolbenschmidt Pierburg from 85% to 92%. Later in the year, it acquired more shares, boosting its ownership to more than 95%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Texas Instruments Holland, the Dutch subsidiary of
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   , acquired Pierburg's mass air flow sensors business in mid-2005. (A year later, TI would sell its sensors and controls business to
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   , which named the business
   <company id="149685">
    Sensata Technologies
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 KS Kolben (the company's pistons division) acquired a plant in Mexico from DESC Automotive Group, the original equipment manufacturer unit of Pistones Moresa. In mid-2006 Pierburg opened its new factory in Brazil, and later in the year it established a new subsidiary in India.
