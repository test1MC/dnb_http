   Pegatron might not be a sibling of the Transformer character Megatron, but it is effective in transforming manufacturing contracts into money. The company is a contract manufacturer of components for computers, communications devices, and consumer electronics for a variety of companies that include
   <company id="12644">
    Apple Corp
   </company>
   . It make PCs, notebooks, smartphones, game consoles, and other devices. What's more, Pegatron is moving into new markets such as automotive information and entertainment systems and manufacturing automation systems. Pegatron has emerged as an alternative to
   <company id="149860">
    FoxConn
   </company>
   and other contract manufacturers. The company formed in 2008 when computer maker

  <p>
   Pegatron divides its operation into Design, Manufacturing and Service (DMS) and the Strategic Investment Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The DMS unit handles the design and manufacture of computer, communication, and consumer electronics' end products (3C Products, as Pegatron calls them), and provides after-sales service. The Strategic Investment Group works on the upstream and downstream chains, and includes strategic and other investments. As might be expected, DMS is Pegatron's cash cow, bringing in 92% of revenue with the rest coming from the investment arm.

  </p>
  <p>
   The company's manufacturing sites and service and repair stations are in its key geographic markets, Europe, North America, and Asia.

  <p>
   Making components for companies like Apple has enabled Pegatron to reach new revenue highs each year. It views its efforts in computing, consumer electronics, and communications as solid foundation as it moves into other areas where it expects growth. Key areas for the future are the internet of things, automation technology, manufacturing efficiency, and automotive infotainment systems.
