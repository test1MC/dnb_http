   The "D" in Dover could stand for diversity. Dover manages 35 companies that make equipment ranging from car wash systems to aerospace components. Dover operates in four segments: engineered systems (products for printing and identification, transportation, waste handling, and industrial markets) energy (extraction and handling of oil and gas); fluids (fluid handling products for retail fueling, oil and gas, chemical, and hygienic markets); and refrigeration and food equipment (systems and products serving the commercial refrigeration and food service industries). Dover traces its historical roots back to 1955.

   In 2014 Dover spun off its communications technologies operations (acoustic components, microphones, speakers, receivers, and transducers) into a new publicly traded company called
   <company id="163168">
    Knowles Corporation
   </company>
   . In conjunction with the move, Dover reorganized its business structure into four new segments.

  <p>
   It now operates through the segments of engineered systems (products for printing and identification, transportation, waste handling, and industrial markets); energy (extraction and handling of oil and gas); fluids (fluid handling products for oil and gas, chemical, and hygienic markets); and refrigeration and food equipment (systems and products serving the commercial refrigeration and food service industries).

  <p>
   Dover sells directly to customers as well as through a network of distributors. It caters to the supermarket industry, including big-box retail and convenience stores, the commercial/industrial refrigeration industry, institutional and commercial food service and food production markets, and beverage can-making industries.

  <p>
   Dover saw its revenues decline 10% from $7.75 billion in 2014 to $6.96 billion in 2015. Its profits climbed 12% from $775 million to $870 million during that same time period mainly due to cost savings realized as the result of restructuring programs and reduced discretionary spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by a 26% drop in energy sales due to lower organic revenue and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translations. This segment also experienced lower demand from customers as a result of the dramatic decrease in the price of oil in 2015 and a decline in the year-over-year average number of active drilling rigs in the US.

   Dover relies on a steady stream of divestitures and acquisitions as its principal means for growth. In 2015 Dover sold its Sargent Aerospace &amp; Defense unit, headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, to
   <company id="119022">
    RBC Bearings
   </company>
   for $500 million. It also divested its
   <company id="46954">
    Datamax O'Neil
   </company>
   unit, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, to
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   for $185 million that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Dover sold its
   <company id="118685">
    DEK Printing Machines
   </company>
   unit to
   <company id="145746">
    ASM Pacific Technology
   </company>
   , a Hong Kong listed company. Also that year, Dover spun off its former communications technologies segment (acoustic components, microphones, speakers, receivers, and transducers) into a new publicly traded company called
   <company id="163168">
    Knowles Corporation
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   In mid-2016, Dover agreed to acquire Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd, a global provider of fuel dispensing, payment, systems and aftermarket services for retail and commercial fuel stations, for $780 million. The deal should improve Dover's position within the growing global retail fueling market.

  <p>
   George Ohrstrom, a New York stockbroker, formed Dover in 1955 and took it public that year. Originally headquartered in Washington, DC, Dover consisted of four companies: C. Lee Cook (compressor seals and piston rings), Peerless (space-venting heaters), Rotary Lift (automotive lifts), and W.C. Norris (components for oil wells). In 1958 Dover made the first of many acquisitions and entered the elevator industry by buying Shepard Warner Elevator.
