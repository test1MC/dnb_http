   When it comes to its products, Tangerine Confectionery hopes its customers will be like kids in a candy store. One of the UK's largest privately-owned candy companies, Tangerine makes a variety of sweets, including toffees, licorices, fruit chews, bon-bons, hard candy, gum, and chocolate. Popular products include its Taveners Proper Sweets line, Princess Marshmallows, Barratt Dip Dabs, and Butterkist popcorn. Tangerine operates six British factories and sells primarily through large UK retailers like

  <p>
   Tangerine was formed in 2006 when Growth Capital Partners (not to be confused with Houston-based
   <company id="124775">
    Growth Capital Partners L.P.
   </company>
   ) invested in what was then a subsidiary of Danish candy-maker Toms Gruppen. The subsidiary's assets were combined with the confectionery division of biscuit-maker
   <company id="125685">
    Burtons Foods
   </company>
   to form Tangerine. Two years later, Tangerine doubled its profits when it acquired confectionery and popcorn company Monkhill from Cadbury for Â£58 million (about $90 million). The acquisition moved Tangerine up near the top of the UK's candy industry and made it one of the biggest non-chocolate candy makers in the country.
