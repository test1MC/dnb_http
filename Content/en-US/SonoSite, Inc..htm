   FUJIFILM SonoSite makes handheld ultrasonic imaging devices that health care providers can use outside of traditional imaging facilities -- for instance, in the ER, at a patient's bedside, or in the doctor's office. Its fourth- and fifth-generation systems include the handheld NanoMaxx tool and the M-Turbo and Edge portable consoles that produce imaging quality comparable to larger cart-based systems. Its S Series of products feature customized interfaces for different clinical applications, including the ER or the ICU. SonoSite also sells some earlier-generation products and accessories used with its products. SonoSite is owned by diversified imaging company
   <company id="41760">
    FUJIFILM Holdings.
   </company>

  <p>
   As part of FUJIFILM's medical equipment sector, SonoSite benefits from access to the parent company's global distribution network.
  </p>
  <p>
   SonoSite manufactures all of its finished products at facilities in Bothell, Washington, and Toronto, Canada; some product components such as screens and circuits are made by third parties. In addition to its hospital operations, the company also sells its handheld devices to the US military, which uses them at front-line hospitals and other military medical facilities. In all, SonoSite has more than 145 patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary FUJIFILM VisualSonics, based in Toronto, makes real-time, high-resolution micro-imaging systems for preclinical research. Its products are targeted towards the researchers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector as well as hospitals and universities performing research in cardiovascular, cancer, neurobiology, developmental biology, and other fields. The unit operates in more than 30 countries.

  <p>

  <p>
   SonoSite's historical strategy has been to take handheld ultrasound into medical areas where the technology has previously been unused, such as vascular access surgeries, emergency room care, and musculoskeletal procedures, as well as to expand its use in more traditional areas such as cardiovascular disease management, radiology, and obstetrics. The company has steadily augmented its offerings in all of these areas over the years through new product introduction and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent FUJIFILM plans to continue to develop innovative ultrasound products by combining SonoSite's technologies with its own advanced imaging capabilities. FUJIFILM also plans to utilize the combined companies' manufacturing and sales infrastructures to increase global market penetration of the SonoSite products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, subsidiary VisualSonics launched Vevo 3100, the first one-touch preclinical imaging platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, SonoSite partnered with Vivid Medical to promote the VividTrac Video Intubation device, a single-use, pocket-sized video device with a USB interface. The product provides clinicians with access to visualization technologies to reduce risk and contribute to more affordable health care. (Typically, video intubation has been reserved for only the most difficult cases.)

  <p>
   SonoSite got its start in the 1980s when the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   awarded its then-parent ATL Ultrasound with a grant to create a portable ultrasound system for use on the battlefield. ATL Ultrasound spun the unit off as a public company in 1998. FUJIFILM acquired SonoSite in 2012.
