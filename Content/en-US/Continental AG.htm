   Continental AG keeps rolling along as one of Europe's largest manufacturers of tires for cars, trucks, bicycles, and agricultural products. Its
   <company id="139869">
    Automotive Group
   </company>
   is Continental's largest segment, manufacturing brake and traction control systems, passive safety products, sensors, and chassis and powertrain products. The Rubber Group comprises its Tires division (sold under the Continental, Uniroyal, and General brands), as well as its ContiTech division, which produces vibration control and power transmission systems, as well as conveyor belts. Germany-based bearing and clutch manufacturer

  <p>
   Continental's Automotive Group generates about 60% of total sales each year, while its Rubber Group hauls in the remaining 40%. Automotive comprises the Interior, Chassis and Safety, and Powertrain segments. Each segment operates through about 80 to 90 locations in about 20 countries.

  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 4% from 2013 to 2014. The primary reason was a surge in the production of cars, station wagons, and light commercial vehicles combined with a more favorable vehicle mix. The growth in its automotive division was strongest in NAFTA and in Asia, particularly in China. Continental's net income also increased 24% from 2013 to 2014 due to the higher revenue volumes coupled with lower depreciation and amortization costs.

  <p>
   For its growth strategy, Continental has identified about 25 of the fastest growing automotive groups, including navigation systems, turbochargers, and systems used for reducing emissions. The decision to diversify product lines is also part of the company's strategy to keep its dependence on the automotive industry in check by generating additional sales in industries other than automotive. Continental also intends to tighten its grip in emerging markets in Asia, where it already generates about 20% of its total sales. Throughout 2005, it additionally announced initiatives to expand its tire research and development capabilities in both China and Bangalore.

   In 2015 Continental bought US-based rubber and plastics maker Veyance Technologies from financial investment firm Carlyle for about EUR 1.4 billion (or US $1.9 billion). The company will integrate Veyance into its ContiTech division.

  <p>
   A group of financiers and industrialists with interests in the rubber industry founded Continental-Caoutchouc und Gutta-Percha Compagnie in Hanover, Germany, in 1871. The company's products included solid tires for carriages and bicycles, rubberized fabrics, and various consumer items.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1892 Continental was the first German maker of pneumatic bicycle tires. During this period the budding automobile and motorcycle industries created fresh demand for solid tires. Continental began producing pneumatic tires for automobiles in 1898. By 1904 Continental was first to develop a treaded tire. Between 1905 and 1913 Continental expanded into Australia, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Romania, Sweden, and the UK by forming marketing subsidiaries. However, the onset of WWI caused a shift to military production and the overseas sales network dissolved.
  </p>
  <p>
   Poor overall economic conditions atrophied postwar tire industry growth, and by the late 1920s the company merged several German rubber firms to create a much larger and stronger Continental. In 1929 the company changed its name to Continental Gummi-Werke AG.
