   Post-merger, the company's strategy is to develop new products to serve the changing demographics of the Japanese population (low birth-rate and consequent increase in the age of the population). In addition, due to the lessening of family ties and continued urbanization of the populace, it will develop products that reflect the changing life-styles of the Japanese. It also hopes utilize the synergies of combined business resources, manufacturing technologies, quality analysis, pharmaceutical research, marketing techniques, and diverse sales channels.

   The company is also working to expand products for China, the world's largest market. In 2014 it opened a new ice cream plant in Guangzhou to produce ice cream and frozen novelties, some based on Japanese favorites (sweet red bean and green tea), others made for Chinese consumers (sweetened condensed milk and ice cream fruit cups.)
