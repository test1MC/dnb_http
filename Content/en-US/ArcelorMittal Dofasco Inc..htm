        <p>
   ArcelorMittal Dofasco was created in 1912, when C.W. Sherman founded the Dominion Steel Casting Company to manufacture castings for Canadian railways. Later named the Dominion Foundries and Steel&#160; Company (the origins of the&#160;Dofasco moniker), the company merged with its subsidiary, Hamilton Steel Wheel Company, in 1917. The name was officially changed to Dofasco in 1980.
