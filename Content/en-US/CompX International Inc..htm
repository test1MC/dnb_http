   CompX International tries to keep the workday smooth, theft-free, and painless. Through CompX's three operating divisions -- security products, furniture components, and marine components -- the company makes ball bearing slides, cabinet locks, and ergonomic computer support systems. The company's primary customers are office furniture makers, but its components are used in recreational marine vehicles, ignition systems, vending equipment, mailboxes, appliances, and computer equipment. CompX International believes that it is a North American market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms. The company is majority-owned by

   CompX International is a diversified manufacturer of engineered, quality components and operates through three business segments: CompX Security Products, CompX Furniture Components, and CompX Marine.

CompX International makes disc tumbler locks for moderate security, KeSet brand pin tumbler locks for higher security, and eLock electronic locks for high security drug storage. eLock offers data capabilities that map entries and exits. The Furniture Components segment creates slides for use with ATMs, refrigerators, and imaging equipment.

   A majority of CompX International's component sales are direct to large OEM customers through its factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers' representatives.

        <p>
   An improving economy has translated into an improved bottom line for CompX International. The 3% increase in the company's net sales in 2011 was primarily due to improved sales in the Security Products segment. Security Products experienced a significant increase in sales to customers in the leisure transportation industry as well as improved customer order rates and new specific customer projects. Furniture Components' net sales were boosted by $1.9 million in sales relating to the 2011 acquisition of an ergonomics component products business. The increase in sales was fully offset by a decrease in sales of other ergonomics component products due to a drop in customer projects associated with lower government spending.
  </p>
        <p>
   The 151% spike in CompX International's net income was the result of higher revenues outpacing operating costs and expenses, which remained flat in 2011.
