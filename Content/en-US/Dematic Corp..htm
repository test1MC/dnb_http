   The company's growth plan involves increasing its market share in North America. In 2015 the company indirectly acquired a majority stake in SDI Group Limited, a UK-based supplier of garment on hanger and flat sorter technology in Europe. The purchase will expand Dematic's global order fulfillment offerings in the apparel, retail, and e-commerce markets.

   In the fall of 2013, the company obtained Montana-based Upturn Solutions, a provider of computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) designed for distribution, manufacturing, and warehouse environments. Upturn enhanced Dematic's capability into distribution center workflow, asset and inventory management, and preventative maintenance. The deal also enhanced its ability to deliver robust order fulfillment products for diversified markets such as e-commerce, retail, apparel, health care, 3PL, food, beverage, parcel, and manufacturing.
