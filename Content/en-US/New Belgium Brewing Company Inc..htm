   The New Belgium Brewing Co. has pedaled its way to success. The third-largest craft brewer in the US by sales, the company traces its origin to a bike ride through Belgium that inspired company founder Jeff Lebesch to start the business and create its flagship beer, Fat Tire ale. The Colorado brewery, which produces and sells more than 790,000 barrels of beer annually, also makes Blue Paddle, Sunshine Wheat, and Trippel IPA. New Belgium makes brews under the Lips of Faith name, as well, in funky flavors Biere de Mars, Cocoa Molé Ale, Fresh Hop, Prickly Passion, and Super Cru. Its seasonal selection includes Red Hoptober, Dig, and Somersault. Employee-owned New Belgium distributes its beers nationwide.

        <p>
   The company distributes its beer in more than 35 states, practically in every region but the Northeast and half of the Deep South. For now, all of New Belgium's beers are brewed in Fort Collins, Colorado; a second brewery in Asheville, North Carolina, is under construction.

        <p>
   Like other companies that make and sell beers, New Belgium sells its products to retailers through a dealer network. Its materials are delivered to the brewery by truck, with some getting a ride by boat or rail before being loaded onto trucks.

   New Belgium attributes its success to its "whimsical approach to business," and the fact that sales of craft brews are accelerating. Indeed, volume share for craft brewers has risen from 4.4% in 2009 to nearly 8% in 2013, representing a $14.3 billion market. The company sponsors quirky events, such as a bicycle race called the Tour De Fat, as well as scavenger hunts (on bikes) called Urban Assault Rides and drive-in movies for two-wheelers, Bike-In Cinema, held every summer on the front lawn of the brewery. New Belgium also gives employees ownership in the company along with a new bike to mark their one-year anniversary with the company.

   Key to the company's growth is market expansion. Indeed, during the past six years, New Belgium has averaged about 10% annual growth in number of barrels produced. In 2014 the company began distributing its beer in Mississippi, after debuting in Alaska, Louisiana, and Florida in 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   New Belgium is developing an East Coast brewery site in Asheville, North Carolina, that's due for completion in late 2015. Indeed, Asheville trumped Philadelphia as a possible site. The future brewery will produce an estimated 500,000 barrels a year and will allow the company to distribute its beers on the East Coast.
