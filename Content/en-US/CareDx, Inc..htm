   Rejection hurts, but organ transplant rejection hurts worse, and CareDx wants to help. The company makes tests that monitor cellular rejection in heart and kidney transplant patients. Its FDA-approved AlloMap test measures gene expression in patients' blood samples to determine if a transplanted heart has been accepted. The company believes its tests will help reduce costs by decreasing the number of biopsies and drug therapies often used in evaluating transplants in patients. CareDx is also working on the development of AlloMap for kidney transplant patients, and it has other molecular (gene-based) diagnostic research programs in areas such as immunology. Founded in 1998, the company went public in 2014.

  <p>
   CareDx in July 2014 went public with an offering worth $40 million (far below its original target of $50 million). The company filed to go public once before, but withdrew the offering, which aimed to raise up to $86 million, in 2008. Proceeds from the 2014 IPO will be used for research and development and, if all goes well, sales and marketing activities to support the launch and commercialization of new products.

   The molecular diagnostics company reported $22.1 million in sales in 2013, an 8% increase versus 2012. The gain was driven by a 10% rise in testing revenue due to a 21% increase in year-over-year testing volume. Collaboration and license revenue, which accounts for a small fraction of total revenue, declined by 41%. 2013 was another unprofitable year for the company, which reported losses on $5.1 million and $3.5 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

   The company's AlloMap test for heart patients was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in mid-2008 and is now in the commercialization phase in the US, with plans for international expansion in the second half of 2014. The price per AlloMap test is high (around $3,000), and some of the company's success will be determined by the number of insurers who agree to reimburse for its use. CareDx is looking to expand its sales and marketing base, as well as its research operations. The company hopes to develop similar tests for the transplant of other organs.

   In late 2008 the company announced that it would restructure its business to focus on the heart transplant market. Other areas of its research (lung transplants, autoimmune disorders) were placed on hold or offered up for collaboration with other researchers. Luckily at least one of its programs was quickly picked up for collaboration: in early 2009 XDx signed an agreement with

   (BMS) to research biomarkers to diagnose lupus and other immune disorders. BMS will also use the work to support its development of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia.
