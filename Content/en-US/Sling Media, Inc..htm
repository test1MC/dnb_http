   Sling Media has a cure for anyone who suffers from separation anxiety when they're away from television too long. The company's Slingbox allows viewers to watch their home televisions from a computer or mobile device. The Slingbox, which looks like any set-top box, is compatible with cable and satellite broadcast services, as well as digital video recorders. For mobile devices, the SlingPlayer Mobile is compatible with

   customers. (EchoStar is a former subsidiary of DISH).
