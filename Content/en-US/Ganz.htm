   Stuffed animals and their virtual lives are big business for Ganz Canada. It makes popular tween toy Webkinz and runs its related website, where kids register to take care of their pets online. The company has expanded its Webkinz distribution beyond the specialty store niche to mass merchants, such as

   Limited Too. Ganz also manufactures bath and body collections, candles, home and garden accent products, purses, photo albums, and other products.

   Called the next Beanie Baby with a virtual twist, Webkinz has targeted the pre-teen set, which is generating the most sales. Its Webkinz online world can be accessed using a code found on the stuffed animal toy. (With demand high, some retailers have found that enterprising kids were tearing off the tags in order to gain entry to the website.) On the site, users can set up a room for their virtual pet; they must remember to feed and care for the pet, whose health, hunger, and happiness is measured on a posted scale. Users also can interact with other Webkinz pet owners on a limited basis.

  <p>
   Despite the private firm's vast products portfolio, Ganz is banking on its Webkinz business for its bread and butter as it works to extend its reach into other areas for product and sales diversity.
