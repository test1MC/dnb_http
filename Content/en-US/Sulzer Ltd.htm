   Switzerland's Sulzer serves the industrial machinery needs of customers in hydrocarbon processing, power generation, and oil and gas, among other markets. The company develops and supplies centrifugal pumps (Sulzer Pumps), surfacing technology products and specialized machining services (Sulzer Metco), components and services for separation and mixing technology (Sulzer Chemtech), and maintenance and repair services for rotating equipment, such as turbomachinery, generators, and motors (Sulzer Turbo Services). The company also conducts contract R&amp;D through its Sulzer Innotec division. It has more than 160 locations worldwide. Europe, followed by North America and Asia, are its largest markets.

  <p>
   Salomon Sulzer set up the first Sulzer company, a brass foundry, in the town of Winterthur, Switzerland (near Zurich), in the 1770s. His son, Johann, built on this business, serving neighboring villages with such items as saucepans and bells and providing pumps to saltworks both at home and abroad. With his own sons, Johann and Salomon, Johann Sr. established a cast-iron foundry in 1834 and named the company to run it Gebrüder Sulzer (Sulzer Brothers).
  </p>
  <p>
   When the company built a new foundry in 1839, it used a steam engine for the first time to power bellows. Steam engines soon became a major product. In addition to meeting the strong demand for engines, Sulzer began producing rock drills, metal pipes, tanks, refrigeration equipment, and heating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1885 the company opened its first plant outside Winterthur, in Germany. By 1914, when Sulzer was incorporated as a public company, the diversified manufacturer had sales offices in seven countries. WWI propelled the sale of diesel engines, which Sulzer produced for both the Japanese and US navies. Between the wars, it expanded into compressors, turbines, railways, and ship propellers. During the Depression, it began making industrial weaving machines and gas turbines.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Sulzer set up subsidiaries in Austria, Brazil, Norway, and South Africa. It acquired Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works in 1961, and by 1963 Sulzer was also the world's #1 maker of low-speed marine diesel engines. It moved into medical implants during the 1960s after Swiss surgeons needed an alloy for hip replacements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Sulzer formed a weaving machine venture with
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   in Japan and set up pump plants in Brazil, the Netherlands, South Africa, and West Germany. That decade the company was one of the first to use computerized and automated production processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 Sulzer began restructuring and focused on three core businesses: construction services, such as air conditioning and refrigeration; weaving machines; and medical engineering. It acquired Intermedics Group in 1989 as part of a series of acquisitions to boost its medical technology business. Sulzer sold its diesel engine business in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a slump in the textile machinery industry, the company invested heavily in its other businesses, particularly in medical technology. In 1994 Sulzer formed Sulzer Metco by taking over Metco from US-based Perkin-Elmer (later
   <company id="11167">
    Applied Biosystems
   </company>
   and now
   <company id="58766">
    Life Technologies
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, depressed markets in the mid-1990s led to another restructuring and the sale of assets. In 1996 the company sold its Chemtech environmental technology unit and spun off its ELMA business. A year later Sulzer reorganized as Sulzer Corporation, a holding company with two major groups: medical technology and industrial units. That year Sulzer Medica (which went public in 1996) acquired orthopedic prosthesis distributor Italpro, Swiss firm Synos Medical (trauma products), and Friatec (arthroscopics). In 1998 Sulzer Medica acquired US orthopedics firm SpineTech.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Sulzer Hydro business in 1999. By acquiring Finland-based Ahlstrom Pumps in 2000, Sulzer became a top maker of pumps for the pulp and paper industry. It also began a major restructuring that year to focus on its medical devices and surface and materials technology businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sulzer agreed to spin off Sulzer Medica after being threatened by Swiss corporate raider René Braginsky and his InCentive Capital firm. In 2001 shareholders rejected Braginsky's effort to sack the board of directors, and InCentive dropped its bid to take over the company. The spinoff of Sulzer Medica was completed in July of that year. (In 2002 Sulzer Medica changed its name to Centerpulse and was acquired by
   <company id="103803">
    Zimmer Holdings
   </company>
   in 2003.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The realigned and refocused Sulzer Ltd. started growing its US presence in the pump market with its June 2002 acquisition of Centriflo Pump and Machine Company of Odessa, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sulzer acquired Germany thermal coating manufacturer OSU Maschinenbau GmbH in 2004 in efforts to bolster its product range in thermal coatings (adding arc spray equipment to its wide array of products). The company also acquired the US pump business of
   <company id="14463">
    Precision Castparts
   </company>
   in late 2004. The purchase included the pump brands Johnston, Crown, and Paco, with facilities in Texas and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2005 Sulzer acquired Cana-Tex International, a Houston-based firm, and added the business to Sulzer Chemtech, widening the unit's capabilities in the area of specialized tower field services. The company gave up its search for investors in Sulzer Hexis, its solid-oxide fuel cell venture; the business was sold to a Swiss foundation and an independent venture, Hexis AG, began operations at the outset of 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sulzer Pumps sold the Paco pump brand to
   <company id="59704">
    Grundfos Group
   </company>
   in early 2006. That year Sulzer Chemtech acquired three Swiss firms -- Mold, Mixpac, and Werfo -- for about $169 million, adding to its portfolio of static mixers for the dental and industrial markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Sulzer divested its real estate business Sulzer Real Estate Ltd. to focus on its other four main divisions.
