   Ericsson opens all lines of communication. The world's leading maker of mobile broadband infrastructure gear provides the equipment that telecom carriers use to build and expand their networks. The company also provides wireline broadband, metro area Ethernet, LTE modems, and optical transport equipment. Its services unit handles operations ranging from systems integration to network deployment and management. Ericsson's multimedia arm provides content-related products, including Internet television systems. The company traces its roots back to 1876, when Lars Magnus Ericsson opened up a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm.

  <p>
   Ericsson's core business comprises three segments: networks, global services, and support solutions. The networks segment, which accounts for just more than half of the company's sales, develops and deploys the latest generation of mobile broadband networks (LTE) and maintains and refines older networks (GSM, WCDMA, etc.) for its network operator customers. The segment also provides equipment for Internet protocol (IP), microwave transport, and core networks, including IP routers, core routers and switches, cables and interconnect products, microwave radio links, optical transport components, radio base stations, and wireline network access equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Serving network operators, Ericsson's professional services segment supports its customers network operations through its consulting, customer support, network design and integration, and training services.  The segment also offers managed services like application hosting and network operations. The growing professional services unit is supported by four global service centers in India, China, Mexico, and Romania. The services segment accounts for about 43% of the company's net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's multimedia support solutions segment offers software for consumer-facing applications, including mobile and Internet television, messaging, and music, as well as billing support systems for telecommunications network operators. About 6% of sales come through solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
   For 2014 Ericsson's revenue was flat and profit dropped 8% from 2013 levels. Sales growth in China, the Middle East, and India was offset by lower sales in North America (the company's biggest market) and Japan, where several larger mobile broadband coverage projects were completed. Reported sales for segments Networks and Global Services were flat compared with 2013, while Support Solutions reported sales grew by 3%. Net income fell as operating costs and finance expenses rose.

   Ericsson has focused on building its broadband network equipment and services businesses and expanding geographically. The company strengthened its operations in India in a deal with Tata Sky, the leading direct-to-the-home (DTH) telecom in India. Ericsson's AVP 4000 System Encoder will deliver Sky Tata content to homes through its video compression platform. Tata Sky will be able to increase the number of channels it offers and the viewing quality. In Africa, Ericsson will manage Smile Communications' LTE operations in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Ericsson will provide localization and customization of Volvo ITS4Mobility intelligent transportation system in Latin America.

   In 2013 semiconductor manufacturer
   <company id="42481">

   (ST) sold its stake in
   <company id="159888">
    ST-Ericsson
   </company>
   , a now-dissolved joint venture with Ericsson. The two companies split the joint venture's assets, with Ericsson taking over the development and sales of the newer LTE multimedia thin modems (which complement its mobile broadband business) and ST taking a portion of the existing ST-Ericsson modem product line. Other assets, including a global navigation satellite system, were sold to third parties.

   As the top company in its industry, Ericsson is the target of its competitors. The proposed union of
   <company id="41751">
    Lucent-Alcatel
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   could strengthen their operations.
   <company id="59788">
    Huawei

   , based in China, is another formidable competitor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 4Q 2015, Ericsson entered into a strategic partnership with
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   , the leading maker of networking equipment. The companies intend to cooperate to develop products and services in areas such as 5G, cloud computing, Internet protocol, and the Internet of Things. Their goal is to add $1 billion in revenue for each company by 2018. The companies will cooperate on developing networks through reference architectures and joint development, systems-based management and control, a broad reseller agreement, and collaboration in key emerging market segments. Cisco's networking capabilities and increasing development of networking software should complement Ericsson's telecom strengths. It should also strengthen Ericsson in its competition with Lucent-Alcatel-Nokia and Huawei.

  <p>
   Ericsson has been making acquisitions to shore up some areas of its technology offerings and to expand further into areas where it already has strength.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Ericsson bought a majority stake in Apcera, the US-based developer of the Continuum platform as-a-service (PaaS) product. The acquisition was designed to strengthen Ericsson in the cloud market by extending the company's network approach into operator and enterprise cloud.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the acquisition of another US company, Azuki Systems, a provider of TV Anywhere delivery platforms, Ericsson adds to its TV and media portfolio. The acquisition should help Ericsson add functions and quality to its video-related services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fabrix Systems, a provider of cloud storage, computing and network delivery for video applications that Ericsson acquired in 2014, adds a cloud-based and computing platform to optimize media storage, processing, and delivery applications such as cloud DVR and video-on-demand expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition of MetraTech Corp., a provider of metadata-based billing, commerce and settlement software, builds on Ericsson's expertise in billing and expands its presence in the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   Lars Magnus Ericsson opened a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm in 1876, the same year Alexander Graham Bell applied for a US patent on the telephone. Within two years Ericsson was making telephones. His company grew rapidly, supplying equipment first to Swedish phone companies and later to other European companies. In 1885 Ericsson crafted a combination receiver-speaker in one handset.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1911 Ericsson and SAT, the Stockholm telephone company, merged under the Ericsson banner. The company adopted its present name in 1926. In 1930 international financier Ivar "The Match King" Kreuger, owner of the Swedish Match Co., won control of Ericsson. His triumph was short-lived. Krueger committed suicide in 1932 and one of his creditors, Sosthenes Behn's ITT, took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITT in 1960 sold its interest in Ericsson to the top Swedish industrialist family, the Wallenbergs. In 1975 Ericsson introduced its computer-controlled exchange, called AXE. Buoyed by AXE's success, the company unveiled the "office of the future" in the early 1980s, diversifying into computers and office furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Ericsson's timing was off: The demand for office automation never materialized and profits plunged.
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   chairman Hans Werthen was recruited to split his time between the two companies and rescue Ericsson. The company sold its computer business to
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   in 1988 and refocused on telephone equipment. It dusted off its aging AXE system for the burgeoning cellular market and quickly won key contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company and aircraft maker
   <company id="99192">
    Saab
   </company>
   merged their military aviation electronics operations as Ericsson Saab Avionics in 1996. (It was dissolved in 1998.) In 1998 manager Sven-Christer Nilsson was appointed CEO. He reorganized the company and laid off 14,000 workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Ericsson fought bitterly with rival
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   over wireless standards and patents, the companies settled in 1999, agreeing to push for the standardization of third-generation technology based on QUALCOMM's code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology. As a part of the deal, Ericsson purchased QUALCOMM's infrastructure business. To expand its Internet offerings, Ericsson bought Internet router maker Torrent and Internet telephony company Touchwave.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 Nilsson was pushed out for moving too slowly on restructuring plans and was replaced as CEO by chairman Lars Ramqvist, who put many of the duties on president Kurt Hellström. Hellström immediately set out to simplify the company's managerial and accounting structure, trim its workforce and slow-growth businesses, and push new phone models to market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Ericsson sold noncore businesses, including its private radio systems, power supply, and equipment shelter operations. The company also agreed to develop a standard for secure wireless transactions with Nokia and Motorola and formed a joint venture with Web router maker
   <company id="54603">
    Juniper Networks
   </company>
   to sell routers for mobile Internet applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fierce competition, an industrywide slowdown in handset sales, and manufacturing glitches led Ericsson to outsource the manufacture of its phones to
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics
   </company>
   and form a joint venture (
   <company id="103887">
    Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
   </company>
   ) with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   to link the development and marketing of their handsets in 2001. Ericsson also sold its direct enterprise sales and service unit, outsourced IT operations in Europe to Electronic Data Systems (which later became
   <company id="41915">
    HP Enterprise Services
   </company>
   ), and cut more than 20,000 jobs that year. Hellström became CEO in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman Ramqvist became honorary chairman in 2002; Electrolux CEO Michael Treschow was named as the acting chairman. Ericsson announced 20,000 more layoffs in 2002. That year the company sold its semiconductor unit to
   <company id="58590">
    Infineon
   </company>
   for about $380 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ericsson sold its optoelectronic components business in 2003. Hellström retired later that year and Carl-Henric Svanberg, former CEO of
   <company id="56145">
    Assa Abloy
   </company>
   , was appointed as company president and CEO. In 2005 Ericsson acquired certain telecom hardware assets from troubled Marconi (later renamed
   <company id="41750">
    telent
   </company>
   ), for about $2.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired seven companies in 2007, the largest of which were
   <company id="59416">
    Redback Networks
   </company>
   ($1.9 billion) and
   <company id="107138">
    TANDBERG Television
   </company>
   ($1.4 billion). The Redback buy gained Ericsson broadband IP routers, while the TANDBERG Television purchase brought software and services for the cable television market. It also picked up fiber-access technology company
   <company id="108985">
    Entrisphere
   </company>
   in an effort to expand its broadband access offerings in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to broaden its multimedia offerings, the company purchased Mobeon, a Swedish provider of IP-based voice and video mail. Other 2007 acquisitions included German customer care software provider LHS, Swedish mobile service deliver platform developer Drutt, and Spanish IPTV specialist HyC. In an effort to refocus its multimedia operations on key areas such as service delivery and provisioning, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX products business to
   <company id="107007">
    Aastra Technologies
   </company>
   for about $100 million in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its North American business, Ericsson bought bankrupt Nortel Network's CDMA and LTE-based wireless business there in 2009 for $1.1 billion. The deal significantly boosted its profile as a provider of mobile networking gear to wireless carriers on the continent. The company's other acquisitions that year complemented its manufacturing and services activities. These purchases included the manufacturing operations of Estonian electronics maker
   <company id="118041">
    Elcoteq
   </company>
   , as well as Turkish systems integrator Bizitek.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 EVP/CFO Hans Vestberg took over as president and CEO of Ericsson, succeeding Carl-Henric Svanberg, who resigned to become chairman of
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
