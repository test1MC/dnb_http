   If it's good enough for the Queen Mum, it's good enough for you. When Queen Elizabeth II's late mater, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, needed a new hip, her doctors used one made by JRI Orthopaedics (JRI). The company designs and manufactures  orthopaedic implants for joint replacement (including hips, shoulders, and knees)  that it distributes globally under trade names Furlong and Vaios. JRI also sells surgical instruments and repair devices needed for implanting and maintaining its products. The company is wholly owned by charitable organization Orthopaedic Research UK.

  <p>
   JRI operates a modern facility in Sheffield, where it houses manufacturing, research, product development, marketing, customer service, and warehousing and distribution activities. It also has locations in Norway, Sweden, Spain, and Italy.

  <p>
   JRI's surgical portfolio includes upper limb products, lower limb products and orthobiologics (biomaterials used in bone replacement surgical procedures under the brands RegenOss, ENGIpore, SINTlife, Repros, VacuumAid and Biomimetics).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's flagship cementless prosthesis product, the Furlong HAC total hip replacement, was launched in 1985 and named for founder Furlong. It was designed to be totally compatible with bone. By coating the mineral hydroxy-apatite onto artificial joint shafts, a patient's own bone could then penetrate the prosthesis and become joined together after three months.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides its own manufactured products, JRI distributes two biomimetic products (imitating nature or a natural process): TriboFit Acetabular Buffer components used for joint reconstruction and made by Active Implants Corporation and MaioRegen Osteochondral scaffolds (which mimic osteo-cartilaginous tissue) made by Finceramica.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company introduced its Vaios shoulder replacement system (not to be confused with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   's Vaio!). The name stands for Versatile, Anatomic, Inverse Optimized, and Stable.
  </p>
  <p>
   To benefit research in orthopaedic science, JRI presents annual gift aid donations from its profits to Orthopaedic Research UK, which was founded by Ronald Furlong under the name Furlong Research Charitable Foundation in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   JRI was founded in 1970 by orthopedic surgeon Ronald Furlong, first importing hip replacement prostheses from Switzerland and later moving on to making products in-house.
