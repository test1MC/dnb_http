   Like the rest of the publishing world, the company has been focusing on the digital front to offset the declining sales of physical books. It has been selling entire books to consumers directly online, placing it in competition with other book retailers.

  <p>
   In 1925 Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer bought the Modern Library, a publishing imprint specializing in classic literature. Two years later the pair expanded their publishing activities and, to reflect the breadth of their publishing goals, named their company Random House. Through the 1930s Random House expanded into juvenile literature and began publishing reference works in 1947 with the
   <i>
    American College Dictionary.
   </i>
   The company went public in 1959. In 1960 Cerf approached rival publisher Alfred A. Knopf about buying his eponymous imprint. To cement the deal, Cerf promised Knopf complete independence within the organization, beginning a tradition of inter-competition between Random House's units.

   Media and electronics giant RCA bought the company in 1965. Random House continued to grow, acquiring Ballantine Books in 1973. However, RCA struggled as it diversified through the 1970s and finally sold the publishing operation to
   <company id="40006">
    Advance Publications
   </company>
   in 1980. Random House expanded its publishing reach through acquisitions of Fawcett Books (1982), Times Books (1984), Fodor's Travel Guides (1986), and Crown Publishing (1988). It branched into electronic publishing in 1993 when it bought the electronic publishing division of Bantam Doubleday Dell.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its growth, however, Random House was failing to turn a profit for Advance, and in 1998 it was sold to
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   for a reported $1.2 billion. Bertelsmann combined its other US publishing unit, Bantam Doubleday Dell, under the Random House banner. Peter Olson, who had run Bantam Doubleday for the German media giant, became chairman and CEO of the enlarged enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Random House bought a minority stake in Xlibris, a print-on-demand publisher. (Xlibris was sold to
   <company id="159553">
    Author Solutions
   </company>
   in 2009.) It also launched an online electronic book imprint, AtRandom. The next year Bertelsmann reorganized all of its book publishing activities under the Random House banner, moving its book clubs to a new division. Olson became the first American to sit on Bertelsmann's supervisory board. The company scored a publishing coup in 2001 with a deal to publish former President Bill Clinton's memoirs for more than $10 million, the most ever paid for a non-fiction book. Random House later joined Classic Media to buy bankrupt publisher Golden Books Family Entertainment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was dealt a blow by the courts when it could not get an injunction against RosettaBooks, a company selling digital versions of books first published by Random House. Responding to the lack of demand for electronic books, the company cancelled its AtRandom e-book imprint in 2001. The following year Random House settled its lawsuit against RosettaBooks, agreeing to let the upstart publish electronic version of books in exchange for an advance and a royalty paid to the author and publisher.

   In 2003 the company bought the Ullstein Heyne List paperback book group from
   <company id="51022">
    Axel Springer Verlag
   </company>
   . Expanding its presence in the Asian market, Random House entered a joint venture with major Japanese publisher Kodansha in 2003 to translate Random House titles into Japanese and to translate Japanese titles internationally. A similar arrangement was made with a Korean publishing company. In 2005 Random House acquired the publishing operations of Germany-based Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH.
  </p>

   Random House author James Frey was the center of controversy after it was revealed in 2006 that he had lied in his best-selling memoir,
   <em>
    A Million Little Pieces,
   </em>
   which Oprah Winfrey had selected for inclusion in her book club. Following the uproar, Random House and Frey agreed to refund readers who signed statements saying they would not have bought the book if they knew that certain facts had been changed. The legal settlement was called unprecedented by the publishing community.
  </p>
  <p>
   Markus Dohle replaced Perter Olson as CEO in 2008. Olson was pushed out after less than stellar financial results at Random House.  Later that year Dohle oversaw the elimination of the company's Doubleday and Bantam divisions, their imprints absorbed by Random House's other divisions. The move effectively merged the company's divisions from six into four. The following year two Random House divisions -- Crown Publishing Group and the Knopf Doubleday Group -- announced a number of layoffs across various departments as the company saw sales decline during the economic recession.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company hoped to bolster its catalog with the purchase of Ten Speed Press, a California publisher of nonfiction titles, for an undisclosed price. Among Speed Press's most successful titles are Mollie Katzen's
   <em>
    The Moosewood Cookbook
   </em>
   and Richard Nelson Bolles's job hunting book
   <em>
    What Color is Your Parachute?
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Random House owes a big thanks to Dan Brown (author of
   <em>
    Da Vinci Code
   </em>
   ), whose
   <em>
    The Lost Symbol
   </em>
   broke one-day sales records, selling more than 1 million copies in the US, Canada, and the UK when it was released in 2009. The book ended up being the world's biggest-selling fiction title for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company released a hit in 2010 with
   <em>
    The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo
   </em>
   by Random House author Stieg Larsson; the title was part of Larsson's
   <em>
    Millennium
   </em>
   trilogy that sold more than 15 million copies in the US and Germany that year.
