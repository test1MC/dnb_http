   Chart Industries is charting its own miracle on ice campaign. The company designs equipment for low-temperature hydrocarbon and industrial gas production and storage, including cryogenic systems that can operate near absolute zero. Chart vessels can process, liquefy, store, and transport gases, which are marketed to petrochemical and natural gas processors, industrial gas producers, satellite testing companies, and restaurants and convenience stores. The company also offers engineered bulk gas installations and makes specialty liquid nitrogen end-use equipment used in the hydrocarbon processing and industrial gas industries.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Garfield Heights, Ohio, Chart has about 45 domestic operations located across the US and an international presence in Asia, Australia, and Europe. Although Chart products are sold worldwide, the US generates about 50% of sales.

  <p>
   The company operates through three chief segments: energy and chemicals (32% of sales); distribution and storage (49%); and biomedical (19%).
  </p>
  <p>
   The majority of Chart's products -- including vacuum insulated containment vessels, heat exchangers, cold boxes, and other cryogenic components -- are used throughout the liquid gas supply chain for the purification, liquefaction, distribution, storage and end-use of hydrocarbon, and industrial gases.

  <p>
   Chart's primary customers are large, multinational producers and distributors of hydrocarbon and industrial gases and their suppliers. It sells its products and services to more than 2,000 customers around the globe. Around 47% of the company's sales stemmed from the energy industry in 2014.

  <p>
   Chart has achieved significant growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $1.2 billion and profits reaching almost $82 million in 2014. The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years, however; after declining in 2013, cash flow increased 99% to $119 million in 2014, due to a decrease in accounts receivable largely driven by the energy and chemical and biomedical segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was due to volume increases in small to mid-scale LNG and petrochemical projects within its energy and chemicals segment. The revenue increase was offset by a decrease in sales of respiratory therapy products and commercial oxygen generation products within biomedical. Distribution and storage sales also fell by 2% due to a shortage in bulk industrial gas applications. In addition, revenues from China declined due to shortfalls across all product lines throughout 2014.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have helped maintain the momentum of its distribution and storage business, now the company's largest in sales. Chart has specifically cast an eye towards expanding the segment's footprint in China. In 2014 Chart acquired the brazed aluminum heat exchanger (BAHX) business belonging to Wuxi City Zhongbo Heat Exchanger Co., Ltd in order to augment its energy and chemical segment. The deal included the construction of a newly built BAHX manufacturing and cold box fabrication facility in Wuxi, China. Chart's existing cold box fabrication facility in Changzhou, China, will be integrated into the new facility in Wuxi, which will open up more capacity for Chart's distribution and storage LNG business in Changzhou.

  <p>
   In 1986 Arthur Holmes teamed up with his brother Charles to purchase ALTEC International, a struggling maker of brazed aluminum heat exchangers that dated to 1949. The brothers turned ALTEC around and used it to acquire undervalued companies. From 1986 to 1991, they purchased storage and transportation equipment for liquefied gases and high-pressure cryogenic equipment, including Greenville Tube Corporation (stainless steel tubing, 1987); Process Engineering, Inc. (cryogenic tanks, 1990); and Process Systems International (cold boxes, 1991). The Holmes brothers finally established a public holding company in 1992, and named it Chart Industries (for CHarles and ARThur).
