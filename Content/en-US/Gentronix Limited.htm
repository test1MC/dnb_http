   Gentronix is a biotechnology company that provides pharmaceutical makers with drug development products and monitoring services. Gentronix's products and services are geared toward helping drug discovery scientists speed up pre-clinical research and development. The company's main products are GreenScreen HC and BlueScreen HC. GreenScreen HC uses cellular biosensor technology to test potential pharmaceutical compounds for genotoxicity (DNA damage) and cytotoxicity (general cellular damage). BlueScreen HC is based on GreenScreen technology, however, in place of GFP, BlueScreen utilizes a luciferase from the marine copepod
   <em>
    Gaussia princeps
   </em>
   to generate a luminscent output.

  <p>
   Gentronix also offers comprehensive testing for a portfolio of genotoxicity and other predictive toxicology assays. Also, a number of Contract Research Organizations (CROs) in both the US and UK offer GreenScreen HC and BlueScreen HC services for customers who can't contact Gentronix themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also added GreenScreen GC to its line-up. GreenScreen GC is a yeast cell based assay for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity screening.  The assay employs a genetically engineered brewer's yeast strain,
   <i>
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   </i>
   , which hosts a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene reporter system to detect the up regulation of the DNA repair gene RAD54.   As a result, cells that sustain chromosome damage produce increasing quantities of GFP.

   The company is seeking to offer genotox assays with the intention of acquiring Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) accreditation. GLP is a required system of management controls for research laboratories ensuring the consistency and quality of safety tests on chemical compounds.

  <p>
   Gentronix has licenses with
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   and Prolume to use their GFP and Gaussia Luciferase genese, respectively, in its assays.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company, as part of a planned growth initiative into new areas of genotox, relocated into new, larger laboratories in the BioHub at Alderley site in Alderley Edge, UK.
