   Dayton Superior Corporation is built on a strong foundation. The company makes metal accessories and forms for keeping nonresidential concrete and masonry structures in place during construction. Dayton Superior's sales come largely from lines comprising concrete accessories, such as anchoring and bracing for walls and bridge support framework. It also makes masonry products, welded dowel assemblies, paving products, and corrosion-preventing epoxy coatings and other chemicals. The company's rental equipment includes concrete forming systems and shoring systems.

   Dayton Superior relies on new product launches and expanding its sales force as a means for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company added a new high-strength brace, the B33F, to its Accubrace brand product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dayton Superior expanded its operations in Bogota, Colombia. It also integrated its paving manufacturing at Valparaiso, Indiana into the regional paving hub in Kankakee, Illinois, to service customers throughout the Midwest, South Central, Northeast and Southeast. In 2015, the company also announced plans to invest in a 79,000 sq. ft. service and distribution facility to house its Toronto operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Dayton Superior opened its Innovation Center at the company's corporate headquarters in Miamisburg, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the product innovation front, that year the company introduced the Max-A-Form Handling Hook and the Super She Bolt, two accessory products which are used with the company's existing concrete forming systems, along with two supplemental chemical products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it introduced new brokerage services to bring together buyers and sellers of new and used equipment. Also that year, it increased its sales mix in the Western and Southern parts of the US as a result of increased revenue and higher demand for its products. It also beefed up its Latin American sales force serving the concrete construction market in Columbia, Mexico, and Panama in 2013.
