  <p>
   Discus Dental operates within the Health and Wellness business of Royal Philips's Consumer Lifestyle division. Discus Dental offers dentists a range of aesthetic dental products -- from high end light-activated whitening systems to less expensive simple gel products. The company also offers home-use whitening products, which are dispensed through dental offices.

  <p>
   Prior to being acquired, the company expanded its offerings through the acquisition of ZAP Lasers. The 2010 purchase added development and manufacturing operations in Southern California; ZAP Lasers already provided contract manufacturing services for Discus Dental's soft-tissue diode lasers. The acquisition also expanded the company's international distribution network.
