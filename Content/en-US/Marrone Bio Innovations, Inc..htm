   Marrone Bio Innovations makes pesticide a little less poisonous. The company's biopesticides are made from eco-friendly ingredients such as plant extracts, bacterium, or fungus. Marrone Bio Innovations has three products on the market and three in development awaiting EPA approval. Its pesticide Grandevo contains bacteria that repels plant-eating insects and kills them if ingested. The company's plant extract-based fungicide Regalia is also used as a seed treatment for corn, cotton, and soybeans, and Zequanox kills mussels found in water pipes. Its products are primarily sold to vegetable growers as alternatives to conventional agricultural chemicals. Marrone Bio Innovations went public in 2013.

  <p>
   The company raised $57 million in its IPO, which it will use to expand capacity at its manufacturing plant. Any remainder will be used for research and development, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.

   While conventional chemical pesticides are often effective in controlling pests, some are toxic, contain suspected carcinogens, or have other harmful effects on the environment, people, and animals. Similar risks also affect the water treatment industry, as chlorine and other chemicals used to control invasive water pests such as mussels can inadvertently contaminate and endanger natural waterways. Marrone Bio Innovations sees market opportunity for eco-friendly agricultural chemicals, especially as consumer demand for environmentally responsible products and practices continues to affect the industry.
