   BorgWarner has enjoyed increased demand for powertrain technologies such as gasoline and diesel turbochargers, dual-clutch transmission technology, variable cam timing systems and emissions products. As a result it continued to reinvest in its transmission business in 2012, as it increased capacity for dual clutch transmission modules in Europe, engine timing systems in Asia, transfer cases in North America, and turbo-chargers all over the world.

   BorgWarner in 2013 expanded its technology in highly engineered engine and drivetrain components in the growing Brazilian automotive market. It aims to take advantage of government regulations aimed to increase technological development to improve fuel economy, innovation, environmental protection and energy efficiency as well as the quality and safety of vehicles and auto parts produced in Brazil.
