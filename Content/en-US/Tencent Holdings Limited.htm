   This company puts its pennies into Internet services. Tencent is a provider of Internet and instant messaging (IM) services to consumers in China. Users of its QC IM platform can communicate by text, images, audio, video, and email, and also partake in Tencent's mobile games, personals, content downloads, and other value-added services. Almost 800 million QC users currently have active accounts. Tencent also operates Internet portal QQ.com, the QQ Game portal, multi-media social networking service Qzone, and PaiPai.com, a Chinese Internet shopping site. The company was founded in 1999 and went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2004.

   Online advertising represents only a small part of Tencent's overall revenue (less than 10%). Instead, the company focuses on e-commerce as its primary revenue stream (more than 75%), while mobile services account for the rest.

   Despite a weak economy, the company is riding high on China's position as home to the world's largest Internet population. The company has been looking to buy or invest in mobile Internet services companies and online games developers.

   In order to fulfill corporate social responsibilities and to promote civil Internet communities, the company participates in public charity programs.
