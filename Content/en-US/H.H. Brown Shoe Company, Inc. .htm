Brown manufactures and distributes casual, work, and dress shoes and boots under more than a dozen brands, including Bøc, Børn, Carolina, Corcoran, Dexter, Double-H, Kork-Ease, Matterhorn, Nurse Mates, Söfft, and Softspots. Founded in 1883, H.H. Brown is named after Massachusetts shoemaker Henry H. Brown and is a subsidiary of

   . The company owns and sells through websites (shoeline.com and supershoes.com); more than 40 of its own H.H. Brown SuperShoes stores, which span the East Coast; a leather goods flagship shop in Connecticut; and retailers such as

   The company has grown by expanding its closet of footwear name brands and applications. Among them, in 2010 H.H. Brown won a federal contract to supply men's safety boots for the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   . The company in 2009 acquired comfort sandal maker Kork-Ease from Mickey Rosmarin, founder of the upscale Tootsies boutiques. Kork-Ease's cork-soled wedges were a hit in the 1970s but were discontinued the following decade; Rosmarin snapped up the brand and rebooted production in 2006, selling a more modest lineup through some 80 upscale retailers, including Bergdorf Goodman, Fred Segal, and his own Tootsies. H.H. Brown looks to continue the sandal brand's renewed fortune by marketing it alongside its Børn comfort shoes, which are sold in specialty as well as major department stores, such as

   , Macy's, and

   .

   H.H. Brown also benefits from a variety of proprietary shoe technologies, including the Dryz moisture management system, which helps to keep feet warm and dry. Other footwear innovations include the company's C3 Footbed (contoured arch support), Gel Cell (helps dissipate shock), and Opanka (patented hand-stitched construction).

   Additionally, the company puts its technological savvy to use in products other than footwear. It has developed agricultural fertilizers and kitty litter using the urethane technology underlying its Dryz moisture-wicking technology, for example. The technology is also used in bandages and other medical products.
