   While Spectrum doesn't break out sales for its Russell Hobbs business, small appliances accounted for 18% of Spectrum Brands Holdings' $4.1 billion in sales in fiscal 2013 (ended September). Small appliances sales fell 4% versus the prior year, due primarily to falling sales in North America, the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in sales in Europe. Market share gains in the UK, expansion in Europe, and new product introductions contributed to gains in Europe.

   Russell Hobbs generates the bulk of its revenue from kitchen products, including toasters, coffee makers, and kettles. In 2012 the company teamed with consumer goods supplier Ultimate Products to produce a range of goods under license. Ultimate Products signed a three-year agreement with Russell Hobbs' parent company to develop cookware, bakeware, and kitchen utensils for the UK retail market. With sales declining in North America, the company is looking to Europe and new markets for growth.

        <p>
   Polish immigrant Lewis Salton (who had left after the Nazi invasion) founded the company in New York in 1943; his first product, the Salton Hotray -- an electric warming tray -- became a staple for many hostesses during the pre-microwave 1950s and 1960s. Salton introduced a bun warmer in 1963 and over the years followed with oddball products such as peanut butter makers, ice-cream machines, egg cookers, and yogurt makers. Demand for the Hotray dwindled in the 1970s with the advent of the microwave oven, and the company found itself adrift under several different owners.
  </p>
        <p>
   The firm moved to Chicago in 1985. In 1988 Leonhard Dreimann led an LBO of the company (then owned by SEVKO) and renamed it Salton Housewares; Dreimann became CEO. The next year it merged with Maxim, a small-appliance business founded by Joe Bender in the early 1970s, and added the Maxim name. Salton/Maxim went public in 1991, raising money to pay off LBO debt.
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisitions leading to the firm's recovery included infomercial kings The Juiceman and The Breadman (1993); its clock licensee, Salton Time (1994); and Block China (1996). The company began licensing the George Foreman name in 1995, the year it introduced the George Foreman Lean, Mean, Fat Reducing Grilling Machine. In 1996 the firm sold half its stock to Windmere-Durable Holdings, a small-appliance maker. The two companies struck a deal in 1997 with
   <company id="10830">
    Kmart
   </company>
   to supply it exclusively with certain White-Westinghouse products, for which Salton/Maxim had won the licensing rights. The firm also won exclusive rights to distribute Farberware small appliances that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Conflicts broke up the Windmere-Durable and Salton/Maxim relationship in 1998, and Salton/Maxim bought back its shares. In 1999 Salton/Maxim bought small-appliance maker Toastmaster and the SASAKI brand of tabletop products; it also dropped Maxim from its name. In 1999 the company acquired the George Foreman trademark, saving it from having to pay 60% of the line's profits to Foreman and his partners; it was one of the most expensive contracts undertaken by an athlete. Salton bought the Relaxor brand of massagers and other personal items in 2000 from JB Research.
  </p>
        <p>
   Salton acquired personal care appliance maker Pifco Holdings in 2001, expanding its business into the UK and other European markets. Also that year Salton acquired Westclox, Big Ben, and Spartus brands from the bankrupt General Time Corporation (formerly the largest producer and marketer of alarm, wall, and occasional clocks in North America). It formed a new subsidiary, Icebox, to develop Web-enabled kitchen products. (The company sold all of its Time products in 2007.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 Salton further penetrated the European market with its acquisition of the Look For Group, a distributor of small electric appliances under the brand names Suntai, Orgalys, and Orva. The company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Westinghouse that year for the use of its brand name for clocks, fans, heaters, kitchen electrics, personal care products, vacuums, and table-top air cleaners and humidifiers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Salton agreed in 2002 to pay $8.2 million in the settlement of a lawsuit brought by more than 40 states. The suit accused Salton of forcing retailers to fix the price of its George Foreman grills. In 2003 Salton entered into a joint venture with Melitta (global leader in coffee filter production), G. Rossi (top manufacturer of pod-making equipment), and a leading Chinese coffeemaker to market a household coffee pod system in the US and Canada. Salton acquired Lectrix, a designer and marketer of small kitchen appliances that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 Salton and Kmart terminated their small-appliance licensing deal but continued to do some post-petition business together. In 2005 Salton sold its tabletop assets to
   <company id="14458">
    Lifetime Brands
   </company>
   for approximately $14.2 million. In 2006 David Sabin, a Salton founder, retired after 15 years as chairman of the company's board of directors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Salton, through its then largest investor Harbinger Capital Partners, bought fellow small appliance maker Applica (and its subsidiaries) in 2007. In addition, Applica COO Terry Polistina was named CEO of Salton. He succeeded Leonhard Dreimann, who resigned in 2007.
  </p>
        <p>
   Harbinger Capital's ownership of the company began when it took the company private in 2008, following the household appliance maker's acquisition of
   <company id="11641">
    Applica
   </company>
   in 2007. Applica was integrated into Salton following the purchase. The combined company changed its name to Russell Hobbs in 2009. Besides volume purchasing and enhanced distribution capabilities, the two had complementary geographic strengths outside the US -- Applica had a foothold in the Americas, while its new owner's reach extended to Europe, Australia, and Brazil.
  </p>
        <p>
   Salton also saw some change in its management ranks following the Applica deal, including the chief executive's office. In 2007 Applica COO Terry Polistina was named CEO of the combined company. He succeeded Leonhard Dreimann.

   fell through in 2008. (Spectrum agreed to pay Salton a $3 million termination fee to for backing out of the deal.) Salton changed its name to Russell Hobbs, Inc. in 2009.  In June 2010, Russell Hobbs was acquired by Spectrum Brands Holdings.
