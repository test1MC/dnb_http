   As France's leading magazine publisher, Lagardère Active is perhaps the company's most high profile business. However, Lagardère Services accounts for the largest chunk of revenues -- some 48%. The unit operates duty free retail outlets for travelers (in airports and train stations) and neighborhood convenience stores. It also provides press distribution to retail outlets. Lagardère Unlimited, meanwhile, includes brands such as Newsweb (sports-related Internet content provider) and Sportfive (European football marketing and media rights).

  <p>
   Jean-Luc Lagardère began his rise to industrial titan when he joined French aerospace contractor Dassault as an engineer in the 1950s. He was tapped to be president and CEO of military equipment manufacturer Mécanique Aviation TRAction (Matra) in 1963, where he pushed the firm to branch out into electronics, space systems, and automobiles during the 1970s. Lagardère turned his focus to the media world in 1981 when he joined with Filipacchi Médias to acquire control of venerable French publishing firm Hachette.
  </p>
  <p>
   Started by schoolteacher Louis Hachette in 1826, the publishing firm first catered to the textbook market and later began producing general trade books and travel guides. It became involved in the newspaper business in the 1920s and launched fashion magazine
   <i>
    Elle
   </i>
   in 1945. A diversification strategy in the 1970s proved disastrous, however, leading to Lagardère's takeover.
  </p>
  <p>
   The engineer-turned-entrepreneur launched international spinoffs of Hachette's magazines, including a successful US
   <i>
    Elle
   </i>
   in 1985 in partnership with media maven Rupert Murdoch. In the late 1980s Hachette invested in radio broadcasting, bought US magazine distributor Curtis Circulation, and acquired Spanish encyclopedia publisher Salvat. Meanwhile, Matra launched its Espace minivan in 1983 (marketed by Renault). In 1988 Hachette acquired encyclopedia publisher Grolier for $1.1 billion and later bought out Murdoch's share of
   <em>
    Elle
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Hachette bought a 25% stake in money-losing French TV network La Cinq. The station collapsed a year later, leaving Hachette with a $643 million write-off. To cover the huge debt, Lagardère merged Matra with Hachette in 1993 under the holding company that now bears his name. Its Matra division acquired British Aerospace's satellite division the next year and Hachette expanded its North American distribution business in 1995. Two years later Filipacchi Médias and Hachette Filipacchi Press merged to form Hachette Filipacchi Médias.
  </p>
  <p>
   With French industry decreasing its reliance on defense business, Lagardère merged its Matra unit with France's state-owned aerospace firm, Aerospatiale, in 1999. Not long after, the new Aerospatiale Matra agreed to merge with Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas to form Airbus. Completed the following year, the merger created the world's #3 aerospace company. (Lagardère retained a minority stake in the venture.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2000 Lagardère sold Grolier to Scholastic Corp. for about $400 million and bought the rest of Hachette Filipacchi Médias from its minority shareholders. The same year Jean-Luc Lagardère escaped a 1988 fraud charge when a judge ruled that the time limit for prosecution had expired. To begin leveraging its media assets, the company created multimedia unit Lagardère Active in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought most of the assets of
   <company id="42387">
    Vivendi Universal Publishing
   </company>
   (VUP) from media giant
   <company id="92356">
    Vivendi
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion in 2003. To get past antitrust authorities, Lagardère sold 60% of VUP, which it renamed
   <company id="42387">
    Editis
   </company>
   , to French firm
   <company id="92042">
    Wendel Investissement
   </company>
   . (Wendel ended up buying more of Editis in late 2004.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Jean-Luc Lagardère died in 2003 of a rare neurological disease. Also that year the company exited the automotive design business with the sale of its Matra subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Lagardère decided to begin gradually reducing its holding in Airbus. The company expected to reduce its stake to 7.5% by 2009, but such efforts were delayed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lagardère purchased Time Warner Book Group in 2006. Also that year Hachette Filipacchi Médias merged with Lagardère Active. In 2007 the company created a sports marketing division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company decided to slim down its magazine operations considerably when it sold about 100 titles in 15 countries (including China, Italy, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, UK, and the US). Among the assets it divested were the rights to
   <em>
    Elle
   </em>
   magazine outside France.
