   Skyworks Solutions makes analog computer chips that help wireless devices such as phones stay on and connected. Its flagship handset products include power amplifiers and front-end modules used by
   <company id="12644">
    Apple Inc.
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="149927">
    HTC
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="140691">
    ZTE
   </company>
   . Other aalog devices include attenuators, diodes, couplers, phase shifters, receivers, filters, and switches used in a broad array of industries. Skyworks uses gallium arsenide (GaAs), a material that is faster and uses less energy than industry-standard silicon, in many of its devices. The company gets more than 90% of its sales from customers in the Asia and Asia/Pacific regions, where it has most of its manufacturing plants.

  <p>
   In addition to its handset business, Skyworks sells its analog and mixed-signal (combines analog and digital circuits on a single chip) integrated circuits to customers in the automotive, energy management, infrastructure, medical, and military markets. The company sells its portfolio of more than 2,500 analog components to more than 2,000 customers worldwide. It also licenses its intellectual property (IP) to encourage customers to incorporate its integrated circuits into their products during the design phase.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   China leads Skyworks' geographic markets, accounting for 71% of sales; other Asian countries bring in an additional 25%. The Americas (including the US) and Europe bring in the rest. The company has fabrication facilities in the US and Japan, and packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Mexico and Singapore.

  <p>
   Although Skyworks partners with some electronic components distributors, it markets its products to OEMs primarily through its own global sales force. The company's largest customers are
   <company id="149860">
    Foxconn
   </company>
   and Samsung, which together, account for more than 10% revenue. Products sold to Foxconn are assembled into Apple products.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Skyworks' financials have been headed, well, skyward for the past five years. In 2016 (ended September), however, revenue rose just 1% after 42% growth the year before. Revenue came in a $3.3 billion in 2016, compared to $3.26 billion in 2015. Sales rose 3% in China in 2016, which outweighed sales declines in most other markets. The company said the growth it did capture came from a higher share of RF and analog content per device, a increased number of applications for the internet of things, and a bigger product portfolio for automotive, industrial, medical, and military markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 25% in 2016 to $99.5 million from 2015. Skyworks kept cost increases manageable for research and development and administrative purposes. Profit got an $88.5 million boost from a termination fee for the cancelled acquisition of PMC-Sierra. That company spurned Skyworks in favor of Microsemi.
  </p>
  <p>
   The amount of money that Skyworks had to work with in 2016 increased as cash flow from operations reached $1.1 billion, up from $993 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Part of Skyworks' strategy is to expand its products as mobile forms of communication expand. Its research and development budget rose to $312 million in 2016 (ended September) from $303 million in 2015. R&amp;D spending had been $226 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In trying to diversify beyond Apple and Samsung, Skyworks has introduced products for WiFi networks, internet of things applications, and filter technology. To help its filter business, the company opened a facility in Japan for the design, development, and manufacture of filter devices particularly for the Japanese market.

  <p>
   The company ended its bid to buy
   <company id="14609">
    PMC-Sierra
   </company>
   , a maker of semiconductors and software for storage, optical, and mobile networks, when its $2 billion was bested by
   <company id="14119">
    Microsemi
   </company>
   and its offer of $2.5 billion in cash and stock. At that point, Skyworks decided the deal didn't fit its financial framework. PMC-Sierra paid an $88.5 million termination fee to Skyworks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Skyworks acquired the 34% it did not own of a joint venture with Panasonic. The unit, which makes automotive devices, became a subsidiary of Skyworks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company spent $6.6 million to buy Quatance Inc., which brought intellectual property in envelope tracking and power efficiency technologies.
