   In the midst of the economic recession that hit the publishing world particularly hard, the company sold its struggling
   <em>
    Modern Woodworking
   </em>
   magazine to TCC Media Group in 2009. It made the sale in order to focus on its core competencies.

   Former owners Wachovia Capital Partners, a private equity and mezzanine investing subsidiary of banking giant
   <company id="103806">
    Wachovia Corporation
   </company>

Wachovia had purchased Randall Publishing from the family and estate of H. Pettus Randall III in 2005. As a result of that acquisition, the company changed its name to Randall-Reilly Publishing.
