   Namco Bandai Holdings (dba Bandai Namco in the US) is no joke, but it is a source of amusement for customers across its portfolio of products. The company's toys, created by Bandai Co., include the Tamagotchi virtual pet and the Digimon, Gundam, and Power Ranger collections of characters and action figures. Its related products include clothing, stationery, and accessories. The company's arcade game machines and game software are developed primarily by Bandai Namco Games and include
   <em>
    Dark Souls II and Dragon Ball
   </em>
   . Namco Ltd. operates a chain of amusement facilities (more than 10% of sales), develops animated and live-action content for film and mobile phones, and sells coin-operated game and amusement machines.

  <p>
   Japan is the Tokyo-based company's largest market, accounting for nearly 85% of sales. The rest of Asia, the Americas, and Europe roughly split the rest.

  <p>
   Namco Bandai Holdings reported net sales of ¥507.7 billion ($4.9 billion) in fiscal 2014 (ended March), versus ¥487.2 billion the prior year. Net income fell 23% over the same period. Fiscal 2014 marked the fourth consecutive year of increasing net sales (before the impact of foreign exchange rates). The company's Toys &amp; Hobby and Content units posted year over year sales gains, while the Amusement Facility business posted a 3% decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   On a geographic basis, sales were up 5% in Japan, flat in Europe, and down 18% in the Americas.

  <p>
   Namco Bandai has been working to boost its global profile in the lucrative content sector by transporting characters from the hands-on world of toys to the hands-on (joystick) world of computer games. The move is paying off. In fiscal 2014, the company generated 52% of its revenue from content versus 35% from its toys and hobby segment, an area that once led the company's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm is looking to extend its reach beyond its home market of Japan (where it rings up nearly 85% of its sales) but hasn't made as much progress in recent years as it continues to square off against global toy-making stalwarts
   <company id="10966">
    Mattel
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12007">
    Hasbro
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11603">
    Disney
   </company>
   that have a strong presence outside Asia.

  <p>
   Namco Bandai was formed in 2005 when Bandai, Japan's largest toy maker and a developer of regionally popular game titles, acquired global computer games legend Namco to build market share in the gaming space domestically and abroad. Faced with formidable competition from the likes of
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   , the company develops games based on Bandai's catalog of toy and anime characters using Namco's software gaming expertise. Namco made its name in the 1980's with such video arcade classics as
   <em>
    Pac-Man
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Galaga.
   </em>
   In June 2014, the English-language name of Namco Bandai Holdings was changed to Bandai Namco Holdings.
