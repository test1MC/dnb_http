        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The revenue increased by 3% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in other revenue partially offset by a slight decline in net sales. The decline in net sales was due to the measures implemented in Spain over the past three years.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income decreased by 9% in fiscal 2012 compared to the previous period due to increased spending on R&amp;D and additional operating expenses.
