   Today's soldier needs more than just a horse and a Colt .45-caliber handgun, and to its benefit Colt Defense has changed with the times. The company produces small arms and weapon systems primarily for the US and Canadian military and law enforcement agencies. Colt Defense has historically held multiyear contracts as a prime contractor to the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   and the Canadian Department of National Defence. Products include military rifles (M4 carbine rifles and M16 rifles), auxiliary weapon systems (M203 grenade launchers), law enforcement firearms, and spare parts and replacement kits. Colt Defense filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in mid-2015 and emerged in January 2016.

  <p>
   Colt in mid-2015 voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and emerged in the beginning of 2016. During that time, it restructured and reduced its debt, improved its capital structure, and enhanced its liquidity. The company has reduced its debt by approximately $200 million, after raising $50 million of new capital through the restructuring process.

  <p>
   In recent years, Colt has been working to extend its reach into international markets. It has been cultivating its presence outside North America through agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Denmark, which each account for about 10% of the company's sales.

   The arms expert has also focused on developing new products, such as a multi-caliber modular carbine designed specifically for US combat forces. Its complete line of law enforcement products include the AR-15 series, the combat M4 series, 9mm submachine guns, a grenade launcher for non-lethal applications, and a heavy barrel accurized rifle.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots to the frontier days -- a corporate predecessor began supplying weapons to the US military in 1847. Colt Defense was spun off from

   in 2002.
