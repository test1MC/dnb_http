   BioMarin Pharmaceuticals works to raise orphan drugs up right. The company has developed a number of
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved drugs that qualify for orphan drug status, a financial incentive that encourages companies to create drugs for rare diseases by giving the compounds an extended period of market exclusivity. BioMarin's Naglazyme and Aldurazyme drugs treat versions of the life-threatening genetic condition mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), caused by a rare enzyme deficiency that prevents patients from metabolizing certain complex carbohydrates. Another drug, Kuvan, is approved to treat enzyme deficiency phenylketonuria (PKU), while Firdapse treats Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), a rare autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   BioMarin's top selling drug is Naglazyme (accounting for more than half of annual revenues), which is sold to consumers in the US, Europe, and other global markets to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI). Its other MPS drug, Aldurazyme, treats MPS type I. The company's newest drug, Firdapse, received European Union marketing approval as a treatment for LEMS in 2010. The drug is being developed under orphan designation for the US market through licensing partner Catalyst Pharmaceutical.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US and Europe account for the largest amount of annual revenues (about 50% and 25%, respectively), trailed by Latin America and other regions. BioMarin has operations in more than 40 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, with office locations in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, and the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force in the US, Europe, South America, and select other markets to sell Naglazyme, Kuvan, and Firdapse (where approved). In markets where it doesn't have its own sales force, BioMarin sells through distributors. It also has marketing agreements with other drugmakers: Aldurazyme is sold worldwide by partner
   <company id="13560">
    Genzyme,
   </company>
   while BioMarin manufactures the drug and receives royalty payments on its sales. In addition, while the company also markets Kuvan in the US, partner
   <company id="90988">
    Merck Serono
   </company>
   markets the drug in Europe and other international markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Since a relatively small number of people have the diseases treated by BioMarin's products, it sells mainly to specialty pharmacies and end-users including government agencies and hospitals, though it does also provide some products to large wholesalers. The company uses third parties for warehousing and distribution functions.

   To bring itself to a steady level of profitability, BioMarin intends to bring additional candidates to market (with a continued focus on orphan drugs). The company has several investigational drugs in its pipeline, including BMN-110 (formerly GALNS), an enzyme replacement treatment for MPS IV A, also known as Morquio syndrome. BioMarin is also developing a second PKU treatment (dubbed PEG-PAL), which aims to assist in the metabolism of certain amino acids and is designed for PKU patients who don't respond to Kuvan. Other BioMarin drug candidates in clinical and preclinical development include possible treatments for additional rare genetic and metabolic conditions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company was focused on gaining FDA approval for Firdapse (already approved in Europe), but decided to license out North American development and marketing rights on the drug to Catalyst Pharmaceutical in late 2012. The deal gave BioMarin $5 million in Catalyst shares plus future royalty payments of between 7% and 10% on US sales of the drug once it gains approval; it also allows the company to focus on development of other candidates.
  </p>
        <p>
   With a fat pipeline and several candidates nearing approval, BioMarin has also been investing in its manufacturing capacity. It has expanded an existing facility in California, and in 2011 it purchased a plant in Ireland from
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   . The new site will be readied to produce BMN-110, PEG-PAL, and other candidates once they reach commercialization stages.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   BioMarin has also furthered its development programs through acquisitions. In late 2014, it acquired Prosensa and its failed drisapersen treatment for Duchenne for $680 million. It had hoped to carry the drug through to regulatory approval, but in 2016 the company admitted defeat and wrote off that investment. It continues to research treatments for Duchenne.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 the firm added candidates for metabolic conditions through the purchase of Zacharon Pharmaceuticals for $10 million. Historical acquisitions include the 2010 purchases of LEAD Therapeutics (cancer drug development) and ZyStor Therapeutics (enzyme replacement therapies for degenerative diseases including Pompe).
