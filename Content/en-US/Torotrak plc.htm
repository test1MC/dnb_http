   If Torotrak is successful, the sound of teens grinding gears will become a thing of the past. Torotrak is pioneering full-toroidal (doughnut shaped) transmission technology for use in continuously variable (CVT) and infinitely variable transmissions (IVT), designed to deliver smooth and steady power without the gear changes now necessary in automatic and manual transmissions. Torotrak carries some 500 patents and develops gearless traction drive transmissions (Torotrak), variable drive superchargers (V-Charge), and mechanical kinetic energy recovery systems (Flybrid). In addition, its Flybrid Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) is its newest breed of mechanical hybrid.

  <p>
   The company's Flybrid industry partners include Jaguar Land Rover, Wrightbus, and Arriva, among others. Torotrak targets the commercial vehicles (on-highway), commercial vehicles (off-highway), and passenger car industries.

  <p>
   Torotrak's balance sheet has fluctuated over the years. Revenues decreased in 2014 due to decreased sales from engineering services and license agreements. After posting positive net income in 2013, the company posted a net loss in 2014 primarily due to costs and expenses associated with its Flybrid acquisition.

  <p>
   In 2014 Torotrak enhanced its product offerings through the acquisition of Flybrid Automotive Ltd, a UK-based engineering company with expertise in hybrid vehicles. The deal enabled Torotrak to commercialize an affordable hybrid system, named Flybrid M-KERS, that acts as one of the most cost-effective powertrain technologies for reducing CO2 emissions.
