   Connoisseurs of the beer-can chicken recipe owe a toast of gratitude to the Metal Container Corporation (MCC). Part of the
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   (A-B) Packaging Group, the subsidiary makes aluminum cans and lids for A-B's domestic beer operations in addition to supplying the US soft drink container market.
   <company id="45737">
    Hansen Natural
   </company>
   's Monster Energy beverages are a major soft drink customer, as well as
   <company id="55869">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   . MCC makes more than 25 billion cans and 27 billion lids annually, and supplies more than 45% of A-B's domestic cans and 55% of its lids. About 25% of the US aluminum can market is produced by MCC, which operates five can and two lid manufacturing plants in the US.

   MCC is stationed in Saint Louis, Missouri, and it has manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin.

  <p>
   Not only is MCC's production footprint shrinking, its best practices are streamlining processes and products. Each of the company's plants are very large, very productive, yet very low cost; some are capable of churning out more than 9 million cans a day. Raw material costs are contained by sourcing aluminum sheets processed from recycled cans. In 2012 its parent company announced plans to expand MCC's production facility in Arnold, Missouri, by adding 100,000 sq. ft. to the location.
  </p>
  <p>
   MCC also continues to work at designing a stronger, yet lighter-weight, single-serve product, requiring less aluminum and energy to manufacture and ship. Since it was established in 1973, MCC has reduced aluminum can weight by more than 40%, and rolled out a lid design that has helped to cut operating expenses.
