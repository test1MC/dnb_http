   The Company is headquartered in High Point, North Carolina, with showrooms in High Point, New York, Denver, and Las Vegas. The US is Lexington's biggest market, however, about 10% of revenues come from international customers. China, Canada, and Mexico are the furniture maker's next largest markets.

   Lexington Home Brands in mid-2013 added outdoor furniture to the lineup with the addition of the Tommy Bahama Outdoor brand, which includes two contemporary outdoor collections, Aviano and Blue Olive.

   Lexington Home's long-running successful partnership with designer Bob Timberlake came to an end in 2011. In its stead, Lexington launched the Henry Link Trading Co. furniture collection soon after. The collection is named after globe-trotter Henry Link, who founded Dixie Furniture in 1936. The 200-piece line of bedroom, dining, and living room furniture is inspired by Link's travels (including African safaris and Asian climbing expeditions) and features pieces made of exotic woods, bamboo, cane, marble, brass, and shells.

   In response to shifting consumer preferences for smaller homes, Lexington has been downscaling some of its furniture pieces. About 20% of the company's sales came from scaled-down designs, and the Zacara collection, composed of smaller contemporary bedroom and dining room pieces, is one of its best-selling lines overall.

   In fall 2011 Lexington acquired Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Sligh Furniture Co., a maker of home office and home entertainment furnishings. The purchase added two new categories to Lexington's core bedroom, dining room, and living room offerings.
