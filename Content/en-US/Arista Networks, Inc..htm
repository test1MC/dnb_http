   As a player in the software-defined networking (SDN) space, Arista Networks is focused on making its technology more agile than its competitors. Legacy networks aren't programmable and can be difficult to integrate with third-party applications for network management and automation. However, Arista Networks' cloud networking platform doesn't have the same limitations of legacy network architectures.
