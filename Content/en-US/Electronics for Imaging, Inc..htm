  <p>
   Efi Arazi, an
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   -trained engineer, started Electronics For Imaging (EFI) in 1989. Arazi, one of Israel's high-tech magnates, had earlier founded Scitex Corp., a digital printer manufacturer; he later established Imedia, a maker of routing systems for digital video; Imedia was acquired by cable modem provider Terayon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arazi acquired exclusive rights to an MIT patent that formed EFI's core technology. The company shipped its first Fiery server in 1991 and went public the next year. Its secondary strategy -- selling its EfiColor and Cachet Color Editor software alone -- failed, so in 1993 the company scrapped Cachet, making the development and marketing of the Fiery series top priority.
  </p>
  <p>
   COO Dan Avida became CEO in 1995, replacing Arazi, who remained chairman. That year EFI introduced the Fiery XJ series, which doubled the speed of its predecessor and allowed easier upgrades. In 1996 EFI formed an alliance with Netherlands-based
   <company id="47874">
    Océ
   </company>
   and introduced a system for Océ's high-speed printers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its software development, EFI in 1997 bought Pipeline Associates, a specialist in PostScript, hypertext markup language (HTML), and printer control language interpreter technologies. During the next two years, EFI partnered with

    Agfa
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="104796">
    Fuji Xerox
   </company>
   and nearly doubled its customer base. It struck deals to incorporate Fiery controllers in
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   laser printers, and Fiery servers in ENCAD's ink jet printers. In 1998, EFI released 40 new products, including its Fiery ZX (for wide-format printers) and X2 (for pre-press devices) platforms. That year Avida replaced Arazi as chairman.
