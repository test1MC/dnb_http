   It's a black and white world for Zebra Technologies, which makes devices for printing and reading the barcodes affixed to just about anything for sale. The company designs and sells printing devices that print labels, plastic cards, tickets, and receipts. The company also makes equipment to read barcodes with its acquisition of Motorola Solutions in 2014. Its Zebra Location Solutions unit provides asset tags, call tags, sensors, exciters, and software -- all of which use passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) to help companies track and manage assets. Zebra Technologies serves government customers and many corporate clients in industries ranging from health care to manufacturing to retail.

   In 2014, the company's sales zoomed 60% higher to $1.6 billion from $1.04 billion in 2013. Profits, however, tumbled 75% for the year to $32 million. The Motorola assets and those of Hart Systems, acquired in 2013, helped top line growth. Healthy sales of printers and supplies also contributed. Profit took a hit from higher operating costs associated with the acquisitions. Cash flow from operations were $248 million in 2014, up from $197 million in 2013.

  <p>
   The acquisition of Motorola Solutions is a big part of Zebra Technologies' strategy. It adds technologies, products, and customers that should strengthen Zebra Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company seeks to deliver new processes and products for mobile and cloud computing as well as the Internet of Things, the connection of devices relaying information about a range of activities. The company released several new products in early 2015 for improved security in mobile applications, help medical manufacturers better track their products, and a new line of rugged mobile printers.

  <p>
   The acquisition of the enterprise business of
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola Solutions
   </company>
   for nearly $3.5 billion was the biggest for Zebra Technologies. The business -- which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets, and barcode scanners -- generated about $2.7 billion in sales for Motorola in 2013. The deal significantly strengthened Zebra's portfolio of offerings and expanded its geographic reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013 Zebra paid $94 million for Hart Systems, which makes software and hardware (mobile devices) that allow retailers to perform self-directed in-store inventory. The acquisition expanded Zebra's product offerings to the retail industry. The year before, it bought LaserBand, a provider of patient identification wristbands and related products used in hospitals worldwide, boosting the company's profile in the health care market.

  <p>
   With $1,000, Edward Kaplan and Gerhard Cless founded Data Specialties, Inc. (DSI) in 1969 to make machines that punched holes in paper and read paper tape. The company introduced its first bar code printer, which used a dot matrix system, in 1982. DSI introduced the first thermal transfer bar code printer and changed its name to Zebra Technologies in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public and opened a UK office in 1991. Two years later Zebra acquired a plant in the UK. Kaplan gave up day-to-day management in 1995 to focus on acquisitions. That year the company acquired Vertical Technologies, a maker of PC-based label and bar code software.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to offer new products for the evolving market, through in-house development and acquisitions. It's biggest purchase came in 2014 when Zebra Technologies bought the enterprise business of Motorola Solutions. The deal expanded Zebra Technologies' products, customer set, and geographic reach.
