   H2O Plus wants to leave skin feeling fresher than a day at the beach. The company makes skin care products touting marine ingredients such as seaweed and nutrient-rich algae. Its expansive product line spans face, body, and hair care items that are for the most part moderately priced. The company's products are developed from a portfolio of 500 proprietary formulations that use water as a base instead of other pore-clogging ingredients. H2O Plus products are sold online and at more than 2,400 beauty stores in nearly 40 countries, mostly in North America and Asia. In the US, its largest market,

   H2O Plus has been focused on growing outside the US and in recent years has doubled its international distribution serving such locations as India, Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. It has also been working to strengthen brand recognition in China.

   Known for its lotions and shower gels, H2O Plus in 2012 and 2013 embarked on a rebranding with the launch of higher-priced face and eye creams to claim part of the facial care product market that is estimated at upwards of $80 billion. As one of the official in-room toiletries for Walt Disney World Resorts, Disneyland, Disney Cruise Line, and the Disney Vacation Club (Disney's timeshare), H2O Plus was able to leverage its deal with the Walt Disney Company and extend its reach into Hong Kong Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Disney's Aulani Resort in Hawaii.
