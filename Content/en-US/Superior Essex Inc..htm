   Fit to be tied over wire and cable? Superior Essex aims to offer the best. The company is, plausibly, the world's #1 maker of outside plant (OSP) copper telephone cable. Its copper and fiber-optic products are used in home and office communications networks, and its winding (magnet) products connect transformers and motors in cars, industrial machinery, and HVAC systems. The vast majority of customers are in the US, but international clients are on the rise due to the company's global expansion. Regional Bell telephone operating companies are major customers of Superior Essex, as are OEMs such as

   Superior Essex conducts its operations through two business segments. Magnet Wire &amp; Distribution produces wire with an electromagnetic charge. The wire is insulated with copper or aluminum to better serve as a conductor in motors, transformers and generators, automotive components, and appliances. The company's Communications Cable business segment makes OSP products for voice and data transmission that are designed for use outdoors; it also manufactures fiber optic and copper cables that are used indoors for communications applications. Customer purchase products through Superior Essex's distribution divisions -- Essex Brownell and High-Wire Ltd.
