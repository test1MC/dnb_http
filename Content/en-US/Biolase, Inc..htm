   BioLase is causing dentists to drop the knife and pick up the laser. The company develops, manufactures, and sells laser-based systems for use primarily in dental applications. BioLase's surgical cutting system, Waterlase, uses laser pulses to turn water droplets into high-speed particles that can cut both hard and soft tissues and bones in the mouth. Waterlase is used in procedures traditionally performed with dental drills and scalpels. The company's Diode laser systems are used to perform soft tissue and cosmetic dental procedures, as well as non-dental procedures. BioLase markets its products in more than 60 countries.

  <p>
   Biolase has sold about 20,000 laser systems to customers around the globe. The US market accounts for about two-thirds of annual revenues. Other core markets include Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the Benelux countries. The firm is also moving to increase its distribution networks in high-growth Asian and South American markets.

   The company is reorganizing its global sales and marketing organization. In the US and Canada, the company uses both a direct sales force and distribution partners to promote its products. (It used

   </company>
   as an exclusive distributor in North America until 2010.) At the same time, the company has eliminated direct sales operations in international markets, instead choosing to sign non-exclusive agreements with distributors including Henry Schein in a growing number of countries in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region. Henry Schein was the company's largest customer in 2011, accounting for 19% of revenues (down from 38% in 2010 and 75% in 2009).

   Outside the dental arena, Biolase offers the Diolase 10 system, which has pain therapy applications in orthopedic, sports medicine, rehabilitation, and chiropractic procedures. In addition, the BioLase Imaging division sells dental imaging devices such as portable digital x-ray systems.

  <p>
   BioLase began to make a turnaround in its finances in 2011 after several years of conducting restructuring and debt-repayment efforts. Biolase's revenues had suffered in previous years as product sales slowed due to economic conditions and weakened customer demand. Cost-cutting measures included the reduction of about 40% of its workforce between 2008 and 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 86% to some $49 million in 2011, largely attributed to sales of its newly released and enhanced Waterlase systems, as well as the reorganization of BioLase's distribution and sales organizations. However, the company failed to report a profit for the eight year running as it continues to spend more on building up its operations than it earns.

  <p>
   Despite continued economic struggles, BioLase has continued to develop and introduce upgraded versions of its laser systems, with hopes that it will attract new customers and increase sales levels by widening its product offerings. Early in 2010 the company received FDA approval for its first direct-to-consumer personal hygiene product, the iLase diode system, and in 2011 and 2012 it launched two next-generation Waterlase all-tissue laser systems for dentists (the Waterlase iPlus and Waterlase MDX).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also launched its dental imaging product line in 2011, and added additional products manufactured by third parties to widen its imaging system offerings the following year. In addition, Biolase continues to explore markets for its laser systems outside of the dental industry, such as ophthalmic procedures. It also conducts marketing and educational programs to increase awareness of its systems among dentists and consumers.

   The company shortened its name from Biolase Technology to simply Biolase, Inc., in 2012; it also changed its ticker to BIOL on the NASDAQ exchange.
