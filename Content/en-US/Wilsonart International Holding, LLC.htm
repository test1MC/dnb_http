   Countertops and other surfaces are like blank canvases for Wilsonart International. The company manufacturers high pressure laminates and other surfaces used for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops, and other uses. Its products are marketed under the Wilsonart, Resopal, Polyrey, Ralph Wilson, and Arborite brands. Wilsonart sells its products through a network of company-owned and independent distributors across North America; it also works through independent international distributors. The company was a subsidiary of mega tool supplies maker

    Illinois Tool Works
   </company>
   until 2012, when 51% of its stock was sold to investment firm
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   .

   Investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice paid $395 million to acquire 51% of Wilsonart International in late 2012, and Illinois Tool Works retained a minority stake.

  <p>
   When it was owned by Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Wilsonart International made up ITW's Decorative Surfaces segment. This segment's total revenue increased 10%, and its net income increased 13% from 2010 to 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   This growth was attributed to an increase in demand for its products coupled with a favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for its North American high-pressure laminate business were up by 6% because of new product introductions and stronger product demand in the office furniture market. Due to growth in China and certain European end markets, the segment's international revenues increased by 8% from 2010 to 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in net income was due to lower restructuring expenses and the favorable effect of currency translation.
