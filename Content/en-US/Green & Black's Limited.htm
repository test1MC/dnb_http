   Admirers of Green &amp; Black's would be blue if it weren't for Maya Gold -- the company's first organic chocolate product to be awarded the Fair Trade designation. Green &amp; Black's makes elegantly packaged chocolate bars, as well as chocolate biscuits, ice creams, hot chocolate mixes, and gift items. Its products are sold through food retailers in the UK, Germany, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as through greenandblacksdirect.com. Its organic cocoa is grown by farmers in Belize and the Dominican Republic. Confectionery giant Cadbury (now part of
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   ) owns the company. Across its portfolio Green &amp; Black's products became Fair Trade certified in the UK in 2011.

   The 2011 certification made Green &amp; Black's the largest organic and Fair Trade brand in the world by volume. Going forward, the company's goal is to have all products that are sold through 30-plus countries to meet this Fair Trade designation. It has also made plans to spend £400,000 (or $627,000) a year through 2019 to support the sustainability of Dominican Republic cocoa-growing communities.

   The company was given its name by the founding husband-and-wife team of Craig Sams and Josephine "Jo" Fairley to symbolize Green &amp; Black's foundation -- green for organic and black for the deep, almost black color of their chocolate. Sams, who has remained president of the company since it was bought by Cadbury in 2005 for £20 million (or $31 million), is working to engineer a buyout of Green &amp; Black's from Cadbury's behemoth owner Kraft. Fearing that Green &amp; Black's will lose its entrepreneurial spirit and its niche growth opportunities as Kraft divides its attention across its vast portfolio, Sams has considered options to secede from Kraft, such as a partial management buyout.

   Having been in business for more than a decade, Green &amp; Black's is unlike any large chocolate makers. It's generally credited with starting what has become the Fair Trade movement in the organic confectionery sector. (The Fair Trade movement, shepherded by the human rights group

   , has helped to eliminate child and slave labor and other abuses on cocoa plantations, as well as guarantee plantation workers a fair wage.)
