   We've come a long way, baby, but we still have a lot in common with the fruit fly. Exelixis, a pharmaceutical research and development firm, got its start analyzing genetic data from fruit flies and other organisms as a means to speed the development of drugs and other products. Its early genomic work has yielded a pipeline of drug candidates primarily in the area of cancer therapies, as well as some potential treatments for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Lead candidate Cometriq gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for treatment of thyroid cancer in late 2012 and was launched in the US in early 2013. Exelixis takes its name from the Greek word for evolution.

  <p>
   Exelixis has built upon its past in genomics research to become a full-fledged drug development company, focusing increasingly on its pharmaceuticals pipeline. Exelixis has historically relied on licensing and co-development partnerships to fund its operations. In fact, most of its development-stage candidates are licensed out to third parties, though the company retains some marketing rights on select candidates (including Cometriq). Development and licensing partners include
   <company id="10232">

   ,

    Genentech
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   . The company expects sales of Cometriq to further support its R&amp;D efforts.

  <p>
   The Exelixis-discovered cobimetinib compound, a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), is being studied by
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   and Genentech in collaboration with Exelixis. Roche has completed a Market Authorization Application (MAA) for the compound to be used in combination with vemurafenib in Europe; in the US, the FDA has granted the compound's New Drug Application. Another compound, XL888, is an HSP90 inhibitor under investigation.

  <p>
   Other pipeline products include METEOR (a phase III pivotal trial in second-line metastatic renal carcinoma) and CELESTIAL (a phase III pivotal trial in second-line hepatocellular cancer).

   In 2014, Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy accounted for 99% of the company's revenues. Commerical product Cometriq is distributed by Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy in the US market, and is warehoused and shipped by a third-party logistics firm.

   Exelixis contracts with third parties to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished drug products for use in clinical studies.

   As a development-stage company, Exelixis has struggled to turn a profit. It did manage to grow its revenues each year for several years by entering new partnerships and licensing agreements and by achieving milestone payouts on existing contracts, including a 55% increase to $289.6 million in 2011. However, the rise in revenue and was due primarily to accelerated payouts from discontinued licensing agreements, and therefore revenues dropped 84% the following year. Revenues have declined since then; in 2014 it decreased 20% to $25 million on lower license and contract revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss increased by 10% in 2014 to $268 million on higher R&amp;D costs related to an increase in clinical trial activity, as well as on charges related to a corporate restructuring initiated that year. Exelixis has lost money every year since its founding, with the exception of fiscal 2011. At the end of 2014, it has accumulated debt of $1.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 18% to $235 million in 2014 due to factors such as a decline in cash provided by clinical trial liability and changes in accounts payable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Exelixis is focused on development of proprietary, partnered, and licensed candidates for cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic candidates. In addition, it is focused on promoting Cometriq, as well as other candidates once they gain approval. Exelixis also seeks out new development and licensing partners to fuel its research programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cometriq (cabozantinib) was the company's main research focus prior to approval; in addition to the approved application for thyroid cancer, the company is developing Cometriq for treatment of prostate, breast, renal, and other cancers. In 2014 the drug was approved in Europe for the treatment of adults with progressive, unresectable medullary thyroid cancer. In 2015, the firm extended its agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum to support the distribution and commercialization of Cometriq in certain European markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   After cabozantinib failed in one of its phase III pivotal trials in 2014, Exelixis initiated a corporate restructuring, reducing its workforce. It recorded some $6 million in aggregate restructuring charges, of which approximately 95% was recorded that year. (The rest is expected to be recorded in 2015.) The company is changing its focus to other phase III pivotal trials of cabozantinib.

  <p>
   Also in 2014,
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (GSK) terminated the development of foretinib, returning it to Exelixis for development and commercialization; GSK remains entitled to a 3% royalty on net sales of any product with cabozantinib (including Cometriq) and a 4% royalty on net sales of any product containing foretinib.
