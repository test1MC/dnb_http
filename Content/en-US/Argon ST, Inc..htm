   Argon ST has the five C's of defense down: command, control, communications, computers, and combat. It also develops systems for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Together these areas are known as C5ISR. Electronic systems tailored for these purposes track, intercept, and interpret data needed to make mission decisions on land, at sea, or in the air. Argon ST's portfolio includes sensors that detect hostile signals and radar; ISR, force protection, geolocation, navigation, and threat warning systems; integrated communications networks; and engineering, integration, and training services. The

   subsidiary primarily serves the US defense and homeland security markets from about a dozen US offices.

  <p>
   Argon ST's products and systems are used on a broad range of military platforms, including ships, submarines, unmanned underwater vehicles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, land vehicles, fixed site installations, and relocatable land sites. It develops many of its systems by incorporating proprietary software and design processes with commercially available hardware and software in configurations that can be deployed or adapted to meet a customer's complex specifications on varied platforms. This approach can enable shorter development time and lower costs.ã€€Sales and Marketing

   In 2013 and 2012 the US Navy extended two contracts with Argon ST, worth a combined $100 million, for signals intelligence systems. In 2011 the company and partner Atair Aerospace received a $45 million contract from the Marine Corps for the procurement, testing, delivery, training, and logistical support of the Joint Precision Air Drop System Ultra Lightweight (JPADS-ULW), an aircraft deployed steerable canopy system that is capable of dropping large weights of disaster relief and medical supply cargo to military units on the battlefield.
