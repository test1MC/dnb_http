        <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Praxair's net revenues decreased by 12% due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation plus other factors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Revenues from North America decreased. Excluding currency and cost pass-through impacts, organic sales decreased due to lower volumes partially offset by higher pricing. Revenues also decreased from decline in sales to the metals, manufacturing and chemicals industries, lower on-site volumes to metals customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Europe revenues declined primarily due to unfavorable currency translation impacts. Excluding unfavorable currency impacts, sales increased due to higher volumes in Russia, Spain, Italy, and Germany and higher pricing. Volume growth was largely due to new on-site project start-ups in Russia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Revenues from South America decreased due to unfavorable currency translation impacts which reduced sales by 30%. Excluding currency and cost pass-through impacts, sales grew due to higher overall pricing, which was largely offset by lower volumes primarily in Brazil due to slower industrial production.
  </p>
        <p>
   Asia sales also decreased. Currency and cost pass-through of precious metals prices used in electronic materials end-markets reduced sales by 5%. Excluding these impacts, sales grew 1% primarily driven by the acquisition of an equity investment in 2014. Lower volumes were impacted by a sale of equipment in China in 2014, partially offset by an increase in volumes primarily from new project start ups in China, India, and Korea.
  </p>
        <p>
   Revenues from surface technologies decreased primarily due to negative currency impacts, and lower volumes to the manufacturing and energy end-markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Praxair's net income decreased by 9%  due to lower net sales and negative foreign currency translation impacts, partially offset by lower interest expense
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash from operating activities was decreased by 6% that year.

        <p>
   The company focuses on energy markets, emerging economies, and environmental applications to drive growth. New plant construction and expansion of existing facilities fuels much of the company's international growth, especially in Asia. Praxair continues to invest in growth geographically and is extending its presence in China and the Middle East.
  </p>
        <p>
   Praxair provides a competitive advantage to its customers by continuously developing new products and applications, which allow them to improve their productivity, energy efficiency and environmental performance.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company plans to continue to adapt to changes in macro-economic conditions, focus on productivity and stay well-positioned to capture market share in the geographies in which it operates. Praxair has invested $1.8 billion for future growth, primarily in new plants for customers under long-term contracts and truck-in- acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, it announced a significant expansion of US Gulf Coast production network with long-term agreement to supply hydrogen and hitroben to an ammonia complex being built in Texas.
  </p>
        <p>Also that year the company delivered volume growth from new project start-ups in Asia, Europe and North America.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Praxair is committed to growth via acquisitions. 
   In 2015 Praxair's acquisitions totaled $82 million, primarily acquisitions of packaged gases businesses in North and South America and an acquisition of a controlling interest of an equity investment in Asia.
</p>
        <p>
   That year the company acquired two independent distributors of industrial and specialty packaged gases and related supplies. it also signed an agreement to acquire
   <company id="132754">
    Yara International
   </company>
   's European CO2 business.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The origins of Praxair date to the work of Karl von Linde, a professor of mechanical engineering at the College of Technology in Munich, Germany, in the late 1800s. In 1895 he created the cryogenic air liquefier. Von Linde built his first oxygen-production plant in 1902 and a nitrogen plant in 1904, and in the first decade of the 20th century, he built a number of air-separation plants throughout Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   By 1907 von Linde had moved to the US and founded Linde Air Products in Cleveland, to extract oxygen from air. Linde Air Products joined rival
   <company id="11540">
    Union Carbide
   </company>
   in 1911 in experimenting with the production of acetylene; it became a unit of Union Carbide in 1917. America's war effort and economic expansion in the 1920s spurred the development of new uses for industrial gases. Union Carbide's Linde unit also contributed to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s, when its scientists perfected a process for refining uranium.
  </p>
        <p>
   As Union Carbide expanded worldwide over the next two decades, Linde became America's #1 producer of industrial gases. In the 1960s Linde expanded into oxygen-fired furnaces for steel production and the use of nitrogen in refrigerators. By the early 1980s Linde accounted for 11% of Union Carbide's annual sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   The disastrous 1984 chemical accident at Union Carbide's plant in Bhopal, India, coupled with heavy debt and falling sales, forced Union Carbide to reorganize. In 1992 Linde was spun off as Praxair. William Lichtenberger, former president of Union Carbide, headed the new company and pushed global expansion. Two years later Praxair set up China's first helium transfill plants for medical magnetic resonance imaging. In 1995 the company began operations in India and Peru.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Praxair Surface Technologies bought Miller Thermal (thermal spray coatings) and Maxima Air Separation Center (industrial and specialty gases, Israel). Also that year the company picked up $60 million when it sold the Linde name and trademark to
   <company id="91155">
    Linde
   </company>
   , a German engineering and industrial gas company. Praxair purchased and then spun off
   <company id="52871">
    Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron
   </company>
   . The company kept only its Liquid Carbonic division, the world's leading supplier of carbon dioxide for processing. The move opened up a new market in carbonated beverages for Praxair.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 and 1998 Praxair constructed plants and, to control its own delivery systems, acquired 20 packaged-gases distributors in the US and one in Germany. The company also formed a joint venture in China to produce high-purity nitrogen and other specialty gases for electronics and then teamed up with rival
   <company id="90734">
    L'Air Liquide
   </company>
   in a production joint venture.
  </p>
        <p>
   Praxair supplied an argon-based protection system for the Shroud of Turin's public display in Italy in 1998. It also installed the industry's first small on-site hydrogen-generating system at an Indiana powdered-metals plant. In 1999 the company formed a global alliance with German pharmaceutical and chemicals company
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   to provide gases and chemicals to the semiconductor industry. The same year Praxair acquired Materials Research Corporation, a maker of thin-film deposition materials for semiconductors, and the TAFA Group, which makes thermal-spray equipment and related products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Praxair underwent a restructuring that included layoffs in its surface technologies unit (hurt by the decline in jet orders) and Brazilian operations. The next year the company started work on a new plant to serve Singapore's high-tech industry. Praxair boosted its health care segment with the acquisition of Alpine Medicine.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004 Praxair Healthcare Services bought Home Care Supply for $245 million. With Home Care Supply joining the company's existing operations, the combined Healthcare Services unit grew its sales to $750 million worldwide, slightly more than 10% of Praxair's total annual sales. The home care market became more important for Praxair as the company saw high growth potential in it (and high margins) and wanted to be able to compete with rivals L'Air Liquide and
   <company id="10042">
    Air Products and Chemicals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   The company bought some of L'Air Liquide's German assets for about $650 million later that year. Due to antitrust requirements, the French company needed to dispose of the businesses after buying much of
   <company id="92102">
    Messer Group
   </company>
   earlier in the year. The acquisition put Praxair's European sales over $1 billion annually.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 Praxair sold the aviation repair business of the Surface Technologies unit to Gridiron Capital and Skyview Capital. The firms created a new company called PAS Technologies to house operations that serve both the commercial and military sectors with the repair of aviation engine and airframe parts and the application of protective coatings to those parts. Also that year, Praxair's distribution unit acquired Medical Gas of  Illinois and Withrow Oxygen Service of California.
  </p>
        <p>
   Praxair expanded its presence in the Middle East in 2010 by acquiring a 49% stake in the ROC Group's operations in Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Praxair sold its US homecare business to
   <company id="15527">
    Apria Healthcare
   </company>
   . The former Praxair segment provided home respiratory services, home medical equipment, and nutrition therapies through a network of more than 80 branches across the country. The transaction allowed Praxair to focus on expanding its institutional healthcare business worldwide, although it maintains some of its homecare units outside of the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the company spent $294 million on acquisitions, primarily for industrial and specialty packaged gas distributors in the US. It also invested in a joint venture in the Middle East and gained a larger ownership stake in its Scandinavian joint venture (Yara Praxair).
  </p>
        <p>
   That year Praxair also agreed to develop and market a new process technology with Midrex Technologies (a subsidiary of Kobe Steel) to produce direct reduced iron (DRI) using a variety of fuels, including coke oven gas. The company hopes to find new markets for the production of DRI, which is usually made from a gas produced from natural gas or coal.
  </p>
        <p>
   Subsidiary Praxair Distribution also expanded in 2011, acquiring Houston-based National Alloy and Equipment, which supplies technical support to makers of high-pressure control packages and drilling risers for oil and energy companies, and American Gas Group, one of the largest independent specialty gas producers in North America.
  </p>
        <p>
   Building on its presence in Russia, Praxair agreed to acquire the industrial and packaged gases operations of Russian tire company SIBUR - Russian Tyres in 2012. With four major projects in Russia having a total production capacity of more than 3,500 tons of gases per day under its belt, the company hopes to become the leading industrial gas manufacturer throughout southern Russia.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 it signed a 15-year agreement with Honeywell Resins &amp; Chemicals to buy carbon dioxide for Praxair's new plant at the Honeywell site.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year the company's Shanghai-based Praxair China unit started up a new air separation plant in Nanjing for Meishan Iron and Steel Co., a subsidiary of giant steel manufacturer Baosteel Group.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Praxair Canada acquired Canadian Cylinder &amp; Gases Inc., an independent distributor of industrial and specialty gases and welding equipment. It also acquired five Airgas branch locations in western Canada, including Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton, Alberta, and Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This acquisition supports its growth strategy in western Canada to better serve existing customers and home oxygen clients in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Praxair Distribution acquired Harlingen, Texas-based Acetylene Oxygen Company, a distributor of Praxair industrial gases. Praxair Distribution also acquired Welders Industrial Supply, LLC, an independent distributor of industrial and specialty gases, welding equipment, supplies and related services to customers in the greater Houston area.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 company opened its first air separation plant in Bahrain to produce liquid nitrogen, oxygen and argon to supply a diverse group of customers in the regional merchant market, including hospitals, metal fabricators, and aluminum manufacturers. That year Praxair China signed a new contract to expand supply with its existing customer, Jinlong Copper Co, Ltd., the largest copper smelting joint venture in China.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Praxair India Private Limited signed a long-term contract with its existing customer, JSW Steel Ltd., to expand the supply of gaseous oxygen, nitrogen and argon to JSW's steel mill located in Tornagallu in Karnataka.
