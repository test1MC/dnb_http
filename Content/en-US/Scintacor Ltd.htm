   Scintacor (formerly Applied Scintillation Technologies) is a maker of imaging and detection products that utilize phosphor and scintillation technologies. More simply put, Scintacor offers X-ray and other imaging devices that are used in the medical, dental, health physics, security, and instrumentation industries. Products include laser alignment devices, infrared digital cameras, neutron gamma detectors, photometers, and radiometers. Founded in 1920, the company was originally called Levy West Laboratory and was an early maker of phosphors (a substance that exhibits the phenomenon of luminescence) for X-ray machines. Members of its management (through an entity called TQ Scientific) bought the firm in 2007.

   Scintacor makes a range of X-ray screens for imaging in medical, dental, security, and non-destructive testing applications. It also makes glass scintillators for use in neutron detectors in well logging drilling systems (to help in the detection of oil). The company also provides alpha and beta particle scintillators, screens, and coatings for manufacturers of hand-held and fixed scanners (to detect contamination).

   The company uses a scientific staff and manufacturing team to help develop new products to add to its portfolio. Its academic relationships also contribute to the company keeping a diverse catalog of products ready to distribute to its customers.
