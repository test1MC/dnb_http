   Fulcrum BioEnergy doesn't let anything go to waste. The development-stage company has a plan to make biofuel out of garbage (garbage!) using a proprietary process to convert solid waste into ethanol, thus keeping it out of landfills.&#160;(The majority of ethanol produced in the US comes from corn, which still takes time and resources to grow and is subject to commodity prices). Fulcrum BioEnergy intends to build a plant that can produce 10 million gallons of ethanol per year using solid waste purchased from

   </company>
   and
   <company id="56446">
    Waste Connections
   </company>
   . Energy marketer

   has already agreed to sell its ethanol. Fulcrum BioEnergy filed a $115 million IPO in 2011 but withdrew it a year later.

   The company planned to use the proceeds from its IPO to build the plant at a site located outside Reno, Nevada. The plant will cost about $180 million, which will be financed through existing equity capital along&#160;with $10 million from

   in exchange for renewable energy credits. However, before it withdrew the IPO in November, citing unfavorable market conditions, the company received a&#160;$105 million loan from the

    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   for clean technology to fund a portion of construction costs.

   In addition, Fulcrum BioEnergy expects its biofuel will be eligible for federal and state tax incentives and credits issued for renewable fuel technologies. The company expects&#160;initial production to launch by 2014.
