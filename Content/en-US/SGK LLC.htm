The company provides digital prepress and other graphic services primarily for consumer product packaging, advertising, and point-of-sale marketing. It offers digital imaging, color separations, electronic retouching, and platemaking services for lithography, gravure, and flexography. Ultimately the company is responsible for manipulating images used to entice consumers to buy a product. The family of founder and chairman Clarence Schawk owns a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company. It has been in operation since 1953 and was acquired by

   Because its work is delivered through multiple mediums, SGK classifies its business into four categories. "At home" includes catalogs, circulars, and direct mail; "at the store" covers point-of-sale displays, in-store merchandising, and interactive displays; "on the shelf" refers to packaging; and "on the go" includes outdoor and mobile advertising. Graphic services account for most of SGK's sales. In addition, the company provides brand strategy and creative design services under the Anthem Group brand, as well as digital asset management, workflow management, and online proofing software.
