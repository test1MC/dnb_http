   The Western Sugar Cooperative beets the competition as a maker of refined sugar. The sugar beet cooperative boasts member-farmers located in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, and Wyoming -- states where it operates a handful of processing plants. Altogether, the grower-owned group maintains about 135,000 acres of farmland from which it harvests sugar beets. Western Sugar's products include a variety of items, from individual granulated-sugar packets to 100-pound bags of the sweet stuff. Products are sold to retail and industrial customers under the GW brand name. As part of its business, Western Sugar also refines sugar to be sold by others under private-label names.

   It packages its sugar into individual bags -- weighing between 1 pound and 100 pounds -- and in super sacks that weigh in at up to 2,300 pounds. The cooperative uses truck and rail transportation to get its products to customers and consumers.

   Western Sugar Cooperative maintains some 1,300 members. The group was formed in 2000 when a group of regional growers united to purchase the operations of Western Sugar from British sugar manufacturer
