   <company id="11175">

   </company>

  <p>
   About 50% of Astellas' sales come from its domestic market, with the rest coming from sales in other Asian, European, and North American countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Astellas holds sales and marketing and manufacturing operations in China, as well as sales offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Australia, and Singapore. It owns sales networks in more than 50 countries around the world.

  <p>
   Astellas markets its products through a direct sales force and through independent representatives. In Japan, it has a sales force of around 2,400 medical representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   While products are marketed to health professionals and consumers, the company's top customers are the drug wholesalers that distribute medications to the end-users, including
   <company id="57044">
    Suzuken
   </company>
   , which accounts for more than 10% of annual revenues.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Astellas has reported growth over the last few years, with the exception of fiscal 2013 (ended March). In 2014, revenues rose 16% to ¥1,139.9 billion on higher (or added) sales of XTANDI, BETMIGA, and Myrbetriq. In the Americas and EMEA, sales of VESIcare grew, while anticancer drug Tarceva sales rose in the Americas. Strong growth in China, which represents about half of earnings in the Asia region, also led to the increase in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased 2% to ¥90.8 billion in 2014 as general expenses roses and the company invested in its oncology operations in the US and EMEA region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 42% to ¥214 billion, primarily because of a change in inventories.

   Astellas is focused on enhancing its internal research and development operations to ensure an active pipeline and to combat  patent expirations for existing products. (It expects a decrease on sales of Prograf, Adenoscan, and Lexiscan in the Americas due to the impact of generics on the market.) The company also expands its R&amp;D programs by forming development partnerships and licensing or acquiring technologies from other companies, especially in the key growth markets of the US and Japan. In addition to the Lipitor licensing agreement with Pfizer, it has a marketing alliance to promote
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   's asthma therapy Symbicort in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Astellas is also focused on deepening its penetration in existing markets. In Japan, the company launched diabetes treatments Suglat and XTANDI in 2014. XTANDI was also approved for prostate cancer treatment that year. In addition, it launched irritable bowel syndrome drug Irribow OD Tablet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Launches in 2013 include VESOMNI for the treatment of protostatic hyperplasia (Europe), anti-hypertensive treatment Bisono (Japan), a new formulation of Prograf (the US), and XTANDI for prostate cancer (the UK).
  </p>
  <p>
   R&amp;D partnerships include the development of a prostate cancer treatment with
   <company id="148680">
    Medivation
   </company>
   and a marketing and development collaboration with
   <company id="93837">
    UCB

   on a rheumatoid arthritis drug. Other partners include

   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca

   (bipolar disorder), and
   <company id="56869">

   (organ transplant rejection). In 2013 it entered an alliance in Japan with
   <company id="139987">
    Amgen
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize five of Amgen's pipeline candidates. The following year, it struck up a partnership with ClearPath Development Company to build a portfolio of vaccines. And in 2015 it formed a new company (Kanyos Bio) with Anokion to develop diabetes and celiac disease drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2015, and agreement between Astellas and Pfizer Japan to distribute and promote Caduet (for the treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) in Japan was terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In emerging countries, especially China and Russia, the company is working to strengthen its sales platform.
