   Hansen Medical helps doctors maneuver through matters of the heart. The firm develops medical devices designed to diagnose and treat common types of cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats), such as atrial fibrillation. Its core portable Sensei system (used along with its Artisan and Lynx catheters) incorporates robotics to assist in guiding the movement of flexible catheters in such places as the atria and ventricles. Sensei has received

    FDA

   and European regulatory approval for certain uses, including manipulation and control of catheters during procedures to detect irregular heartbeats by mapping the electrical impulses of the heart. Technology firm Auris Surgical Robotics is buying Hansen for some $80 million.

  <p>
   The company markets its Sensei system and related products in the US through a direct sales force and in Europe through both direct sales and distributors. It also has a limited presence through distributors in other regions including Asia, the Middle East, and South Africa.

  <p>
   The company's revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year. It claimed $17 million in revenue for fiscal 2013 after bringing in $17.6 million in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   More alarming was the $55 million net loss Hansen suffered in fiscal 2013 after claiming a net loss of $22 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, the company's cash on hand has been trending downward year-over-year since fiscal 2010.

  <p>
   Hansen's manufacturing strategy involves assembling certain critical product parts in-house, while outsourcing less critical systems to third-party contractors. Developing new products is also a key driver of growth for the company.
