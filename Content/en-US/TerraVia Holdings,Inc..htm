   "We make oil" may seem like a strange statement, but in the case of TerraVia Holdings (formerly Solazyme), it's true. The company manufactures a variety of oils by feeding plant sugars to microalgae. Its "tailored oils" can be created to replace fuel and chemical, edible, or personal skin care oil traditionally derived from petroleum or animal fats. The microbial-based oils work with existing production, refining, and distribution infrastructure systems. TerraVia feeds its microalgae sugarcane, corn, and biomass-derived sugars; its oils cost half to a third as much to produce as traditional oils. The company also sells protein, fiber, and other system by-products.

  <p>
   The company's personal care product brand Algenist is sold in more than 1,300 retail stores in 17 countries including Canada, China, member countries of the EU, and Mexico.

   TerraVia's main commercial focus is on selling oil-based products, including tailored oils and powdered oils, to companies that use them as intermediates and ingredients. Its consumer-focused business commercializes branded products manufactured through the company's various proprietary processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   TerraVia has a 50-50 joint venture with industrial ingredient firm

   After experiencing sizable revenue growth over a five-year stretch, TerraVia's revenues dropped by 10% primarily due to a decrease in the R&amp;D program revenues as a result of decline in government program revenues, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in revenues from development agreements with the Solazyme Bunge JV and other strategic partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a net loss of $116.39 million in 2013 (compared to a net loss of $83.1 million in 2012), primarily due to an increase in the operating expenses as a result of higher S&amp;GA expenses (increased personnel-related and facilities-related costs of $5.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and higher marketing and promotional costs of $200,000, partially offset by lower outside service costs of $800,000).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 TerraVia posted cash outflow of $74.8 million (compared to cash outflow of $67.6 million in 2012), primarily due to a loss of $116.4 million, and a net change of $400,000 in net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $42 million. (Noncash charges include stock-based compensation, loss from equity method investments, revaluation of derivative liability, depreciation and amortization, net amortization of premiums on marketable securities and debt discount, and loan fee amortization).

   The company strives to be the global market leader in the design and production of renewable oils and related bioproducts through product innovation, joint ventures, and other partnerships. It also intends to expand geographically by signing agreements that provide access to feedstocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 its Algenist product line launched in
   <company id="14261">
    Nordstrom
   </company>
   locations throughout the US. The launch into Nordstrom's 'Advanced Skincare' category marks an important retail milestone for the brand, furthering distribution for the line. The skincare line features two microalgae ingredients (Alguronic Acid and Microalgae Oil).
  </p>
  <p>
   TerraVia moved into the oil and gas drilling fluids additive market in 2014, introducing Encapso, the world's first encapsulated biodegradable lubricant for drilling fluids designed to deliver high-grade lubricant precisely at the point of friction where and when needed most. Encapso's unique targeted lubricant delivery system helps reduce the costs for the oil and gas exploration and production industry and provides improved drilling performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company's joint venture with
   <company id="58878">
    Bunge
   </company>
   Global Innovation produced its first commercially saleable products on full-scale production lines, including a 625,000-liter fermentation tank at the Solazyme Bunge Renewable Oils plant in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 TerraVia entered into a multiyear agreement with Mitsui to jointly develop triglyceride oils for use primarily in the oleochemical industry. End-use applications include renewable, high-performance polymer additives for plastic applications, lubricants, and toiletry and household products.

  <p>
   The company used its $197.6 million from its 2011 IPO proceeds for R&amp;D, as a resource for future acquisitions, and as capital for manufacturing facility expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though TerraVia says it left the development stage in 2010 with the launch of its first product, it does still anticipate continued losses as it invests heavily in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and production ramp-up efforts. Part of the company's strategy includes moving from the nutrition and skin care markets, where it currently operates, into the fuel and chemicals markets. In that vein, it has development agreements with
   <company id="103877">
    Chevron
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemicals
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   to produce diesel, jet, and other fuels. In late 2010 TerraVia delivered more than 20,000 gallons of shipboard fuel to the Navy, at the time the world's largest delivery of 100% nonalcohol, microbial biofuel. Shortly thereafter, the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   contracted for an additional 150,000 gallons to be delivered in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   TerraVia was formed in 2003.
