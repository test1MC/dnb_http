   JFE Holdings has an iron will unmatched in Japan and much of the rest of the world. The "J" in JFE stands for Japan; "F" is for
   <em>
    Fe
   </em>
   , the chemical symbol for iron; and "E" stands for engineering. JFE Holdings' steel business unit, JFE Steel, accounts for about 85% of total sales and manufactures steel products such as bars, pipes, steel frames, tubes and stainless steel for the automotive, construction, and petroleum industries. JFE is among the world's largest steel companies, ranking behind

  <p>
   While most of its steel production facilities are in Japan, JFE's reach is global, and it has offices in 12 other countries.

   JFE's engineering unit makes designs and builds facilities such as gasifying and melting furnaces, water purification plants, steelworks plants and equipment, and steel structures used in the energy, environmental, and steel structural sectors. Its shipbuilding unit constructs both merchant and military vessels in several Japanese ports, including Kyoto and Yokahama. JFE's urban development unit develops large-scale condominium complexes using large plots of undeveloped land, while its microelectronics (LSI) division includes Kawasaki Microelectronics, which produces integrated circuits for digital cameras.

  <p>
   The company's revenues decreased by a marginal 1% (in local currency) in fiscal year 2012 to a decrease in sales in the  steel, urban development, and LSI segments due to a decline in demand, which was partially offset by an increase in sales in the engineering and shipbuilding segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, its net income decreased by 163% in local currency in fiscal year 2012 due to a drop in operating income and ordinary income and a loss on the valuation of overseas investments.

   The company buys and sell steel companies and other assets as it seeks to deliver the best returns for its shareholders.

  <p>
   In 2012 JFE Steel agreed to acquire threading business and related assets of US-based Benoit Machine LLC through holding company Benoit Holding, jointly owned by JFE Steel and
   <company id="111267">
    Kanematsu USA
   </company>
   , a subsidiary of
   <company id="52020">
    Kanematsu
   </company>
   . The deal will enable JFE Steel and Kanematsu to establish a total supply chain for the manufacture, threading and distribution of oilfield tubing and downhole accessories, and thereby meet diversified needs in the oil and gas industry and capture growing demand for oilfield tubing going

   On the other side of the ledger, in 2012 JFE Steel sold part of its stake in South Korean steelmaker
   <company id="152811">
    Hyundai Hysco
   </company>
   to the
   <company id="41056">
    Hyundai Group
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amont. The stake was cut to below 8%. JFE Steel supplies hot-rolled steel sheet to Hyundai Hysco for the construction and automobile industries, but Hyundai has stepped up its steel production and reduced the need for imports.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 JFE Steel acquired all shares of Toyohira Steel it did not already own, taking full control of the company. Toyohira, a Sapporo-based electronic furnace steelmaker, is a wholly owned subsidiary of JFE Steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, JFE Steel acquired a 24% stake in  Pancheng Yihong Pipe Co., a China-based maker of seamless pipes for oilfields, in a stock-purchase deal. Following the investment, JFE jointly owns the company along with China's Chengdu Steel &amp; Vanadium Co. (51%) and another Japanese company,
   <company id="114673">
    Marubeni-Itochu Steel
   </company>
   (25%).
