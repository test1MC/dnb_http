   MAP Pharmaceuticals knows that a good drug can become a better drug when delivered quickly. The company has developed an inhalation technology and is applying it to existing drugs. Its two lead candidates include a treatment for migraine and a treatment for pediatric asthma. Inhaled drugs can be delivered conveniently and work more quickly than other delivery methods. The company's other candidates include possible treatments for diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). By focusing on improving the delivery system rather than inventing the actual drug, MAP Pharmaceuticals hopes to reduce some of the risk of the development process. The company has been acquired by

  <p>
   In order to try to ensure migraine drug LEVADEX (dihydroergotamine)'s market success, MAP Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Allergan for some $958 million in early 2013.

  <p>
   LEVADEX (dihydroergotamine) has been used for over 50 years, but has only been administered intravenously or nasally. If MAP Pharmaceuticals' version is successful, it will be available for patients to use at home. However, LEVADEX's approval was delayed in 2012 as the

    FDA

   requested that MAP Pharmaceuticals address certain third-party manufacturing issues.

  <p>
   Allergan and MAP Pharmaceuticals previously formed a marketing agreement in 2011 to jointly develop and sell LEVADEX to specialists in the US and Canada. MAP received an upfront payment of $60 million plus $100 million in potential milestones.

   Founded in 2003, MAP Pharmaceuticals has been using the proceeds from its 2007 initial public offering to fund clinical trials for its drugs in development.
