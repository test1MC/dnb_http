   Finicky dog? Short fuse? Ensign-Bickford Industries' (EBI) potentially has a fix for both problems. Through its subsidiaries -- Aerospace &amp; Defense (EBA&amp;D), AFB International, EnviroLogix, DanChem, and Ensign-Bickford Realty Corporation -- the company manufactures one-shot systems for military demolition, combat explosives, and space (flight initiation and termination) applications, as well as taste enhancers (Optimizor brand) for pet foods. The company also provides agricultural diagnostic test kits to detect markers for genetically modified organisms (GMO), specialty chemical products, biomass wood pellets for energy and animal bedding, and real estate services.

   Operating through its five diverse companies is a part of EBI's growth and diversification strategy. The company's businesses not only function on a standalone platform, but also offer partnering opportunities among existing subsidiaries. EBI focuses on its separate businesses to make each subsidiary a leader in its respective field.

   The company's core EBA&amp;D business segment caters to the commercial, as well as military markets. It makes ignition systems for aerospace customers, and breaching systems, which are essentially lightweight explosive strips that can be easily carried and used in the battlefield by military troops.

   EBI is focused on growing its core EBA&amp;D business and AFB International operations through acquisitions. In early 2013, EBA&amp;D acquired Rocketstar Robotics, a provider of motors, gearboxes, and actuator mechanisms for spacecraft applications such as the driving of solar arrays or the positioning of communication antennae.
