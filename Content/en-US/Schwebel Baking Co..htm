   Schwebel Baking produces a noseful of wonderful aromas. As one of the fastest-growing independent wholesale bakers in America, it bakes bagels, bread, buns, rolls, pita bread, and tortillas for the consumer food industry. The company's brands include Schwebel's, Sun-Maid, Roman Meal, Country Hearth, Milton's, Vogel's, and Aladdin's. Its products are available in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York at retail food stores, restaurants, and more than 30 company-owned bakery outlet stores. It also licenses its brands to other producers, and customers can have bread shipped directly to their homes. Schwebel Baking was founded in 1906 by Joseph and Dora Schwebel and remains a family-owned and -operated company.
