   For Aptina, image is everything. The company is a leader in CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) imaging technology. Its digital image sensor components and processors are used in standard digital still and video cameras, as well as cameras built into mobile phones, PCs, and surveillance equipment. The company also makes sensors for medical imaging scopes (used in colonoscopies, for example) and automobile cameras that enable rear view images. Aptina partners with mobile handset makers and camera component designers and distributes its products from offices in North America, Europe, and Asia.

    ON Semiconductor
   </company>
   bought Aptina in 2014 for $400 million.

  <p>
   On Semiconductor acquired Aptina from Micron Technology and investment firms Riverwood Capital and TPG Capital. ON expects to place the Aptina operations in a business segment focused on imaging products. Micron Technology formed Aptina in 2008, spun it off in 2009 and sold 65% of its ownership in Aptina to the investment firm.

  <p>
   The company's world-leading pixel technology is the basis for Aptina's cutting-edge CMOS image sensors. It uses its proven image processing prowess to create top line visual data into clear and accurate pictures and video.

  <p>
   Patents and innovation (such as Aptina Clarity+, which delivers high-quality, rich images in challenging environments) are a critical component of Aptina's growth strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   To enhance Aptina's  product portfolio and to address the broad range of automotive viewing applications, in 2014, the company introduced their ASX350AT system-on-chip (SOC) and the AR0140AT image sensor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aptina's automotive applications were a large part of the reason ON Semiconductor bought the company. Backed by ON's sales and marketing resources, Aptina could see expansion in the market.

   Following LFoundry's purchase of
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   Italia's semiconductor fabrication facility in Avezzano, Italy, in 2013 Aptina formed a partnership with LFoundry to continue the make CMOS image sensors in Avezzano, Italy. (Aptina has a long history with the Avezzano facility and has shipped more than a 1 billion image sensors manufactured at this location).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it signed a patent cross-license agreement with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   , which provides each company with access to the other's patent portfolio. (Aptina's patent portfolio is the largest and strongest in the image sensor industry).

  <p>
   Aptina added to its research and development bench with the acquisition of the Color Filter Array assets from Micron. The assets should enable Aptina to speed up its R&amp;D cycle.
