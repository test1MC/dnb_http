Its products portfolio includes the ON-Q brand of portable infusion pumps and catheters that deliver anesthetic pain medications directly to wound sites, as well as disposable items that aid in the administration of chemotherapies and antibiotics. The company also offers a suite of kits and trays used in performing peripheral nerve blocks. A subsidiary of

  <p>
   The bulk of I-Flow's sales come from its regional anesthesia product line, which includes the ON-Q system. I-Flow has been focused on growing its core regional anesthesia segment, especially by working to boost ON-Q sales in the post-surgical pain market through increased marketing efforts. The company promotes the ON-Q system as a means for health care facilities to reduce costs by allowing for faster patient recovery due to ON-Q's use of local anesthetics, which numb the wound area and reduce the need for narcotic therapy. Its alliance with the larger Kimberly-Clark organization helps I-Flow make progress toward this goal.
