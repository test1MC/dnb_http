   Quady Winery wants everyone to enjoy the sweet life. The winery specializes in dessert wines made from rare Muscat grapes as well as port (wine with brandy added). Quady also makes extra dry and sweet vermouth under the Vya Vermouth label. It ships ports and aperitif bottles under several labels, including Essensia, Elysium, Red Electra, and Electra. Shipments are made direct to consumers where allowed by law, about 20 US states; other areas are served via distributors, such as

   </company>
   . Quady, located in California's Central Valley, also does business in nearly 20 international markets. The company traces its roots to 1975 when president Andrew Quady began making port at his home.
