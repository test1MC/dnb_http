   (ATIC). GLOBALFOUNDRIES operates five 200mm manufacturing plants in Singapore and three 300mm plants in Dresden, Germany; Malta, New York, and Singapore. Its plants have a combined production capacity of more than 7 million wafers per year. As the second-largest foundry in the world, it counts more than 150 customers, including AMD,

   Wafer fabrication facilities (or fabs) are multibillion-dollar facilities to build and maintain; many semiconductor companies are chip design firms that contract out their manufacturing to silicon foundries, chip makers that provide wafer fabrication services.

   The company's eight wafer manufacturing plants are located in Dresden, Germany; Malta, New York, and Singapore. It also maintains a global network of R&amp;D, design enablement, sales, and customer support operations in China, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.

   GLOBALFOUNDRIES aims to position itself as the partner of choice for companies needing advanced analog, digital, high voltage, and RF functionality, but at the economy of scale that only 300mm can provide. (300mm wafers are more cost effective than 200mm because the surface area allows for more ICs per wafer and thus less cost per chip.) To that end, the company is expanding its plants in Singapore to make room for one of them to produce nearly 1 million 300mm wafers per year.

   , it has produced higher performing and more efficient transistors and interconnects, the two fundamental building blocks of chip designs. Previously the company introduced high K metal gate technology for the 32/28nm nodes. Its 28nm-SLP technology is designed for smartphones to offer faster processing speeds, smaller feature sizes, lower standby power, and longer battery life.
