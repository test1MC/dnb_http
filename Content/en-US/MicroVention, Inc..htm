   MicroVention is into interventions. The company makes the MicroPlex Coil System and HydroCoil Embolic System, two endovascular products for treating cerebral aneurysms. The coils, which come in various sizes, are inserted into the problem arteries and either work to expand the artery or clear and support the aneurysm. Some 50,000 people in the US suffer from aneurysms, which frequently do not cause any obvious symptoms but can cause a stroke if ruptured. The company's other neurological offerings include occlusion balloons, flow diverters, and intraluminal stents. MicroVention was founded in 1997 and is owned by Japanese medical device firm
