  <p>
   The company was founded in 1864 by Joseph Bradford Sargent and his two brothers as a general hardware manufacturing business.  In the post-war era SARGENT began to narrow its product offerings to locks and door-related mechanisms. The company was acquired by Swedish lock manufacturer Assa Abloy in 1996.
