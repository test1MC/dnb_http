   Founded in 1912, Ebara's products keep fluids flowing, air and water clear, and networks humming. The company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of industrial pumps and related equipment. The Fluid Machinery &amp; Systems segment makes standard pumps, custom pumps, and compressors. The Environmental Engineering unit is engaged in contract engineering, procurement, and the construction and the operation of incineration facilities (mainly in Japan). The Precision Machinery unit makes chemical mechanical polishers, wafer carrier washers, and solder-plating equipment for use in the manufacture of semiconductors and other high-precision devices. More than 50% of Ebara's total sales come from outside Japan.

   The company was established in 1912 as Ebara Corporation. It set up a plant near Tokyo to manufacture centrifugal pumps.

   In April 2009 the group realigned its operations by consolidating its water treatment businesses into a water treatment company and a waste water treatment company. The integration creates a business entity known as Ebara Engineering Services (EES) that runs the gamut of water treatment needs from treatment facilities construction to maintenance, control, and management. In 2010 Ebara joined with Mitsubishi and JGC in acquiring a one-third share each of EES, creating a consortium in the global water market.
