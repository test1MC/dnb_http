   Medifast tries to help people slim down and shape up... fast. The company develops and sells Medifast brand health and diet products including food and beverages (meal replacement shakes, bars), as well as disease management products for diabetics. Subsidiary Jason Pharmaceuticals makes some of the company's products. Medifast operates through two segments, Medifast and MWCC and Wholesale. Medifast includes Direct (customers order Medifast products online) and Take Shape for Life (personal coaching division with independent contractor "health coaches"). MWCC and Wholesale covers Medifast Weight Control Centers' (MWCC) bricks-and-mortar walk-in clinics while Wholesale includes doctor's offices that sell the products.

  <p>
   Medifast, the direct and coaching part of the business, makes up 85% of revenue. MWCC and Wholesale, the weight control centers and wholesale division, makes up the rest. The company has about 50 company-owned weight loss centers and 70 franchised locations though it's transitioning many company-owned shops to franchisees. Medifast has about 20 weight loss centers outside the US.

  <p>
   Currently, the company has about 50 company-owned weight loss centers in about half a dozen states, including Florida, New Jersey, and Texas; it is transitioning many locations to franchisees. About 70 weight loss centers in six other states, including Arizona and California, are run by franchisees. Medifast has about 20 weight loss centers in South America (mostly Mexico).

   Medifast uses multiple marketing strategies to reach its target audiences. It runs ads in national and regional magazines, on television, radio, and the Web. It also uses direct mail and social media channels. Advertising costs (excluding direct-response advertising) totaled $24 million in 2013, compared with $31 million in 2012.

   Medifast's sales and profits were growing with the rise in obesity rates and the diabetic population. Indeed, its sales increased 255% between 2007 and 2013, while profits and cash flow also climbed steeply. However, in 2013 the company reported flat revenue of $257 million as sales fell in all areas except the Take Shape for Life coaching segment. Net income, on the other hand, rose 50% after declining for several years. The turnaround is attributed to a decline in expenses including an

   lawsuit settlement and other one-time expenses that were on the books for 2012. Cash flow has been growing steadily for several years and in 2013 it grew $2 million to $42 million.

   While the ranks of the overweight are growing, the company is also working to tailor its products to the rapidly growing population of diabetics. It maintains an in-house call center and support staff, with registered dieticians on hand to assist customers.

   Medifast's promotion and distribution model has changed over time. When it was founded in 1993, the company primarily sold its products through doctor's offices. Customers received supervision from their family physician, who, in turn, received commissions on any products sold. However, as physicians had increasingly less time to spend with patients, the method grew less effective. While some doctors still stock an inventory and resell the company's products, most of Medifast's sales are made through the its website, thus reducing the complexity of its product distribution. Even its Take Shape For Life coaches simply direct customers to the website or call centers and receive commissions for orders placed there. New doctors who wish to promote the products are signed on as coaches.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company moved into international territory by partnering with Productos Medix,  a leader in pharmaceutical obesity products in Mexico, to exclusively distribute its Medifast meal replacement products and programs through physicians and Weight Control Centers in Mexico under its Medifast brand. By the end of the year, the two companies had three locations in Mexico. The following year they opened a center in Colombia. In 2014 Medifast bought 21 centers in Mexico and opened its first Canadian center.
