   One of Japan's leading steel companies, Kobe Steel (aka Kobelco) makes more than enough wire and rod to cage its markets. A diversified manufacturer, Kobe Steel also makes aluminum, copper, and titanium products, and it produces welding products, such as welding robots, and industrial machinery, including compressors and crushers. The company also provides wholesale power supply, operating two power plants in Kobe. Kobe Steel's real estate division rents, manages, and sells properties. Kobe Steel's joint venture with

   Kobe Steel's operations are vast. Indeed, the firm lists more than 210 subsidiaries and more than 55 affiliated companies. Its foundation and largest business segment is iron and steel production, representing more than 35% of its sales; construction machinery, and aluminum and copper production each account for about 20% of sales. The firm's natural resources and engineering business offers engineering products and services to the energy, oil refining, and chemical industries. Kobe Steel's environmental business, Kobelco Eco-Solutions, is active in waste water treatment, waste disposal, and recycling. Kobelco Construction Machinery specializes in hydraulic excavators and is active in fast-growing markets, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The company also makes cranes.

   Japan accounts for nearly two-thirds of Kobe Steel's sales. However, its international business is growing quickly: tripling its percentage contribution to Kobe's total sales over the past few years. China is a major foreign market, accounting for nearly 10% of sales. The company's US arm,

   , is located in New York and Michigan.

        <p>
   Kobe Steel also has offices in Singapore and Thailand.

   Kobe Steel's fiscal 2016 (ended March) sales dropped by 3.5% to ¥1,823 billion, despite similar levels of sales volume to 2015, due to a decline in steel sales price as the result of lower primary raw material prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income plunged. The company reported a net loss of ¥21.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to net income of ¥86.6 billion in fiscal 2015 due to lower revenue and higher costs and charges. It was primarily due to lower demand for copper products in China and the rapid decline of the construction machinery segment in that country (causing the company to post extraordinary losses of ¥39.5 billion).
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities dropped by ¥55.2 billion to ¥97.9 billion, due to higher costs brought on by weaker market conditions.

        <p>
   Japan's long-suffering economy has Kobe Steel looking abroad for growth, particularly to emerging markets (including China, India, Thailand, and Vietnam) where infrastructure improvements are driving demand for iron and steel, other metals, and heavy construction machinery.
  </p>
        <p>
   Long term, Kobe Steel is looking to grow its business around three core segments -- Materials, Machinery, and Electric Power.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016 Kobe Steel opened a steel wire venture in Mexico, broke ground on a US-based aluminum extrusion plant, and set up a joint venture in Japan to treat radioactive waste.
  </p>
        <p>
   Streamlining its business portfolio, in 2016 the company created the Electric Power segment to take over the electric supply business operated by the Iron &amp; Steel business at Kobe Works, and two power generation projects (Moka, Tochigi Prefecture, and Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture).
  </p>
        <p>
   That year it created the Construction Machinery segment by merging subsidiaries Kobelco Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. and Kobelco Cranes Co., Ltd. The company also boosted the Engineering segment with the inclusion of the Kobelco Eco-Solutions unit.
