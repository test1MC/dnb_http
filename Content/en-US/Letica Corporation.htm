   Letica has containers by the gallon -- and other sizes as well. Owned by the Letica family, Letica Corp. is a maker of plastic packaging, from buckets to cups, some of which use recycled material. The company produces one- to seven-gallon commercial containers, often with multi-color labels. In addition to a rigid packaging segment, Letica's Maui foodservice packaging offers plastic injection-molded, thin-wall containers and lids, and paper containers. Products are transported to customers and backhauled by Letica Freightlines. Letica's lineup is sold to paint, chemical, and food packaging industries, as well as building material suppliers, hardware stores, and restaurant outlets nationwide.

   The company manages to maintain market share by improving its production processes and introducing new products. It has developed a production process to print buckets as they are molded, reducing labeling time and expense. Letica also introduced the hinged lid that stays attached to a lightweight rectangular plastic container, offering an attractive, easy closure with a tamper proof tab. Dubbed Smart Seal, the package is a popular container for consumer goods, like drink mixes.

        <p>
   The company was founded in 1968 by Ilija Letica. It evolved from a manufacturer of five gallon plastic container (the industry standard for commercial applications) to more than a dozen facilities dotting the US that churn out a slew of packaging products and applications. In mid-2010 its corporate headquarters and technical center received ISO 9001:2008 certification, confirming Letica's consistent use of design, development, and manufacturing process standards.
