  <p>
   The company looks for strategic growth through acquisitions, organic growth initiatives, investment in new production capabilities, and in creating packaging design and innovation. In 2014 Ampac introduced the Design and Sample Lab (DASL), from which it can quickly produce custom sample concepts and technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ampac has added new machine capabilities like the Windmoeller &amp; Hoelscher (W&amp;H) rotogravure printing press (in 2013), and the Mamata VegaPlus 1000 bag/pouch machine and a Nordmeccanica Duplex Combi Horizontal laminator (in 2012). The addition of the machines helps the company reinforce its commitment to the growth of the flexible pouch and better serve existing and new customers' needs for value-added laminations, bags, and pouches.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, Ampac added Pour &amp; Lok, a foldable zipper applied to film in the side gusset area of a package, and Inno-Lok, a patented method of applying a reclosable zipper transversely to packaging films.
