   AirBoss of America is one of the largest custom rubber compounding and mixing enterprises in North America. AirBoss caters to manufacturers of everything from tires and conveyor belts to auto parts and gas masks. Its rubber compounding subsidiary supplies mixed rubber for transportation and industrial parts manufacturing. Hand, foot, and respiratory protective wear for defense markets is developed and sold through an Engineered Products subsidiary. This subsidiary also produces calendared and extruded rubber products for industrial and recreational OEMs. SunBoss Chemical sources chemicals used in the rubber compounding business.

  <p>
   AirBoss sells its products to industrial customers, the automotive industry, and the defense, first response, and healthcare markets. In 2015, sales to five customers represented 32% of its net sales compared to 30% in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rubber compounds are sold through trained sales personnel with access to significant technical resources. Defense products are primarily marketed to customers in North America (including the Canadian and US armed forces) directly by in-house business development and contract managers, and to its international customers through both direct sales efforts and a network of independent agents. Automotive products are primarily marketed to customers (vehicle manufacturers and their Tier I/II suppliers) directly through in-house sales and business development personnel.

  <p>
   AirBoss has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at $305 million in 2015, a company milestone. Its profits, however, fell 3% to $13 million in 2015 mainly due to additional general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations has also fluctuated wildly over the years; after falling in 2014, cash flow jumped 48% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Automotive division sales increased 14% in 2015, particularly due to additional demand for bushings, dampeners, and induction bonding segments. This was fueled by increased demand in the light truck segment across all manufacturers combined with improved customer penetration through the sale of a broader product mix to key customers.
