   UPG operates more than 450 plastics processing machines and has 1 million sq. ft. of manufacturing space. Because of the slow US auto industry, UPG has diverted its energy towards other endeavors, such as the medical industry. In recent years the company has expanded its clean room facilities at its Minnesota manufacturing facility and also doubled its clean rooms in California and China, and will continue to focus on this market.
  </p>
        <p>
   Each year the medical market accounts for around 40% of UPG' total sales; the remainder is divided among the electronics, consumer, industrial, and custom automotive sectors.
