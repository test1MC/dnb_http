  <p>
   As a fabless semiconductor company, Cirrus Logic outsources its manufacturing functions to various contractors, which make the company's chips, package them, and test the finished products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Portable Audio products carry the sales load for Cirrus. The line, which includes analog and mixed-signal components designed for smartphones, tablets, digital headsets, wearables, and portable media players, accounted for 85% of revenue in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other 15% of revenue came from the company's Non-Portable Audio products, which include smart home applications, devices for the automotive, energy, and industrial markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cirrus Logic has offices in sales offices in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 70% of revenue comes from customers in China with another 17% from customers in South Korea. Cirrus gains 6% of revenue from US customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cirrus Logic uses both direct and indirect sales channels. The company counts some 2,500 customers, but its core base is highly concentrated - its top 10 customers account for about 89% of sales. While 66% of its sales were from Apple (through contract manufacturers) in 2016 (ended March), that's down from 80% in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 (ended March) sales jumped 28% to $1.2 billion, compared to 2015. Portable product sales leaped 34% higher on increases in smart codecs and boosted amplifiers as well as a full year of revenue from the Wolfson acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income zoomed 124% to $123.6 billion in 20916 from 2015. The revenue increase more than made up for increased expenses, which included a 36% rise in research and development costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations slowed to $155 million in 2016 from $163.5 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Cirrus depends on cranking out new technologies that offer optimal sound with low power to maintain its place in devices. It revved up R&amp;D in 2015 (ended March) by $71 million for a total of $269 million to keep its technology edge.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company released CS47L90, which it calls its flagship codec. It offers "always on' voice activation, noise reduction, active noise cancellation, echo cancellation, and speaker protection.

  <p>
   Cirrus has, over the years, made acquisitions to fill in its product portfolio and bring additional technologies into its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought Wolfson Microeletronics for $467 million in 2014. Wolfson added to the portable audio product lineup at Cirrus.

  <p>
   Suhas Patil, a professor who had developed a chip-level software system for controlling disk drives while at
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   , founded Patil Systems in 1981. When his firm failed to find buyers for its advanced products, Patil sought advice from semiconductor executive Michael Hackworth. Impressed with the products' possibilities, Hackworth joined Patil Systems as CEO. In 1984 the company was renamed Cirrus Logic, after the high-flying clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company initially focused on chips for computer peripherals, but during the 1980s it also began making chips for PCs. It debuted the first controller chips small enough to be built directly into a disk drive unit, an advance that prompted the PC industry's shift to smaller-profile disk drives. When
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   introduced its Video Graphics Array (VGA) graphics display standard in 1987, Cirrus Logic quickly followed with the market's first VGA controller chip.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cirrus Logic went public in 1989. Its 1991 acquisitions of Crystal Semiconductor and Pixel Semiconductor provided it with access to audio and video technology for the multimedia and fax/modem markets. It bought PC graphics chip maker Acumos in 1992 and Pacific Communication Sciences (products for cellular communications) in 1993. The next year it bought PicoPower Technology, a maker of system controller chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Cirrus Logic sold its wireless infrastructure equipment unit to
   <company id="12487">
    ADC Telecommunications
   </company>
   . That year the company formed wafer fabrication joint venture Cirent with
   <company id="46656">
    Lucent
   </company>
   's microelectronics unit (which became
   <company id="102887">
    Agere Systems
   </company>
   , later acquired by
   <company id="13932">
    LSI Corp.
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   An industry downturn led Cirrus Logic to cut its workforce by 13% in 1996, and by another 15% in 1997. That year Patil stepped away from the company's day-to-day operations (he continued to serve as chairman emeritus and a director) and Hackworth became chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998, continuing to expand its offerings, Cirrus Logic debuted products for DVDs. In response to a prolonged slump in the semiconductor industry, it eliminated its PC graphics and video accelerator product lines and sold voice compression technology subsidiary Nuera Communications to management. Also that year Cirrus Logic spun off its PC modem business as Ambient Technologies.
   <company id="10112">
    Analog Devices
   </company>
   VP/GM David French was named president and COO in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 about 500 more employees were laid off. In an effort to phase out more of its wafer fabrication operations, the company that year handed over control of its MiCRUS joint venture (founded in 1994) to partner IBM and transferred its ownership of Cirent to Lucent (now
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ). Also that year French became CEO; Hackworth remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Cirrus Logic moved its headquarters from Fremont, California, to Austin, Texas. The next year the company announced that it would focus growth efforts on semiconductors used in consumer entertainment devices. Despite historically dismal conditions in the chip industry, Cirrus Logic took steps to pursue this strategy in 2001, when it acquired private chip makers Peak Audio (digital audio hardware and software), LuxSonor ($65 million, DVD video processors), ShareWave ($92 million, wireless home networking chips and software), and Stream Machine ($110 million, digital video encoding chips).
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2001 the company announced that it would lay off about 300 workers -- 30% of its staff -- in the face of continued poor conditions in the global chip market. The next year Cirrus exited the magnetic storage chip business in order to focus on products for the consumer entertainment market. In 2003 the company announced more job cuts and discontinued the wireless product line acquired as part of the ShareWave acquisition. It also sold its chip testing facilities to ChipPAC (now part of
   <company id="99593">
    STATS ChipPAC
   </company>
   ), which in turn supplied Cirrus Logic with assembly, test, and packaging services.
  </p>
  <p>
   As conditions in the worldwide semiconductor market turned choppy again in 2004, Cirrus Logic had a 7% reduction in force, more than 50 workers, mostly affecting employees in California and Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company received $25 million from a legal settlement with
   <company id="52869">
    Amkor Technology
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu
   </company>
   , and Sumitomo Bakelite. The litigation was over faulty semiconductors sold by Cirrus to Fujitsu. Cirrus and Fujitsu first sued each other in 2001; Amkor and Sumitomo were added as parties to the litigation (which shifted from federal court to state court) in 2003. The insurance carriers for the four vendors reached a settlement through arbitration in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year Cirrus Logic sold its digital video IC product line to Magnum Semiconductor, an entity formed by investors led by
   <company id="42861">
    Investcorp
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56711">
    August Capital Management
   </company>
   . The company received a minority equity stake in Magnum Semi for the assets of the digital video line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Cirrus acquired Shanghai-based Caretta Integrated Circuits for about $10 million in cash. Caretta designed power management ICs for the large, single-cell lithium-ion battery market.
  </p>
  <p>
   David French resigned as president and CEO in 2007 after a special committee of the board investigated the company's past practices in granting stock options and found that French was significantly involved in backdating certain option grants. Chairman Michael Hackworth stepped in as acting president and CEO. VP/GM Jason Rhode, a Cirrus Logic employee since 1995, was named to succeed French as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   's Division of Enforcement informed Cirrus Logic that its informal investigation of the company's historical stock option practices, initiated a year earlier, was elevated to a formal inquiry. The SEC later notified the company that the inquiry was concluded and the commission's staff was not recommending any enforcement action against the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cirrus acquired Apex Microtechnology for $42 million in cash in 2007. Apex Micro developed precision high-power analog amplifiers for aerospace and industrial applications, used in motors, piezoelectrics, programmable power supplies, and other devices. Founded in 1980, the company (also known as Apex Precision Products) had some 1,200 customers, with about $20 million in annual sales, and employed around 90 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company decided that things weren't working out with Caretta Integrated Circuits, in terms of its long-term strategic plan. It shut down the subsidiary and laid off about 30 employees in China as a result.
  </p>
  <p>
   The global financial crisis of 2008, which restricted the worldwide availability of credit, destabilized the general economy and triggered a significant slowdown in orders for Cirrus Logic.
