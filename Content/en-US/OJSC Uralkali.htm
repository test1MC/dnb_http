   A shot of Vitamin K helps farmers grow bigger and better crops. Uralkali is on the world's top producers of potash, a form of potassium carbonate commonly used as a fertilizer. The company produces 13 million tons of potash per year, or more than 20% of the world's supply (putting it head to head with Canada's

   </company>
   which also produces about 13 million tons a year.) Uralkali operates two major potash fields in Russia, five production plants, and seven ore treatment mills. The company's key markets for its potash products are Brazil, India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the US, and the European Union.

        <p>
   Uralkali has operations in the towns of Berezniki and Solikamsk (Perm Region, Russia), and at the Verkhnekamskoye potassium and magnesium salt field, the world's second largest deposit in terms of ore reserves. It serves markets around the world.

   The company's assets consist of five mines and seven ore-treatment mills (six potash mills and one carnallite plant) and a sodium chloride plant. Uralkali also holds the development licenses for the Ust-Yayvinsky and Polovodovsky blocks at the Verkhnekamskoye field, which contain ore reserves of 1.3 and 3.2 billion tons, respectively.

   Growing its export market, in 2013 Belarusian Potash Company (a joint venture trader of Uralkali and Belaruskali and the world's leading potash fertilizer exporter), signed a year-long deal with Indian Potash Ltd, the major Indian fertilizer importer, for potash deliveries.

        <p>
   That year, Uralkali secured Russian Federal Agency for Subsoil Use approval for the extension of the terms of exploration and mining for the licenses at Uralkali's working mines. The licenses for the Ust-Yayvinsky and Polovodovsky blocks are valid until 2024 and 2028, respectively.

   In 2012 the company boosted its production capacity increased by 1.5 million tons (to 13 million tons) following completion of the renovation of three processing lines in the granulation unit of its Berezniki-3 processing plant.
