   In 1961 Allen Breed started Breed Corp. to make trigger and safety mechanisms for ammunition. He patented a fuse that measured changes in time and velocity to trigger a mortar rocket. Breed saw potential for his fuse in the emerging field of air bag technology, and in 1968 he produced an air bag sensor. However, automakers resisted the air bag concept for years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company survived during the 1970s and early 1980s on government contracts, designing parts for missiles and land mines. In 1984 the
   <company id="150508">
    US Highway Traffic Safety Administration
   </company>
   required new cars to have passive restraint systems, giving Breed access to automakers. Breed Automotive was founded in 1987 as a spinoff from Breed Corp., and Allen Breed's wife, Johnnie, took over much of the management duties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Breed Automotive further benefited from a 1991 law requiring that all cars made after 1997 for sale in the US must have air bags. The company name was changed to BREED Technologies, Inc., and in 1992 it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. BREED bought Vaisala Technologies (silicon sensors) and opened an office in Japan in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   ' steering-wheel unit in 1996. In 1997 BREED bought Custom Trim Group and the seat-belt and air bag businesses of AlliedSignal (later
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   ). Also that year Johnnie Breed became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bloated from acquisitions, BREED suffered a huge loss in fiscal 1998 and announced plans to lay off 4,500 workers (25% of its workforce) and close about half its plants and 10 sales offices. In 1999 BREED filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and, pressured by creditors, began seeking a buyer or partner.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company agreed in 2000 to be acquired by auto components maker
   <company id="13649">
    Harvard Industries
   </company>
   in a deal worth around $520 million, but BREED backed out of the deal. Instead the company was taken private by its creditors and thus emerged from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   , through its Carlyle Management Group unit (now
   <company id="138325">
    Ewing Management
   </company>
   ), purchased BREED in a deal valued at more than $300 million. The company then announced a restructuring plan that included the ousting of CEO John Riess and CFO Doug Watts, layoffs, and supplier price cuts. The company's name was changed to Key Safety Systems later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fast forwarding to the summer of 2016, Key Safety Systems was acquired by Chinese auto conglomerate
   <company id="192895">
    Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp.
   </company>
   for $920 million.
