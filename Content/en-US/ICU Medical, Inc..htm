   ICU Medical sees the future of infection prevention. The company's devices protect health care workers and patients from the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Its primary products are intravenous (IV) connection devices, called Clave needleless connectors, that reduce the risk of needle sticks and disconnections. The firm also makes custom IV sets, many of which use Clave connectors and other ICU products, for third parties. Additionally, ICU Medical makes critical care equipment, such as angiography kits and heart monitors. ICU Medical sells its products to other equipment makers and distributors throughout the US and internationally.

  <p>
   ICU Medical develops, makes, and sells innovative medical devices used in vascular therapy, oncology, and critical care applications. Its products improve patient outcomes by helping prevent bloodstream infections and protecting health care workers from exposure to infectious diseases or hazardous drugs. The company's products include custom IV systems, closed delivery systems for hazardous drugs, needlefree IV connectors, catheters, and cardiac monitoring systems. About 70% of total revenue comes from infusion therapy services while critical care accounts about 20%; the remainder comes from oncology and other services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products to more than 60 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia/Pacific region, Latin America, and North America. Its administrative office are in San Clemente, California; Vrable, Slovakia; Roncanova, Italy; Utrecht, Netherlands; Bella Vista, Australia; and Ludenscheid, Germany. Customers in Europe are served by facilities in Slovakia and Germany. Customers elsewhere are served from facilities in the US and Mexico. ICU Medical operates a plant in Mexico with about 1,350 workers in Ensenada; it has another plant in Vrable, Slovakia (with about 240 employees). The company also maintains a plant in Salt Lake City, Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for about 70% of total revenue in 2014.

  <p>
   On the sales side, the company is increasingly directing its marketing efforts toward securing long-term contracts with large buying organizations. ICU Medical is reacting to an increasingly consolidated health care provider marketplace, because the providers have more buying power as they get larger. Long-term contracts help the company lock in prices even as the market changes around them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medical device maker
   <company id="132482">
    Hospira
   </company>
   is ICU Medical's biggest customer - it accounts for around 35% of revenue annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sells to independent distributors and to end users through a direct sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, advertising expenses totaled $0.1 million, down from $0.3 million in 2013 and $0.2 million in 2012.

  <p>
   After several years of increasing revenue, in 2013 ICU Medical reported a 10% decrease, from $316.9 million to $313.7 million, due to lower infusion therapy sales to key American customer
   <company id="132482">
    Hospira
   </company>
   . Revenue fell a marginal 1% to $309 million in 2014 for the same reason. Higher international and critical care revenue helped offset the decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been falling the last few years and 2014 delivered a 35% drop to $26 million on lower sales and higher operating expenses (including R&amp;D and restructuring costs). Cash flow from operations has also been on a slow decline: In 2014 it fell 8% to $61 million due to the decrease in net income and a change in inventories.

  <p>
   ICU Medical has a long-standing relationship with
   <company id="132482">
    Hospira
   </company>
   . Way back in 2005, ICU Medical purchased Hospira's Salt Lake City manufacturing plant, which produces catheters, angiography kits, and cardiac monitors, among other devices. At that time the two entered a 20-year agreement under which ICU Medical will manufacture the products and Hospira will purchase them. Then, in 2009, ICU Medical purchased the commercial rights and physical assets from Hospira's critical care product line giving ICU Medical complete control of manufacturing and marketing rights of the critical care line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through yet another agreement with Hospira, ICU Medical makes and co-promotes custom IV systems under the name SetSource. That agreement is set to last through 2018. All told, sales to Hospira account for about 35% of ICU Medical's yearly income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aside from bringing home the bacon, ICU Medical's dealings with Hospira provide ICU Medical access to the IV set market in the US, in which Hospira has a significant share. The company expects Hospira will be important to growing its CLAVE line, custom infusion sets, and its other products worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of its dealings with Hospira, ICU Medical's growth strategy hinges upon its ability to continue to develop and introduce new products to its customers, particularly in the face of upcoming patent expirations on some of its products. Much like pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers enjoy a certain amount of market exclusivity on their patented products, but once those patents expire, competitors are free to introduce their own versions of the devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   ICU Medical is preparing for patent expirations by diversifying its product line, internally developing products and systems, and by acquiring product lines. These products include the TEGO for use in dialysis, the Orbit 90 diabetes set, and a line of oncology products including the Spiros male luer connector device, the Genie vial access device, custom IV sets, and ancillary products specifically designed for chemotherapy. The company is busy working on a new hemodynamic monitor, part of its Critical Care business.

  <p>
   In 2015, ICU Medical acquired the New Jersey-based Excelsior Medical Corporation, a medical device maker also focused on infection prevention, for $59.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017, the company acquired
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's global infusion therapy business Hospira Infusion Systems for $1 billion. The deal creates a company with a complete IV therapy product portfolio.
