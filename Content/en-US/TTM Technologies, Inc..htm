   At TTM Technologies, it's Time To Market. TTM provides contract printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing services, primarily for the networking, communications, high-end computing, aerospace and defense, medical, industrial, and instrumentation markets, as well as to electronics manufacturing service providers that serve those markets. In addition to prototyping, TTM offers both quick-turn production -- limited quantities delivered in a shortened timeframe -- and standard volume production services. Its top OEM customers include
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems

   ,
   <company id="59788">
    Huawei

   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="140691">
    ZTE
   </company>
   . TTM gets almost 54% of its sales from customers outside the US; 26% comes from China. The 2015 acquisition of Viasystems made TTM one of the biggest PCB makers.

  <p>
   The electronics industry provides the majority of TTM's business. That industry is characterized by intense price competition, short product life-cycles, and fluctuations in product demand. When TTM previously had only one plant in China, TTM made boards for big suppliers of computers and networking equipment, and shipped the boards to electronic manufacturing services (EMS) providers working under contract to those OEM customers. Now with eight PCB fabrication plants in China, it competes as a one-stop shop for standard and quick-turn volume contracts.

  <p>
   TTM operates 16 PCB fabrication plants in California, Connecticut, Utah and Wisconsin, and has primary customer inventory hubs in Connecticut, New York, Texas and Wisconsin. Its international footprint includes Asia Pacific operations with nine PCB fabrication plants in Hong Kong, Dongguan, Guangzhou, Huiyang, and Shanghai, China; and inventory hubs in France, Poland, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, Malaysia, and Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gets more than 90% of its revenue from its printed circuit board business.

  <p>
   The company reported a 58% revenue increase in 2015 to $2.1 billion (TTM's first time over the $2 billion mark), driven by the acquisition of Viasystems and stronger demand in cell phone end markets. There was, however, reduced demand in the networking/communications market.
  </p>
  <p>
   TTM bottom line suffered, at least in 2015, with the acquisition of Viasystems. The $25 million loss came from costs associated with the deal. The company made $14.7 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated by operations increase of $237 million in 2015 from $130 million in 2014.

  <p>
   TTM expects high growth in the PCB market in China, where it intends to pursue high-end commercial and defense customers that demand flexible and advanced manufacturing processes, expertise with high-performance specialty materials assembly and testing capabilities, and expertise in other high-mix and complex technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition of Viasystems helps diversify the markets that TTM serves.

  <p>
   TTM closed the deal for Viasystems in 2015, bringing together companies with a pro forma revenue of $2.5 billion. Viasystems complements TTM in the aerospace and defense, medical, industrial and instrumentation, and networking/telecom markets. Viasystem added a substantial opening to the automotive market for TTM. The combination should smooth TTM's revenues across the calendar by reducing effect of the cell phone market's seasonality, which spikes leading to the fourth quarter's holiday sales. The deal cost about $950 million including the assumption of debt.
