   Global engineering group Renold manufactures and markets industrial chains, from roller to conveyor and leaf, as well as precision products, such as automotive cam-drive systems, clutches, and machine tools. Its divides its operations across two segments: Chain and Torque Transmission. Customers include companies in food-processing, packaging, printing, and bottling industries. The company's facilities dot more than 20 countries. Renold traces its historical roots back to 1873 when it was founded by Hans Renold, inventor of the bush roller chain.

  <p>
   The company operates two segments based on its products and services. The Chain segment (almost 75% of net sales) manufactures and sells power transmission and conveyor chain products and also includes sales of torque transmission products through Chain National Sales Companies. Torque Transmission (25%) manufactures and sells torque transmission products such as gearboxes and couplings.

  <p>

  <p>
   Renold experienced a slight revenue decline of 1% from 2014 to 2015 due to decreases in both its segments. Torque Transmission sales declined by 3%, resulting from weaker demand for gear boxes in the Chinese domestic power generation sector. The decline was also associated to the closure of its Bredbury Chain manufacturing Facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a net loss for 2014, Renold posted positive net income for 2015 due to lower tax rates and additional income from the sale of facilities. The company's operating cash flow for 2015 skyrocketed by more than 100% due to the increase in income coupled with a bump in cash inflows from payables. (Note: Growth rates and declines may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   The company's strategy is focused on developing and innovating products within key geographies. After suffering net losses recently, Renold is also focused on controlling costs, leveraging selective bolt-on acquisitions, and launching new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2014 and 2015, the company launched a variety of fail-safe, high temperature, marine propulsion rubber-in-compression couplings.
