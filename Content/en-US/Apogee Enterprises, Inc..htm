   Apogee Enterprises goes to great panes for its glass customers. The company designs and develops value-added glass products primarily for the US market. Its architectural products and services segment fabricates and installs glass that features specialized colors or coatings and aluminum framing systems for commercial and institutional buildings. Customers include architects, general contractors, glazing subcontractors, and building owners. Its large-scale optical (LSO) technologies segment manufactures anti-reflective, UV-protected glass and acrylic under the Tru Vue brand for custom picture framing. Tru Vue products are sold through independent distributors and mass merchandisers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Apogee divides its operations across four segments, with three of the segments serving the commercial construction market: architectural glass (more than 35% of total sales), architectural framing systems (roughly 30%), architectural services (almost 25%), and large-scale optical products (LSO; 10%). Its LSO segment caters to the custom picture framing market.
  </p>
  <p>
   High-performance glass made by its architectural glass segments allows for specific light transmission levels and features solar options. High-performance glass is typically fabricated into custom insulating units or laminated units to allow for installation into window frames, curtain walls, storefronts, or entrances. The architectural framing segments also offer thermally-enhanced aluminum framing systems, as well as ones with recycled content and energy-efficient glass coatings, to target architects and contractors demanding specialty glass for constructing green commercial buildings.

  <p>
   Within the installation services market, Apogee is one of only a few companies to have a national presence, with offices in seven locations serving multiple US markets. It also has an office each in Canada and Brazil, but the US continues to be Apogee's main market, representing about 95% of sales.

  <p>
   LSO glass and acrylic products are distributed primarily in North America through mass merchandisers and independent distributors, which supply national and regional chains and local picture framing shops. Apogee occasionally supplies products directly to museums and public and private galleries. It also has limited distribution in global markets through independent distributors.

  <p>
   Apogee has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $981 million in 2016. Mostly due to the additional revenue, profits also peaked at $65 million in 2016, another company milestone. In addition, cash flow from operating activities soared from $69 million in 2015 to $124 million in 2016 mostly due to tax refunds and additional billings from uncompleted contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2016 was driven by surges in sales from its architectural glass and architectural services segments and higher demand form its architectural framing systems segment. These increases were mainly due to pricing and volume growth resulting from strong commercial construction activity in the US, partially offset by declines in the Canadian and Brazilian commercial construction markets.

  <p>
   Apogee has identified several opportunities for growth in the coming years. It has recorded increased interest from the non-residential and high-end multi-family building sectors in upgrading the front of buildings and improving buildings' energy efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its strategy pertaining to its LSO segment involves continuing to convert the custom picture framing and fine art markets from clear uncoated glass and acrylic products to value-added products that protect art from UV damage and minimize reflection, both within the US and international markets. Apogee has also identified new display markets that desire the value-added properties its glass and acrylic products provide.

  <p>
   Apogee in late 2016 acquired Sotawall, a North America-based designer and fabricator of high-performance, unitized curtain wall systems for commercial construction projects, for $135 million. The deal extended Apogee's geographic presence and enhanced its product offerings.
