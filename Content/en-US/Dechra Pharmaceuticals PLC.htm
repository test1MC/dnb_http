   Dechra provides products for docile dogs... and cats, birds, and horses too. Dechra Pharmaceuticals specializes in the development and marketing of companion animal products. Its operating divisions provide veterinarians with such products as Malaseb (skin diseases), Vetoryl (Cushing's disease), Felimazole (feline hyperthyroidism), and Equipalazone (musculoskeletal disorders in horses). Other products include pet nutritionals, livestock products, and practice management software systems. Dechra sells its products in Europe and other regions around the globe.

  <p>
   The company's branded veterinarian product offerings are segmented into analgesia and critical care products, dermatology, endicrinology, equine medicine, and ophthalmology. It also has some cardiology offerings, and it offers a variety of generic animal health items in Europe under the Dechra Veterinary Essentials brand. Its food product division makes antimicrobials used in feed; Dechra also offers therapeutic and life-stage cat and dog food lines under the Specific brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating units include the NVS and Arnolds subsidiaries, which supply pharmaceuticals, instruments, consumables, and other supplies for veterinary practices, including information technology tools. Dechra's manufacturing arm, Dales Pharmaceuticals, is a UK maker of everything from powders and tablets to liquids and creams. The unit also provides packaging services. Dales makes products sold by the Arnolds subsidiary, as well as third parties.

  <p>
   Dechra's products are sold in more than 40 countries in Europe, the Americas, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East. Sales in European countries account for about 85% of revenue for Dechra. Primary operating territories include the UK (accounting for more than a quarter of sales) and Germany.

  <p>
   Dechra experienced a sharp drop in revenues in 2013 due to the divestiture of its services segment, which accounted for 70% of sales in fiscal 2012. However, continuing operations from the pharmaceutical businesses increased by more than 50% due to the acquisition of Eurovet. Net income from continuing business also doubled.

  <p>
   European sales are conducted through the Dechra Veterinary Products EU and Eurovet divisions, while products in the US are promoted through the Dechra Veterinary Products US division. The company uses a direct sales force in a dozen countries in western Europe, as well as in the US; it uses marketing partners and distributors in other markets. Customers are primarily veterinarians, though Dechra also sells to wholesalers, distributors, marketing partners, and pharmacies.

  <p>
   To focus on its core veterinary products market, Dechra divested its services segment in 2013. The services division included the company's National Veterinary Services (practice management and order fulfillment), Dechra Laboratory Services (diagnostic and clinical pathology), and Dechra Specialist Laboratories (endocrine assays for diagnostics).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expands its line of animal health products through acquisitions and research and development projects. Dechra is also working to expand its sales and marketing capabilities into new territories, as well as to strengthen sales forces to support product growth in existing markets.

  <p>
   The company expanded its prescription offerings for the European market through the acquisition of Netherlands-based Eurovet in 2012 for some €135 million. Products added through the deal include Cardisure for canine congestive heart failure. In addition to cardiovascular products, the purchase of Eurovet expanded Dechra's operations into the livestock products market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Dechra bought a 63% stake in Croatian pharmaceutical Genera d.d., expanding its presence in emerging markets. The deal also provided the firm with entry into the poultry vaccine market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2016 agreed to buy Apex Laboratories, which makes and sells veterinary prescription drugs in Australia and New Zealand, for £31.3 million. That deal will provide Dechra with a base from which it can build its presence in the Asia/Pacific region.
