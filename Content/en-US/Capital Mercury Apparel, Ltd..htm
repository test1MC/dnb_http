   Capital Mercury Apparel is playing the name game. Traditionally a maker of uniforms and private-label clothing, the employee-owned company shifted its focus to concentrate on more upscale, branded merchandise. Capital Mercury, founded in 1960, makes a variety of men's and women's clothing, including shirts, sweaters, dress wear, swimwear, and sportswear. Its Bill Blass Premium, Arnold Palmer, and NYNE brands are sold in department stores, and it makes other labels for

   stores. Agreements with the likes of designer menswear labels Robert Stock and Wilke-Rodriguez -- as well as a deal struck with

   </company>
   -- have brought the company upscale licensing deals.
