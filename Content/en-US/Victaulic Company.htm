   The company often partners with other businesses to extend its geographic footprint. In 2015 Victaulic announced a joint business venture with Bermad, a global producer of hydraulic water and air valve technologies. The new business partnership, called Victaulic Bermad Technologies (VBT), will be based in Houston and will focus on select markets and applications, including commercial fire protection. The partnership will expand its Victaulic valve and device offerings throughout the US and Canadian regions.

  <p>
   Victaulic was founded in New York City in 1925 to market a mechanical bolted coupling design, which joined two pieces of grooved piping within a bolted housing that featured a gasket for a leak-tight seal. The design was first used years prior in WWI to deploy fuel and water to Allied Forces in Europe; it is still used today in a myriad of applications -- plumbing and HVAC, oil field and mining, military and marine, and industrial applications.
