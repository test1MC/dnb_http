        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The history of Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC) is not as precise as its castings. The Oregon Saw Company was founded in 1949 and sold in 1953; its buyer wanted neither the future PCC nor a power tools unit, so the two became Omark Industries. In 1956 a buyer purchased the power tool business but wasn't interested in castings; that operation was spun off as Precision Castparts Corp.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the early 1950s a group of Oregon Saw's casting employees developed a process for producing parts as large as 60 inches by use of investment casting, making products that rivaled the strength of forged and machined parts at a fraction of the cost. After a two-year search, they landed their first aerospace customer -- Air Research Corp. -- with many to follow. The higher operating temperatures generated by aircraft engines led the company to buy a vacuum furnace in 1959 to fabricate parts that could tolerate greater heat; two more vacuum furnaces were added and sales vaulted toward $10 million by 1967. PCC went public in 1968 and continued to grow. In 1976 the company acquired Centaur Cast Alloys (small investment castings, UK) to make parts for the European aerospace industry. By that time General Electric (GE) and Pratt &amp; Whitney accounted for most of PCC's business. Edward Cooley, who had masterminded the company's growth since incorporation, forged ahead with plans to double production capacity.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1980 the airline industry crashed, but PCC's sales held at about $90 million. Structural airplane products soon picked up, and in 1984 the company bought two titanium foundries in France. To diversify, it added
   <company id="106099">
    TRW
   </company>
   's cast airfoils (used in aircraft engines and industrial gas turbines) division in 1986. That acquisition, renamed PCC Airfoils, increased PCC's annual sales by about 80%; sales reached $443 million by 1989.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company broadened its offerings again in 1991 when it acquired Advanced Forming Technology, which made small, complex, metal-injection molded parts used in everything from adding machines to military ordnance. The early 1990s recession hit the airline industry and sales dropped. Cooley retired as chairman in 1994 and GE veteran William McCormick replaced him. The next year PCC acquired Quamco, Inc. (industrial tools and machines). In 1996 PCC flowed into the fluid management market with the acquisition of NEWFLO for about $300 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 PCC spent $437 million to acquire seven more companies that helped boost sales 75% from 1996 levels. The next year it purchased four metalworking companies that served industries other than aerospace. Having reduced dependence on sales to the aerospace industry to just over 50%, PCC began consolidating operations and closing plants to reduce costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company continued to diversify through acquisitions in 1999, but it also expanded its aerospace operations with the purchase of
   <company id="15181">
    Wyman-Gordon
   </company>
   , a leading maker of advanced metal forgings for the aerospace market. PCC's 2000 acquisitions included the aerospace division of United Engineering Forgings and Germany-based Convey Engineering (heavy-duty valves). The next year the company bought the assets of Netherlands-based Wouter Witzel and the US's Drop Dies and Forgings Company (renamed Wyman-Gordon Cleveland). In 2002 PCC bought the rest of Western Australian Specialty Alloys (casting and forging alloys) for $27.6 million in cash and PCC shares.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 Precision Castparts' PCC Structurals unit reached a $400 million agreement with
   <company id="41834">
    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   to supply large titanium and steel castings. That year the company acquired
   <company id="11306">
    SPS Technologies
   </company>
   , a producer of fasteners and other metal components for the aerospace, automotive, and industrial markets. In 2004 subsidiary SPS Aerospace Fasteners signed a four-year deal with Airbus worth about $72 million to supply collars, nuts, studs, and titanium pins to Airbus plants across Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   PCC acquired Air Industries Corporation in early 2005. In 2006 PCC bought Special Metals Corporation (SMC), a maker of nickel alloys and super alloys, for $295 million in cash and the assumption of $245 million in SMC debt. PCC intended to use SMC's product as raw materials for its own aircraft engine components. SMC also served the automotive, chemical, and power generation industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Later in 2006 PCC bought Shur-Lok Corporation, a manufacturer of aerospace fasteners, for about $110 million. The acquisition, combined with the 2005 purchase of Air Industries Corporation, helped to further PCC's desire to grow its airframe fasteners business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Early in 2007 PCC completed the purchase of GSC, a leading maker of aluminum and steel structural investment casting for the aerospace, energy, and medical markets.  It also acquired Cherry Aerospace, which expanded its fastener products portfolio.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2009 the company acquired Carlton Forge Works, which makes aircraft engines for Boeing and Airbus; California-based Arcturus Manufacturing (hammer forging operations) was included in the transaction. PCC also picked up Airdrome Holdings (fluid fittings), Fatigue Technology (cold expansion technology), and Hackney Ladish (forged pipe fittings) in 2009.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late summer 2011, PPC purchased Primus International, a maker of complex metal industrial parts and assemblies. Its products (machined aluminum and titanium components used in aircraft wings, fuselages, and engine-related assemblies) cater to Boeing, Airbus, and other aerospace OEMs. The $900 million deal furthered the company's commitment to the global aerospace industry. In a similar vein, the company obtained Unison Engine Components (operating as Tru-Form Rings) from GE Aviation in mid-2011. Tru-Form made flash-welded and cold-rolled rings with jet engine as well as gas turbine applications.
  </p>
        <p>
   PCC also acquired RathGibson, which makes tubing for the oil and gas, chemical/petrochemical, power-generation, and other markets, in 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   To expand both its Fasteners and Forged Products segments, PCC acquired the aerostructures and industrial products businesses of Héroux-Devtek for about CAD$300 million (about $295.5 million) in 2012. Among other benefits, the acquisition expanded the company's product line for such OEMs as Lockheed, Bombardier, and Gulfstream. PCC also inked a deal to purchase the Synchronous Aerospace Group business of private investment firm Littlejohn &amp; Co. in late 2012.
