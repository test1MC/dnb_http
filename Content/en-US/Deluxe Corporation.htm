   The company's net revenue has enjoyed steady growth during the past few fiscal years. In fiscal 2014 its revenue increased by 6% to $1.67 billion compared to $1.58 billion in fiscal 2013. The increased revenue was primarily due to growth in marketing solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deluxe saw its net income increase by 7% to $199.79 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $186.65 million in fiscal 2013. The spike was primarily due to an increase in product revenue and service revenue.

   Check writing has been on the decline due to the shift to electronic payment methods. In response, the company is cutting costs and focusing on marketing and financial services.

  <p>
   Deluxe Corporation began in 1915 with the determination of William Hotchkiss, a newspaper publisher turned chicken farmer, to produce one product "better, faster, and more economically than anyone else." From his office in St. Paul, Minnesota, Hotchkiss set out to provide banks with business checks within 48 hours of receiving the order. Deluxe Check Printers made just $23 that year. However, when a new Federal Reserve Bank was established in Minneapolis, the region soon became a major national banking center.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1920s Hotchkiss introduced the most successful product in Deluxe's history: the Handy, a pocket-sized check. During the Depression the company cut employee hours and pay, but not jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   George McSweeney, a sales manager, created the Personalized Check Program in 1939 and was named president two years later. During WWII he stabilized the company by printing ration forms for banks. In the 1950s Deluxe was one of the first firms to implement the government's magnetic-ink character-recognition program.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1960 the company was selling its printing services to 99% of US commercial banks. Deluxe went public in 1965. The company integrated computers and advanced printing technology into production during the 1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the following decade Deluxe positioned itself to profit from the increasing automation of transactions, making acquisitions such as Chex-Systems (account verification, 1984), Colwell Systems (medical business forms, 1985), A. O. Smith Data Systems (banking software, 1986), and Current (mail-order greeting cards and checks, 1987). It established a UK base in 1992 with Stockforms Ltd. (computer forms). Deluxe closed about a fourth of its check-printing plants in 1993, the first layoffs in the firm's history.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Gus Blanchard became president and CEO of Deluxe (the first outsider to do so) the following year, he began a major reorganization. In 1996 he initiated a plan to close more than 20 check-printing plants and eliminate 1,200 jobs (completed 1999). He pursued international business, including a joint venture to provide electronic financial services to India's banking system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deluxe bought Fusion Marketing Group (customized database marketing services) in 1997. The next year, through a joint venture with Fair, Isaac and Company (now
   <company id="13357">
    Fair Isaac Corporation
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="12513">
    Acxiom Corp.
   </company>
   , Deluxe developed FraudFinder, a computerized system to rate a merchant's risk in accepting an individual's check or debit card. Increasing its focus on financial services, the company sold off its greeting card, specialty paper, and marketing database businesses. Also in 1998 it began offering check ordering over the Internet and via voice-recognition technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought
   <company id="100597">
    eFunds
   </company>
   , which provides the retail and financial sectors with electronic transaction and payment-protection technology. Deluxe also bought the remaining stake of its venture with HCL in 1999, renaming it iDLX and merging it into eFunds. eFunds went public in mid-2000 and late that same year, Deluxe spun off the unit to focus on paper payment systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2000 Deluxe bought Designer Checks. The next year Deluxe began offering Disney characters on checks, the first time Disney characters have been licensed to appear on personal checks. Also in 2001 Lawrence Mosner was named chairman and CEO of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Deluxe was selected as the exclusive supplier of checks and forms for

   Money and
   <company id="107214">
    Microsoft Business Solutions
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to grow its small business customer roster, Deluxe purchased Massachusetts-based
   <company id="14232">
    New England Business Service
   </company>
   (NEBS), a provider of business forms and other products to North American small businesses, in 2004. Deluxe combined the operations of NEBS with its former Business Services operations to form its Small Business Services unit. (In 2005, Deluxe sold
   <company id="11027">
    PremiumWear
   </company>
   , an apparel business that was part of the NEBS purchase, to Forsyth Holdings.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Mosner retired as chairman and CEO late in 2005. Company president Ronald Eilers succeeded Mosner as CEO on an interim basis; director Stephen Nachtsheim was named chairman. Lee Schram, previously at
   <company id="43707">
    NCR Corporation
   </company>
   , took over the CEO role in 2006. The company was dethroned from the top position in the check printing industry as a result of the 2007 merger of its two primary competitors: John H. Harland and Clarke American to form
   <company id="112637">
    Harland Clarke
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon after Schram took over, Deluxe announced cost-cutting measures designed to save the company some $150 million by the end of 2008. The cost-reduction initiatives included consolidating its call-center and check-fulfillment efforts, as well as more efficient manufacturing, supply chain, and shared services. In 2008 Deluxe acquired PartnerUp, an online networking community for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for about $5.5 million. Later that year it bought Hostopia.com Inc., a provider of Web services to small businesses with an Internet presence, for C$124 million (about US$96 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to Hostopia with two acquisitions in 2009. It obtained MerchEngines, a firm that helps small business owners advertise directly using search engines like
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   and
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo!
   </company>
   . MerchEngines automates the process of choosing keyword targets and creating ads, as well as tracking and reporting results. Also that year it bought Abacus America Inc., doing business as Aplus.net. The transaction gave Hostopia access to Aplus' 80,000 small-business subscribers of shared Web hosting website management applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a difficult 2008 and 2009, the company posted gains in 2010 as the economy began to recover. Revenues and net income increased in 2010, helped by a corporate restruturing enacted to drive down costs.  Between 2007 and 2010, Deluxe closed eight manufacturing facilities and five customer call centers. The shutdowns came as the firm moved to expand its use of digital printing processes. Also in 2010 Deluxe acquired Cornerstone Customer Solutions, which provides marketing solutions to financial service providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010 the company obtained Custom Direct, Inc., a provider of checks based in Maryland, for $98 million. The deal enhanced Deluxe's toehold in the direct-to-consumer channel. Custom Direct sells consumer checks under multiple brands including Check Gallery, Styles Checks, and Artistic Checks.
