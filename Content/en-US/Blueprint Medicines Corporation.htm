   Blueprint Medicines' blueprints are very small. The biopharmaceutical firm identifies kinases that are drivers of genomically defined diseases and crafts drug candidates that may provide significant and durable clinical responses in patients. Since 2012 it has developed a robust small molecule drug pipeline in cancer and a rare genetic disease. One lead drug candidate (BLU-285) targets abnormally active receptor tyrosine kinase mutants that are drivers of cancer and proliferative disorders. Another (BLU-554) targets a kinase that is aberrantly activated and is a driver of disease in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer. Blueprint Medicines went public in 2015.
