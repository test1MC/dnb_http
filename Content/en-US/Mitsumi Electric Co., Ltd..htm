   Mitsumi Electric has more than a peripheral interest in electronics. The company provides electronic components and devices through subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Products include integrated circuits; computer peripherals, such as keyboards and data storage drives; radio-frequency modulators and other devices for cordless phones; and a range of components including switches, transformers, adapters, and connectors. Mitsumi typically serves as a supplier to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Mitsumi was acquired in 2017 by Minebea, which took the moniker

   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Minebea acquired Mitsumi in a stock transaction in early 2017. The deal added Mitsumi's components portfolio to Minebea's expertise in metal processing to develop and make components suitable for deployment for the Internet of Things.

  <p>
   About half of Mitsumi's revenue comes from its mechanical parts business, with about 20% each from integrated circuits and high-frequency parts. Power supply parts and optical devices generate the remainder.

  <p>
   Mitsumi has operations in China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. It has sales offices in Japan (Aichi, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo prefectures), China, and Taiwan. The company biggest markets are Asia (more than half of revenue) and Japan (about 40% of revenue).

  <p>
   Mitsumi's revenue increased 6% to $1.5 billion in 2016 (ended March). The mechanical parts segment carried the weight of the increase with a 5% rise from sales of amusement-related products and health care products. The company posted an $85 million loss in 2016, compared to a profit in 2015. It had higher costs of sales in 2016, which reduced its gross profit by a third. Other expenses such as a loss on currency exchange brought about the year's net loss. Lower inventories helped Mitsumi increase cash flow from operations in 2016 after recording negative cash flow in 2015.

  <p>
   Mitsumi is expanding its original design manufacturing (ODM) business with its in-house capabilities in production and simulation. Specific markets include blood sugar level monitors, beautification and health aids, and electric toothbrushes. The company is looking to boost its productivity with a new factory with an automated assembly line. The new factory requires 50% of the workers that ran the previous production line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Uniting with Minebea should result in a bigger range of product for both companies.
