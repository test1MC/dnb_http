   ARIAD Pharmaceuticals is exploring the myriad possibilities for new cancer treatments. The firm has a handful of candidates being studied for the treatment of various types of cancer. Its drug Iclusig (ponatinib), a treatment for two rare forms of leukemia, is already approved in the US and Europe though the company is seeking approvals for additional indications. ARIAD is also developing brigatinib for the treatment of crizotinib-resistant lung cancer. ARIAD's drug candidates are in varying stages of preclinical research and clinical trials. In early 2017, Japan's

   acquired ARIAD in a $5.2 billion transaction.

   <company id="56037">

   acquired ARIAD to diversify its oncology operations, positioning itself for growth in that priority area. It was particularly interested in the blockbuster potential of lung cancer candidate brigatinib. ARIAD is now a subsidiary of ARIAD.

   Ponatinib was approved under the name Iclusig as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients that have not shown response to older leukemia drugs.

  <p>
   ARIAD's Iclusig is approved and marketed in the US and Europe. It's set to be marketed in Israel and Australia upon approval in those countries.

  <p>
   ARIAD uses its own sales force to market its products in the US. The company's organization was in place in preparation for the FDA approval of Iclusig in late 2012, allowing it to begin delivering the drug to customers within about two weeks. It also set up European headquarters in Switzerland to lead the company's commercial operations in Europe once it received approval there.

  <p>
   Like most drug development companies, ARIAD counts on revenues from collaborations to remain afloat. Most of the money the company has brought in over the past few years has been from its previous ridaforolimus partnership with
   <company id="11326">
    Merck.
   </company>
   In 2013, however, it reported a huge increase in revenue, from $558 thousand the previous year to $45 million, after it received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for Iclusig. ARIAD's net loss increased though, by about 25%, going from $221 million to $274 million, as the company not only ramped up its sales and marketing organizations, an increase in cost of about $82 million, but also spent about $9 million related to a temporary suspension of sales due to FDA concerns about the safety of Iclusig. Those concerns were addressed by the company with specific prescribing guidelines and a revised product warning label. Cash used in operations also increased, rising to $222 million from $154 million, due mostly to the $53 million increase in net loss.

  <p>
   The company focuses on discovering, developing, and commercializing small-molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need - aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate. Part of that strategy includes commercializing Iclusig in the US for additional indications and pursuing approval in other regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, ARIAD announced plans to sell its European operations, including the marketing rights to Iclusig, to Delaware-based
   <company id="16850">
    Incyte
   </company>
   for a $140 million upfront payment plus royalties. That cost-cutting move followed a workforce reduction of some 90 positions. The actions also portended the subsequently announced sale of ARIAD to Japan's
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceutical Company
   </company>
   . That deal was completed in early 2017; Takeda bought ARIAD in a $5.2 billion transaction.

  <p>
   ARIAD's name refers to the mythical Ariadne, who gave her lover Theseus a spool of thread that guided him safely out of a dangerous labyrinth. Similarly, the firm's drug development efforts focus on the labyrinthine molecular pathways that regulate disease.
