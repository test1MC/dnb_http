    BT Group
   </company>
   , Openreach (its trade name is British Telecommunications PLC) handles the copper wire and fiber-optic cable connections that link consumers and businesses to their local exchange networks. It provides local network installation and maintenance services for about 500 communications providers in the UK, including BT businesses (about 70% of sales). Products and services come under wholesale line rental (WLR), local loop unbundling (LLU), Ethernet, and fiber-based broadband. Openreach was created in 2006 out of BT's wholesale and retail divisions.

   Openreach's customers are predominantly BT businesses because BT is still the reigning telecommunications carrier in the UK, even though competitors have whittled down its market share, as Openreach's recent financial results reflect.

   In January 2015 the company's parent revealed its ultra-fast broadband vision for the UK. Using G.fast technology, the company expects to offer initial speeds of a few hundred megabits per second to millions of homes and businesses by 2020. As further industry standards are secured, it expects speeds to increase to up to 500 mbps to most of the UK within a decade.
