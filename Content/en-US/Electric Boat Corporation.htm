   Quonset Point, Rhode Island is home to the company's automated hull-fabrication and outfitting facility. Submarine components are manufactured using digitally controlled machines for precision cutting, machining, and bending. The completed hull cylinders are equipped with tanks, propulsion machinery, torpedo and missile tubes, wiring and lighting, and piping, and then sent by barge to the Groton (Connecticut) shipyard or to Northrop Grumman Newport News (Virginia) for completion. The Groton facility designs, engineers, assembles, tests, and delivers the submarines.
