   Ice cream and other dairy products might be missing a major ingredient without Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA). The dairy cooperative, which serves more than 2,100 farmers in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin, produces some 3.9 billion pounds of milk each year. Milk products include sweetened condensed milk, instant nonfat milk, and dried buttermilk, as well as other items the likes of cream, cheese, butter, and ice-cream mixes. With no consumer brands or products, MMPA sells its products as ingredients to food makers who sell baby formulas, candy, ice cream, and yogurt. Founded in 1916, the co-op operates a pair of Michigan plants and a merchandise facility.
