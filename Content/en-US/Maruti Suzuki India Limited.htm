   The company's key rivals, India's

    Tata Motors

   and South Korea's
   <company id="55281">
    Hyundai Motor
   </company>
   , are persistently chipping away at the MSIL market dominance. MSIL is shoring up against the competition by launching a series of new products, and improving production capacity. Recent models look to freshen up the manufacturer's offerings to attract new drivers, as well as plug alternative fuel opportunities.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 MSIL agreed to merge Suzuki Powertrain India Limited (SPIL) into MSIL. SPIL supplies engines as well as transmissions for vehicles to MSIL.

   holds a 70% share in SPIL; MSIL, 30%. The merger will enable MSIL to put all its diesel engine capacity under a single management to improve synergies and costs.

   In 2006 MSIL's production and sales operations were merged with, and took the name of Maruti Udyog. In 2007 the Indian government divested its 10% stake in the company. The company subsequently changed its name to Maruti Suzuki India.
