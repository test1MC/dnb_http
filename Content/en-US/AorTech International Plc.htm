   AorTech International's technical expertise lies in medical plastics. Through primary operating subsidiary AorTech Biomaterials, the firm develops, manufactures, and commercializes medical-grade polyurethanes for use in devices and implants; it also makes device components for partnering medical equipment makers. Its products are based on the company's Elast-Eon (biostable elastomers) and ECSil (silicone) materials which have various applications including cardiovascular and neurological implants (leads, valves, and stents), orthopedic devices (spinal discs), and reconstructive and cosmetic products (breast implants), as well as gastroenterology and urology equipment.

  <p>
   The company gets its revenue through licensing and milestone payments, as well as bulk material sales and product royalties related to supplying Elast-Eon products. The firm's newer polymer material, ECSil, was developed to work as a softer formulation for use in the company's breast implant, spinal disc, and lead development.

   AorTech markets its products in the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia.

   After continuous revenue growth, which peaked in 2013, earnings fell 93% to $419,000 in 2014 as a result of the company's disposition of its polymer manufacturing operations. Net loss increased 55% to $1.3 million that year on losses from discontinued operations. Additionally, AorTech reported an operating cash outflow of $40,000, versus an inflow of $500,000 in 2013.

  <p>
   In an effort to focus purely on its intellectual property, AorTech divested its manufacturing operations in 2014. That move will allow the company to operate at a significantly lower cost as it seeks ways to exploit its proprietary technology. The company transferred its manufacturing and distribution capabilities to Biomerics.
