   Nanosphere offers molecular diagnostics for the masses: Its molecular testing system is intended for use in hospital-based laboratories that don't have the money or expertise to maintain the complex genomic testing equipment often reserved for reference labs and research centers. The company's diagnostic Verigene System is a compact and simple workstation designed to perform multiple genomic and protein tests simultaneously on a single sample. Nanosphere also sells Verigene-compatible tests, including hematology, cystic fibrosis, and influenza diagnostic assays, and has several other tests, including HPV (the virus that causes cervical cancer) in the works.

  <p>
   To build its business, Nanosphere used proceeds from its 2007 IPO to fund research and development to introduce a broad range of diagnostic tests for its Verigene System. Funds from the offering were also used to build its sales and marketing organization, which targets hospital labs in the US.

  <p>
   Nanosphere has closed subsequent public offerings, first in October 2009 and again in May 2011, which generated roughly $35 million and $32 million, respectively, in net proceeds.
