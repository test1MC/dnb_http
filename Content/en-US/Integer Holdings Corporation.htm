   Integer Holdings likes to keep its business close to the heart. The company is a leading maker of batteries used in implantable medical devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Other medical components include electrodes, capacitors, engineered components, enclosures, and feedthroughs (used to deliver electrical signals from an implantable medical device to an electrode). Integer Holdings also makes batteries for demanding industrial applications, such as oil and gas exploration. The business gets nearly half of its sales from US clients.

  <p>
   Integer Holdings has experienced unprecedented growth over the last few years. Revenues jumped 4% from $664 million in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $688 million in 2015. Profits also surged 53% from $36 million in 2014 to $55 million in 2015, another company milestone. Its operating cash flow increased from $57 million to $81 million over the same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was fueled by a 22% bump in vascular product sales, which reflected the continued adoption of its products and the relaunch of a vascular medical device near the end of 2013. QiG sales skyrocketed 212% in 2015 compared to 2014, due to almost $6 million of additional sales from a previous acquisition. This segment was also helped by increased adoption of its thin-film electrode technology and new product launches.
