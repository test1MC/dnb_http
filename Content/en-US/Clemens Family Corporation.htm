   The Clemens family helps its customers bring home the bacon -- and other products, too. The Clemens Family Corporation (CFC) operates primarily through the Clemens Food Group (CFG). CFG includes pork product producers Hatfield Quality Meats (bacon, scrapple, deli ham, pork tenderloin) and Nick's Sausage Company (breakfast and specialty sausage, sausage crumbles), as well as logistics and transportation firms (PV Transport and CFC Logistics) and a hog procurement and production company (Country View Family Farms). Its products are sold via grocers in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the US. Additionally, family-owned CFC operates Clemens Development, which develops real estate owned by the company.
