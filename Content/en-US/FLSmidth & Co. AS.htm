   Engineering and building materials company FLSmidth likes to cement a deal. The holding company provides services (design and engineering), machinery, and equipment to the cement and mineral industries worldwide. Operations include supplying cement plant machinery; conveyor belts, silos, and cranes; crushers, pumps, and separators for mines; and air and noise pollution control devices. The company fills orders in size up to complete cement plants and mineral processing units. Through subsidiary Cembrit, it sells fiber cement building materials. FLSmidth does business in about 50 countries and operates major project and technical centers in Denmark, Germany, India, and the US.

  <p>
   In 1882 Frederik Læssøe Smidth completed his machinist apprenticeship and founded the Technical Bureau in his mother's Copenhagen apartment, where he concentrated on designing drying equipment for the tile and brick industry. The company changed its name to F.L.Smidth &amp; Co. in 1887 when engineers Poul Larsen and Alexander Foss joined the fledgling operation. The following year the company built a cement plant in Limhamn, Sweden. In 1889 the Aalborg Portland Cement plant was founded; it was there that sand cement was invented. The company opened offices in the UK (1890), Paris (1893), and New York (1895). Smidth did not live to see his company expand any further, as he died in 1899 at age 49. Foss then took over the day-to-day operations of F.L.Smidth &amp; Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   F.L.Smidth continued to grow, opening a Berlin office (1901). The company began receiving orders not only from Europe and the US, but also from South America. The Lodge Fume Company (dust precipitators, UK) was formed in 1913 as the forerunner of F.L.Smidth's environmental technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWI partially isolated Denmark and dampened the company's expansion plans by cutting off customers in Central Europe. F.L.Smidth conducted its business from UK and US offices. The end of the war allowed F.L.Smidth to renew its expansion plans as it opened offices in Japan (1922) and France (1923). These moves were helped, in part, by the company's introduction of technological advances in the cement industry that included the Unidan mill and SYMETRO gear.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the inevitability of another war and having learned a lesson in WWI, F.L.Smidth authorized its UK and US offices to act independently in 1938. The company also sent its employees and their families from its home office to the US with thousands of machine diagrams to ensure business could operate in the event Denmark was occupied. The company moved into the freight business in 1939 with the founding of DanTransport (sold 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   While the postwar years were lean, a restoration effort quickly allowed F.L.Smidth to continue mixing things up in the world of cement. Some estimates indicate that by 1957 F.L.Smidth's machinery had a hand in producing upwards of 40% of the world's cement. The company was once again on the road to expansion with offices opening in Brazil (1958), South Africa (1961), Canada (1961), and Mexico (1963).
  </p>
  <p>
   Competition and newer technologies put F.L.Smidth at a disadvantage during the 1960s. As a result, both profits and orders dipped until the company was able to gear up with newer technologies. F.L.Smidth was listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1968. During the 1970s F.L.Smidth opened offices in Australia (1970) and Chile (1977), and it became involved in the packaging industry through its Nyborg Plast subsidiary (sold 1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   F.L.Smidth began to solidify its place in Asia with offices in South Korea (1981) and Singapore (1982). The company's environmental technology operations were consolidated in 1988 into FLS miljø. To better manage its global expansion, FLS Industries was created in 1989 to act as the parent of 125 companies then in the group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1990 acquisition of the Fuller Company (cement plant engineering, US) gave FLS a stronger foothold in North America. FLS launched its aerospace business in 1991 with the purchase of Dan Air Engineering. A reorganization in 1998 shed many of the company's noncore units, leaving cement and production machinery, environmental technology, transportation, and aerospace. DanTransport Holding was sold the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   FLS continued to streamline in 2000 with the disposal of its RM Industrial Group (metal processing). The company merged FLS Industries and Aalborg Portland in 2001, and the next year it sold FLS miljø's boiler operations and transferred the subsidiary's air pollution control business to F.L.Smidth Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2004 the company sold aircraft maintenance and engineering firm FLS Aerospace to SR Technics, part of the UK's
   <company id="47011">
    3i Group
   </company>
   . By the end of the year, the group had sold cement and ready-mix concrete production units Aalborg Portland and Unicon, which represented a large part of FLS Industries' building materials business, to Italian cement group
   <company id="91682">
    Cementir
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   At the beginning of 2005, the company changed its name From FLS Industries back to FLSmidth &amp; Co. to reflect its transformation from a conglomerate to one company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the minerals part of the company exploded when subsidiary FLSmidth Minerals of Bethlehem scored the Process Division of Montreal-based
   <company id="116654">
    Groupe Laperriere &amp; Verreault
   </company>
   for $930 million. Renaming the acquired business GLV, the deal has helped make FLSmidth a one-stop shop for mineral mining companies by bringing together products and services throughout the mining process. Also in 2007 the Bethlehem subsidiary picked up the materials handling business and name of RAHCO International.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company purchased the engineering assets of CEntry Constructors &amp; Engineers (now
   <company id="121035">
    FLSmidth CEntry
   </company>
   ) from
   <company id="109372">
    The Layton Companies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Two additional purchases were made in 2009. FLSmidth acquired Conveyor Engineering, a US company specializing in the design and supply of bulk material handling systems for cement, mining, and heavy industrial facilities worldwide. With Conveyor Engineering's strong presence in Peru, FLSmidth landed a $30 million contract to supply equipment to the Toromocho copper mine.
  </p>
  <p>
   FLSmidth also acquired EEL India, a manufacturer of cement material handling and bagging equipment, in 2009. The acquisition aims to bring reciprocal benefits; EEL augments FLSmidth's similar product company in Ventomatic, Italy, and EEL builds upon its new owner's position in the global cement industry.
