   A.O. Smith gets its customers in hot water. The water-heating company makes equipment for residential and commercial users. Its products include home gas and electric water heaters and large-scale commercial water heating systems. Its
   <company id="128667">
    Lochinvar
   </company>
   subsidiary specializes in high efficiency water heaters, boilers, pool heaters, and storage tanks. A.O. Smith sells its products in North America and China through a network of more than 1,000 wholesale distributors, as well as retailers such as
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   . A.O. Smith has operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, China, India, the UK, Turkey, and the Netherlands. About 60% of its sales are in the US, while 30% are in China. The company is controlled by the founding Smith family.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates two segments, based on geography. The North America segment (66% of 2015 revenue) makes and sells specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and non-condensing boilers, and water system tanks. The Rest of World segment (34% of revenue), which consists of China, India, and Europe, also makes and markets water treatment products, primarily in Asia. The company also sells in-home air purification products in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of A.O. Smith's 18 manufacturing plants, a dozen are located in North America (in five US states, Canada, and Mexico) and six are in four other countries outside the US.

  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A.O. Smith sells its products in North America and China through a network of wholesale distributors, including more than 1,200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with 4,400-plus locations that serve both residential and commercial customers. It also sells its residential water heaters through retailers, such as
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   . In China alone, A.O. Smith sells water heaters through more than 8,000 retail outlets, of which 2,000 exclusively sell the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   A.O. Smith's client base is fairly concentrated, as its top five customers made up 38% of its total sales in 2015. The company, which has been ramping up its advertising spend in recent years, spent $102.2 million on advertising in 2015, up from $94 million and $78 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   A.O. Smith has enjoyed rising revenue and profits for the past few years thanks to new home building in the US and the continued market acceptance of its products overseas
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue climbed 9% to a record $2.54 billion during 2015 mostly thanks to a combination of 14% growth in China from higher demand for water heaters, water treatment products, and its newly-launched air purification products; and 5% growth in North America with higher prices in the US and Canada and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue growth in 2015 drove A.O. Smith's net income up 36% to $282.9 million. The company's operating cash levels jumped 31% to $344.4 million for the year thanks to the rise in cash earnings and lower outlays for working capital driven by increases in accounts payable balances in China.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While the US still represents 61% of sales (down from 64% in 2012), A.O. Smith has been seeking growth abroad -- especially in China and India -- in recent years. In 2015, A.O. Smith introduced its line of air purification products in fast-growing its China market just three years after opening its second water heater manufacturing plant in Nanjing to add 50% more capacity to its China water heater operations. With its sales in China jumping 14% and 18% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and double-digits in prior years, the company hopes new product introductions in China will continue to provide growth over the long term.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's been investing in other markets abroad as well. In 2014, the company began marketing its reverse osmosis water purification products in Vietnam, including under-the-sink water purifiers, counter top water dispensers, and tankless RO products that produce large volumes of purified water. In 2013, it acquired Turkish water treatment company MiM to expand its reach into the Eastern European and Black Sea water treatment markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   A.O. Smith has also been innovating with new product lines, with high-efficiency and sustainability in mind to target frugal and environmentally-conscious consumers. In 2014, it introduced both its Master-Fit Ultra-Low NOx commercial gas water heater for the California market, along with its high-efficiency commercial gas water heater Cyclone Mxi product with an efficiency-boosting adjustable burn rate feature that will save energy and lower customer operating costs.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013, A.O. Smith purchased privately-held Turkish water treatment company MiM Isitma Sogutma Havalandirma ve Aritma Sistemleri San. Tic. A.S. (MiM) for $4 million, expanding the company's product offerings and expanding its reach to Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region water treatment markets.

  <p>
   Working to expand its US business, A.O. Smith in 2011 bought Tennessee-based boiler manufacturer Lochinvar for some $418 million. The addition of Lochinvar gave A.O. Smith entry into the growing residential and commercial condensing boiler markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Smith Family Voting Trust controls about 87% of the company.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Charles Jeremiah Smith founded a machine shop in 1874 to make parts for baby carriages. The business expanded into making bicycles, and by 1895 it was a global leader in bicycle parts. The Smith family sold the firm in 1899. Charles' eldest son, Arthur, began tinkering with car frames, and by 1902 he had a breakthrough design. Arthur bought the company back in 1904 to make car frames and incorporated it as A. O. Smith.
  </p>
  <p>
   A huge 1906 contract from
   <company id="10597">
    Ford Motor
   </company>
   spurred Arthur to retool the factory, increasing production tenfold. In 1921 A. O. Smith unveiled the first automated assembly line for car frames. Dubbed the Mechanical Marvel, it could produce a frame every eight seconds and did so for the next 40 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm began production of the first glass-lined residential water heaters in 1939. Acquisitions over the next decade allowed A. O. Smith to enter the electric motor market, and in 1959 it established a plastics unit for its fiberglass pipe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 A. O. Smith expanded its electric motor business when it bought
   <company id="11627">
    Westinghouse's
   </company>
   small-motor division. The company doubled the size of its tank business by buying Peabody TecTank (dry storage tanks) the next year. Company veteran Robert O'Toole was named CEO in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   A. O. Smith sold its auto business in 1997 and bought private motor producer UPPCO. The company became the #1 North American maker of compressor motors for the air-conditioning industry with its 1998 purchase of a
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   motor unit. The next year it bought the electric-motor unit of
   <company id="10948">
    Magnetek
   </company>
   , doubling the size of its pump motor business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sold its fiberglass pipe business to
   <company id="12022">
    Varco International
   </company>
   . The next year A. O. Smith sold its storage products business to Kansas-based CST Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its manufacturing capabilities, the company acquired an electric motor maker in China from the Changheng Group (air-moving motors for the Chinese air-conditioning market) in 2002. A. O. Smith pumped up its water systems by acquiring privately held water heater manufacturer
   <company id="58661">
    State Industries
   </company>
   . Also that year A. O. Smith bought the assets of the Athens Products division of
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company again expanded its global motor manufacturing business, buying the assets of Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd., a maker of hermetic electric motors based in China. Two years later the company bought another Chinese motor manufacturer, Yueyang Special Electrical Machinery.
  </p>
  <p>
   O'Toole retired at the end of 2005 and company president Paul Jones was named CEO. In 2006 A. O. Smith acquired
   <company id="117840">
    GSW
   </company>
   , a Canadian supplier of water heaters, for about $320 million in cash. The acquisition gave A. O. Smith entree as a supplier to home improvement giant
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year the company sold GSW Building Products, a manufacturer of vinyl rain ware systems, to
   <company id="110505">
    Euramax International
   </company>
   . GSW Building Products employed about 100 people in Barrie, Ontario, and posted 2005 sales of $30 million. A. O. Smith received net proceeds of about $11.3 million from the sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   International expansion has been a focus for the company. A.O. Smith opened a sales office to import products specifically designed for the Indian market in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began manufacturing water heaters in India in 2010. In 2009 A. O. Smith acquired an 80% stake in the water treatment activities of Hong Kong-based Tianlong Holding, which offers a line of reverse osmosis (RO) products.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later A. O. Smith bought the remainder of Tianlong Holding. A. O. Smith's entry into supplying RO water filtration products to China and neighboring export markets is filtered through its foreign subsidiary, A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its electric motors segment, Electric Products Company, to Regal Beloit in 2011. The deal included $760 million in cash in addition to $140.6 million in stock in Regal Beloit. A. O. Smith used proceeds from the sale to continue to grow in emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2012, the company boosted its production in its fast-growing China market after opening its second water heater manufacturing plant in Nanjing to add 50% more capacity to its China water heater operations.
