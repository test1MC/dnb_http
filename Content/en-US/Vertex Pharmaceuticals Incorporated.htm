   Vertex Pharmaceuticals aims to cure patients with previously incurable diseases. The biotechnology firm uses an integrated, multidisciplinary approach -- employing biophysics, computer-based modeling, and functional genomics -- to speed up the discovery and development of new drugs. Its orphan drugs Kalydeco and Orkambi (launched in 2015) are used to treat cystic fibrosis; the firm is also seeking approval for the medications for other indications. Vertex has other drugs in development, including additional treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as cancer, pain, and the flu. The firm's first drug, the blockbuster hepatitis C treatment Incivek, was discontinued in 2014 after

   's popular Sovaldi hit the market.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Vertex received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   and European Commission approval for Orkambi in 2015. The company is in late-stage trials exploring the use of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in children with cystic fibrosis. Other pipeline programs include VX-66, VX-371, VX-152, and VX-440.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net product revenues represented some 60% of the company's revenue in 2015.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has R&amp;D sites in the US, Canada, and the UK; it has commercial offices in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for about three-fourths of Vertex's revenue in 2015, followed by Europe, which accounted for about 20%.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The firm markets its products to physicians through direct contact as well as through advertising, mail-outs, and public relations activities.Advertising expenses totaled $24.5 million in 2015, up from $16.2 million in 2014 and $19.6 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vertex markets Kalydeco in the US on its own, and it is working to gain approval for the drug in additional countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its top customer,
   <company id="11601">
    Walgreen
   </company>
   , brings in about 20% of total revenue;
   <company id="10984">
    CVS

   and

    Accredo

   are also large customers, accounting for about 15% of earnings each.

   After launching Incivek in 2011, the company began earning product revenues, which brought up total revenue exponentially. However, lower demand for Incivek (in light of the competition provided by Gilead's Sovaldi) caused revenue to decline in 2013 and 2014. The launch of Orkambi and growing sales of Kalydeco brought revenue back up the following year: Revenue rose 78% to $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vertex entered the black for the first time in 2011, but the drop in demand (and ultimate discontinuation) of Incivek, as well as increased R&amp;D costs, led to net losses in 2013 and 2014. However, net loss decreased 25% to $556 million in 2015, thanks largely to the increase in revenue. As of the end of 2015, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $5.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has followed revenue trends for the company. In 2015, it fell by 36% to $365 million.

  <p>
   Vertex's key strategies for growth include expanding the number of products in its pipeline as well as establishing more collaborations with other research companies. For example, in 2015 it established a collaboration with Parion Sciences to develop cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary disease treatments. Through the agreement, Vertex has global development and commercial rights to Parion's ENaC inhibitors. The company also has a research collaboration with gene editing firm CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Vertex entered into a license and collaboration agreement with BioAxone to jointly develop VX-210 for the treatment of patients with spinal cord injuries. It also has an agreement with
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen
   </company>
   , which holds the exclusive worldwide license to develop certain flu treatments.

   In 1989 venture capitalist Kevin Kinsella wooed Joshua Boger away from his job as Director of Basic Chemistry at
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   's drug research laboratory to form Vertex Pharmaceuticals. With nearly $6 million in funding, the company pursued "rational" drug design intended to cut the time and costs of bringing a drug to market. It aimed to produce drugs for diseases with large pools of sufferers. In 1990 the firm teamed with Chugai to develop immunosuppressants and went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 the company began its HIV/AIDS collaboration with an entity that later became
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ; buoyed by that and other agreements, it posted its first profit. The next year Vertex opened an office in the UK. In 1995 it licensed Alpha Therapeutic to develop its hemoglobin-disorder drug in the Americas (the agreement ended in 1997 because of a long development curve).
  </p>
  <p>
   As the century drew to a close, Vertex focused on deals to boost its drug pipeline. In 1996 it licensed a G. D. Searle patent necessary to develop its HIV/AIDS treatments; three years later the FDA approved HIV therapy Agenerase. The firm clinched a number of potentially lucrative development deals with such companies as
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   (1997, for a hepatitis C program) and
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   (2000, kinase inhibitors).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the firm cut back on its development of an arthritis drug candidate to focus instead on kinase inhibitor treatments for other inflammatory conditions. That same year it bought
   <company id="53279">
    Aurora Biosciences
   </company>
   to bolster its drug pipeline and merged it into another subsidiary to form
   <company id="106249">
    PanVera
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later the company sold the subsidiary to Invitrogen (later called
   <company id="58766">
    Life Technologies
   </company>
   ), keeping the instrumentation systems operations (renamed Aurora Instruments). Vertex also received good news in 2003: The FDA approved HIV therapy Lexiva, a drug partnered with GlaxoSmithKline. In late 2003 the company spun off its Discovery Tools and Services unit for $101 million to concentrate on drug development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered collaborations with
   <company id="119821">
    Mitsubishi Tanabe
   </company>
   and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporation (CFFTI, an affiliate of the
   <company id="109420">
    Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
   </company>
   ) in 2004 on its hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis candidates. In 2006 Vertex added Janssen Therapeutica (a subsidiary of
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   ) as a partner for the hepatitis C program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vertex sold royalty rights for its two co-discovered HIV drugs (Lexiva/Telzir and Agenerase) to development and marketing partner GlaxoSmithKline in 2008.

   Founder and CEO Dr. Joshua Boger retired in 2009, but chose to stay on as a company director. Five-year board member (and former head of UK drug firm
   <company id="56567">
    Shire plc
   </company>
   ) Matthew Emmens stepped up to replace Boger. The two worked together at Merck before Boger founded Vertex. Emmens himself retired in 2012 and was replaced by Jeffrey Leiden, another board member and a former
   <company id="10030">

   executive.
