   School spirit tops the shopping list of customers of AAC Group. Doing business as American Achievement, the company manufactures and supplies class rings, yearbooks, and letter athletic jackets, as well as graduation items, such as caps and gowns, diplomas, and announcements for the US elementary through high school and college markets. Its ring and accessory brands include ArtCarved, Balfour, and Keepsake. Although scholastic products account for most of its sales, AAC Group also makes commemorative jewelry for families, bridal jewelry, personalized rings for the military, bowling tournaments, and pro sports such as World Series, Super Bowl, and Stanley Cup. The memorabilia maker is owned by

   AAC Group's business is closely tied to the school year. The company looks to diversify its product portfolio with new interactive technologies, including a multimedia line that students can use to capture their personal milestones. To lead the change, Fenway in mid-2011 tapped Steve Parr as president and CEO. Parr, most recently head of

   magazine publisher

   </company>
   , comes to AAC Group with 20-plus years of expertise in media and digital strategy initiatives spanning the US, Canada, and England.
  </p>
  <p>
   The move to diversify follows the publishing industry's transition from print to digital. In addition to class rings, yearbooks (produced by the company's Balfour Publishing and Taylor Publishing units) are AAC Group's biggest sellers, regularly generating about 40% of revenue, each. The company sells its class rings through mass merchandisers (including

   and

   ), booksellers (including

    Barnes &amp; Noble
   </company>
   and
   <company id="112006">
    Follett
   </company>
   ), online, and through campus sales representatives. In contrast, yearbooks are sold directly to students by their academic institutions. The yearbooks, which are marketed under the Taylor Publishing name, are produced under contract with universities and elementary and secondary schools.
