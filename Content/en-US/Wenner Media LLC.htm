   How does it feel to be a complete unknown? The rock stars that grace the cover of
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   wouldn't know. Magazine publisher Wenner Media owns
   <i>
    Rolling Stone
   </i>
   , its flagship publication that has been covering music and pop culture for more than four decades. The company also publishes men's lifestyle mag
   <i>
    Men's Journal
   </i>
   and gossipy entertainment title
   <i>
    US Weekly
   </i>
   . In addition, Wenner Media operates its magazines' corresponding websites -- RollingStone.com, USMagazine.com, and MensJournal.com. More than 42 million readers read its magazines each month, while 22 million people visit the company's websites. Jann Wenner started
   <i>
    Rolling Stone
   </i>
   in 1967.

  <p>
   As a result of a weak economy that has significantly hurt the magazine industry, the company is seeing declining profitability and ad-page count at its titles. In particular, Wenner Media's
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   title has faltered, feeling the heat from younger titles such as
   <i>
    Maxim
   </i>
   , as well as the effects of the siphoning of readers to free content online. Sister publications
   <em>
    US Weekly
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Men's Journal
   </em>
   have fared better, fueled by the public's appetite for celebrity gossip, as well as a less cluttered market with respect to content for men.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like the rest of the media world, Wenner Media has been focusing on digital content and advertising in order to offset losses from print. In 2012 it entered a partnership with
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo!
   </company>
   in a deal that granted
   <em>
    US Weekly
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   permanent branded pages on Yahoo!'s site in exchange for Yahoo! branding on RollingStone.com and USMagazine.com.
   <em>
    Men's Journal
   </em>
   is being distributed on Yahoo! in addition.

  <p>
   A 21-year-old University of California at Berkeley dropout named Jann Wenner started a "little rock and roll newspaper" in 1967 in hopes that it would help him meet Bob Dylan and John Lennon. The name
   <i>
    Rolling Stone,
   </i>
   derived from a Muddy Waters song, was suggested by Wenner's mentor, Ralph Gleason, a San Francisco music critic. With a backing of $7,500 (much of which was supplied by the parents of his future wife Jane), Wenner formed Straight Arrow Publishers, taking the company name (and the magazine's subscription list) from a rival counterculture rag.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfazed by a string of new magazines that failed, Straight Arrow started a book division in 1971 with the publication of Wenner's extensive interview with Lennon. The company saw its first profit that year, and as the 1970s rolled on, the stature of
   <i>
    Rolling Stone
   </i>
   grew with contributions from gonzo avatar Hunter S. Thompson and celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz (not to mention breaking the inside story of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst's kidnapping). Straight Arrow flew out of San Francisco in 1977, opting for the mass-media high life in New York.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wenner's 1985 purchase of 25% of
   <i>
    US
   </i>
   magazine marked the start of the company's first non-
   <i>
    Rolling Stone
   </i>
   survivor. Straight Arrow bought the rest of
   <i>
    US
   </i>
   in 1989 and began
   <i>
    Men's Journal
   </i>
   in 1992. The company changed its name to Wenner Media in 1993, the same year it reached out to yuppie parents by delivering
   <i>
    Family Life
   </i>
   (which was sold off three years later). Turmoil erupted in 1995 when Wenner was "outed"; the subsequent separation from his wife led to rampant speculation about the company's future (Jane owned 49%). Wenner maintained control of the company, however, and the couple remains married.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later Wenner Media expanded its online offerings by combining JAMtv (which became Tunes.com, which later was bought by EMusic.com) with RollingStone.com to form the Rolling Stone Network. It launched international editions of
   <i>
    Rolling Stone
   </i>
   in Latin America in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed the monthly
   <i>
    US
   </i>
   into entertainment news magazine
   <i>
    US Weekly
   </i>
   in early 2000, in hopes of reversing its faltering circulation and to compete better with Time Inc.'s
   <i>
    Entertainment Weekly
   </i>
   and
   <em>
    People
   </em>
   . It reportedly lost some $30 million making the format switch. Wenner turned to Walt Disney as an investor in 2001, selling 50% of
   <em>
    US Weekly
   </em>
   to the media conglomerate. Wenner reacquired the stake from Disney in 2006 for an estimated $300 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004
   <company id="48035">
    RealNetworks
   </company>
   took over the operation of RollingSone.com through a licensing agreement with Wenner Media. RealNetworks used the site to provide its Rhapsody streaming and downloadable music service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The end of Kent Brownridge's 31-year reign as general manager of Wenner Media came in 2005. Despite rumors of his falling out with longtime business partner Jann Wenner, both men reported the departure as a voluntarily retirement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   changed formats, replacing its iconic oversized newsprint version with the more conventional 8-by-11-inch glossy. In 2010 Wenner Media resumed control of RollingStone.com and launched a redesign of the site.
