  <p>
   Halma is a highly decentralized organization, which it believes is a competitive advantage. Its subsidiaries are grouped into operating divisions, each of which is an autonomous unit responsible for its own growth organically and by acquisitions, many of which are small, niche-oriented, bolt-on additions that add new technology and local manufacturing or sales operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each of Halma's four main business segments -- Environmental and Analysis, Medical, Infrastructure Safety, and Process Safety -- consist of two or three operating divisions. Through this autonomous and agile structure and a broad product portfolio, the company's strategy is to build strong positions in niche markets where the demand is global.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's biggest business is infrastructure safety, accounting for 30% or revenue, followed by process safety and medical, about 27% each, and Environmental and Analysis, 16%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Halma is headquartered in Amersham, UK, and it operates through subsidiaries in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, and the US. It operates worldwide, but Europe accounts for nearly 44%, followed by the US (32%) and the Asia/Pacific (16%).
  </p>

  <p>
   Worldwide, demand is being driven by growing urbanization, aging populations, and increasingly stringent health, safety, and environmental regulations. Halma is clearly benefiting from this demand as it boasts an impressive history of delivering record profits, strong cash flows, and year-over-year revenue increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue rose 7%, but profit fell 4% from 2014 to 2015 (ended March). The revenue rise was attributed even growth from organic increases and from acquisitions. At 25%, Halma's Process Safety segment posted the highest rate of growth in 2015. Higher operating expenses cut into the company's profit.

  <p>
   The company continues to grow organically by investing in employee and management training and new product development in the areas of health, safety, and the environment. It also invests strongly in developing markets, particularly in China. Many companies in the group are also developing a stronger presence in South American markets, such as Brazil. In developing markets, the need for infrastructure development in the areas of water treatment and leakage control is anticipated to grow.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using resources reaped from its organic growth, Halma funds strategic acquisitions to accelerate its entry into new market niches; it also disposes of under-performing businesses. In 2012 it divested its Tritech operations to Moog Components to focus on its activities outside the marine energy market.

  <p>
   Continuing its acquisition spree in 2014, Halma completed the $116 million (US) purchase of RCS, which designs, manufactures, and sells pipeline corrosion monitoring products and systems. Its markets include energy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and utilities. The acquisition expands Halma's reach into the energy and utility sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Halma bought ASL Holdings, a maker of communication products used in SMART meters for the utility, transportation, and retail sectors. Halma is integrating ASL into its Environmental and Analysis segment. It previously added to this segment and widened its reach in Asia through the purchase of Hong Kong-based Thinketron Precision Equipment Company, a maker of fluid handling pump products sold throughout China.

  <p>
   Halma originated as The Nahalma Tea Estate Company Limited in 1884 in what is now Sri Lanka. The company officially became Nahalma Rubber Estate Company Limited in 1937 and, as suggested by its name, managed rubber-producing activities in Sri Lanka. When the government nationalized many of the island's enterprises, including rubber industries, in the 1950s, Nahalma Rubber Estate Company Limited changed its name and focus in 1956 to become investment firm Halma Investments Limited.
