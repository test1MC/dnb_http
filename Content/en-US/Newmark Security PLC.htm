   Newmark Security doesn't apologize for its "better safe than sorry" business approach. The company operates two divisions: electronic security and asset protection. Its electronic security division develops supporting software and manufactures electronically controlled access control systems, such as its JANUS and N-TEC access control systems. Newmark's physical security division provides asset protection security systems, such as its Eclipse bullet-resistant moving screens that are controlled by staff to reduce risk and secure cash management machines. Newmark also has a 87% stake in ATM Protection, a company that makes systems to protect ATMs during use, refilling, and service.

  <p>
   Newmark has operations primarily in the UK, the US, and Europe. The UK accounts for 85% of its revenue.

  <p>
   The company's net revenue increased 5% in 2014 due to growth in access control revenue resulting from the introduction of its SATEON product. Asset protection sales also spiked in 2014 due to the acquisition of CSI, a former division of Gunnebo UK Limited.
