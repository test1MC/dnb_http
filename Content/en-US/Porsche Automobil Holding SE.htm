   More than a century after founder Ferdinand Porsche began designing autos, Porsche is still burning rubber. The company comprises twelve brands from seven European countries: Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN. (Volkswagen is its best-selling passenger car, generating nearly 60% of net sales in 2013.) In addition, branded consumer goods also leverage the company's global image as a premium sports car maker.

   Porsche SE is sticking with its winning formula of long product life cycles, eschewing a spike in sales through artificial financing gimmicks or cash incentives. The company integrates major suppliers into the early stages of the new vehicle design and development process, benefiting from additional knowledge and products. In addition, Porsche continues to expand its international sales, serving customers in over 100 countries. It is focusing on markets such as China, Russia, the Middle East, and Latin America, which have shown an average growth rate of 35%.

  <p>
   Ferdinand Porsche was 25 when a battery-powered car with a motor he had designed was unveiled at the Paris Exposition in 1900. Six years later, Porsche was hired by
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler Motor
   </company>
   . During his rise to chief engineer at Daimler, he designed the famous Mercedes-Benz S-series.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frustrated by the conservative nature of his employer, Porsche quit and opened an engine-design company bearing his name in 1931. The next year Josef Stalin offered to make Porsche the head of the Soviet Union's auto industry. Porsche turned Stalin down.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1933 Hitler announced his intention to build a widely affordable "volkswagen" (people's car). Soon Porsche was designing the vehicle that would become the Volkswagen Beetle. During WWII Porsche continued work on the Volkswagen project and also provided advice on increasing Germany's factory production. After the war, Ferdinand and his son Ferry were imprisoned for two years in France for allegedly abusing French laborers. Father and son were compelled to work on the Renault line of automobiles. After his release, Ferdinand reportedly burst into tears and exclaimed, "My Beetle!" when he saw his Volkswagen cars populating the streets in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1948 Ferdinand and Ferry had developed a Porsche sports-car prototype based on the Volkswagen. It was named the 356 because it was the 356th project undertaken at the Porsche design office. In 1950 the first Porsche 356 rolled off the assembly line in Stuttgart. Ferdinand Porsche lived just long enough to see his sports cars become highly sought by the rich and famous. He died in 1951.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1952 Ferry designed the Porsche emblem, which combined the Porsche name and the Stuttgart and Wurttemberg coats of arms. Porsches won hundreds of races during the 1950s, and the car's popularity grew. (James Dean was driving his brand-new Porsche when he was killed in 1955.)
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1960s Ferry Porsche decided to build an entirely new Porsche model that didn't rely so heavily on the Beetle's design. The company unveiled the Type 911 Porsche in 1964 and discontinued the 356 the next year. In 1973 the company went public under the Porsche AG name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company flourished in the 1980s, due largely to its cars' popularity in the US. By 1986 Porsche was producing almost 50,000 cars a year, with about 60% of them destined for the US market. Models introduced in the late 1980s included the 912, the 924, and the 928.
  </p>
  <p>
   Porsche's fortunes crashed in the early 1990s, when the company faced tough competition and a recession priced many consumers out of the sports-car market. In 1992 the company sold only 23,060 cars -- 4,100 of those in the US. That year Wendelin Wiedeking, an engineering and manufacturing expert, was brought in as CEO. He cut costs, in part, by convincing most workers to reduce the number of hours they worked each day and eliminating overtime. Wiedeking also updated the 911 and initiated development of the Boxster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Introduced in 1996, the $40,000 Boxster was an instant hit -- its first year of production sold out in advance. In 1998 the company initiated plans to produce a luxury SUV in partnership with Volkswagen. Porsche launched the Boxster S, featuring a 250-hp engine, in 1999. The next year Porsche announced that its Cayenne SUV -- which shares a platform with Volkswagen's SUV -- would hit the market in 2003. Early in 2002 Porsche announced its next product launch -- the Carrera GT. Production of the Carrera GT began the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The extraordinary shareholders meeting of Porsche, which was held in June 2007, passed a resolution to change the organizational form of the company to a European stock corporation, a Societas Europaea (SE). The company's name was changed from Dr. Ing. h.c.F. Porsche AG to Porsche Automobil Holding SE.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the European Court of Justice overturned a German law protecting VW from a formal takeover, allowing Porsche to increase its holdings to an over-50% stake in 2008 (at a cost of €21.9 million). Porsche achieved controlling interest in Volkswagen along with 74% of the voting rights. Under Germany's domination law, once Porsche reached a 75% stake, it would control the finances of VW.
  </p>
  <p>
   The companies, however, battled over a range of issues, including VW's attempt to restrict Porsche's access to technology from its Audi premium brand, and Porsche's request for VW diesels. After again increasing its stake in VW, Porsche was required to make an offer for Audi, a division of VW. Porsche named one of
   <company id="91128">
    Audi
   </company>
   's chairmen to its 12-person supervisory board to mollify Audi managers. Porsche also acquired indirect control of
   <company id="51695">
    Scania
   </company>
   , a Swedish truck manufacturer and a division of VW.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Porsche announced its plans to take full control of VW. The families that control Porsche and VW agreed on forming an integrated car manufacturing group. However, Porsche's €9 billion debt, which was mostly run up in Porsche's acquisition of VW share options and shares, became a millstone around the company's neck in the worldwide credit crunch, thwarting its plans to take over VW. VW loaned €700 million to Porsche in 2009, as Porsche applied for a loan of €1.75 billion from a German government bank.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tables turned on Porsche. With a lack of the necessary cash to move forward with its plans to acquire VW, it ended up selling 49.9% of its company to VW in 2009. The Porsche and Piëch families, along with Qatar Holdings and Lower Saxony, own the remaining stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   The dream ended in July 2009 with the dismissal of Porsche's CEO Wendelin Wiedeking and CFO Holger Härter. With the exit of Wiedeking, the way was cleared for a merger with VW. Former Porsche production executive Michael Macht was named as Wiedeking successor in late 2009. Macht, however, would hold the title for less than a year with the announcement that longtime VW executive Matthias Mueller would become the CEO of Porsche in October 2010. Macht moves on to the position of VW's production chief.
