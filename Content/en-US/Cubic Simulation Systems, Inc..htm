  <p>
   George Young founded Educational Computer in 1961 to develop a vocational and technical training product called the SMART trainer. The company signed a deal in 1966 with the US Office of Education to supply SMART trainers to three Pennsylvania vocational high schools. Educational Computer went public in 1968. The next year it merged with computer firm E.D.P. Technology and changed its name to ECC International.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shedding unprofitable operations, the company restructured in 1973. By the 1980s ECC had become one of the leading makers of simulation products as it concentrated on trainers for the maintenance of military equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 ECC expanded into making vending machines. That year the company also signed a deal to build a simulator for the M1A2 Abrams tank and the M2A1 Bradley fighting vehicle system. It signed a $12 million contract with Vickers in 1995 to develop a simulator for the UK's new main battle tank, the Challenger II. Contract delays led to a sales slump in fiscal 1997, and ECC began to focus on joint ventures and acquisitions. To reduce debt, the company sold its vending machine subsidiary to Maytag that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 industry veteran James Garrett replaced retiring president and CEO George Murphy, who had held both titles since 1970. The company closed its money-losing UK subsidiary, ECC Simulation Limited, in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Co. cancelled their Javelin simulator contract in 2000, the loss of millions of dollars of business forced ECC to cut 25% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delays in the awarding of the Javelin Multi-Year 2 and EST Lot 2 contracts resulted in a fall-off in sales in 2001, but the company signed a contract for 377 Javelin Field Tactical Trainers in 2002. Late in 2003 ECC was acquired by rival simulator manufacturer Cubic in a deal worth about $42 million. ECC became Cubic Simulation Systems Division in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the acquisition, ECC was dependent on a small number of programs and products: A single contract for 377 Javelin Field Tactical Trainers accounted for 52% of the company's 2002 sales. Without that contract, ECC's sales likely would have continued the steady year-to-year decline that had been under way since 1998.
