  <p>
   In early 2017, REV launched an IPO and raised $275 million. It is using the money to pay down debt, but it also plans to invest the net proceeds into  securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, or guaranteed obligations of the US government.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   REV operates through three segments: Fire &amp; Emergency (40% of net sales), Commercial (35%), and Recreation (25%). In 2016, it sold approximately 17,300 units and has an estimated installed base of approximately 240,000 vehicles in operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   It sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One (E-ONE) and Kovatch Mobile Equipment (KME) brands and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles (AEV), Horton Emergency Vehicles (Horton), Leader Emergency Vehicles (Leader), and Frontline brands, among others.

  <p>
   REV's manufacturing and service network consists of 15 manufacturing facilities and 11 aftermarket service locations. The US generates almost all of its revenue (99% of net sales).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company caters to municipalities, government agencies, private contractors, consumers, and industrial and commercial end users. Its top 10 customers represent 25% of net sales, with no single customer representing more than 6% of net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   REV's revenues jumped 11% from $1.7 billion in 2015 to $1.9 billion in 2016. Its profits also increased from $23 million to $30 million and its cash flow from operations surged from $26 million to $76 million over that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2016 fueled by a surge in sales from its Fire &amp; Emergency segment due to additional fire apparatus sales and additional revenue from the acquisition of KME. Higher Recreation sales in 2016 were due to higher unit sales volumes primarily from its Class A diesel products. In contrast, lower Commercial segment sales were attributed to lower shuttle bus units shipped during 2016.

  <p>
   REV believes its diverse end markets are favorably exposed to multiple secular growth drivers. These include rising municipal spending, a growing aged population, growing urbanization, growing student populations, the increasing popularity of outdoor and active lifestyles, and the replacement of existing in-service vehicles including legislated replacements. In addition to these drivers of growth, REV believes several of its served markets will benefit over the next several years from incremental demand created by the under-investment in fleets following the Great Recession.
  </p>
  <p>
   REV also focuses on new product development across its three segments. It introduced eight new products in 2016. It currently has 11 new products in development that it anticipates will be released in fiscal year 2017.

  <p>
   The company has generated additional revenue over the years through the help of acquisitions. In 2016, REV purchased rival Kovatch Mobile Equipment Corp. (KME). Based in Pennsylvania, KME makes fire apparatus (pumpers, aerials, tankers), rescue vehicles, and fuel trucks, and has operations in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, and California.
