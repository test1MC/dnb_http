   Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings is a leading US producer and marketer of fuel-grade ethanol, a grain alcohol made from corn and mainly used as a gasoline additive to reduce vehicle carbon emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuel. It produces ethanol at facilities (with a total capacity of 460 million gallons a year) in Illinois, Indiana, and Nebraska. Ethanol production by-products (including corn feed, brewers yeast, and distillers grain) provide another source of revenues and help offset Aventine's corn costs. Buckeye Energy Services and

   are among Aventine's largest customers. The company was acquired by

   in 2015.

  <p>
   Like other biofuel manufacturers VeraSun and Nova Biosource, Aventine filed for bankruptcy protection in early 2009, citing high corn prices and dropping demand for ethanol spurred on by a flagging economy. Aventine also saw its distribution business continue to decrease throughout the year. In 2010 the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

   Aventine is a leading US ethanol producer and marketer and distributes ethanol to leading energy companies as a automotive fuel additive. It also produces several by-products, such as distillers grain, corn gluten meal and feed, corn germ, and grain distillers dried yeast, which generate revenues and helps Aventine offset a major portion of its corn costs.

   In 2012 Aventine completed its restructuring transaction with members of its lender group, converting the majority of its outstanding term loan debt into newly issued common equity (92.5% of the issued and outstanding common stock).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company was hoping to take advantage of the
   <company id="130205">
    EPA
   </company>
   's approval of the E15 blend (15% ethanol in every gallon of auto fuel) to increase ethanol producers' output and sales of ethanol. (Previous regulations limited ethanol use to 10% of an ethanol/gasoline fuel blend known as E10).

   In 2010 Aventine resumed construction of two 108-million-gallon biorefinery projects in Nebraska and Indiana, both of which were near completion when it filed for bankruptcy. It also acquired Riverland Biofuels's ethanol production facility in Canton, Illinois, for $16.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aventine formed its Bio-Products division in 1998 to produce and market distiller's yeast and other value-added products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1981.
