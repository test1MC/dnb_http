   Quanex Building Products (QBP) makes engineered materials and components for OEMs of building products. Its Engineered Products and Aluminum Sheet Products operations serve the new home building and remodeling markets in North America and, lesser so, in Asia and Europe. QBP produces aluminum flat-rolled products used in exterior home trims, screens, and gutters. It also churns out window and door components, insulating glass spacers, solar panel sealants, and extruded vinyl and composite framing material for fenestration OEMs. QBP generates around 80% of its total sales in the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   QBP operates across three main segments. North American (NA) Engineered Components is focused on the fenestration market in North America and makes vinyl profiles, insulating glass spacers, screens, and other fenestration components. European Engineered (EU) Components is comprised of its UK-based vinyl extrusion business (vinyl profiles) and its European insulating glass business, which makes insulating glass spacers. North American (NA) Cabinet Components is comprised solely of its North American cabinet door and components business.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   QBP operates through roughly 35 manufacturing facilities located in 17 states in the US. Internationally it has one facility in Germany, one in Mexico, and two in the UK. The US accounts for about 80% of net sales.

  <p>
   The company sells its components, products, and systems to national and regional OEMs through a direct sales force in North America and the UK, supplemented with a limited use of distributors and independent sales agents.

  <p>
   QBP has seen its revenues fluctuate over the years. After declining in 2015, revenues jumped 44% to reach $928 million in 2016. The growth was fueled by a 60% surge in sales from European Engineered (EU) Components, which was aided by the previous international acquisition of HLP. Its NA Cabinet Components segment also achieved growth due to the 2015 acquisition of Woodcraft Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, however, posted a net loss of almost $2 million during 2016 mostly due to an additional $37 million it paid on interest expenses. Its operating cash flow jumped from $67 million in 2015 to $86 million in 2016 mainly due to about $16 million it earned on debt discounts.

  <p>
   QBP's growth strategy continues to orbit around North American new home construction and residential remodeling and replacement (R&amp;R) activity. It has also improved its international presence with the 2015 purchase of HLP, a provider of vinyl extruded products in the UK.

  <p>
   QBP is focusing on improving the energy efficiency, durability, and aesthetics of its window and door components through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 the company acquired Minnesota-based
   <company id="117541">
    Woodcraft Industries
   </company>
   , a premier supplier of doors and components to leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the kitchen and bathroom cabinet industry, for $246 million. The acquisition expanded QBP's position in the $3 billion kitchen and bath cabinet component industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, the company enhanced its international presence through the purchase of HLP, one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded products in the UK in terms of volume shipped. The deal diversified QBP's client base as HLP's primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market.
