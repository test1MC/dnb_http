   's fashion and leather goods business group, which generated 35% of 2014 sales for the luxury goods company.

   Thomas Pink has been responsible for robust revenue growth despite an economic downturn in recent years. The clothier has continued to boost its presence in existing locations while also looking for new areas for growth, such as entering the Mexican, Australian, and Indian markets.

   The company relies on growth in its key markets -- the UK and the US -- and regularly rolls out new products. Most notably, the company has seen successes among its online boutique from sales of its White Shirt Bar and Informal shirt line. Thomas Pink logged similar sales increases with its Imperial, Informal, and Comfort Stretch shirt lines. Thomas Pink added breadth to its products portfolio by enlisting the expertise of British designer Bill Amberg to create a line of shirt dresses and a leather line.

   Thomas Pink's products and services have given the apparel company a competitive edge worldwide. The shirt company offers a Personally Pink custom-order shirt service. At certain Thomas Pink stores customers make an appointment with a company tailor, either at the store or at their office or home. Thomas Pink also offers monogramming, delivery, and online services through its website for those who cannot make it to a store.
