   Going up? ThyssenKrupp Elevator looks to elevate the elevator operations of its parent company, global industrial giant
   <company id="59131">
    ThyssenKrupp AG
   </company>
   . Through divisions spread across five continents, the company makes, distributes, and services passenger and freight elevators, escalators, and moving walkways. It also offers handicapped accessibility products, such as stairway lifts, platform lifts, and home elevators. The company's products are used in such prominent buildings as the Sydney Opera House, London's City Hall, and New York's high-rise Time Warner Center. ThyssenKrupp provided over 70 elevators and 12 escalators for the One World Trade Center, under construction at the site of the former Twin Towers.

  <p>
   ThyssenKrupp's elevator business is organized across four business units. Three units concentrate on the regional elevator and escalator business (Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific). The other one operates globally as Access Solutions (passenger boarding bridges, chair, service and platform lifts, as well as home elevators).

  <p>
   The company accounted for 17% of the total net sales of its parent company in 2015. Elevator Technology's sales were 12% higher compared to the previous year as a result of stronger demand for new installations and positive exchange-rate effects.

In 2015 Thyssenkrupp Elevator invested to advance its manufacturing presence in Neuhausen. More than â‚¬80 million in total was invested in the upgrade and modernization of the technology park.

Lift &amp; Engineering specializes in the design and manufacture of all types of lift equipment and drive systems to meet site conditions or customer specifications. The deal opened opportunities for improved efficiency and profitable growth.
