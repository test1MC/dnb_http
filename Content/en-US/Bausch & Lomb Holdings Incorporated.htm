   The eyes are the windows to a business model for Bausch &amp; Lomb. Operating as Bausch + Lomb, the eye care firm is best known as a top maker of contact lenses and lens care solutions (including the PureVision and ReNu brands). Along with its contact lens products, Bausch + Lomb makes prescription ophthalmic drugs Alrex, Lotemax, and Zylet. It also makes over-the-counter vitamins and drops through its pharmaceuticals division. The company's surgical unit makes instruments and equipment for cataract, vitreoretinal, and other ophthalmic surgeries. Bausch + Lomb markets its products in more than 100 countries worldwide. Bausch + Lomb is owned by Canadian drug maker

  <p>
   Bausch + Lomb's vision care division makes a variety of contact lenses, as well as lens care and cleaning products. Meanwhile, the cataract and vitreoretinal surgery unit makes products used to surgically replace cataract-affected lenses, as well as to treat retinal disease. The company's Crystalens intraocular lens procedure is a commonly performed outpatient surgery which has a short recovery period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bausch + Lomb's pharmaceuticals division makes prescription and over-the-counter ophthalmic drugs, as well as vitamins for ocular health. Its vitamin product line includes products for age-related macular degeneration (PreserVision) and dry eye, as well as nutritionals for diabetics. The division also sells prescription anti-inflammatory/anti-infective Zylet, and plans to develop more proprietary prescription drugs over the long term.

  <p>
   Bausch + Lomb's growth strategy is to expand its product offerings through a combination of internal research, acquisition, and partnership efforts. The company is especially enhancing its lens offerings to include bifocal and multi-focal contact lenses to cash in on an aging population in need of reading glasses. Bausch + Lomb is also boosting its surgery business in order to address the boom in cataract and corrective eye surgeries in older vision patients, as well as younger consumers who are tired of wearing corrective lenses of any sort. As it works to expand its pharmaceutical operations, Bausch + Lomb often collaborates with other drug makers, such as CrystalGenomics,
   <company id="143224">
    Galapagos
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11175">

  <p>
   Parent company

   also aims to leverage the Bausch + Lomb brand in emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company must stay on its toes when it comes to developing new products as competition from companies such as
   <company id="89515">
    Alcon

   (Opti-Free), as well as generic product manufacturers, continue to try to nudge their way toward the top of the eye care industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Bausch + Lomb expanded the power range of its Biotrue ONEday for presbyopia contact lenses and introduced the MoRoCCo VA App to help eye care professionals Fit KeraSoft IC Soft Contact Lenses.

   In 2013
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant
   </company>
   acquired Bausch + Lomb from its former owner, private equity firm
   <company id="103796">
    Warburg Pincus
   </company>
   , in an $8.7 billion deal (including some $4.5 billion in cash and $4.2 billion in debt). The deal expanded Valeant's specialty drug and medical device offerings and boosted its overall position in the global pharmaceuticals market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the Valeant agreement, the company had filed to go public in March 2013, with hopes to raise $100 million in its initial public offering. It planned to use the IPO proceeds to repay debt. Owner Warburg Pincus had begun looking at options to sell Bausch + Lomb in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the acquisition, Bausch + Lomb retained its name and began operating as a division of Valeant.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1853 German immigrant Jacob Bausch opened a small store in Rochester, New York, to sell European optical imports. Henry Lomb soon became a partner by lending Bausch $60.
  </p>
  <p>
   The then Bausch &amp; Lomb's first major breakthrough came with Bausch's invention of Vulcanite (a hard rubber) eyeglass frames. The company fitted the frames with European lenses, and by 1880 had a New York City sales office. The company later began making microscopes, binoculars, and telescopes.
  </p>
  <p>
   It incorporated in 1908 as Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. In 1912 Jacob's son, William Bausch, became one of the few to make optical-quality glass in the US. During WWI the company supplied the military with lenses for binoculars, searchlights, rifle scopes, and telescopes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Army Air Corps commissioned the company in 1929 to create lenses to reduce sun glare for pilots. Bausch &amp; Lomb responded with Ray-Ban sunglasses; they were made available to the public in 1936 and went on to become a company mainstay. Bausch &amp; Lomb went public in 1938.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company won an Oscar in the 1950s for its Cinemascope lens; it won government contracts for lenses used in satellite and missile systems in the 1960s. Bausch &amp; Lomb also bought such firms as Ferson Optics (1968) and Reese Optical (1969). It began concentrating on contact lenses after the FDA approved its soft lenses in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Daniel Gill, who had helped build the soft contact lens business, became CEO. He sold the company's prescription eyeglass services and industrial instruments units and diversified into medical products and research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earnings soared in the 1990s with foreign expansion and acquisitions, including Steri-Oss (dental implants); the Curel and Soft Sense skin care lines from S.C. Johnson &amp; Son; Award, a Scottish manufacturer of disposable contacts (1996); and Arnette Optic Illusions sport sunglasses (1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Gill's insistence on double-digit growth contributed to a dubious ethical climate in which some executives used questionable tactics to put more sales on the books. This led to an SEC probe (closed in 1997 with no fines or penalties assessed) and a shareholder lawsuit (settled in 1997 for $42 million). That year the company also paid $1.7 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging Bausch &amp; Lomb was marketing one type of contact lens under several different product names with varying prices. Gill resigned under fire in 1995 and was replaced by outside director William Waltrip; he turned the reins over to William Carpenter in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Noncore divisions were sold (oral care and dental implant businesses in 1996; skin care line to Kao subsidiary Andrew Jergens in 1998) in a $100 million restructuring program, and 1,900 jobs were cut. The company entered the cataract and refractive surgery market, buying Chiron's vision unit in 1998 and ophthalmic diagnostic technology company Orbtek in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on eye care, in 1999 the company sold its sunglasses unit to
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica
   </company>
   , and Charles River Laboratories to an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, now
   <company id="43826">
    Credit Suisse First Boston
   </company>
   . Bausch &amp; Lomb then consolidated its manufacturing operations and cut its workforce.

   CIBA Vision unit over its new PureVision extended-wear lenses, the company withdrew disputed product ads after an FDA warning in 1999. In 2000 the company made a failed bid for tinted contact lensmaker Wesley Jessen VisionCare (which was later bought by and merged into CIBA Vision). The company's successful purchases that year included Groupe Chauvin, a maker of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. In 2001 Bausch &amp; Lomb bought the ophthalmic business of

   Ronald Zarrella became chairman and CEO of Bausch &amp; Lomb in 2001, after seven years with

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company reintroduced its extended-wear PureVision lens, which had been the subject of a years-long patent dispute with
   <company id="111411">
    CIBA Vision
   </company>
   . The two companies resolved the dispute in 2004, agreeing to cross-license rights to the technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than 700 people fell victim to a rare and dangerous fungal infection while using Bausch &amp; Lomb's ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution between 2005 and 2006. The company recalled the product, which had been its leading brand. Expenses associated with the recall hurt the company's bottom line, as well as its stock price. A desire to keep any settlement expenses out of the public eye contributed to the company's decision to go private in 2008.

  <p>
   Also in 2008, the company acquired intraocular lens maker

  </p>
  <p>
   Bausch &amp; Lomb and Pfizer created a bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) treatment called Besivance that received
   <company id="144161">

   approval in 2009 and is marketed by Bausch + Lomb and Pfizer in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company redesigned its logo and corporate identity to begin operating as Bausch + Lomb, with the B+L logo being phased into use on its product packaging and marketing materials over time. Many of its products carried the new labeling as of late 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its offerings through the 2010 acquisitions of cataract surgery drug Miochol-E from
   <company id="114003">
    Novartis
   </company>
   and topical anti-viral treatment Zirgan from Sirion Therapeutics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Bausch + Lomb expanded its South American operations through the acquisition of Argentinean contact lens maker Waicon.
  </p>
  <p>
   New Bausch + Lomb product launches included the PureVision 2 contact lens line for astigmatism (2011), Lotemax ointment for post-operative inflammation (2011), and enVista intraocular lenses for corrective surgeries (2012).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Bausch + Lomb acquired ISTA Pharmaceuticals for approximately $500 million. The buy nearly doubled the number of mid-to late-stage novel therapies in its pipeline and increased its offerings by adding ISTA's product portfolio which includes four prescription ophthalmology products: Bromday, Bepreve, Istalol, and Vitrase.
