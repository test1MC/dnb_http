   Société BIC keeps things handy. The French consumer products company sells its ubiquitous lighters, pens, and shavers in 160 countries. It sells its products through stationery stores, tobacco shops, drugstores, supermarkets, and office supply stores. BIC also offers custom-printed advertising and promotional products, and its brand can be found on surfboards, kayaks, and other water sports products, as well as on prepaid cell phones. Founder Baron Marcel Bich launched the BIC Cristal ballpoint pen in 1949, which has grown to hold the #1 spot in Europe and #2 spot in North America.

  <p>
   BIC's stationery products (such as pens, pencils, highlighters, markers, crayons, and correction items) are its top sellers, generating about 33% of revenues. Lighters (disposable, utility, and special-edition) contribute some 29% of sales, and shavers (men's and women's) bring in about 20% of sales. Other products (water sports gear, promotional items, cell phones) and BIC Graphic account for the remaining roughly 18% of revenues. BIC's "other products" category has grown in recent years as the company diversified its offerings amid the global economic downturn.

  <p>
   Based in France, BIC operates in 160 countries, and it adapts its products to local climates and writing styles that affect pen performance. It generates 46% of its revenue from North America, 24% from Europe, and the rest from developing markets in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has 27 factories on 5 continents across the globe.

  <p>
   Revenue grew strongly in 2015 to €2.2 billion, a 13% increase. Lighters and Shavers led the way, and while all geographic zones made contributions to growth, Eastern Europe and Latin America posted double-digit growth due to the success of triple-blade disposable shavers in Brazil, among other things.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 24% to €325 million, mostly due to the increase in sales. Net cash flow from operating activities likewise climbed 5% to €367 million, mostly caused by the increase in sales but also due to disposals of properties and operations in New Zealand and Texas.

   Given its strong position in slow-growing developed markets, BIC looks to developing markets to support expansion. To this end the company acquired Cello, the top pen and pencil manufacturer in India, in 2016 for around €74 million, and hopes to drive Cello's market share in India.

  <p>
   In 1945 Italian-born Marcel Bich and partner Edouard Buffard bought a factory near Paris and formed PPA to make fountain pen parts and mechanical lead pencils. Bich was inspired by the cartridge-filled ballpoint pens he had seen carried by American soldiers in Paris. The American pens were expensive and leaked badly, but Bich liked the idea of not having to carry around ink bottles. Bich worked on the design for two years, and in 1949 he began producing cheap ballpoint pens, which he named BIC -- a shortened version of his own name. Sales grew quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
   PPA was renamed Société BIC in 1953. From 1954 to 1957 the company entered foreign markets, primarily by creating subsidiaries and acquiring companies. BIC Italy and BIC Brazil were created in 1954 and 1956, and the company acquired England's Biro Swan Company in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1958 BIC bought the Waterman Pen Company in Connecticut, marking BIC's first foray into North America. The company introduced its BIC pens to the US market the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   BIC diversified in 1971 when it bought Flaminaire, a French maker of traditional lighters. In 1973 the company introduced its first disposable BIC lighters with the popular advertising slogan "Flick your BIC." Disposable razors were next: The company launched its single blade razor in 1975. Fashion house Guy Laroche joined the BIC family in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 the company acquired Wite-Out Products, a US manufacturer of correction fluid. Marcel Bich stepped down as chairman and CEO in 1993, and was succeed by Bruno Bich, one of his 11 children. (Marcel died in 1994.) BIC added the Tipp-Ex brand, Europe's leading correction fluid products, in 1997. That year it also acquired Sheaffer, a worldwide manufacturer of upscale writing instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   BIC announced in 1999 that Guy Laroche was up for sale, but, with no takers, BIC restructured the outfit in 2000 to get a little more wear from it. Guy Laroche named Mei Xiao Zhou chief designer in 2001. Late that year, BIC sold Guy Laroche to Rech International, a European fashion group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its shaving product line, BIC introduced its three-blade men's razor, Comfort 3, in early 2003, eventually gaining 15% of the US market. In 2004 it launched Soleil, a three-blade women's razor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Stypen, a French writing instrument company, in May 2004, hoping to broaden its European stationery portfolio. In November 2004 the company sold its Ballograf division to that company's management.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further tapping into new markets, the company launched the BIC Phone in partnership with French wireless operator
   <company id="53226">
    Orange
   </company>
   in 2008. The no-frills, pay-as-you-go mobile phone is marketed by Orange in France and Spain.
   <company id="90610">
    Proximus
   </company>
   began peddling the BIC Phone in Belgium in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2009 the firm acquired Norwood Promotional products, a leading US supplier of promotional items, including calendars, bags, drinkware and other promotional goods based in Indianapolis, for $162 million. NPP thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of BIC USA.
