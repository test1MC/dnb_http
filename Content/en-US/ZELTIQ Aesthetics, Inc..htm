   ZELTIQ Aesthetics is winning the battle of the bulge. The company's CoolSculpting device offers a non-invasive alternative to liposuction to knock out fat cells. The treatment uses controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells and melt fat without causing scar tissue or skin damage. ZELTIQ sells the CoolSculpting device and related consumables in the US for use on targeted areas of the torso and thighs, but it is also used more freely in about 45 other international markets. The CoolSculpting system is sold to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and aesthetic specialists such as medical spas. ZELTIQ was incorporated in 2005 as Juniper Medical.

   . The ZELTIQ acquisition will further build its aesthetics business, creating opportunities for cross-selling treatments to individual patients.

   In addition to its CoolScultping systems, the company generates revenue from sales of consumables including CoolGels, CoolLiners, and CoolCard computer cartridges. Income is split about down the middle between the two divisions.

  <p>
   The company markets its products in the US, where the system is only approved for abdominal and thigh use, and in 60 international markets where it's used on all body parts. Domestic use accounts for about 80% of sales.

  <p>
   In the US ZELTIQ uses a dedicated sales force to market its wares to plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and aesthetic specialists. Abroad, it employs a small sales force directing a network of about 40 distributors.

   Revenue rose 47% in 2013 to $112 due to increased sales as the company expanded into new markets, especially in North America. Consumables sales continue to be strong as the installed base of ZELTIQ machines grows leading to the need for consumables.

  <p>
   Since CoolSculpting was only approved in 2011, the company still runs at a net loss and may for the foreseeable future as it continues pumping money into R&amp;D. For 2013, however, the net loss was $19 million compared to $30 in 2012, a 36% improvement due to increased sales. ZELTIQ's accumulated deficit stood at $133.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash for operations is also still going out but improving. It spent $23 million less in 2013 due to tight inventory control and an improvement in net income.

  <p>
   ZELTIQ's plan for success includes expanding the base of CoolSculpting machines while also driving demand for consumables. Of course, it will also continue to seek

    FDA
   </company>
   approval for additional body areas and introduce new consumables. To that end, in 2014 the FDA gave clearance for CoolSculpting use on thighs and the company launched a new applicator. The prior year, it also launched a new applicator, training programs, and a data management tool to help end-users improve their sales.
