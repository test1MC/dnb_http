   Machines might not possess big picture vision, but Cognex machines have excellent vision when it comes to detail. The company is one of the world's largest producers of systems that, linked to a video camera, serve as eyes where human vision is insufficient. Semiconductor, consumer goods, health care, and automotive companies, among others, use the company's machine vision and industrial identification systems to position and identify products, gauge sizes, and locate defects. Cognex serves three primary markets: factory automation, semiconductor and electronics capital equipment, and surface inspection. It also offers consulting and educational services, as well as tech support for its products. Sales to customers based outside the US account for about two-thirds of sales.

  <p>
   Cognex operates two business segments. The largest is its Modular Vision Systems Division (MVSD), which accounts for about 88% of its sales. MVSD develops, manufactures, and markets modular vision systems and ID products that are used to automate the manufacturing and tracking of discrete items by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. The smaller Surface Inspection Systems Division (SISD) develops, makes, and markets surface inspection vision systems that are used to inspect surfaces of materials processed in a continuous fashion, such as metals, papers, plastics, and glass, to ensure that there are no defects on the surfaces. Parsed another way, Cognex products brings in 93% of revenue and services, 7%.

  <p>
   Customers in Europe accounted for 42% of Cognex's $486 million in sales in 2014. It took in 30% from US customers, 9% from Japanese customers, with the rest of the world US rounding almost a fifth of sales. Internationally, Cognex has been expanding its sales force in China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. The company's products are assembled by a contract manufacturer in Indonesia. Testing and shipping is done from its Natick, Massachusetts facility for US customers and from its Ireland facility for customers outside the US.

  <p>
   Cognex sells its MVSD products through a worldwide direct sales force, and via a global network of integration and distribution partners. SISD, which is the smaller of the two businesses and has fewer customers in a concentrated group of industries, sells its products primarily through a worldwide direct sales force. Direct and indirect sales to Apple were 14% of Cognex revenue in 2014.

   it doesn't take a Cognex product to recognize the company's sales growth. It reported sales of $486 million in 2014, a 37% increase from 2013 sales of $354 million. Sales rose in each of the three segments with factory automation recording a 41% gain over 2014. Sales to surface inspection customers were 29% higher and up 14% for customers in semiconductor and electronics. The higher revenue flowed to the company's bottom line which stood at $121.5 million for 2014, a 65% improvement over 2013. A gain in foreign currency also contributed to the profit rise.

  <p>
   Cognex's successful expansion into the factory automation market has significantly widened its customer base. The company maintains its focus on factory automation as its best bet for continued growth. To that end, it's investing in new product development and functionality to make its machine vision products easier to use and more affordable. Cognex has opened sales offices in emerging markets, such as China, India, and Brazil, where it sees ample opportunity for the adoption of its factory automation products. Cognex's business strategy includes selective expansion into new machines vision applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company released several new products designed to expand its portfolio to more customers. Three new models, the DS1050, DS1101, and DS1300, combined higher resolution video and easier-to-use software to increase accessibility to a wider range of users. An update to its DataMan 8600 series of handheld bar code readers should enable reliable readings of challenging direct part bar codes.

   colleagues, Marilyn Matz and William Silver, started Cognex (short for "cognition experts") in 1981 to create vision replacement machines for factories. Competition and inadequate technology forced the firm to reevaluate its distribution strategy in 1986. Cognex began supplying machine vision technology to original equipment manufacturers. The company introduced the first custom vision chip in 1988 and went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cognex found success where human vision fails -- in the high-speed, detailed, repetitive processes required in making semiconductors. The company expanded by purchasing Acumen, a developer of machine vision systems for semiconductor wafer identification (1995); Isys Controls, a maker of quality control systems (1996); and Mayan Automation, a maker of surface inspection systems (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   Low demand for semiconductor and printed circuit board manufacturing equipment in Asia hurt sales in 1998. Nonetheless, the company boosted R&amp;D by 10% and acquired some of

   's machine vision operations, also becoming the preferred global supplier to Rockwell's plants. Orders picked up in early 1999 and Cognex invested $1 million in upstart Avalon Imaging (machine vision for the plastics industry), its first investment in such a company.
  </p>
  <p>
   A series of acquisitions and in-house innovations enabled Cognex to expand into factory automation inspection, which accounts for more than 90% of its business.
