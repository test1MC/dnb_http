LP produces oriented strand board (OSB), siding products, and engineered wood products. It also makes decorative molding and cellulose insulation.

The company sells its products to distributors, dealers, professional lumberyards, and retail home centers, including
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   . It has production facilities throughout North and South America. After a difficult period during the recession and housing crisis, LP is poised to capitalize on the uptick in housing starts.

        <p>
   Nashville, Tennessee-based LP operates about 20 production facilities in the US and Canada. It also owns two facilities in Chile, and one in Brazil. The US is LP's largest market, accounting for nearly three-quarters of its sales. Canada is second with 18% of sales.

        <p>
   LP operates four business segments. The largest, oriented strand board (OSB), makes and distributes OSB panels and accounts for about 45% of sales. Siding products and related accessories represents about 30%, while engineered wood products (laminated veneer lumber) accounts for more than 10%. The company's South America business which manufactures and distributes OSB and siding products in South America and certain export markets, account for the rest. Other products include decorative moulding and a joint venture that makes cellulose insulation.

   LP's sales and marketing efforts are focused on traditional two-step distribution, professional building products dealers, home centers, third-party wholesale buying groups, and other retailers. The company's wholesale distribution channel includes a variety of specialized and broadline wholesale distributors and dealers focused primarily on supplying products used by professional builders and contractors. LP also supplies large retail chains and smaller independent retailers. The company's top 10 customers accounted for 46% of sales in 2012.

   Buoyed by improvement in the housing industry, LP's 2012 sales increased 26% versus 2011, to $1.72 billion. Net income swung from a loss in 2011 to $28.8 million in 2012. Indeed, 2012 was the company's first profitable year since 2006. All of the company's product categories posted sales gains, with oriented strand board posting a 50% increase year over year on higher pricing and volume. Siding sales rose nearly 17%. Sales in Chile jumped 26%.

   LP is dusting itself off after enduring the tough market conditions that plagued operations during the economic downturn. Declining new home construction created low demand for LP's products from 2008 through 2010 and sales suffered and profits suffered. The company moved to cut costs, refinance debt, and improve operations. In order to reduce costs and adjust to lower demand for its products LP shut down plants in Alabama, Georgia, Maine, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and other locations in the US and Canada. Production was curtailed at other plants.
  </p>
        <p>
   Housing starts are slowly improving but demand is still not at pre-recession rates. In light of the challenges, the company remains focused on cash management, while at the same time preparing for the future.
  </p>
        <p>
   Still, the recent rebound in sales and profits has LP looking to grow again.

        <p>
   Louisiana-Pacific (LP) was spun off in 1972 from
   <company id="10648">
    Georgia-Pacific
   </company>
   after the Federal Trade Commission contended that Georgia-Pacific had created a monopoly in the softwood plywood industry. Harry Merlo, the company's first CEO, became chairman in 1974.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1978 the company acquired Fibreboard Corporation, a maker of asbestos and other products used in furniture and cabinets. (Despite spinning off Fibreboard in 1988, LP has been a co-defendant in hundreds of asbestos-related lawsuits.) Also in 1978 the US government acquired some of LP's timberlands as part of the expansion of the Redwood National Park in California.
  </p>
        <p>
   Facing a shortage of Douglas fir and southern pine trees, LP experimented with making wood products from fast-growing, less-expensive trees, including aspen and cottonwood. Oriented strand board (OSB) -- pieces of logs mixed with resin and pressed into sheets -- was developed in the late 1970s and was touted as a cheaper, stronger alternative to plywood.
  </p>
        <p>
   LP profited from a housing boom and a strong pulp market in the 1980s. It began marketing OSB as an exterior siding alternative in 1985. Between 1990 and 1994, however, thousands of property owners in Florida complained that its OSB siding deteriorated in the humid climate. Three class-action suits were filed. The attorney general of Minnesota sued the company over defective siding in 1991. LP settled that case in 1992, and by the end of that year LP had paid $22 million to settle OSB claims throughout the US. But consumers, armed with the siding's 25-year warranty, continued to complain about rotting and cracking boards. The company paid out another $15 million in 1993 and 1994.
  </p>
        <p>
   After a 1995 grand jury indicted LP for environmental violations and product misrepresentation, Merlo and other top executives were dismissed. International Paper EVP Mark Suwyn was named chairman and CEO in 1996 and immediately became the subject of a non-compete lawsuit filed by his former employer. (In 1997 a federal judge ruled in Suwyn's favor.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 the company agreed to pay at least $275 million to 800,000 homeowners who had used its wood siding. LP also started growing its complementary building-products business by purchasing companies such as wood-coating and chemical producer Associated Chemists (sold in 1999) and cellulose insulation maker GreenStone Industries. Meanwhile, a weak OSB market prompted LP to close several of its OSB plants. LP chopped operations and some 25% of its workforce in 1997 to focus on its core building products.
  </p>
        <p>
   LP sold its Northern California lumber operations in 1998 and closed down its fiber-cement roofing operations. In 1999 LP acquired ABT Building Products (paneling and siding), as well as Canadian companies Le Groupe Forex (OSB) for $510 million and Evans Forest Products (laminated veneer and plywood). The following year it added Hoff Companies' composite decking assets and the Sawyer Lumber Company (low-cost lumber for residential construction). In 2001 the company sold a controlling interest in its Samoa, California, pulp mill to LaPointe Partners.
  </p>
        <p>
   It continued to trim operations in 2002 by selling a controlling interest in an OSB plant in Ireland; the company recorded a $2 million gain on the sale and reduced its debt by $6.5 million. LP bought out its joint venture in Chile for $3 million that year. Also in 2002, due to low paper demand and falling profits, LP announced a radical restructuring plan in which the company would cut 45% of its workforce (or 4,400 jobs) and close unprofitable businesses to focus on its core structural products business.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company in 2003 sold more than 600,000 acres of timberland in a series of deals. Also that year LP sold six lumber facilities, an industrial panel facility, and a veneer facility, in part because of an industry wide oversupply of lumber and historically low prices for lumber.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004 LP sold a hardboard plant in Michigan, a decorative panel facility in  Ohio, and a Washington sawmill. The following year the selling continued, with several operations siphoned off.
  </p>
        <p>
   At the helm since 2004, Rick Frost retired as CEO in 2012, replaced by Curt Stevens, who'd joined the company in 1997.
