   For more than a century, Congoleum has taken a pounding. The company has four manufacturing facilities where it makes hard-surface flooring products for residential and commercial use, including resilient sheet flooring (linoleum or vinyl flooring), do-it-yourself vinyl tile, and commercial-grade flooring. Its lineup is used in new construction, as well as remodeling, manufactured housing, and commercial applications. Congoleum markets its products via a distributor network and directly to mass market retailers in North America. It has three manufacturing plants in the US.

   Banking on growth in residential construction and remodeling and the manufactured housing market as the US economy improves recession, Congoleum is making investments to maintain and improve its equipment and facilities. It hopes to capitalize on production efficiencies to gain market share in the highly competitive flooring industry. It remains, however, heavily dependent on its distributors and retailers to get its products out to the market.
