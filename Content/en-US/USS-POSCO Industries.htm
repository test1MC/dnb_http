   US and Korean steel manufacturing interests come together in the form of USS-POSCO Industries (UPI), a 50/50 joint venture between
   <company id="12969">
    United States Steel
   </company>
   (US Steel) and
   <company id="42957">
    POSCO
   </company>
   . The company operates a steel plant (formerly owned by US Steel) in Pittsburg, Northern California. It manufactures flat-rolled steel sheets in various forms: cold-rolled steel, galvanized steel, and tinplate. In addition, USS-POSCO churns out iron oxide, which is used to make hard and soft ferrites. UPI sells its products to more than 150 customers in more than dozen states throughout the western US. End products include office furniture, computer cabinets, metal studs, cans, culverts, and metal building materials.

   UPI's main product lines include cold rolled sheet, galvanized sheet, hot rolled pickled and oiled sheet, and tin plate. It has the capacity to produce about 1.5 million tons of product per year.

   UPI ships steel products to more than 150 customers across North America. The company sells its products to a wide range of manufacturers whose end products include automotive parts, computer cabinets, culverts, food packaging, metal buildings, metal studs, and office furniture. About 1/3 of UPI's product line is tinplate for the canning industry.

  <p>
   Its Korean co-owner supplied high quality raw materials for use at the plant. In order to stay competitive in the face of cheaper steel imports, UPI jettisoned non-core product lines to focus on steel sheet and tin. However, strong competition and poor market prices forced the company in 2011 to introduce furloughs at the plant and enforce temporary shutdowns of the facility.

  <p>
   The company rebounded from a major fire in 2001. In 2010 UPI invested heavily in remediation measures to clean up soil and groundwater impacted by its plant activities.
