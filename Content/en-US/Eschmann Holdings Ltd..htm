   Eschmann Holdings, which does business as Eschmann Equipment, supplies medical products and devices to hospitals, GP surgeries, and dental practices in both the private sector and public sectors. The company designs and manufactures operating tables, electrosurgical instruments, bench-top autoclaves, surgical suction units, and other pieces of medical equipment, primarily for use in the operating room or for infection control. The privately held company's products are primarily marketed and distributed in the UK; it also exports about one-third of its products to other countries through independent and affiliated distributors.

   Eschmann operates through three divisions. Its operating theater segment features products such as specialist tables to meet the specific needs of bariatric surgeons and neurosurgical operations. Other products include electrosurgical tools, portable suction, and surgical suction.

   The infection control division includes autoclaves, washer disinfectors, decontamination treatment, and other similar items.

   Finally, the Eschmann Care segment offers CarePlans (a type of insurance) for a range of dental equipment such as autoclaves, sterilizers, and washer disinfectors as well as operating theater equipment including operating tables, surgical suction and electrosurgical generators. The Eschmann range of service CarePlans and Preventative maintenance contracts offer clients some assurance against costly servicing or repair bills and delays in the event of an equipment breakdown.
