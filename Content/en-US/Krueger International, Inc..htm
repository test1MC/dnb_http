   Krueger International can be found in cubicles, classrooms, cafeterias, and college dorms. The company, which does business as KI, makes ergonomic seating, cabinets, and other furniture used by businesses, healthcare organizations, government agencies, and educational institutions. The company offers everything from benches and beds to desks and tables, not to mention shelving, filing systems, movable walls, and trash bins. KI markets its products through sales representatives, furniture dealers, architects, and interior designers worldwide. Founded in 1941, KI was purchased in the 1980s by its managers, who later allowed employees to buy stock. Today KI is 100% employee owned.

  <p>
   Boasting $700 million in sales and the title of sixth-largest contract furniture manufacturer in the industry, KI operates a variety of subsidiaries, including KI UK Ltd., KI East Asia Sdn. Bhd, KI Nova Scotia, KI Canada, KI-Sebel, and KI India.
  </p>
  <p>
   KI also owns three subsidiaries: AWP Wood Products, Pallas Textiles, and Spacesaver. Quebec-based AWP Wood Products makes architectural wood doors for the office partition industry. Pallas Textiles, which operates out of Wisconsin, creates textile products for contract upholstery, panel systems and wall-coverings, healthcare environments, and casements. Spacesaver Corporation, also located in Wisconsin, makes high-density mobile storage systems for office, institutional, and industrial applications, and is a major supplier of steel shelving systems, rotary storage systems, and storage accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company maintains nine manufacturing sites around the globe. Besides its four locations in Wisconsin (in Bonduel, Fort Atkinson, Green Bay, and Manitowoc), KI operates production facilities in High Point, North Carolina; Penmroke, Ontario, Canada; and Tupelo, Mississippi. In 2012, KI expanded its Green Bay, Wisconsin, plant (at the tune of $3.3 million) by more than 100,000 sq. ft. for additional elbow room devoted to manufacturing, shipping, receiving, and warehousing.

   KI is well-regarded in the classroom furniture market and is a leading supplier for both K-12 schools and universities. The company has outfitted classrooms, lecture halls, administrative offices, computer labs, media centers, residence halls, and student unions. KI has been a government vendor for more than six decades, providing furnishings for an assortment of federal agencies, including all branches of the military. KI's corporate products are ergonomically designed to help individuals work more comfortably and efficiently. In addition to these core customer groups, KI has also installed its furnishings in outdoor public spaces, sports arenas, conference centers, and airports.
  </p>
  <p>
   It regularly rolls out new products. In 2013, KI launched the Grazie Seating Collection through a collaboration between renowned designer Giancarlo Piretti, and in 2012 introduced the elegant and sophisticated Affina Collection, an expansive seating and table line designed by Paul James and Dan Cramer. KI also expanded its existing product licensing agreement with UK seating industry leader Boss Design in 2013 to give Boss Design an extended reach into the US market and KI a broader portfolio of lounge, task seating, and occasional table items.

  <p>
   The company has expanded its network of showrooms in the US and abroad over the years. KI added a showroom in Houston in 2010 to boost its US presence, which includes about 10 locations in half a dozen states. To better serve its Asian and European customers, the company operates through a showroom in Shanghai, China. KI has international showrooms in London, Malaysia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Toronto. To support its growth, KI completed a $3.3-million, 100,000-sq.-ft. plant expansion in 2012 to reduce costs and streamline its business. The move boosts its manufacturing, shipping, receiving, and warehousing space.
  </p>
  <p>
   As its showroom presence grew, KI also formed new sales partnerships. The company tapped Heartland Furniture Group, a contract furniture representative, in 2011 to take care of existing customer accounts and broker sales in Kansas, Missouri, and southern Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also looked to acquisitions to extend the reach of its business. In 2011 KI purchased Sebel Furniture Limited from GWA Group Ltd., a top supplier of building fixtures in Australia. The $24 million deal has given KI a foothold in the commercial furniture business in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Hong Kong.
