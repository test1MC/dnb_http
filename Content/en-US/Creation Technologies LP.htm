   Creation Technologies is a medium fish in a small pond. The regional contract electronics manufacturer is focused on the North American market, though the majority of the world's electronics are produced in Asia. The company operates four facilities in Canada, six in the US, and one in China, for North American manufacturers with Asian operations. Creation Technologies specializes in printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing; it offers various PCB technologies, including high-speed surface mount, automated through-hole, double-sided, flexible circuit, and backplane assemblies. The company also offers related services, including product testing, procurement, software configuration, and repair.

   Expanding further into the US market for electronic manufacturing services in 2006, Creation Technologies acquired Asemtec, a PCB contractor based in San Jose, California. The company retained Asemtec's founder as a manager for the operation, which was rechristened Creation Technologies -- San Jose. The California operation serves customers in the communications, industrial control, medical, and military fields.

   The Asemtec acquisition left Creation with seven manufacturing facilities in North America -- four in Canada and three in the US. The company boasts 16 surface-mount technology lines in its plants.

   In 2007 the company acquired two US contract electronics manufacturers -- SMC of Lexington, Kentucky, and Taytronics of Saint Peter, Minnesota. SMC was rechristened Creation Technologies -- Lexington, while Taytronics (previously an affiliate of

    Taylor Corporation
   </company>
   ) was renamed Creation Technologies -- Saint Peter. The acquisitions bumped Creation up to nine plants, with five in the US.

   In 2007 Birch Hill Equity Partners made a $65 million investment in Creation Technologies. The EMS firm will use the funds for potential acquisitions and to buy out certain existing shareholders.
