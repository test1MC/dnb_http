   Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, and most likely it's Elkay Manufacturing. Elkay makes sinks, cabinets, drinking fountains, faucets, water coolers, and water filtration products for residential and commercial use. The family owned company sells products such as stainless steel sinks under such names as Harmony, The Mystic, and Elite Gourmet. It also offers kitchen accessories (colanders, cutting boards, soap dispensers). Elkay's cabinet brands include Yorktowne, Medallion, Schuler, and MasterCraft. Elkay is the parent of about dozen subsidiaries and one joint venture, Elkay Pacific Rim.

   Elkay's innovative products and production techniques have enabled it to become the world's largest manufacturer of stainless steel residential sinks.

   In 2015 the company's Medallion Cabinetry brand launched a new finish, Appaloosa, in addition to other new products, floating shelves and five-piece drawer front modification.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company opened a new showroom in Shanghai, hoping to take advantage of the increased interest in American-made cabinetry products in China.

  <p>
   In 2012 Elkay joined forces with CuVerro Antimicrobial Copper to introduce a line of antimicrobial copper sinks designed for infection control in healthcare facilities. This partnership helped Elkay to build its healthcare business and combat the industry's ongoing battle against hospital-acquired infections. The sinks take advantage of the unique bacteria-killing characteristics of uncoated copper, which are greatly enhanced in the copper alloys used by CuVerro.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1920 by the Katz family to make sinks for butlers' pantries and sculleries.
