   For Venture Corporation Limited, contract manufacturing is an unlimited adventure. Through some 40 subsidiaries, the company offers electronics manufacturing services (EMS), original design manufacturing (ODM), and supply chain services (through its e-Fulfillment division). EMS, which accounts for most of its sales, makes printed circuit boards, fiber-optic switches and transceivers, and provides box-build (complete system) assembly for companies such as
   <company id="144560">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10723">
    HP
   </company>
   . Its ODM companies specialize in printing and imaging equipment (VIPColor), plastic tools (Univac), electronic systems, and components. Almost all of the company's sales come from Asia.

   Venture recognizes that the key to establishing long-term relationships with its clients is to be more involved in product design. It has collaborated with customers to develop products for mobile payments, data capture devices, and life science equipment. It has also partnered with suppliers to learn more about fluidics and photonics in order to enlarge its supply base for such strategic components.

   The company signed a deal in 2012 to handle the back-end manufacturing for optical and laser component maker
