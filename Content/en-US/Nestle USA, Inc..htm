   Nestle USA continues to innovate its candy products to keep its products fresh in the minds of consumers. In 2015, for example, it introduce its new SweeTarts Ropes candy, which holds the well-known candies on a licorice-style rope that is shareable and contains no artificial colors or flavors. Also that year, its Skinny Cow Brand introduced new ice cream and chocolate candy flavors, along with new creamy iced coffee drinks. In 2014, the company partnered with Girl Scouts to market candy bars based on the best selling cookies.

   In response to higher demands for its Boost nutritional drinks and Carnation Breakfast Essentials drinks, the company in 2013 invested $72 million into its Anderson, Indiana plant to significantly expand the plant's production capacity.
