   Bayerische Motoren Werke, better known as BMW, is among the top 10 automakers in the world. It manufactures premium brand cars and off-road vehicles under the BMW, MINI, and

   </company>
   names, as well as motorcycles under the BMW and Husqvarna names. Spare parts and accessories are also offered. Its vehicles and products are sold worldwide through company branches, independent dealers, subsidiaries, and importers. BMW's financial services segment offers car leasing and credit financing for both retail and corporate fleet customers; dealer financing; insurance; and deposit banking.

  <p>
   BMW operates in more than 140 countries and operates 30 production and assembly facilities in 14 countries. It generates about half of its revenue in Europe, while the remainder is well dispersed among the Americas (mainly the US), China, and other parts of the world.

   To support global markets, BMW has 30 production facilities in 14 countries. It also has about 12 R&amp;D centers in Austria, Germany, the US, Japan, and China. Some assembly is undertaken with external partners in emerging markets, including India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Russia.

  <p>
   The company has a global sales network that spans more than 140 countries. BMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through the company's own branches and independent authorized dealers. Sales outside of Germany are carried out mainly by subsidiaries and in certain markets by independent importers. Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in the US by a subsidiary and elsewhere by dealers. At year end 2014, BMW's car sales network was made up of 3,250 BMW, 1,550 MINI, and 130 Rolls-Royce dealerships cover 650 locations worldwide.

  <p>
   (Note: growth rates differ after conversion to US dollar.) BMW in 2014 experienced a 6% rise in sales primarily by the continued upward trend in sales volumes across all segments. It also experienced an uptick in external revenues from the sale of BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce brand cars. Revenue from its Automotive segment grew by 6%, Motorcycles by 12%, and Financial Services by 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to revenue growth, BMW posted a surge in profits from 2013 to 2014 due to the revenue increase coupled with improvement from other operating income and expenses. Its operating cash flow, however, decreased during 2014 primarily due to higher cash outflows for taxes.

  <p>
   BMW is in the midst of what it call its Number ONE strategy, an initiative begun in 2007 that continues today to boost profitability and enable expansion of its global production and sales networks. From 2007 to 2014 the company expanded from 23 production facilities to 30. More recent manufacturing plants have been opened in China through its BMW Brilliance joint venture with

   </company>
   . BMW's goal is to sell more than 2 million BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce vehicles by 2016 -- up from the 2.1 million cars it sold in fiscal 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   From an environmental perspective, BMW's strategy is to invest in and develop technologies that support making its vehicle fleet more fuel efficient and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 25% between 2008 and 2020. To this end, it is increasing R&amp;D expenditures in part to support continued development of a new fuel efficient engine family called Efficient Dynamics and improvement of a hybrid technology called ActiveHybrid. New vehicle models like the pure electric BMWi family were launched in late 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other areas of its business, BMW is dealing with contracting motorcycle markets worldwide and is therefore changing strategic course. In early 2013 it sold its Husqvarna motorcycle business to Austrian company Pierer Industrie AG in order

  <p>
   BMW's logo speaks to its origin: a propeller in blue and white, the colors of Bavaria. In 1913 Karl Rapp opened an aircraft-engine design shop near Munich. He named it Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1917. The end of WWI brought German aircraft production to a halt, and BMW shifted to making railway brakes until the 1930s. BMW debuted its first motorcycle, the R32, in 1923, and the company began making automobiles in 1928 after buying small-car company Fahrzeugwerke Eisenach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1933 BMW launched a line of larger cars. The company built aircraft engines for Hitler's Luftwaffe in the 1930s and stopped all auto and motorcycle production in 1941. BMW chief Josef Popp resisted and was ousted. Under the Nazis, the company operated in occupied countries, built rockets, and developed the world's first production jet engine.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its factories dismantled after WWII, BMW survived by making kitchen and garden equipment. In 1948 it introduced a one-cylinder motorcycle, which sold well as cheap transportation in postwar Germany. BMW autos in the 1950s were large and expensive and sold poorly. When motorcycle sales dropped, the company escaped demise in the mid-1950s by launching the Isetta, a seven-foot, three-wheeled "bubble car."
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s BMW's European exports soared, and the company set up a distribution subsidiary in the US. The company also produced larger cars that put BMW on par with Mercedes-Benz.
