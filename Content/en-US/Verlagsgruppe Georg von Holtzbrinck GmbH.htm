The firn also has newspaper and Web holdings. Its US assets operate through its

   </company>
   subsidiary, which does business as Macmillan US. The company also operates the London-based
   <company id="122579">
    Macmillan Publishers Limited
   </company>
   . The family of founder Georg von Holtzbrinck (including executive chairman Stefan von Holtzbrinck) owns the company.

   The company's roots extend back to Stuttgarter Hausbücherei (later Deutscher Bücherbund), a German book club launched by Georg von Holtzbrinck in 1948. The book club may not have been Holtzbrinck's first brush with the publishing world: Published reports indicate that he may have been a member of the Nazi party and published Nazi-approved books and magazines during WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s, Holtzbrinck diversified into record clubs and newspaper publishing. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he acquired German publishers Droemer, Kindler, Rowohlt, and S. Fischer Verlag and began investing in German business newspaper
   <i>
    Handelsblatt.
   </i>
   Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck was created in 1971 as a holding company for Holtzbrinck's burgeoning empire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Georg von Holtzbrinck died in 1983, and his son, Dieter, took the company's reins. The company elevated its US presence through acquisitions of Holt General Book (now Henry Holt) in 1985 and Scientific American (publisher of the magazine by the same name) the following year. By 1986 the firm ranked second only to Bertelsmann in German publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1989 sale of its book club gave Holtzbrinck the capital to fuel continued growth. Its 1994 acquisition of US publisher Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, followed by its purchase of 70% of UK publisher Macmillan in 1995, boosted its profile on the international stage.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company invested in Infoseek Deutschland in 1998. That year Holtzbrinck formed its Activ Publishing division to offer publishing software and services. In 1999 Holtzbrinck invested in online bookseller Booxtra and bought the portion of Macmillan that it did not own. It also entered a swap arrangement with Dow Jones through which it acquired a 49% stake in
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal Europe
   </i>
   in exchange for 22% of
   <em>
    Handelsblatt.
   </em>
   (The companies later completely divested their partnership and now have no interest in each other's papers.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Holtzbrinck placed its Internet holdings under its newly formed holtzbrinck networXs in 2000. Later that year, it inked a deal with The New York Times Company to revive the Times Book publishing imprint. In 2002 the company sold its stake in German news channel n-tv to RTL Group.
