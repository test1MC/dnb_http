   NACCO Industries has a knack for coal mining, housewares, and specialty retail. The holding company conducts these businesses through three main independent operating subsidiaries.
   <company id="112393">
    North American Coal
   </company>
   (NACoal) mines and markets coal for power generation and steel production through developed mines located in North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. On the housewares side,
   <company id="112376">
    Hamilton Beach Brands
   </company>
   designs small kitchen appliances such as meat grinders, blenders, and juicers, while
   <company id="121289">

   NACCO divides its operations across
   <company id="112393">
    NACoal
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="112376">
    Hamilton Beach Brands
   </company>
   (HBB), and
   <company id="121289">
    Kitchen Collection
   </company>
   (KC).
  </p>
  <p>
   NACoal professes to be the largest miner of lignite coal in the US and among the 10 largest coal producers nationwide. Coal is delivered to power plants in Mississippi, North Dakota, and Texas. In addition to mining coal for power generation and steel production, NACoal provides value-added mining services for other natural resources companies. It also provides dragline mining services under the North American Mining Company name for independently owned limerock quarries in Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   HBB is a leading maker of small appliances, such as blenders, coffeemakers, dehydrators, juicers, indoor grills, mixers, toasters, and slow cookers for household use and commercial use in bars and restaurants. KC is a specialty retailer of kitchenware and gourmet foods operating under the Kitchen Collection and Le Gourmet Chef brands in malls across the US.

  <p>
   The primary coal customers of NACoal are electric utilities, an independent power provider, a coal cooperative, and a synfuels plant. Retail giant
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   accounted for approximately 33% of HBB's revenues in 2014.

  <p>
   NACCO spun off its former subsidiary,
   <company id="111353">
    NACCO Materials Handling Group
   </company>
   , in 2012, and its balance sheet is a direct reflection of this action, with revenues and profits dropping virtually each year since 2012. Revenues dropped 4% from $933 million in 2013 to $897 million in 2014 as the company posted its first net loss ($38 million for 2014) in the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2014 were driven by a a reduction in both royalty and other income and its consolidated mining operations. The mining decrease was the result of fewer tons sold due to a spike in the number of planned and unplanned outage days at a customer's power plant in 2014 compared with 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The net loss for 2014 was largely the result of an ongoing asset impairment charge of $105 million affiliated with its Reed Minerals operations coupled with an increase in interest expenses and closed mine obligations. In addition, NACCO's operating cash flow sharply declined from 2012 to 2014.

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   NACCO's subsidiaries continue to focus on their own strategies for growth. HBB is focusing on expand internationally in emerging Asian and Latin American markets by increasing product offerings designed specifically for those market needs and by expanding its distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   KC is focused on refining its store formats, improving its merchandise mix, store displays, and appearance, and closing under-performing stores. KC hopes to increase both the number of Kitchen Collection and Le Gourmet Chef stores. NACoal expects to continue efforts to develop new coal mining projects, especially domestic opportunities, over the longer term.

  <p>
   NACCO often improves its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 the company acquired Weston Products for $25 million. As a result of the deal, HBB now markets a range of game and garden food processing equipment, including meat grinders, bag sealers, dehydrators, and meat slicers under the Weston brand as well as several private label brands.

  <p>
   King Coal ruled the early part of the 20th century, and Frank Taplin was ready to be a loyal subject. In 1913 the 38-year-old Cleveland native, formerly an office boy for John D. Rockefeller and later a VP at Standard Oil Company, formed distributor Cleveland &amp; Western Coal. Four years later, spurred by WWI, the company bought three mines and began producing coal. It incorporated in 1925 as North American Coal Corporation (NACCO).
