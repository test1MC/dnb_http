   At A. Moksel the best of times are the wurst of times. One of Germany's largest meat processors, it slaughters and packages meat at its more than 15 slaughterhouses and processing and merchandising facilities (all located in Germany). The company then distributes the fresh and value-added meat products, mainly in Europe. Not content to limit itself to just one or two types of meat, Moksel processes beef, pork, veal, lamb, poultry, and wild game. It also offers sausage and seafood. Moksel's customers include grocery retailers and wholesalers, butcher shops, and catering operations throughout the world.

  <p>
   Founded in Buchloe in 1948 by Alexander Moksel, Moksel originally made a business of slaughtering, meat and sausage processing, and meat and livestock trading. By 1964, the company had expanded through imports and was developing its meat export business; Italy proved to be a major customer in the international market, though by 1970, the butcher was serving the eastern European market as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 1974, Moksel focused on becoming a vertically integrated distribution company, buying a stake in a refrigerating and cutting plant and expanding business activities to include logistics. By 1980, the German company had grown so large, it had become necessary to divide activities into two segments: production and trading. Investments remained a priority for the company, however, pushing sales over DM 1 billion for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company emerged from another restructuring in June 1987 under the name A. Moksel AG. In October 1987, A. Moksel conducted a public offering of its shares. The company used proceeds from the offering to drive expansion in the early 1990s, picking up a majority holding in Fleischzentrale Südwest GmbH and Eyckeler &amp; Malt AG, and acquiring meat trader G.u.P. Salomon AG. The investment in Salomon in 1991 proved a poor one, leading A. Moksel on a downward financial spiral. A. Moksel's forced repayment of Salomon's hidden debt -- which cost the company DM 100 million -- may have been one reason the company's founder, Alexander Moksel, sold his 34% stake in A. Moksel to now-defunct German food company März AG in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   A. Moksel suffered setbacks in the 1990s -- including a slump in demand for beef due to mad cow disease -- which kept it from earning a profit for much of the decade. By 1996, A. Moksel was preparing for recovery, streamlining its meat processing business and increasing focus on international trade and product branding. The strategy may have worked; in 1998, the group reported profits for the first time since 1991. In 2001 Moksel sold its 51% stake in Karl-Heinz-Arnold Fleischhandel, but increased its share of rival meat company Eyckeler &amp; Malt to nearly 75%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still facing difficulties, A. Moksel went hunting for an investor in 2002 and proved to be a tasty acquisition for the young, growing, and then-named Bestmeat Company (which was renamed VION in 2005), based in The Netherlands. It initially purchased 85% of A. Moksel as part of its goal to become a leading meat provider in Europe. Within a year it increased its holdings to 89% of A. Moksel and acquired another German meat processor, Nordfleisch.
