   Clipper Windpower is cutting away at carbon emissions by making wind-energy turbines and developing wind-power generating facilities in the Americas and Europe. Boasting key patented turbine components, including the power train and magnet generators, Clipper's 2.5 MW Liberty turbine is sold to large power generators in the wind industry. For wind-power development, Clipper provides expertise in all stages of a project, from design and engineering to construction and maintenance. In all, the company has performed or overseen the installation of more than 3,000 wind turbines.

  <p>
   Clipper's Iowa-based plant specializes in new and used gearbox assembly and repair. The company also specializes in wind turbine hub assembly and matrix assembly and repair. (The matrix is the primary component of the Generator Control Unit, which accepts DC power from up-tower, converts it to AC and stabilizes the power current for distribution to the grid).
  </p>
  <p>
   Clipper provides specialized kits with various parts and hardware to make complete components for turbine builds. Clipper inspects, repairs, and tests all motors before delivering quality products to the end customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's manufacturing plant is equipped to handle mechanical, hydraulic and electro-mechanical assembly. Other areas of expertise include electrical sub-assembly and testing for high and low voltage, high current, and AC/DC systems. It also offers vibratory gear polishing, surface preparation, and application of weather resistant coats on large industrial components.

   </company>
   . Expanding Clipper's geographic range, the project is the first wind farm in Maryland.

  <p>
   In mid-2010
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   acquired a 49.5% stake in the company for $270 million; it acquired the remaining shares later that year for an additional $112 million. United Technologies sold Clipper to
   <company id="60168">
    Platimum Equity
   </company>
   in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 2001 by Chairman James Dehlsen, Clipper Windpower takes its name from the 19th-century sailing ship, the clipper, that was designed for maximum utilization of the wind.
