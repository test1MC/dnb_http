   Perfect storms make good business for Generac Power Systems. That's because the company manufactures engine-driven standby and portable generators for homes, businesses, hospitals, and recreational vehicles. The company also makes industrial power generation equipment, automatic transfer switches, switch gear and controls, and remote monitoring software. Brands include Generac, Magnum, Ottomotores, and Tower Light. Generac sells its products through retailers as well as through wholesale distributors. The US represents nearly 85% of the company sales.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is based in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and operates 11 manufacturing plants located principally in the US, Mexico, Italy, Brazil, and the UK. It sells its products in the US and Canada, with an expanding presence internationally in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia/Pacific regions. Generac generated 85% of its net sales from the US during 2015.

  <p>
   Generac divides its operations into two primary segments: residential power products (51% of sales); and commercial and industrial power products (42%). Other products account for the remainder of revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company targets the residential, light commercial, industrial and construction markets. Products are sold into these regions through a broad network of independent dealers, retailers, wholesalers, catalogs, e-commerce merchants, and equipment rental companies under the Generac, Magnum, Ottomotores, and Tower Light brand names. Generac also sells direct to certain national and regional account customers that are the end users of its products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Generac's revenues dropped by 10% from $1.46 billion in 2014 to $1.32 billion in 2015. Profits also fell 55% from $175 million to $78 million, and the company's operating cash flow also dropped 25% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 were fueled by lower sales from its two main segments: residential power products (7%) and commercial and industrial power products (16%). The latter segment was affected by a significant reduction in shipments into the oil and gas and general rental markets and reduced shipments to telecom national account customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The drop in profits for 2015 was attributed to additional tradename and goodwill impairment charges related to the transition and consolidation of various brands to the Generac tradename.

  <p>
   The company plans to expand its presence in under-served North American regions by continuing to build its dealer network. Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and China represent favorable opportunities for the company and have piqued Generac's interest in seizing growth opportunities in international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boasting a North American market share of 70% for residential standby generators, a broad distribution network (direct dealers, catalog, wholesale, and retail), a comprehensive product line, and specialized engineering and manufacturing capabilities, Generac continues to invest in innovation and product development, as well as technician training to ensure the repair and maintenance of its products.

  <p>
   Generac has grown through the help of acquisitions. In 2015, the company acquired Vermont-based Country Home Products (CHP), a manufacturer of high-quality, professional-grade engine-powered equipment, for $75 million. The acquisition expanded the company's chore-related products line-up and provided additional scale to its residential engine-powered tools platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016, the company obtained 65% of Siena, Italy-based Pramac, a manufacturer of stationary, mobile, and portable generators, for $61 million. Pramac products are sold in over 150 countries through a broad distribution network. The deal augmented the company's global presence by adding product, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world.
