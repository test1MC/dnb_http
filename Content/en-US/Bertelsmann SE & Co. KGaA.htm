   A company so big it takes up space on the bookshelf, the magazine stand, and on television, Bertelsmann is one of the world's leading media conglomerates. It owns
   <company id="101299">
    RTL Group
   </company>
   , Europe's #1 TV broadcaster with more than 40 channels operating in a dozen countries, and
   <company id="43807">
    Penguin Random House
   </company>
   , the world's top trade book publisher. In addition to these two heavyweights, it owns magazine publisher

   , services unit
   <company id="125484">
    Arvato
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="104628">
    BMG
   </company>
   , the music business, as well as Bertelsmann Printing Group, Education Group and Investments. Carl Bertelsmann founded the company in 1835.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   One unique quality of Bertelsmann is that its divisions operate more like stand-alone businesses rather than being integrated with one another in a fashion similar to
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   or
   <company id="163064">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   . Within its home market of Germany, Bertelsmann competes most directly with publisher Axel Springer and broadcaster ProSiebenSat.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Bertelsmann is certainly one of the largest European media conglomerates, it is also one of very few: while its TV and publishing businesses range across dozens of countries, most of the company's nearest competitors restrict their activities to just one or two.
  </p>
  <p>
   RTL brings in over a third of revenue, Arvato around 30%, and Penguin Random House 20%. A restructure took effect on 1 January 2016 that re-formed the struggling Be Printers (alongside other interests) as Bertelsmann Printing Group, and split out Corporate Investments as independently functioning Bertelsmann Education Group, Bertelsmann Investments, and BMG, the music business. The four units together account for around 10% of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Bertelsmann operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, and the core markets are Germany, France and the UK, as well as the US. Germany is the biggest market at over a third of revenue, while the strongly-growing US makes some 22%. The company is looking to increase its presence in emerging markets, notable India, China and Brazil.

  <p>

   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, revenue for the year grew 2% to €17.1 billion. Part of this growth was down to positive exchange rate effects, but earnings also grew in Penguin Random House (by 12%) on the back of strength in the US, and in television in Germany, BMG, and Relias Learning, an online education resource.
  </p>
  <p>
   The latter helped the group record a huge leap in sales from digital platforms: for RTL in particular, digital revenue increased 72% to upwards of €500 million, doubling its contribution to total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Be Printer, the struggling print business reporting under the Bertelsmann Printing Group umbrella as of January 2016, continued on its downward trajectory in 2015. It shrank 25.5% on prior year as digital printing and shorter print runs for magazines eat into revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 27% on prior year to €538 million, due largely to a lower charge from special items. In 2015 special items, which included sales of various businesses including Be Printers Spain, amounted to €-190 million, up on €-620 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities nudged up 7% to €1.6 billion on the back of higher overall net working capital.
  </p>

  <p>
   Bertelsmann's strategy rests on two key tenets of embracing the digital transformation and expanding into regions with the biggest growth opportunities. The company also divides its businesses into growth and declining businesses, and allocates investment as appropriate. For instance, the company recognizes that the printing industry is undergoing a structural downsizing and has thus sold Barcelona-based Rotocobrhi and Eurohueco to British firm Walstead Capital in 2015. Gruner + Jahr departed the Italian market amid poor prospects, selling its 50% stake in its joint venture with Mondadori.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bertelsmann Education Group was created as part of the restructuring that took place on 1 January 2016, and has been supported by the expansion and acquisition of a variety of online education platforms. These include the expanded Relias Learning business, and the acquired Affero Lab, Udacity, HotChalk and Alliant International University.
  </p>
  <p>
   A fragmentation of RTL's audience as digital drives a wider variety of choice risks eating into the company's advertising revenue. The company has responded by investing in online video advertising, for instance in the purchase of student marketing startup Employour, and by developing non-advertising revenue such as distribution revenue. RTL found success in the US and Europe with 'Deutschland 83'.
  </p>
  <p>
   China, India and Brazil are Bertelsmann's biggest targets for revenue growth. In China, the company invested in a large number of startups, in Brazil it bought aforementioned internet learning platform Affero Lab, and in India the company invested in Saavn, the country's biggest music streaming service.
  </p>
  <p>
   Random House merged with Penguin Group in 2013 to create the world's biggest book publisher. The merger came about amid an intensification of competition from online retailers (
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon
   </company>
   in particular) and supermarkets, and this disruption to the market brought by the adoption of e-books.

  <p>
   Bertelsmann makes a large number of acquisitions each year to adapt to shifting media currents, but also has to be aware of antitrust laws given its leading market position in many lines of business. The company made a series of acquisitions in the online learning space, including Relias Learning, Udacity, HotChalk and Alliant International University, as well as Saavn.
  </p>
  <p>
   At year-end, G+J acquired the student marketing specialist Employour.

   Carl Bertelsmann founded his publishing company C. Bertelsmann Verlag in Gütersloh, Germany, in 1835. The company primarily published hymnals and religious materials, expanding into newspapers during the 1860s. Heinrich Mohn, a fourth-generation descendant, took over the company in 1921 and expanded its operations to include popular fiction, which helped Bertelsmann expand to more than 400 employees by 1939.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the company published books and propaganda material for the German army, but was closed by the Nazi government in 1944 as it was not considered important to the war effort. (The company had maintained for decades it was closed because it produced religious materials, but contrary evidence was uncovered in 2000 by historians working at the behest of the company.) After WWII Mohn's son, Reinhard (who had been captured by the Allies and interned in a Kansas POW camp), returned to Germany determined to rebuild the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bertelsmann boosted book sales by launching book clubs in Germany during the 1950s and bought Germany's UFA (TV and film production) in 1964. It took a minority interest in publisher
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner + Jahr
   </company>
   in 1969, taking a controlling stake in 1973. In the US, Bertelsmann bought 51% of Bantam Books in 1977 (and the rest in 1981) and Arista Records in 1979. In 1986 it took control of Doubleday Publishing and bought RCA Records (forming Bertelsmann Music Group the next year). Mohn transferred substantial non-voting shares in the company to the Bertelsmann Foundation (
   <company id="140019">
    Bertelsmann Stiftung
   </company>
   ) in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company teamed up with
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   in 1995 to form AOL Europe, and with Luxembourg broadcaster CLT it launched CLT-Ufa in 1997. Bertelsmann acquired book publisher
   <company id="43807">
    Random House
   </company>
   the next year. The company also took a 50% stake in online bookseller barnesandnoble.com (retaining nearly 40% after an IPO in 1999). In addition, Thomas Middelhoff became chairman and CEO in 1998. The next year Bertelsmann acquired some 85% of scientific publisher Springer Verlag. Also in 1999 Reinhard Mohn transferred his controlling shares in the company to Bertelsmann Verwaltungsgesellschaft, a firm controlled by Bertelsmann executives and the Mohn family.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Bertelsmann announced that it would sell its half-interest in AOL Europe back to AOL by mid-2002; it also spun off
   <company id="100478">
    Lycos Europe
   </company>
   (retaining 27%, now about 20%). It later merged CLT-Ufa with Pearson TV to form
   <company id="101299">
    RTL Group
   </company>
   . (Bertelsmann got a 37% stake.) That year Bertelsmann bought online music retailer
   <company id="54912">
    CDNOW
   </company>
   and began negotiating a merger between BMG and
   <company id="41769">
    EMI Group
   </company>
   . (Those talks fell apart in 2001.) Late in 2000 the company formed an alliance with online music service Napster, loaning the company start-up cash and allowing it to use the BMG music catalog to develop a subscription-based service. (Bertelsmann later tried to acquire Napster but a bankruptcy court quashed the deal. Napster went out of business shortly after, although its name was acquired by Roxio, now
   <company id="102418">
    Napster
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   Bertelsmann bought
   <company id="102682">
    Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
   </company>
   's 30% stake in RTL Group in 2001. As part of the deal, Bruxelles gained a 25% stake in Bertelsmann -- with the understanding that it would be able to float its interest to the public in four years. Bertelsmann combined RTL's Ufa Sports unit with French sports-rights company
   <company id="102877">
    Jean-Claude Darmon
   </company>
   in exchange for a 40% stake in the combined company, now called Sportfive. Later that year it sold its stake in online music venture GetMusic to
   <company id="100557">
    Universal Music Group
   </company>
   . Also that year, it bought Pearson's 22% stake in RTL Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's board fired Middelhoff in 2002, citing disagreements over the direction of the company. He was replaced by Gunter Thielen, chairman of Bertelsmann's
   <company id="125484">
    arvato
   </company>
   business unit. The following year Bertelsmann sold its science publishing subsidiary, BertelsmannSpringer. Music subsidiary
   <company id="58218">
    BMG Entertainment
   </company>
   merged with
   <company id="56304">
    Sony Music
   </company>
   in 2004 to create
   <company id="135429">
    Sony BMG Music Entertainment
   </company>
   , a joint venture with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After a contentious few months in 2006 when Groupe Bruxelles Lambert almost forced an IPO of the notoriously private media firm, the Mohn family bought out Lambert's interest in the company for $5.7 billion (leaving the Mohns with a 23% interest in Bertelsmann, and the Bertelsmann Foundation owning the rest). Later that year, the company sold
   <company id="104628">
    BMG Music Publishing
   </company>
   (which was not part of the BMG-Sony Music merger) to
   <company id="100557">
    Universal Music Group
   </company>
   for $2.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thielen stepped down as CEO of Bertelsmann at the beginning of 2008 and was replaced by Hartmut Ostrowski. Later that year, Bertelsmann sold its stake in Sony BMG Music Entertainment to Sony for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. (The music business then changed its name to
   <company id="135429">
    Sony Music Entertainment
   </company>
   .)
