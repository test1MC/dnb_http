   Italians have never been afraid of a few carbohydrates and they have made the Barilla brand their pasta of choice. As a result, Barilla is the #1 dry pasta maker in Italy -- and worldwide. The company also leads in pasta sauces in continental Europe, in bakery products in Italy, and in crispbread in Scandinavia. The food manufacturer sells its some 1,500 products in more than 125 countries. The Barilla business encompasses pasta and sauces, along with additional pasta and baked goods operations. Along with Barilla, the company's brands include Mulino Bianco and Pavesi (breads, cookies, cakes, crackers), Voiello (pasta), and Wasa (crackers). It also sells ready made pasta and frozen meals.

   Pietro Barilla opened Barilla A &amp; G Fratelli as a bread and pasta shop in Parma, Italy, in 1877. The Barilla family built its first factory in 1910, expanding production to eight tons of pasta a day. By 1939 the company had increased production to 80 tons a day and began producing Pasta Fosfina, the first Barilla pasta to be packaged for consumption.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Barilla ceased its production for the state and returned to selling its pastas on the open market. Barilla became a joint stock company in 1960, and it opened a factory for the production of bread sticks and biscotti in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company built the largest pasta factory in the world in 1969. Two years later, as Italian businesses were under attack from labor strikes and Red Brigade terrorists, Pietro Barilla and his brother sold majority ownership of the pasta business his grandfather had started to US company, W. R. Grace. Pietro promptly regretted the sale. Barilla entered the baked goods market in 1975 with the introduction of Mulino Bianco cookies, in addition to acquiring the Voiello brand of wheat pastas. The Barilla family regained control of its original pasta business in 1979, and founded its first foreign subsidiary in France.

   Pietro's sons Luca, Guido, and Paolo joined the family business and spurred Barilla's international expansion efforts in the 1980s. The company's advertising campaigns throughout Europe featured celebrities such as Gerard Depardieu, Placido Domingo, Stefan Edberg, and Steffi Graf. In 1987, the Barilla Group acquired Unione Laboratori and its Le Tre Marie brand of croissants and seasonal cakes. In 1989, the company introduced a line of pasta sauces and acquired the Panem brand of fresh breads.

   Barilla entered Greece with its acquisition of pasta producer Misko in 1991. By 1995, the company had introduced a line of biscuits called Essere, acquired the Pavesi line of confections, and begun exporting products in the US with the plan of making it a national brand. Barilla opened a pasta factory in Ames, Iowa, and acquired Swedish cracker and breakfast cereal producer, Wasa, in 1999.
  </p>

   In 2001 the company purchased Sanson (ice cream, Italy) and sold off its Parmamec (cold meats, Italy) subsidiary. Later that year the company acquired Kraft's Mexican pasta business and formed a joint venture with

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Casting about for new industries and countries to expand into, in 2002 Barilla purchased Germany's then-named Kamps AG and a majority of French baking company, Harry's. It acquired 100% ownership of Kamps and Harry's in 2007.
