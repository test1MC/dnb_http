   Caraustar Industries thinks outside the box in order to make new ones. The company makes 100% recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products for end-use markets such as tubes/cores, folding cartons, gypsum facing paper, and specialty products. Caraustar's business groups include Recovered Fiber, Mill, Consumer Packaging, and Industrial Packaging. It purchases about half of its own recovered fiber, selling the rest to independent converters and to the textile, paper, metal, bookbinding, printing, and furniture industries. The company's carton and packaging products are used to box a variety of consumer goods.
  </p>

  <p>
   The Recovered Fiber Group operates fiber recycling centers that receive, sort, bale, and distribute fiber to US and international customers. It is also a broker of recovered fiber. The Mill Group manufacturers 100% recycled paperboard and specialty converted products. The Consumer Packaging Group makes folding cartons and rigid set-up boxes. The Industrial Packaging Group manufacturers paper tubes and cores, edge protectors and related protective packaging products, construction tubes/forms, furniture forms, and adhesives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paperboard production is Caraustar's principal manufacturing business. Uncoated and clay-coated recycled paperboard is converted into tubes, folding cartons, gypsum wallboard facing paper, and specialty paperboard products. Recovered fiber (derived from recycled paperstock) is the most significant raw material used in mill operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The principal applications of the tube and core division products are textile and paper mill cores, yarn carriers, carpet cores, construction tubes, and foil and metal cores. The folding carton business makes rigid boxes, which are used as containers for candy, frozen and dry foods, paper goods, hardware, sporting goods, and other industrial applications.

  <p>
   Caraustar functions through a number of subsidiaries and about 60 operating facilities in North America. Because of the relatively high cost of shipping tubes and cores, these facilities generally serve customers within a relatively small geographic area. Accordingly, most of its tube and core converting plants are located close to concentrations of customers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Caraustar serves the four principal recycled boxboard product end-use markets: tubes and cores; folding cartons; gypsum facing paper; and specialty paperboard products. It sells its converted recycled paperboard products to the food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, carpet, film, textile, automotive, hardware, and sporting goods industries, primarily for packaging of retail and industrial products. The company sells gypsum wallboard facing paper to wallboard manufacturers.

  <p>
   In order to cope with continuing increases in input costs, including energy, freight, and raw material costs, Caraustar has to raise the prices for its products almost every year. The company in early 2017 announced price increases of $60 per ton on all its mill uncoated recycled paperboard grades and 8% on all converted paper products, including tube, core and protective packaging product lines.

   In late 2016, Caraustar expanded its capabilities on the West Coast with the purchase of Los Angeles Paper Box, a folding carton and rigid box company specializing in supplying the food industry. The deal expanded its product assortment available to the food industry by offering a large variety of custom and stock packaging containers to its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its manufacturing and distribution capabilities, Caraustar in 2015 purchased
   <company id="41287">
    The Newark Group
   </company>
   , a New Jersey-based manufacturer of recycled paperboard, linerboard, industrial tubes, cores and other converted product including book covers and packaging solutions.
