   Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) has its foot on the gas, the oil, and petrochemicals, too. CEPSA, the second-largest oil company in Spain (behind
   <company id="41831">
    Repsol
   </company>
   ), refines 121,900 barrels of crude oil daily, primarily in three refineries. Its oil exploration and production efforts are focused on Algeria, Colombia, Egypt, Peru, and Spain. It has proved reserves of 172.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. CEPSA's marketing network includes more than 1,800 gas stations in Spain and Portugal. It also produces a range of chemical products and has gas and power assets. The company is owned by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC).
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   CEPSA  operates in Spain, Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the UAE, Malaysia, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Suriname, Thailand, Kenya, and Liberia. Its products are marketed worldwide.

  <p>
   An integrated energy company, CEPSA's operations include the exploration and production of oil and gas, refining, transportation and marketing of petroleum products and natural gas, biofuel production and marketing, and the cogeneration and sale of electricity. CEPSA has also developed an important petrochemical area that is highly integrated with oil refining. It produces and sells chemical raw materials used in the production of plastics and biodegradable detergents.
  </p>
  <p>
   A significant part of the company's exploration and production activities is conducted through a production-sharing arrangement with Algeria's state-owned oil company,
   <company id="57690">
    Sonatrach
   </company>
   . The two companies are working together to develop reserves in the eastern part of the Sahara Desert.

  <p>
   The company grows through joint venture initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 CEPSA and
   <company id="161008">
    Golden Agri Resources
   </company>
   announced plans to create a joint venture based in Singapore to develop and sell industrial vegetable alcohols globally. That year, CEPSA and
   <company id="52342">
    Cosmo Oil
   </company>
   created Abu Dhabi Company Cosmo Energy Exploration &amp; Production, in which CEPSA has a 20% stake. The partnership marks the entry of CEPSA in the area of exploration and production of oil and gas in Abu Dhabi.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 CEPSA and
   <company id="182384">
    OPEL
   </company>
   signed a deal to promote the use of autogas (liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG) in Spain. CEPSA plans to install autogas fuel pumps in 100 stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, that year CEPSA agreed to sell 25% of CEPSA Química China to

   Growing its E&amp;P assets, in 2014 CEPSA acquired a 30% interest in an exploration block oil in Liberia, operated by Anadarko Liberia Block 10 Company, a subsidiary of

  <p>
   In 2009 the companies were given the go-ahead by Algerian authorites to drill 40 wells in the lucrative Timimoun Gas Field in southwestern Algeria. CEPSA has another joint venture with Sonatrach to promote an Algeria-Spain pipeline to meet Europe's rising demand for natural gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC), which already owned 47% of CEPSA, acquired TOTAL's 49% stake in the company. IPIC bought TOTAL's interest for €3.7 billion. (In 2009 IPIC acquired the stakes in the company formerly held by Banco Santander and Unión Fenosa for €3.31 billion).

  <p>
   Compañía Española de Petróleos, S.A. (CEPSA) was founded in 1929 as Spain's first oil company listed on the Madrid stock exchange. The company built its first refinery the next year (Tenerife) and branched out into exploration and production in the 1940s. CEPSA continued to grow, creating its lubricant supply operations in 1950 and entering the petrochemical sector in 1954.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company would wait until 1967, however, to gain its next refinery, La Rábida. A refinery in Gibraltar followed in 1969. (In the 1960s and 1970s Franco pushed for more refineries in Spain, which supported his larger goal -- to bulk up the country's heavy industry sector.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Franco's legacy within Spain's oil industry was a non-diversified energy supply. Spain's reliance on oil meant that when two energy crises arose in the 1970s, the country was plunged into a recession that lasted until the mid-1980s. CEPSA expanded outside Spain in 1987, building a storage facility in Portugal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost a quarter of CEPSA's oil was derived from the United Arab Emirates, and that country's International Petroleum Investment Corp. (IPIC) bought a 10% stake in the oil company in 1989. France's Elf Aquitane (later absorbed into TOTAL FINA ELF) followed suit by acquiring a 25% stake in 1990. A year later CEPSA bought smaller Spanish refiner Ertoil from Elf Aquitane. As part of the deal, Elf increased its ownership in Cepsa from 25% to 33%, and CEPSA got its second refinery in Gibraltar.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEPSA sold its part of chemical storage joint venture Proquimica in 1994, the same year that Banco Central Hispano sold half of its 36% stake in the company to an international fund managed by Morgan Grenfell. In 1995 Endesa, Spain's largest energy concern, invested in CEPSA, but sold its holdings four years later after buying a stake in rival oil company Repsol (now Repsol YPF).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company expanded into Canada by building a petrochemical factory in Quebec to produce purified terephthalic acid (PTA), a material used in plastics such as soft drink bottles. CEPSA also formed another joint venture with Sonatrach to promote an Algeria-Spain natural gas pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cepsa and TOTAL FINA ELF (later renamed TOTAL) received regulatory approval in 2001 to merge their Spanish natural gas supply units. The resulting joint venture company, CEPSA Gas Comercializadora, accounted for about 5% of Spain's liberalized natural gas market in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company formed CEPSA Marine Fuels to supply fuels to the shipping market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To streamline operations, in 2008 Cepsa set up CEPSA Química as an umbrella company to handle all of its petrochemical operations.
