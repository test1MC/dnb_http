   The world's largest olive oil bottler, Deoleo is ever on the alert to feed the country's citizens. Formerly named SOS Group, it boasts divisions devoted to vegetable oils and what it refers to as diversification (which includes seasonings, confections, olives, and specialty products). After the company sold its rice division to focus on olive oil, the company changed its name to Deoleo in 2011. With facilities in Spain, Portugal, and the US, it produces goods that are sold to retailers in 100-plus countries. Holdings include Italian olive-oil bottling and distribution firm Minerva Oli (Sasso brand) and Carapelli Firenze, an Italian olive oil company. Spain's largest bank Caja Madrid owns about 18% of Deoleo.

  <p>
   The Madrid-based company rings up nearly 30% of its sales in Spain. Southern Europe accounts for about 35% of Deoleo's sales, with the US, Canada, and Mexico together contributing about 20%. Overall, the company's brands are sold in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   Deoleo's sales declined 14% in 2012 versus 2011, to €828.9 million ($1.1 billion). The double-digit decline was blamed on lower oil sales and the divestiture of the rice business in 2011. Revenue fell across all the company's geographic markets, with Spain, and the US, Canada, and Mexico both down around 30%. Profits fell on lower sales and an increase in operating expenses.

   With Spain and other markets in Southern Europe (including Greece) in a prolonged economic slump, Deoleo is looking abroad for growth, particularly to untapped emerging markets, such as Brazil and China.

   The company sold its rice business in 2011 to focus on olive oil (96% of sales). Indeed, Deoleo's brands -- which include Bertolli, Carapelli. Carbonell, and Sasso -- are well known and hold leading positions in their markets. Still, the company's sales have been trending down since 2009.

  <p>
   In late 2013, Deoleo hired JPMorgan Chase to aid in a refinancing as the company seeks greater long-term stability. Several private equity firms are said to be weighing bids for a majority stake in the Spanish firm.

   In a bid to bolster its portfolio of leading olive oil brands, in May 2013, Deoleo acquired the Hojiblanca olive oil brand, including Hojiblanca's production plant in southern Spain. Hojiblanca's specialty is extra virgin olive oil. A cooperative of olive growers, Hojiblanca also supplies table olives and makes the Cordoliva brand of olive oil.

   for €195 million ($255.5 million) in 2010 in an attempt to reduce its €1 billion (about $1.5 billion) debt and appease its creditors. The company acquired the Bertolli olive oil and vinegar business from London-based

   for €630 million (about $998 million). As part of the 2009 purchase, Deoleo also acquired the Italian Maya, Dante, and San Giorgio olive oil and seed oil brands, as well as a Unilever facility in Inveruno, Italy. Unilever kept the Bertolli brand for all other categories, including margarine, pasta sauces, and frozen meals.
