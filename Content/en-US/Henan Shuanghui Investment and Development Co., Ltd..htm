   Henan Shuanghui Investment and Development, which operates as Shuanghui Development, is the largest pork producer in China, as well as Asia as a whole. It processes some 15 million hogs each year to produce more than 200 cuts and styles of fresh and packaged meats such as ham, sausage, and bacon. In addition to its namesake brand, the company also produces and sells American-style products under the
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   name. Shuanghui Development is about 75%-owned by global pork giant WH Group, which also owns US-based Smithfield.

   Parent WH Group reported 2015 revenue of $21 billion, with Shuanghui Development contributing about 30% of that (roughly $6.5 billion). Shuanghui Development saw performance dip slightly that year amid an economic slowdown in China.

   Shuanghui Development sees American-style packaged meats as key to its growth in China as more and more Chinese citizens enter the middle class. In early 2015 it started selling
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   branded products across the country, and later that year it opened the first factory modeled after the technology and practices of Smithfield's US plants. It plans a handful of additional factories in the next few years.
