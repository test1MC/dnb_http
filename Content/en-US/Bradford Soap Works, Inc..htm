   Bradford Soap Works is far from being a dud with suds. As a top manufacturer of private-label bath soaps, the company makes soap and personal care formulations specifically for consumer products firms. Products, which include bar soaps, gels, powders, and mousses, are manufactured under names AngelSkin, Eco-Ex, OrganicChoices, Chakra, Body Buffing Grain, and Watercolors, among others. Bradford Soap also makes certified organic ingredients, detergent, lubricants, and foam stabilizers for industrial use. Bradford also provides outsourcing services (packaging, assembly and manufacturing) through its facility in Mexico. Founded in 1876 to make soaps for the textile industry, Bradford operates in the US and Mexico.

  <p>
   Other products include bathroom accessories including shower pouf sponges, loofas, scrubbing brushes, manicure/pedicure kits, wash cloths, and other spa-related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   For industrial applications, the company has bulk programs manufacturing soaps in flake, powder, and liquid forms for processing aids, lubricants, and wetting agents. It also produces specialized sodium and potassium soaps, ammonium and potassium stearates, detergents, and anti-microbials; and offers manufacturing services for customers who have existing formulations that lack the capacity to manufacture them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Mexico facility is a Maquiladora, with a special status that allows it to ship materials from the US duty-free and take advantage of the low cost of labor in Mexico. Beyond products, this facility offers turn-key services, such as gift-set assembly, hand-wrapping and decoration of finished goods. It's also equipped for assembly-related work beyond the personal care product arena.

   The company's position as a leader in soap production is regularly contested by competitors that dole out reduced wages and benefits. To stay competitive, Bradford staffs more than half of its production positions at facilities in Indiana and Mexico.
