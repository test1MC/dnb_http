   As its name implies, Sparton is big on defense. Working for aerospace, defense, and medical companies, the company provides contract electronics manufacturing services, primarily the design and production of electronic and electromechanical devices. Its products include printed circuit boards, sensors, and electromechanical components, as well as fully built systems and devices. The company also manufactures an anti-submarine warfare device called a sonobuoy for the

   </company>
   and foreign governments. Sparton, which tracks its roots to 1900, generates most of its sales in the US.

  <p>
   The company is organized around two segments -- manufacturing and design services and engineered components and services. About two-thirds of revenue come from the former, which does contract design, manufacturing and aftermarket repair and refurbishment of sophisticated printed circuit card assemblies.The engineered components and services business designs, develops, and makes proprietary products for domestic and foreign defense agencies as well as for businesses. The unit makes Sparton's anti-submarine warfare devices known as sonobuoys for the US Navy and foreign governments OKed by the US Department of State.

  <p>
   Sparton operates from four factories in the US and one in Vietnam. The US accounts for about 90% of sales.

  <p>
   The company markets its non-sonobuoy products and services directly to customers; sonobuoys are distributed through a joint venture subcontractor ERAPSCO. The US Navy is Sparton's top customer, accounting for about 25% of revenue. Another major client is Fenwal Blood Technologies, which accounts for 10% of sales.

   The company has reported five consecutive years of revenue growth since struggling with declines during the worst of the economic recession. In 2015 (ended June) revenue jumped 13.7% to $382 million and net income rise more than a quarter to nearly $10 million. Sparton saw growth across both segments, although customer Fenwal withdrew some business by conducting some of its own manufacturing. Net income dipped 15% in 2014 to $11 million. It dealt with higher costs such as a settlement and amortization of intangible assets.

  <p>
   In 2015, Sparton made two big acquisitions that bolstered its manufacturing business. In one deal it bought Hunter Technology Corporation for a price that could be as high as $68 million. Hunter is an electronic contract manufacturer that specializes in military and aerospace applications. In another transaction, Sparton acquired Electronic Manufacturing Technology, LLC. , a contract services business manufacturing electromechanical controls and electronic assemblies, for $22.1 million.

   In 2014, the company concentrated on rugged computer systems in  buying Stealth.com, assets of KEP Marine, which specializes in the marine market, and Industrial Electronic Devices, Inc., which is in the industrial and marine markets.

  <p>
   Founded in 1900, Sparks-Withington originally made agricultural equipment components. In 1911 it introduced the world's first electric car horn. In the 1920s the company moved into radios; over the years it introduced a number of firsts, including the first radio to operate on household current. Sparks-Withington went public in 1926. In 1950 it began making submarine detection devices, called sonobuoys, which would become a primary business. That year longtime director John Smith became chairman and CEO; he would head the company for 40 years. The company changed its name to Sparton (a shortened version of the original) in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sparton's sales were buoyant during the 1980s, thanks to a military buildup that emphasized antisubmarine warfare. However, the end of the Cold War dropped the company's sonobuoy business from 61% of sales in 1991 to 17% in 1995. In an effort to get back above water, Sparton shifted its focus to contract electronics manufacturing. In 1996 the company sold its KPI Automotive Group to Dura Automotive Systems for about $100 million, leading to a strong gain in fiscal 1997. Also in 1997 Sparton won a contract for 55% of the US Navy's sonobuoy requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company closed its remaining auto operation, a car horn plant, after failing to find a buyer. That year Sparton began expanding globally through pacts with foreign contract manufacturers. It sold its acoustics line in 1999. Costs associated with a legal tussle against the EPA regarding cleanup at one of its New Mexico facilities pumped up losses for fiscal 1999. In 2000 Sparton settled the case and agreed to pay more than $1.6 million in fines and clean up soil and groundwater which it had contaminated. That year Smith died; his nephew Bradley Smith took over as chairman, and president David Hockenbrocht added CEO to his title.
