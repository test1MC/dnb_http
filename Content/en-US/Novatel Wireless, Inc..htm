   Overall revenues dropped to $344 million in 2012, down 15% from 2011. Both of its mobile computing and M2M products saw decreased sales. Mobile computing was hit by increased competition at Verizon, its largest customer, and the M2M segment lost a top customer that year. Novatel Wireless has not recorded a profit since 2009.
