   The company continues to launch new offerings, particularly in the events and digital media spaces.  In 2011 it enhanced its government technology conferences with the introduction of the FOSE Institute. The FOSE Institute is designed to identify ideas that address government technology policy and implementation challenges. The previous year 1105 Media launched Upside, an online lead generation solution for IT vendors that provides information on more than 1 million IT professionals.

   1105 Media was established when Vitale and his private equity partners acquired 101 Communications and merged it with Stevens Publishing. The acquisitive firm added Post Newsweek Tech Media to its holdings in 2006, followed by Fawcette Technical Publications; the GovSec, U.S. Law and READY Conference and Exhibition; and Federal Employees News Digest (FEND) in 2007.
