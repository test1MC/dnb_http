   The UK's #1 cigarette maker, Imperial Brands eyes an even larger throne. The group (formerly Imperial Tobacco Group) has lavished billions on brand-building acquisitions -- including Spain's

   (Davidoff and West cigarettes, 2002) -- to extend its reign across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific region, and North America. In addition to Davidoff, major brands include Gauloises, JPS, Rizla, KOOL, Salem, blu e-Cigs, Montecristo cigars, and Skruf snus. Imperial Brands operates some 50 cigarette and tobacco product and processing plants worldwide, as well as a logistics business. Products are sold in 160-plus countries; emerging markets account for 60% of cigarettes sold.

  <p>
   The company manages its tobacco business as two units. The Growth brands, which have broad appeal in all markets, include cigarettes and loose tobacco under the Davidoff, West, Gauloise, and Parker &amp; Simpson brands, among others. The Specialist brands, which appeal to niche groups and provide steady returns, include cigarettes, loose tobacco, papers, cigars, and smokeless tobacco under the Gitanes, Montecristo, Route 66, and Skruf names, among others. The split approach began during the global recession when Imperial noticed an improving trend in lower-priced brands as more smokers traded down in order to maintain their habit. It began expanding its Growth portfolio while managing Specialist to contain costs. The few products that don't fit this formula are being transitioned in.
  </p>
  <p>
   While tobacco accounts for two-thirds of the company's business, its logistics unit covers the other third. The division provides its services to Imperial Brands companies and third parties.

  <p>
   Imperial Brands is rolling out regional and local luxury tobacco brands with some success in emerging markets, particularly the Asia/Pacific region, but also Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In China, Imperial has signed a 10-year pact to produce and sell cigarettes. Snus (smokeless tobacco) brands, Skruf and Knox, hold more than 5% of total snus sales volumes in Sweden and Norway.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has 46 manufacturing sites and operates in 160 countries worldwide. Its main Growth Markets include the US and selected markets in the EU, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Specialist markets include Australia as well as parts of the EU, Eastern Europe, and Africa.

   In 2013 revenue decreased by 6% to £26.63 billion compared to £28.27 billion in fiscal 2012, due primarily to falling sales in both segments. Tobacco was impacted by foreign exchange movements and the company's stock optimization program. Behind the final results Growth brands outperformed market trends with a 7% in sales volume compared to the declining tobacco market in general. Imperial Brands has gotten used to controlling costs and did so to deliver a 56% increase in net income leading to an 8% increase in cash from operations.

  <p>
   Careful brand management is a key part of Imperial Brands' strategy but so are acquisitions. To that end, in 2015 the company paid $7 billion for three American cigarette brands from rival

    Reynolds American
   </company>
   as well as cigarette and e-cigarette brands and certain physical assets from
   <company id="55993">
    Lorillard
   </company>
   . Reynolds purchased Lorillard in 2015, a move that required both to offload some properties to appease antitrust regulators. Imperial purchased Winston, Maverick, Kool, Salem, and e-cigarette brand blu, to become the #3 cigarette company in the US, the world's most profitable market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cost control is also key to Imperial, and in 2014 it closed underperforming plants in the UK and France after increased tobacco regulations and continued economic sluggishness cut output in half.

   In 2013 Imperial consolidated part of its business when it paid £41 million for its Cambodian distributor and created Imperial Tobacco Cambodia.

  <p>
   Imperial Tobacco Group was formed in 1901 to fight American Tobacco's invasion of the UK. American Tobacco had become the dominant US tobacco company partly by using a large cash reserve to undercut competitors. When it bought UK tobacco and cigarette factory Ogden's that year, 13 UK tobacco firms responded by registering as The Imperial Tobacco Company. The firms (including Wills, Lambert &amp; Butler, and John Player &amp; Sons) continued to make and sell their products separately.
  </p>
  <p>
   As expected, American Tobacco cut prices, and Imperial fought back, acquiring the Salmon &amp; Cluckstein tobacco shop chain and offering bonuses to retailers that sold its products. When Imperial threatened US expansion in 1902, American Tobacco surrendered: It gave Ogden's to Imperial and halted its Ireland and Great Britain business in exchange for Imperial's pledge to stay out of the US (except for buying tobacco leaf). The two formed the British American Tobacco Company (BAT) to sell both firms' cigarettes overseas. But when American Tobacco split into four companies in 1911 and sold its BAT interest, the agreement was modified to let Imperial sell some of its brands in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s Imperial controlled more than 80% of the UK tobacco market, but its share decreased during the 1960s due to competition from Gallaher Group (Benson &amp; Hedges). Imperial diversified, buying companies such as Golden Wonder Crisps snack food (1961) and the Courage &amp; Barclay brewery (1972).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1973 BAT and Imperial agreed that each firm would control its own brands in the UK and Continental Europe. Imperial sold the last of its stake in BAT in 1980. Conglomerate Hanson Trust paid $4.3 billion for Imperial in a 1986 hostile takeover. Hanson reduced Imperial's tobacco brands from more than 100 to five brand families (a move that decreased its UK market share to 33% by 1990). It also sold Imperial's drinks unit, including Courage and John Smith beer, to Elders IXL (now Foster's Brewing). Between 1986 and 1993 Hanson cut Imperial's tobacco operations from five factories and 7,500 employees to three factories and 2,600 employees; it also sold Imperial's restaurant and food operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   As UK cigarette consumption dropped, Imperial began expanding overseas in 1994. Facing further declining UK cigarette sales and a government tax hike, Imperial bought the world's #1 cigarette paper brand, Rizla (1997), and Sara Lee's cut-tobacco unit, Douwe Egberts Van Nelle (1998), which it renamed Van Nelle Tabak. That acquisition added Drum hand-rolling tobacco and Amphora pipe tobacco to Imperial's brands. In 1999 the company added a bevy of Australian and New Zealand brands (Horizon, Brandon, Flagship, Peter Stuyvesant) from

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Imperial acquired paper maker EFKA (Germany, Canada) and tobacco maker Baelen (Belgium). That year Imperial tripled its cigarette vending operations by acquiring Mayfield Vending (27,000 UK locations). Imperial expanded operations in Africa in 2001 with the acquisition of 75% of Tobaccor. It also began distributing the Marlboro brand in the UK. In late 2005 Imperial acquired the Swedish snus manufacturer Skruf, to get a foothold in the popular niche of the tobacco market, and Norwegian tobacco product distributor Gunnar Stenberg.
