   In the past it took years to sequence the human and other genomes, but Pacific Biosciences of California has introduced a third generation DNA sequencing technology that can map an organism's genome in minutes. The biotechnology company develops proprietary technology known as SMRT (single-molecule, real-time) that performs fast and inexpensive DNA sequencing. Pacific Biosciences of California's sequencing machines are designed for use by clinical, commercial, and institutional research laboratories. The PacBio RS II product is a SMRT DNA sequencing system claims the highest consensus accuracy and longest read lengths of any available sequencing technology.

  <p>
   The company sells its products to customers in North America, Europe, and Asia. The US contributed about 44% of Pacific Biosciences of California's revenues in 2012.

  <p>
   The company manufactures its instruments and reagents in house but relies upon third parties to manufacture some of its sub-components. It has also built up a service and support crew to install its products at customers' sites.

   Pacific Biosciences of California markets its products through a direct sales force in North America and Europe and through distributors in Asia. Customers include genome centers, clinical, government and academic institutions, genomics service providers and agricultural companies.

   The company's revenues dropped by 23% in 2012 as the result of the decline in sales of its PacBio RS instruments due to the loss of US government funding for research (from the
   <company id="100358">
    National Institute of Health
   </company>
   ) and weaker demand in the US for sequencing products. Government funding for research in also Europe declined significantly, contributing to an overall decline in sales of capital equipment such as its PacBio RS system. The revenue slump was partially offset by an increase in service and other revenues stemming from a larger installed base of PacBio RS instruments in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pacific Biosciences of California's net loss declined by 14% in 2012 due to lower operating expenses stemming from the decline in research and development costs led by a $17.5 million cut in personnel related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to a reduction in work force in 2012.

  <p>
   Pacific Biosciences of California develops SMRT technology for commercial applications, though some of its R&amp;D efforts are funded through non-commercial US government grants. The SMRT technology works by focusing on and monitoring a DNA enzyme (polymerase), which moves down the DNA strand and synthesizes a new strand by using the old strand's information. The DNA's sequencing information is extracted at specific moments during the synthesis process. The information is commonly used in scientific research (like mapping genomes) such as agricultural testing, drug discovery, and biosecurity.

   To enhance product performance, in 2012 the company introduced its C2 and XL chemistry enhancements to its PacBio RS system, an automated MagBead loader, software analysis tools for enhanced assembly, and secondary analysis tools for detecting and characterizing base modifications.

   Fueled by IPO cash, in 2011 the company launched the PacBio RS sequencing platform. Along with the actual durable instrument, the company also sells consumable products (collection cells, reagent kits) that are used during sequencing. Despite market excitement over the PacBio RS, the hoped-for torrent of orders was simply a steady stream. Citing an uncertain economic environment (read: tight government research budgets), the company trimmed its workforce by 28% in late 2011. Most of the cuts were made to its operations and research and development groups, to conserve its cash.

   Pacific Biosciences of California completed an IPO in late 2010. Before its IPO the company relied on operational funding from various venture capital investment firms. The $200 million raised in the IPO helped the company with the early

   In 2008 Pacific Biosciences of California broadened its resources after acquiring sequencing technologies from biotech company LI-COR Biosciences. The company also expanded into the European Union in 2010 by establishing a sales organization there, which markets the PacBio RS system.
