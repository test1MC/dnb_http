   Panasonic Corporation of North America's (PNA) products run the gamut of cool: from ultra HD TVs, to hip wearable digital cameras, and household air conditioners. The company oversees the North American operations of Japan's

   , one of the world's leading electronics firms. PNA makes and sells consumer products (home appliances, camcorders, DVDs, VCRs, men's shavers), business products (copiers, fax machines, printers), and industrial electronics products (computer components, semiconductors, appliance motors) under the Panasonic, Technics, and Quasar brands. The company, its Japanese parent's principal subsidiary in North America, is also the largest maker of plasma TV sets.

   It Panasonic Eco Solutions North America unit is focused on the design and implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the US and Canada; PNA's Eco Solutions North America unit partners with Lighthouse Technologies Limited to allow PNA to provide a streamlined, single source of LED video display devices as the sole distributor of the technology in the US and Canada.

   While

   doesn't break out sales for its PNA subsidiary, it reported that sales in North and South America accounted for 3% of its total sales in fiscal 2014 (ended March), and 13% of its total overseas sales.

  <p>
   Priorities for PNA include establishing the company as the leader in the nascent 3D TV market, where it competes with

   ,
   <company id="41885">
    Sony

   , and
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , among others. Innovation and "early-to-market" are key aspects of Panasonic's revenue growth strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 PNA launched a new social community for Hybrid Photographers, the LUMIX Luminary Lounge, which gives users the opportunity to interact with group of photography professionals and enthusiasts selected by Panasonic as brand ambassadors.

  <p>
   Growing its product portfolio, in 2015 the company acquired Dallas-based TS Sports, a privately-held electronic video board systems integrator specializing in light-emitting diode (LED) display technology solutions. Panasonic will benefit from TS Sports' industry expertise while integrating the company's in-house LED video display fabrication facilities and network of regionally-based technicians into the audio-visual business operations of the Panasonic Enterprise Solutions Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to expand business opportunities for both companies in the education market in North America, that year PNA agreed to buy Houston-based Video Insight, a developer of video management software.

  <p>
   In 2010 Panasonic pointed Joseph Taylor lead PNA. The selection of an American to run the company is seen as a sign that Panasonic wants its US arm to exercise more autonomy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Panasonic and PNA are looking to put some distance between themselves and the worldwide financial crisis, which spelled trouble as consumer demand for their products plunged and price competition increased. Despite declining revenues in 2009 and 2008 -- and plummeting profits in 2009 -- the electronics giant continued to invest substantial sums in R&amp;D to bring future generations of products to market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Established in New York City in 1959, Panasonic Corporation of North America was known as Matsushita Electric Corporation of America until 2005 when its company name was changed to strengthen its connection to the brand.
