   From a biological standpoint, Basmati rice is part of the Oryza sativa plant, but for Amira Nature Foods, Basmati is the best way to make a living. Through Amira India and its other subsidiaries, the holding company procures, processes, packages, markets, and sells Basmati rice. The company sells its rice, a fragrant long-grain variety used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine, under its Amira brand in more than 25 countries. Its customers include everything from small, privately owned independent shops to large retailers, such as Bharti

  <p>
   The company plans to use a portion of its IPO the proceeds to fund the development of a new rice processing facility, repay debt, and for general corporate purposes. While it sought to raise $100 million, Wall Street valued the IPO at a little less and Amira raised $90 million instead.

  <p>
   The company has seen a steady increase in sales and profits in recent years. Revenue grew from $201.7 million to $329 million between 2010 and 2012, while profits were up from $5.2 million to $11.9 million during the same period. The company attributes these increases to higher prices and sales generated by third-party customers selling its rice under other labels.

  <p>
   Amira traces its roots back to 1915, when it began as a family-run business that traded agricultural commodities and salt. Amira Nature Foods was later formed in 2012 to hold the assets of Amira India, its main operating subsidiary, and related businesses. Its formation also facilitated its IPO. Prior to the IPO filing, the company was owned by CEO Karan Chanana.
