   Mitsubishi Rayon Lucite divides its business into the production of upstream products (MMAs and specialty methacrylates, or SpMAs) and downstream products (acrylic sheet, specialty polymers, and resins and composites). Its leading brands, Lucite and Perspex, are produced in its downstream operations. Mitsubishi Rayon Lucite is the only MMA producer active in markets around the world.

   The company's acrylic products are known for their workmanlike uses in signage, baths and showers, adhesives, electronics, and other commercial and industrial markets. Mitsubishi Rayon Lucite is hoping to branch out into higher profile product areas.
