   Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals (formerly Star Scientific) has a new name and business strategy focused on the development of drugs to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and neurological disorders. The company has adopted the name of its Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals subsidiary (founded in 2007), which makes nutraceuticals using alkaloids found in tobacco and other plants. Its core products are Anatabloc, to reduce inflammation, and CigRx, a tobacco alternative. (Both products are the subject of warning letters from the
   <company id="144161">
    US Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   .) Formerly a seller of discount cigarettes, the emerging drug development company has since exited the cigarette and dissolvable tobacco businesses.

   The company reported sales of $9.1 million in 2013, a 48% increase versus 2012. Despite the big jump in sales, Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals (RCP) was unprofitable for a fifth consecutive year and cash flow from operations dove further into negative territory. The company attributed the double-digit sales gain in 2013 to increased sales volume of its Anatabloc dietary supplement for anti-inflammatory support. (Indeed, sales of Anatabloc has been RCP's primary source of revenue in recent years.) The company blamed its net loss on significantly higher sales and marketing expenses, and increases in legal and general expenses, partially offset by lower research and development costs. RCP spent about $3 million in R&amp;D in 2013, $1.6 million less than in 2012. The R&amp;D funding in 2013 was directed toward the ongoing clinical trial for Anatabloc Facial Creme. Also in 2013, RCP recognized a modest gain from the sale of equipment and inventory related to its discontinued dissolvable tobacco business

   Along with its name change, which took effect in June 2014, and change in focus, RCP has a new leadership team. The company's CEO and COO both resigned in late 2013. Ex-CEO Jonnie Williams is embroiled in the public corruption trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife. The couple are charged in federal court with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Williams in exchange for promotion the company's tobacco-based dietary supplement.

   The company discontinued its Star Tobacco division in 2012 to focus on the anti-inflammatory aspects of anatabine, in an effort to develop a range of non-nicotine dietary supplements and related pharmaceutical products. (Star Tobacco made two types of dissolvable smokeless tobacco products, branded as Ariva and Stonewall Hard Snuf. Star Scientific reported low sales for its dissolvable tobacco products due in part to federal marketing restrictions surrounding such products.) However, in late 2013, the firm received a warning letter from the
   <company id="144161">
    US Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   (FDA) regarding two of its products: Anatabloc and CigRx. The FDA asserts that anatabine is a new dietary ingredient that required premarket notification to the agency. The agency also asserts that the company's products are unapproved new drugs based on statements the company makes on its websites.

   In March 2013, Star Scientific launched Anatabloc Revitalizing Facial Serum, to improve the skin's appearance, after introducing Anatabloc Rare Cellular Facial Cr√®me in September 2012.
