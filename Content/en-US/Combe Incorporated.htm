   Combe comes to the rescue when a touch of grey or other personal indignity appears. The company's health and beauty aids nix the itch with Vagisil, as well as color the head turned salt and pepper (Grecian Formula and Just For Men). Combe also combats loose dentures (sold under the Sea-Bond brand) and tough beards (Lectric Shave). Its acquisition of J.B. Williams added popular personal care brands Aqua Velva after-shave and Brylcreem hair styling cream, among others. Founded in 1949 by Ivan Combe and his wife Mary Elizabeth Deming, the family-owned company created Clearasil in 1950, the #1 acne medication (later sold), and other familiar brands.
