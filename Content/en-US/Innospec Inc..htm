        <p>
   Innospec has concluded that the company's future lies in applying innovative ideas to its specialty chemicals businesses by developing fuel additives and niche performance chemicals. Innospec's Fuel Specialties segment makes chemical additives that enhance fuel efficiency and engine performance, and its Performance Chemicals unit makes several products used in the personal care, paper, detergent, and photographic markets. It is also the sole producer of TEL (tetra ethyl lead) product, an anti-knock gas additive sold to oil refineries worldwide.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Innospec operates in France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Switzerland, the, UK, and the US. It has regional offices in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the US accounted for 35% of sales.

        <p>
   The company's Fuel Specialties segment produces a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions. They are used to support the efficient operation of automotive, marine, and aviation engines, power plant generators, and heating and diesel particulate filter systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its Performance Chemicals segment provides technology-based solutions for customers' processes in the personal care, polymers, and the fragrance ingredients industries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its Octane Additives segment sells TEL for use in automotive gasoline and trading as part of the company's environmental remediation business.

        <p>
   The company's products are sold primarily to oil refineries, personal care, and fragrance companies, and other chemical and industrial companies throughout the world. In 2012 Innospec had one significant customer in the Fuel Specialties business,
   <company id="50019">
    Royal Dutch Shell plc
   </company>
   and its affiliates, which accounted for 11% of group sales.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Innospec's revenues grew by 0.26 % in 2012 thanks to a 1% increase in the sales of the Fuel Specialties and Performance chemicals segments. Fuel Specialties segment revenues grew despite a decline in sales volumes in both the Americas and Asia/Pacific (due to lower sales of high volume but low margin products) which was offset by higher sales of more added value products, resulting in an improved price and product mix in both these geographical markets. The Performance Chemicals segment revenues jumped thanks to higher sales volumes. The Personal Care market in the Americas and the global Fragrance Ingredients markets saw improved sales volumes
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income increased by 40% in 2012, primarily due to higher sales, decreased restructuring charges, and profit on the disposal of surplus real-estate.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Innospec's strategy is to develop new and improved technologies to continue to strengthen and increase market positions within its Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals businesses. Innospec is currently the only available source of TEL in the world. However, declining TEL sales after the US Clean Air Act was passed, along with similar moves by other countries, forced Innospec to develop other business lines. With a global decline in the use of leaded gasoline, Innospec plans to stop manufacturing TEL.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2016 Innospec acquired
   <company id="136323">
    Huntsman
   </company>
   's European Differentiated Surfactants business, valued at about $260 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Diversifying its specialty chemical offerings, in 2012 the company bought Louisiana-based Strata Control Services, a leading supplier of mud and fluid loss services for oil and gas drilling operations for $60 million. Strata's products and services help to lower operating costs by preventing the unnecessary loss of valuable materials into the formation matrix.

        <p>
   Patrick Williams was named Innospec's president and CEO in 2009. Williams was previously EVP and president of the company's Fuel Specialties division. He replaced Paul Jennings, who resigned from Innospec during the Justice Department bribery investigation but was not CEO when the violations occurred. The company pleaded guilty in 2010 and paid more than $40 million in fines in a settlement that resolved criminal and civil economic corruption charges in the US and related charges in the UK.
  </p>
        <p>
   Innospec was investigated by the US Justice Department and the British for its role in bribing Iraqi government officials between 2000 and 2003 in the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. It was also charged by the DOJ with violating the US trade embargo against Cuba, and in a Securities and Exchange Commission civil case with bribing government officials in Indonesia.
