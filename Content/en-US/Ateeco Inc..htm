   Got a thing for pierogies? Thank Ateeco, the longtime manufacturer of the traditional Polish specialty dish: potato-stuffed pasta. Doing business as Mrs. T's Pierogies, the company makes and ships more than 13 million frozen Mrs. T's brand pierogies every week. Its customers include retail food, convenience, and club stores, and foodservice providers across the US, as well as US military commissaries worldwide. Mrs. T's pierogies come in more than a dozen varieties, including potato and cheddar; sauerkraut; and potato, sour cream and chives. The family-owned and -managed company was founded by Ted Twardzik in 1952; the product was named after his mother, Mary Twardzik.
