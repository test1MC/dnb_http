   Thermo Fisher Scientific gets the laboratory ready for research, analysis, discovery, or diagnostics, . The company makes and distributes analytical instruments, equipment, and other laboratory supplies. Product range from chromatographs and spectrometers to Erlenmeyer flasks and fume hoods. It also provides specialty diagnostic testing products, as well as clinical analytical tools. Thermo Fisher serves more than 400,000 customers worldwide in its key markets of health care and diagnostics, biotech and pharmaceutical, academic, research institutions, and government, and industrial and applied settings, including environmental quality and process control. About half of its sales are in the US.

  <p>
   Laboratory Services, which provides just about everything needed to run a lab, generate 38% of Thermo Fisher's revenue. With about a quarter of revenue is the Life Sciences Solutions segment, which provides reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, drug discovery and production and for vaccines and diagnosis. Analytical Instruments and Specialty Diagnostics account for 18% and 19% of revenue, respectively.

  <p>
   Thermo Fisher gets just more than half of its sales in the US. With no country outside the US representing a double-digit percentage of sales, Thermo Fisher sees lots of room to grow internationally, and is aiming for a quarter of sales to come from emerging markets by 2016. Key countries include China (currently 8% of sales), India, South Korea, Brazil, and Russia.

   Pitching Thermo Fisher's offerings is a team of direct sales personnel; it has some 12,000 sales people overall. The company also uses e-commerce, third-party distributors, and other channels.

  <p>
   Thermo Fisher maintained revenue at about $16.9 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. The biggest segment increase was from lie science solutions which had 5.8% year-to-year growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income increased 4% to about $2 billion in 2015 from 2014 with help from a reduction in costs associated with product liability litigation, third-party transactions, and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion in 2015, compared to $2.6 billion in 2014.

   While acquisitions continue to be a strong component in Thermo Fisher's growth strategy, the company also uses divestitures to keep its business focused. In 2014 it sold its cell culture, gene modulation, and magnetic beads businesses to
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   for $1 billion. Later that year it sold Cole-Parmer Instrument Company to private equity firm
   <company id="99579">
    GTCR
   </company>
   for $480 million. Cole-Parmer makes laboratory equipment under the brands Masterflex, Oakton, and Digi-Sense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thermo Fisher held research and development spending at about $692 million, about the same as 2014 after increasing the amount from $396 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's customers are susceptible to market forces that might reduce their R&amp;D spending. Pharmaceutical research could be affected by mergers and academic research could be affected by reduced federal spending for basic research.

  <p>
   Thermo Fisher in 2016 bought
   <company id="44668">
    FEI Co.
   </company>
   for $4.2 billion. FEI, which had $930 million in revenue in 2015, brings a complementary product mix of electron microscopes to Thermo Fisher's mass spectrometry products. The companies's boards of directors approved the deal, which is expected to wrap up in early 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FEI deal follows on the heels of Thermo Fisher's acquisition of
   <company id="51430">
    Affymetrix
   </company>
   in April 2016 for $1.3 billion. Affymetrix makes instruments used to analyze specimens at the cellular and genetic level.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Thermo Fisher finalized a huge deal that will move it to the head of the pack in life sciences tools, particularly the growing field of genetic testing. It bought California-based
   <company id="58766">
    Life Technologies
   </company>
   for about $15.3 billion, plus the assumption of debt. Life Technologies develops tools and systems for gene cloning, expression, and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cash from making bread-and-butter laboratory equipment (beakers, microscope slides) is used to buy small, innovative companies that can benefit from Thermo Fisher's resources and drive the company's steady growth, especially in emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015,Thermo Fisher bought Alfa Aesar, a manufacturer of research chemicals, for $405 million in cash. The acquisition adds to Thermo Fisher's portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. Also in 2015 Thermo Fisher bought Advanced Scientifics Inc., a provider of single-use technologies for customized bio-processing, for $300 million in cash. ASI's product line helps Thermo Fisher meet customer demand in the bio-processing market. Both Alfa Aesar and ASI operate internationally, which helps Thermo Fisher's drive to increase overseas sales.

  <p>
   Predating the acquiring company, Thermo Electron, Fisher Scientific dates back to 1902, when 20-year-old Chester Fisher bought the stockroom of Pittsburgh Testing Laboratories (established 1884) and formed Scientific Materials Co. The company's earliest products, supplied from Europe, included simple tools such as microscopes, balances, and calorimeters. It published its first catalog in 1904.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the outbreak of WWI disrupted supplies from Europe, Scientific Materials established its own R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities. It acquired Montreal-based Scientific Supplies in 1925 and the following year changed its name to Fisher Scientific Company. By 1935 Fisher had doubled its size, adding glass-blowing operations and an instrument shop.

  <p>
   During the German occupation of Greece in WWII, George Hatsopoulos, part of a well-to-do family packed with politicians and engineering professors, made radios for the Greek resistance. After the war he came to the US and became a professor of mechanical engineering at
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   . With a $50,000 loan, Hatsopoulos founded Thermo Electron in 1956 to identify emerging technology needs and create solutions for them.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Thermo Electron merged with Fisher Scientific International in a stock-swap transaction valued at nearly $11 billion. (
