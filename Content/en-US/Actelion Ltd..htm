   Drugmaker Actelion is anything but neutral in its fight against life-threatening diseases. The Swiss drugmaker develops and markets small molecule drugs in a number of therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular disease, oncology, and autoimmune disease. Actelion has several products on the market: It sells Tracleer worldwide and Ventavis in the US as treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a serious disease characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries connecting the heart and lungs. The company also markets Zavesca, which treats an inherited metabolic disorder called Gaucher disease. In early 2017,

    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   agreed to buy Actelion for $30 billion.

  <p>
   Actelion has sales and marketing subsidiaries in more than 25 countries around the world. Though the company is based in Switzerland, nearly all of its product sales take place in international markets -- especially the US, which accounts for 43% of annual revenues. Other major markets include Europe (37%) and Japan (11%).

  <p>
   The company has a pipeline of potential new therapies including compounds in areas such as cardiovascular disease, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, genetic disorders, and infectious and autoimmune diseases. Among the diseases Actelion's investigational drugs may treat are insomnia, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The firm received

    FDA
   </company>
   approval for Veletri, a newly developed treatment for pulmonary hypertension, in 2010. Veletri is available in the US and some European markets.

  <p>
   Actelion, which occasionally acquires drug companies or formulations and technologies from other drugmakers, intends to use such strategic acquisitions, as well as partnerships with other drug firms, to expand its development efforts.

  <p>
   As Europe's largest biotech, with a focus on rare diseases (which makes it less prone to competitive pressures), Actelion has been an attractive acquisition target for years. In early 2017,
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   made a deal to buy Actelion for $30 billion. It plans to spin off Actelion's drug discovery and early-stage R&amp;D operations into a new public company headquartered in Switzerland and led by existing Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel.
