   Benchmark also offers precision technology manufacturing capabilities that complement its EMS services and allow it to provide vertical integration of critical components. Benchmark Precision Technologies performs precision machining, metal joining, and functional testing, as well as specialized engineering services. Benchmark provides these services for a number of industries, including the aerospace, medical, instrumentation, and semiconductor equipment manufacturing sectors. By expanding the number and type of services it offers, the company becomes a more integral part of its customers' manufacturing operations and reduces its dependence on the consumer electronics industry.

   About of third of Benchmark's revenue comes from aerospace and defense firms in its industrial category. Telecommunications and Computing customers account for 23% and 22% of sales, respectively. Medical, a promising category for the company, generates about 14% of revenue with testing and instrumentation at 9%.

   Benchmark ended a four-year stretch of revenue in 2015, reporting a 9% decrease to $2.5 billion from 2014. A 26% drop in revenue from telecom customers followed a telecom boom in 2014 and a 4% decline in sales to computing customers reflected a slowdown in that sector. Revenue in the medical sector perked up 13% on the strength of new business.

  <p>
   Benchmark marked a 16% higher profit in 2015, rising to $95 million from 2014. The company banked a tax benefit in 2015 that was an expense in 2014, enabling it to post higher profit despite lower sales.

   Cash flow from operations ended 2015 at $147 million compared to $137 million of 2014.

   Benchmark has benefited from a continuing push toward outsourced manufacturing, which helps major electronics firms cut costs. In order to expand globally in the competitive and rapidly consolidating EMS market -- where giants such as

   ), and

   dominate -- it has added engineering design teams in Asia, where it can operate less expensively. Still, the company is growing at home in Texas where its business is being fueled by growth in high-tech. In the summer of 2014, Benchmark opened a new location in Round Rock, Texas to serve high-tech companies there.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focusing its efforts on high-end products in growth industries including medical, test and instrumentation, and industrial. Its products range from easy to assemble, low-cost high-volume components for consumer electronics to complicated, state-of-the-art, mission critical electronic hardware for military, medical and other high-end applications. Benchmark sees higher profit margins for its higher-end products that require specialized design and production services. However, the company prides itself on offering services to all kinds of markets.

  <p>
   Strategic acquisitions continue to be a focus of the company's organic growth initiatives. In November 2015 it acquired Secure Technology, which specializes in providing engineered and ruggedized products for industrial, aerospace and defense applications, for $230 million. The acquisition increases Benchmark's engineering capabilities and enhances its ability to serve customers in the highly regulated industrial, aerospace and defense markets.

   Benchmark in October 2013 acquired the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) business of
   <company id="10275">
    CTS Corp
   </company>
   . for about $75 million in cash. The purchase included five manufacturing facilities in California, New Hampshire, Thailand, and Mexico, as well as 1,000 employees. The purchase expands Benchmark's industrial, defense and aerospace, and medical customer base. In June the company bought Suntron Corp., an EMS company based in Phoenix, for $19.3 million in cash. The acquisition of Suntron added manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Arizona and strengthened Benchmark's business with aerospace and defense clients.

  <p>
   Benchmark Electronics was formed in 1979 as Electronics, Inc., to produce patient monitoring equipment. It was incorporated in 1981 as a wholly owned subsidiary of medical implant maker Intermedics, which pioneered surface-mount technology in pacemakers. In 1986 Intermedics sold 90% of Benchmark's stock to Electronic Investors Corp. (EIC), a company formed by Intermedics executives Donald Nigbor, Steven Barton, and Cary Fu. (Nigbor began serving as president.) In 1988 EIC became Benchmark, and Mason &amp; Hangar (engineering and construction) bought 60% of the company. Benchmark went public in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company moved its headquarters from Clute, Texas, to a larger plant in nearby Angleton. Benchmark made its first acquisition -- electronics contract manufacturer EMD Technologies -- in 1996. In 1998 the company acquired Hudson, New Hampshire-based electronics firm Lockheed Commercial Electronics (which later became Benchmark's Hudson Division). That year, despite a prolonged slump in the electronics industry and turmoil in Asian markets, Benchmark's sales grew more than 50%.
