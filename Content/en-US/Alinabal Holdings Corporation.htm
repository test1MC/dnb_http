   Alinabal Holdings operates through its individual business units that serve the automotive, aerospace, and printing industries. Alinabal Motion Transfer Devices manufactures spherical bearings, stamped molded bearing and linkage assemblies, and standard/custom rod ends. Alinabal Engineered Products produces complex mechanical assemblies and precision stampings. Its Alinabal Practical Automation unit provides printers (for use in ticket kiosks and ATMs), and the company also makes aircraft instrumentation (desiccators and dehumidifiers) and optical shutters (aka "beam blockers") through its DACO Instrument subsidiary.
