   Petrochemicals might be a bitter (and expensive) pill to swallow for some, but Myriant has a sweeter alternative. A biochemical company, Myriant makes chemical intermediates, including biosuccinic acid and lactic acid, from corn-derived glucose, sugarcane-derived sucrose, and cellulosic sugars in biomass. Its proprietary technology uses biocatalysts and a fermentation process to make chemicals (used by industrial and other manufacturers) that serve as a substitute for traditional petroleum-based chemicals. Myriant boasts that its technology can potentially produce lower-cost chemicals and consume, rather than produce, CO2. The company filed an IPO in 2011 but withdrew it in 2014.

   Until it begins earning revenue from chemical manufacturing, Myriant will seek to bring in revenue through government grants and by licensing its proprietary chemical-producing technology to third-party chemical companies. Since 2008 the company has earned revenue through a licensing agreement with Purac Biochem BV (a subsidiary of
   <company id="92646">
    CSM N.V
   </company>
   .), which uses Myriant's technology to produce lactic acid and other chemical products. The company has also entered into agreements with
   <company id="59131">
    ThyssenKrupp's
   </company>
   subsidiary
   <company id="139775">
    Uhde Gmb
   </company>
   , which would leverage the company's fermentation process. Despite its various sources of revenue, Myriant continues to operate at a loss, due in large part to R&amp;D and general and administrative expenses that exceed the company's revenue.
