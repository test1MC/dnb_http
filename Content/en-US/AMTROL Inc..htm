   The company keeps its competitive edge by investing in research and development to improve the technology and design of its products. Notable advances include its products' ergonomic design, stack and storage ability, and impact and corrosion resistance. AMTROL's expansion tanks are designed to reduce water volume and pressure within a water heater due to thermal expansion.
