   Hitachi's global business strategy to respond to growing demand in the important North American market by expanding production capacity in the Americas, including Mexico. In 2014 it built a new plant in Lerma City, Mexico to manufacture automotive systems, through its Hitachi Automotive Systems Mexico, S.A. de C.V. The Mexican market is developing into a base for automotive manufacturing throughout the Americas, including Latin America. The plant will strengthen the supply for the car makers throughout the Americas using the preferential trade agreement.

   That year HiAMS-AM also built a third production facility at its Monroe, Georgia plant, through an investment of an expected $80 million. Production at the new facility is expected to begin in 2016.

   In 2014, the company launched the Hitachi Advantage mobile application for Android and iOS devices, which will meet the growing demand for tools that inspire customers to purchase Hitachi products.
