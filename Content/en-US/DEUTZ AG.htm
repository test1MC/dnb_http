   DEUTZ is revved up when it comes to its engine business. The 140-year-old company manufactures diesel and gas engines, and provides related services. Its main customers include truck and bus makers, but DEUTZ also sells its engines for use in cars, ships, and construction and agricultural machinery; its gas and diesel engines are used for power generation. Other DEUTZ products include air, oil, and water cooling systems and exchange parts. DEUTZ is
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   's main supplier of small- and medium-sized diesel engines. Europe generates approximately 75% of the company's revenues. SAME DEUTZ-FAHR Group S.p.A. owns about 45% of DEUTZ, while AB Volvo owns more than 25%.

  <p>
   DEUTZ AG had its beginning as N.A. Otto &amp; Cie, an engine company founded by Nicolaus August Otto and Eugen Langen in 1864. While Langen provided financial backing, Otto provided technical expertise for the fledgling company. By 1868 the company had begun large-scale production of atmospheric gas engines and was exporting to the US. In 1869 it built a factory through the funding of businessman Ludwig August Roosen-Runge, and the company was renamed Langen, Otto, &amp; Roosen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz (GFD) was established in 1872; Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach were hired as the engineering director and head of the tracer department, respectively. In 1877 GFD established Schleicher, Schumm &amp; Co. to build engines in the US. Daimler and Maybach left GFD in 1882 to form Daimler Engine (which has developed into
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler AG
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Otto expanded the company's product line with his innovations (the four-stroke engine and the electromagnetic ignition system) until his death in 1891. The company began producing locomotives with internal combustion engines in 1892 and diesel engines in 1907. Soon afterwards the company began a short-lived career in car production that ended in 1912.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became Motorenfabrik Deutz in 1924 after it merged with Motorenfabrik Oberursel. It began producing diesel tractors in 1926. The 1930s brought more name changes: Following its 1930 merger with Maschinenbauanstalt Humboldt (mechanical engineering), it became Humboldt-Deutzmotoren; in 1938 it became Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD) when it formed an affiliation with the steel group

    Klöckner &amp; Co
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1944 KHD produced air-cooled diesel engines as alternatives to water-cooled engines. Following the destruction caused during WWII, the company struggled to resume production as it reconstructed its plants. In 1951 KHD permanently replaced its water-cooled tractor engines with air-cooled engines. The company began producing chain tractors in 1953, and in 1959 it acquired a railroad car producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1960s and the 1970s included a string of purchases that included FAHR (mechanical engineering, 1968), Veorde (large engines, 1971), and WEDAG (plant construction, 1973). During this time the company stopped making locomotives and focused on engines, agricultural machinery, and plant construction.
  </p>
  <p>
   KHD acquired Allis-Chalmers Corporation (agricultural machinery, US) in 1985, but the company had overestimated the success of the US agricultural market, and the purchase led to financial woes. KHD reduced its workforce by 32% in 1987 and shed 15 subsidiaries in 1988. In 1989 it sold Deutz-Allis and returned to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 KHD reorganized into a holding company for its subsidiaries. It sold two of its agricultural machinery units in 1995. By 1996 KHD was on the verge of bankruptcy after one of its industrial plant units reported false returns that led to substantial losses for the company. With aid from
   <company id="40833">
    Deutsche Bank
   </company>
   , its major shareholder, the company weathered the losses. KHD changed its name to DEUTZ AG in 1997, and it started to shed some of its industrial plant units, with the goal of disposing of that segment altogether to concentrate on engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary DEUTZ ENERGY was established in 1998 to head growth in the gas engine market. In 1999 and 2000 DEUTZ continued to dissolve its industrial plant unit (it closed its cement works plant in Dessau). In 2001 the company sold KHD Humboldt Wedag, a subsidiary engaged in industrial plant construction, to AIG Altmark Industrie.
