   Patheon makes the production path for pharmaceutical companies a little easier to tread. With facilities in North America and Europe, the company provides contract development and manufacturing services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty drug companies worldwide. It develops drug candidates at pre-formulation stage through final stages of launch, commercialization, and production. On the manufacturing services side, it makes mainly prescription drugs in a wide variety of dosage forms -- from solids to sprays. Indeed, Patheon manufactures 12 of the top 100 selling drug compounds in the world (based on sales). Patheon is owned by newly-formed DPx Holdings B.V.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Patheon has a dozen commercial manufacturing facilities and nine development centers located throughout the US, Canada, Mexico, and Europe (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK).  It also has an office in Japan.

   The pharmaceutical services company has about 533 customers worldwide, including 19 of the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies, eight of the world's 10 largest biotech firms, and eight of the world's 10 largest specialty pharmaceutical companies. Patheon's top 10 customers account for nearly two-thirds of its revenue.

   Patheon primarily operates through two market-leading businesses: CMO (commercial manufacturing outsourcing services) and PDS (pharmaceutical development services). CMO focuses mainly on prescription products in sterile dosage forms and solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms. That segment generates about 85% of the company's revenue. PDS provides development services ranging from finished dosage formulation to clinical trial packaging to related analytics.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Patheon's sales increased 37% in fiscal 2013 (ended October) versus the prior year, to top $1 billion driven by a 44% increase in CMO revenue primarily due to demand in North America and the acquisition of Banner Pharmacaps in 2012. The company also significantly narrowed its net loss to $35.9 million in 2013 from more than $100 million in 2012 on higher revenue, partially offset by refinancing expenses. Patheon has reported a loss from continuing operations in each of the past four years.

   The merger of Patheon with Royal DSM's pharmaceutical products business catapulted Patheron's contract manufacturing business from third to second place (behind
   <company id="159463">
    Catalent
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is currently developing new products to lower cholesterol and triglycerides, and is using proprietary technologies to develop abuse deterrent drugs, improve the bioavailability of existing drugs, improve product stability, and introduce new forms of dosages, such as pediatrics.
  </p>
        <p>
   Following its acquisition of
   <company id="108868">
    Banner Pharmacaps
   </company>
   in late 2012, Patheon closed its facility in Alberta, Canada in October 2013 as part of an ongoing effort to assess its global footprint. In February 2013 it sold its facility in Puerto Rico for $7 million and entered into a sale-leaseback deal. The firm combines lean manufacturing practices with six sigma manufacturing to streamline operations, removed bottlenecks in productions, and optimize the performance of its manufacturing network.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is capitalizing on the trend toward more outsourcing in the pharmaceutical industry by developing long-term relationships with clients. It expanded the service offering of its PDS unit -- which manufactures and develops formulations for drugs still undergoing clinical testing -- to include labeling, packaging, and storage of clinical trial patient kits. Patheon's goal was to create an integrated service offering for clinical development outsourcing as a way to bring in new customers, then transition them to commercial manufacturing customers once their drugs win regulatory approval.

        <p>
   As part of Patheon's strategic plan to be a leader in oral dosage development and manufacturing services, the company in December 2012 acquired
   <company id="136906">
    VION
   </company>
   subsidiary
   <company id="108868">
    Banner Pharmacaps
   </company>
   , which specializes in gelatin-based oral drug delivery technology, for $269 million. The deal provides Patheon with a well-balanced portfolio of proprietary products, state-of-the-art facilities, and additional manufacturing plants in Canada, Mexico, and the Netherlands.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired
   <company id="117069">
    IRIX Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , which manufactures complex active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drugs from development through commercial launch. That deal broadened Patheon's existing API services in the US.
