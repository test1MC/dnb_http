   It's a heil of a job, but someone's gotta do it. The Heil Co., which does business as Heil Environmental, is one of the largest makers of refuse and recycling collection vehicles. Its vehicles include front, rear, and side loading refuse collection trucks, multi-compartment vehicles, and recyclers. Heil also offers a line of lifting and recycling products under other brand names, including DuaLift (hook lift and cable hoist systems), Bayne (cart trippers and lift systems), and Marathon (waste compaction and recycling systems). Heil, which sells its products to municipalities and private refuse collection companies in 150 countries through more than 50 distributors, is a unit of diversified manufacturer

   Heil stays ahead of the garbage game when it comes to dealing with the recessionary economy and fluctuating fuel and steel prices by leveraging new technologies. For instance some of the company's larger automated side-loader units incorporate its STARR System semi-trailer design for improved maneuverability on narrow streets. Other products include Heil's MultiTask SL straight-body side loader, which is capable of handing mixed refuse routes such as bagged and containerized garbage, as well as loose yard debris. Such vehicle designs offer greater operational efficiency and ultimately lower labor costs by reducing collection times on routes.

   In 2014 the company introduced Odyssey, a lighter, more efficient, purpose-built residential front loader refuse collection vehicle. That year the  company began delivering integrated compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel systems for garbage trucks though the introduction of Heil's CNrG tailgate. CNrG integrates CNG tanks, which are usually found on the roof of a refuse collection vehicle or along the frame rails, into the tailgate.

   In 2012 Big Truck Rental of Tampa, Florida chose Heil to be the new single provider for its nationwide fleet of garbage trucks and other refuse equipment.

   In 2013 Heil's Environmental Solutions Group (ESG) acquired The Curotto-Can Company of Sonoma, California. The Curotto-Can is known for its automated carry can that mounts to the forks of a commercial front loader, converting the unit into an automated front loader.
