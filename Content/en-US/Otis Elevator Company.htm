More than 2.5 million Otis elevators, escalators, and moving sidewalks are in service. The company, which serves more than 200 countries, makes gearless elevators for high-rises, a hydraulic line for mid-rise buildings, and a heavy-duty one for freight, as well as Gen2 and ReGen energy efficient elevators (offering 75% energy reduction). Its people-moving systems carry airport passengers to baggage claim. Otis offers installation, maintenance, and upgrade services, too. More than 80% of its sales are generated outside the US.

   Otis is part of UTC Building &amp; Industrial Systems, one of
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   ' five business segments. The company is investing in developing more energy efficient elevators and escalators. Its Gen2 has been around for more than a decade, touting 50% energy reduction, but Otis has launched its ReGen elevator system that claims a 75% reduction in energy compared to conventional systems that don't have regenerative drives. (Regenerative drives feed energy back to a building's electrical center.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has boosted its slate of services, as well; it introduced an Elite program that puts more muscle behind its equipment reliability and repair response; so far, customers in more than 10 countries are using it. Accompanying the service enhancements, Otis is offering upgrades to its Gen2 elevator line by installing a branded ReGen drive.

  <p>
   Otis' revenues have been on an upward trend since 2012, including a 7.4% rise in 2014. In 2014 organic sales increased by 6% due to higher new equipment sales (China, 2%, the Americas, 1%, Europe, 1% and the Middle East, 1%). Service sales growth in the Americas and China (combined 1%), was offset by a 1% decline in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company reported strong new equipment order growth rates in North America of (39% of total sales); South Asia, 28% (due to a large order in Singapore); and China, 5%. These were partially offset by lower new equipment orders in the Middle East (30%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Operational profit increased by 4% due to higher new equipment contribution (6%) partially offset by a lower service contribution (1%) due to continued pricing pressures in Europe, and higher overhead expenses (2% ) in connection with the company's continued investment in emerging markets.

   In 2015 Otis won a contract to provide 73 elevators and escalators for 30 Hudson Yards, a 92-story office tower that will be among the first buildings constructed as part of Hudson Yards on Manhattan's West Side. The project is the largest development in New York City since the construction of the Rockefeller Center in the 1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support its growth in India, in 2015 Otis opened its expanded factory in Bengaluru (Bangalore) that includes a new, state-of-the-art elevator test tower.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its China business, in 2014 Otis announced plans to supply elevators for Chengdu Yintai Center and has opened a second Sichuan branch office in Mianyang.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in Asia, Otis won the largest new equipment contract in its history in 2014, to supply and install 411 escalators and 167 Gen2 elevators for a mass transit project in Singapore. It will also supply 107 high-rise elevators and escalators for the Abu Dhabi Plaza in Kazakhstan, which at 1,050 feet will be the tallest building in central Asia when completed in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the innovation front, in 2013 Otis launched a new elevator that is simpler to install, sustainable to operate, and is powered by a battery when the power fails. Otis is launching a new residential Gen2 elevator that eliminates the need for three phase power, is solar-power capable, and uses battery technology to continue to run when the power goes out. The Gen2 Switch elevator will be available globally through Otis operating units in a phased rollâ€‘out in developed and emerging markets, including: Europe, India, South East Asia, and Central and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also launched a new mobile application for its eService online customer service platform to customers with instant access to open service calls, elevator performance data, and service call logging from a smartphone in select markets.

   Otis has capitalized on acquisitions to expand its global service portfolio. In mid-2011 it purchased Pittsburgh-based Marshall Elevator, the state's largest privately owned and operated full-service elevator enterprise. The deal marked Otis' twelfth acquisition for the year. However, with the majority of business coming from outside the US, Otis has focused on acquiring businesses in regions undergoing large scale urbanization, mainly Eastern Europe. Earlier in 2011 Otis took over RSU Number 3, a Saint Petersburg, Russia elevator service company, and Servis Vyathu, in the Czech Republic.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a company that is more than 160 years old, Otis has come a long way from its beginnings in Yonkers, New York, to be a part of such major attractions as Rio's Christ the Redeemer monument, the Eiffel Tower, and the Sydney Opera House. Otis traces its roots to Elisha Graves Otis, the founder who unveiled the world's first "safety elevator" in 1853. Otis Elevator was acquired by United Technologies in 1976.
