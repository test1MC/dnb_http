   Without the airy outdoors, W.C. Bradley would suffocate. The company's Char-Broil division is a leading maker of outdoor barbecue gas and electric grills. In addition, W.C. Bradley makes Thermos-brand grills; Lamplight Farms oil lamps, Tiki torches, and scented candles; and Lew's, Martin, Quantum, Van Staal, and Zebco fishing gear. The company's wares are sold to major retailers worldwide, including

   , and through its own web sites. The company also ran a PGA Tour Stop shop in Florida until 2013. Founded in 1885 by William C. Bradley, the company is run by the family's fourth generation; chairman Steve Butler is the nephew of Bradley's grandson.

  <p>
   Based in Columbus, Georgia, the company's operations have grown from its roots as a cotton factoring business to a global supplier of Char-Broil grills, oil lamps, and fishing gear, among other items. It operates in Europe through its 2012 purchase of Kriswell and sells branded grills in the US, Canada, Latin America, and Australia.

  <p>
   The W.C. Bradley business consists of Char-Broil L.L.C., Saber Grills LLC, W.C. Bradley/Zebco Holdings, Inc. (known as Zebco Brands), Lamplight Farms Incorporated, and W.C. Bradley Co. Real Estate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Char-Broil unit operates at W.C. Bradley headquarters. More Char-Broil gas grills are distributed nationwide than any other brand. W.C. Bradley sells the branded grills in the US, Canada, Latin America, and Australia. It also makes and markets outdoor cooking brands such as Oklahoma Joe's, New Braunfels Smoker Company, and Thermos. The Char-Broil brand is #1 in infrared technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zebco Holdings, Inc., is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where it manufactures fishing tackle and outdoor gear under the Zebco, Rhino, and Martin brands for recreational use. Brands the likes of Quantum, Fin-Nor, and Van Staal are targeted to avid reelers. Other labels include The Cajun Line, William Joseph, and Badlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   From its office in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Lamplight Farms offers outdoor torches, cintronella fuel, outdoor wax candles, indoor oil lamps, lamp oil, and related items. Its portfolio of brands include TIKI, Lamplight, Ultra-Pure, and Medallion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's namesake real estate business has worked to develop the Columbus, Georgia, area for the past 50 years. Real estate developments include the Maple Ridge Golf Community, Brookstone, Callaway Woods, Shoppes at Bradley Park, Brookstone Centre, Synovus Centre, and the Riverfront Building, as well as more recent work on transforming the Eagle &amp; Phenix cotton mill -- at the tune of $6.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   W.C. Bradley operated the 31,000-sq.-ft. PGA Tour Shop in St. Augustine, Florida, until 2013.

  <p>
   To give Saber Grills more elbow room to grow this upscale brand, W.C. Bradley established a stand-alone Saber Grills L.L.C. entity in 2011 outside the Char-Broil subsidiary. The premium line of grills are sold through independent outdoor retail chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   W.C. Bradley has been reorganizing its Char-Broil unit and shifted its grill production from an Ohio manufacturing plant to countries with cheaper labor after hearing from retail buyers that its US-made products were too expensive compared to Chinese-made grills. Besides moving its production overseas, W.C. Bradley is extending its reach abroad for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company shuttered its PGA Tour Stop store at the World Golf Village in 2013.

  <p>
   With an eye on expanding its global footprint, W.C. Bradley has made several purchases in recent years. Representing the first of several planned investments by Char-Broil, the company in 2012 acquired Kriswell A/S, a Danish company that markets charcoal barbecue products under the Dancook brand. As Northern Europe's largest maker of barbecues, Kriswell and its Dancook label enjoy a substantial distribution network throughout the continent. The company also exports its products to more than 25 countries. The acquisition underscores W.C. Bradley's move into infrared technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, the company's Zebco Brands subsidiary bought Zebco Sports Europe, one of Europe's oldest and most successful makers of fishing tackle. The 2011 move reunites two Zebco businesses and brands that were sold separately a decade earlier.
