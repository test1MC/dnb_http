   Herr Foods is your best friend when you've got the munchies. The snack food manufacturer, which celebrated 65 years in business in 2011, makes more than 340 different kinds of snack foods (all sold under the Herr's brand name). They include potato chips, pretzels, tortilla chips, cheese curls, corn chips, pita chips, popcorn, crackers, nuts, pork rinds, onion rings, and meat sticks. The snacks company distributes its food items to retail food outlets (including

    Kmart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54056">
    Giant Food Stores
   </company>
   ) in the US (primarily east of the Mississippi River), as well as in Canada, and Argentina. Herr Foods, which is also kosher certified, is run by chairman and CEO James M. Herr, son of company founder, James Stauffer Herr.

   To keep its snack menu and sales growing, Herr Foods employs a five-person research and development team. The team is joined by a representative from manufacturing and another from quality assurance. The R&amp;D team also receives input from the snack maker's marketing department. Currently, the company is focused on developing healthier snack products in response to consumer demand. As a result, Herr Foods has added more diverse oils to its portfolio, including sunflower oil, and moved to eliminate trans fats from its products. Baked Potato Crisps are among the company's "lighter" products.
