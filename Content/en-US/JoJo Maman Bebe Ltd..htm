   ? After working for several years in France, Laura Tenison returned to her home in the UK and founded JoJo Maman Bébé (JMB) in 1993, with the goal of giving women a more stylish alternative to frumpy maternity clothing. The company, which operates 30 high-street retail outlets, designs comfortable, expandable clothing ranging from casual pants and skirts for everyday wear to dresses and outfits for special occasions. It also offers maternity undergarments and tops for breastfeeding; a line of clothing for infants and children; and a range of baby toys, bath and travel gear, nursery decor, and car seats. JMB sells through print catalogs and online.

  <p>
   JMB has 70 stores in about 50 countries.

  <p>
   The South Wales headquarters of the multichannel baby, nursery, and maternity retailer houses the operations, accounts, and distribution teams. JMB focuses on clothing design, graphics, and marketing in its Battersea location.

  <p>
   In 2015 new stores and faster online sales led to a £7 million increase in JMB's revenues and more than doubling pre-tax profits. UK sales increased by more than £5 million to £36.4 million. International sales stood at £3.1 million.

  <p>
   In 2015 JMB opened new stores in Perth and in Truro.

   With its eye on catering to women with growing families, the company's primary customer is relatively affluent women between the ages of 25 and 43. As part of the retailer's strategy, the company lets each store retain its own identify, rather than creating a cookie-cutter mass-market consumer experience. To this end, each JMB location in the UK is run like an independent store.
