   and
   <company id="90092">
    Bunzl

   <company id="15745">
    Starbucks
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's

   To cut costs following its 2012 acquisition, Solo has sold some non-core assets. In 2014 a New York investor paid about $85 million for the 1.6 million-square-foot Solo Cup warehouse in south suburban University Park, Chicago. In 2013
   <company id="161815">
    STAG Industrial
   </company>
   bought the Solo Cup Distribution Center at 630 Hanover Pike in Hampstead, Maryland for $44 million.

   In 2012 Solo was acquired by rival
   <company id="40808">
    Dart Container
   </company>
   in a deal valued at $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the transaction, Dart paid $315 million in cash and assumed about $700 million of Solo's debt. The family owned and operated Dart continues to offer products under the Solo brand, including its popular red cups. The deal created an absolute juggernaut in its industry: before the deal, Dart already controlled about half of the global market in foam cups. Before being acquired by Dart, Solo was majority-owned by the family of its founder, Leo Hulseman. It was also a portfolio company of
   <company id="56734">
    Vestar Capital Partners
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Leo Hulseman founded the Paper Container Manufacturing Company in 1936. Ten years later the company renamed itself Solo Cup, after the cone-shaped paper cup that made it famous.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought and absorbed rival
   <company id="41568">
    SF Holdings
   </company>
   , parent company of disposable products maker
   <company id="112817">
    Sweetheart Holdings
   </company>
   , in 2004. By the end of 2006, however, the deal proved to be less than sweet. While the marriage of Solo and Sweetheart created a company with more than 30 manufacturing facilities in North America (including more than 20 from the Sweetheart side), Solo was unable in the early years of the merger to realize the cost savings that it had initially projected.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Sweetheart purchase was helped along by a $220 million investment in Solo from equity firm
   <company id="56734">
    Vestar Capital Partners
   </company>
   in exchange for a minority stake in the new company. Late in 2006, Vestar exercised its right -- linked to the company's ongoing weak financial performance -- to take over the Solo board. Therefore, while the founding Hulseman family still holds a majority ownership stake in the firm, it no longer maintains majority operating control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2007 the company sold six US factories for $130 million to reduce debt and subsequently leased back the plants for 20 years. As part of another cost-cutting effort, Solo sold Hoffmaster operations to private equity firm
   <company id="131641">
    Kohlberg &amp; Co.
   </company>
   for about $170 million. Hoffmaster makes tableware, such as place mats and napkins, primarily for hotels. Additional efforts to cut debt include the sale of its uncoated white paper place operations to AJM Packaging and the planned closure of two plants, one in Massachusetts and one in Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alliances with such organizations as the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) and the Keep America Beautiful effort have fueled the company's courtship of eco-conscious consumers. Solo n 2009 introduced compostable Bare-branded plates and cups, made from bio-based materials such as corn and sugarcane. In 2008 the company tied up with the
   <company id="53162">
    Sesame Workshop
   </company>
   to launch a line of kid-friendly paper plates, bowl, and cups, popular with parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manufacturing alliances and acquisitions, moreover, have helped to expand Solo Cup's broad array of offerings and ability to compete for a larger slice of the retail disposable market. In March 2010, Solo acquired Georgia-based InnoWare Plastic, a maker of take-out containers, from Minnesota-based Norwest Equity Partners. Solo made the acquisition via a $24 million stock-purchase agreement. The new line, sold under Solo's Creative Carryouts brand, strengthened its product portfolio offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solo's concentration in the US foodservice market, however, exposed the company to downturns in consumer spending crimped by a sluggish economy. Despite posting gradual bumps in revenue, Solo wasn't profitable for four straight years (2008 to 2011). Specifically, the company suffered around $100 million in net losses for both 2010 and 2011. It was stung mostly by the high costs involved in manufacturing its products, an increase in raw material costs, an asset impairment charge, and mounting interest expenses that has eaten into its gross profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response, in 2011 the company sold off its Springfield, Missouri manufacturing facility and also closed plants in Maryland and Massachusetts. The move followed cutbacks in 2009 in Solo's corporate workforce (amounting to less than 10%) and the closure of an Illinois manufacturing facility. The company also consolidated its headquarters from three buildings to one.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2012, Solo was acquired by its largest competitor,
   <company id="40808">
    Dart Container
   </company>
   , in a deal valued at around $1 billion.
