   Sargento Foods may be the biggest Cheesehead in Wisconsin. The company is one of the largest cheese manufacturers in the US, offering a variety of block cheese and such value-added products as shredded cheese blends and sliced cheeses for sandwiches. Sargento Foods markets its products through supermarkets and other retail grocery stores nationwide. The manufacturer is also a leading supplier of custom cheese products to restaurants and other food service operators; its food ingredients division makes cheese items for other food manufacturers. The family-owned business was started in 1953 by Leonard Gentine Sr. and his business partner Joseph Sartori.

   trough new product releases designed to meet changing consumer needs. Recent innovations include a line of ultra thin slices with only 40 to 45 calories per slice.
