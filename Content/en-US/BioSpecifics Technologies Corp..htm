   BioSpecifics Technologies specifically uses collagenase (an enzyme that breaks the bonds of collagen) to treat a variety of skin-thickening diseases and conditions. Its current product, named Xiaflex, is an injectable collagenase that treats Dupuytren's disease (marketed) and is being tested for Peyronie's disease, frozen shoulder, and cellulite. The company is working with
   <company id="108854">
    Auxilium Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   on these indications. On its own, BioSpecifics is also testing a collagenase treatment for human and canine lipoma (benign fatty tumor). The company was formed in 1990 to make a topical collagenase for burns and skin ulcers; it sold that business in 2006 but still received payments until 2013.

  <p>
   The company's agreement with DFB, the company that bought its topical business, expired in 2013 but it may still collect royalties if the treatment is used for new indications.
  </p>
  <p>
   BioSpecifics' other source of revenue is from its agreement with Auxilium from which it receives sublicense, royalty, milestone, and mark-up payments. Xiaflex is approved in the US and Auxilium has the rights to sell it in Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Mexico for Dupuytren's contracture once it's approved.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clinical trials for using Xiaflex to treat lipoma are in the early stages.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company and
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   dissolved their agreement for Pfizer to commercialize Xiaflex for Dupuytren's disease in Europe.

  <p>
   BioSpecifics reported a 2% decline in revenue for 2012 due to a decline in licensing revenue though there was an increase in net sales of Xiaflex. Net income dropped 55% as R&amp;D expenses rose as the company worked to develop Xiaflex for lipoma. Investing and financing activities took a bite out of cash flow, dropping it about 30%.

  <p>
   The company will continue to develop Xiaflex for Peyronie's disease, frozen shoulder, cellulite, and lipomas while looking for additional indications where the drug would be useful. It will also continue to seek marketing and distribution partners, especially in Europe.
