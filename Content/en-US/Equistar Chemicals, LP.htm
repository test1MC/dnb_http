   Someone's got to build the building blocks: Equistar Chemicals, a subsidiary of
   <company id="106018">
    LyondellBasell
   </company>
   , does that by manufacturing chemical building blocks. Its primary product is ethylene, which is the world's most-used petrochemical and the basis for any number of other chemicals, plastics, and synthetics. Among the company's other products are propylene, butadiene, polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, benzene, and toluene. Polyethylene is used in plastic bags and bottles; polypropylene is used in plastic caps, rigid packaging, automotive components, and carpet.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates about a dozen manufacturing plants in Texas; two each in Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio; and one each in Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, and Tennessee.

  <p>
   Equistar is one of the largest producers of ethylene, propylene, and polyethylene in North America and a top producer of ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, high value-added specialty polymers and polymeric powder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Equistar's pipeline group operates 1,400 miles of pipeline in Texas and Louisiana, and ships 20 billion pounds of product and 80 million barrels of feedstock a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates a styrene maleic anhydride unit and a polybutadiene unit, both owned by an unrelated party. Its petrochemical  plant consists of a butadiene production unit, and an aromatics unit.

  <p>
   Equistar's products are used to manufacture a range of products including automotive components, biofuels, construction materials, durable textiles, fresh food packaging, lightweight plastics, medical applications, and personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company ships its feedstocks and refined petrochemicals products via railcar and truck.

  <p>
   Equistar is a part of
   <company id="113875">
    LyondellBasell
   </company>
   's Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment, which accounted for 30% of the parent company's revenues in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas Segment's revenues increased by 2% in 2013 due to higher olefins sales volumes, particularly of propylene and butadiene, partly offset by a 1% revenues decrease caused by lower prices. Polyethylene sales prices were higher in 2013, reflecting supply constraints due to competitor outages, while increases in the cost of propylene feedstock led to higher polypropylene prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olefins results in 2013 benefited from lower ethylene production costs and higher sales volumes. Polyethylene results also improved on higher margins; polypropylene results declined on lower margins.

  <p>
   Growing its infrastructure, in 2011 Equistar bought about 200 miles of pipeline near Houston from
   <company id="58872">
    BP Plc.
   </company>
   The pipelines and metering stations include an olefins distribution system that transports ethylene and propylene to an Equistar storage terminal and other facilities in the Bayport Industrial District in Pasadena, Texas. The purchase also includes a natural gas liquids feedstock supply line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its US operations were a part of LyondellBasell's successful Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. As a part of its parent's bankruptcy case, Equistar idled its Chocolate Bayou olefin plant near Alvin, Texas, and its ethylene glycol plant in Beaumont. Both actions met the approval of the bankruptcy court. Equistar emerged from bankruptcy along with its parent company in 2010.
