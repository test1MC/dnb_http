   Nikon's focus extends far wider than most consumers would believe. Though well-known for its cameras, lenses, and other consumer imaging products, Nikon vies with national rival

   to be the world's top producer of photolithography steppers, which is the crucial equipment used to etch circuitry onto semiconductor wafers and LCD panels (the Precision Equipment division). The company's Instruments unit makes surveying instruments, microscopes, and measuring instruments. Other products include ophthalmic lenses, optical equipment, and thin film coatings. Founded in 1917, Nikon is part of the huge

  <p>
   The company's revenue decreased by 13% to Â¥857.8 billion in 2015 (ended March) primarily due to a 15% decline in Imaging Products and a 17% dip in Precision Equipment sales as a result of a downturn in the overall market. All its targeted regions experienced declines in 2015, including Japan (19%), China (15%), Europe (16%), and the US (10%). In addition to the dip in sales, Nikon's net income decreased by 61% in 2015 due to the lower revenue coupled with a surge in impairment losses.

   The company focuses on growth through a portfolio of six businesses: semiconductor lithography, FPD lithography, imaging products, microscope solutions, industrial metrology, and medical.

  <p>
   It plans to generate additional cash by both expanding sales and reducing costs for semiconductor lithography, FPD lithography, imaging products. Nikon expects future growth within the other spheres by investing heavily and setting aggressive sales goals throughout the years ahead.

   Lensmaker Nippon Kogaku KK formed in 1917 with the merger of three large Japanese optical glassmakers. Nippon Kogaku started selling binoculars in 1921; the company introduced its first microscope four years later. Its range of products offers a snapshot of the optical world. Its cameras have caught images from every manned space flight since
   <em>
    Apollo 13
   </em>
   . Its microscopes are used in schools and cell biology research laboratories, and its eye examination equipment and prescription glasses and sunglasses are fixtures in opticians' offices worldwide.
