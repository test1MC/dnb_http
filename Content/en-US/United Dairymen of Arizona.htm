   Its name says it all: United Dairymen of Arizona (UDA) is a group of Arizona-based dairy farmers united together to stabilize and strengthen the market for milk products. Supplied by some 90-member producers, the cooperative's plant has the capacity to process 10 million pounds of milk per day, about 90% of the milk in the state. Products include sweet cream and butter, fluid and condensed skim milk, and non-fat dry milk, among others. Customers include onsite cheese maker

   , fluid milk processors, and supermarket chains throughout The Grand Canyon State. UDA also makes dried lactose powder for food manufacturers. Started in 1960, the co-op was formed through a merger of two dairy associations.

  <p>
   Based in Arizona, United Dairymen of Arizona serves other companies in the state as well as the US kosher niche. It exports products overseas.

  <p>
   UDA's Arizona-based manufacturing plant operates around the clock, often serving as a balancing plant for other area processors. Its capacity handles a broad line of milk products, shifting milk production according to dairy supply and market demand. The plant is the nation's largest supervised kosher milk facility with a weekly production capacity of more than 500 metric tons of kosher powder. UDA also produces blended dry products as part of a joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   UDA's operations include providing emergency repair, preventative maintenance, installation, and transportation services, and related supplies to members. Since 2007, the co-op's service and supply division share a facility in Texas, too.

  <p>
   While UDA's business is concentrated in Arizona, its member interests cross both eastern California and Texas. Beyond the US, UDA has benefited from export assistance to sell cheese to customers in Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. As a member of DairyAmerica (which is controlled by
   <company id="47617">
    California Dairies
   </company>
   ), UDA further extends its international reach by selling non-fat dry milk, skim milk powder, and other products on the auction block known as GlobalDairyTrade, developed by

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The only milk marketing co-op in Arizona, UDA is focused on improving production, processing, and marketing opportunities for member-producers. To that end, it strategically joins with other daily cooperatives to expand global trade of dairy products and promote legislation that addresses issues such as surplus of milk, low prices, and volatile markets.

  <p>
   To its benefit, UDA enjoys long-term relationships with fluid milk processors, which enables it to rely on a steady market for about 30% of its fluid milk. Schreiber Foods, based in Tempe, Arizona, buys another 30% of its products.
