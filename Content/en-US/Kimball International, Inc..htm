   A manager at a furniture mill in Jasper, Indiana, Arnold Habig had a hankering to start his own company. In 1950 he led a group of investors (including co-worker Herb Thyen) in a takeover of struggling cabinet maker Midwest Manufacturing. They renamed the company Jasper. During the 1950s the firm began to vertically integrate, acquiring wood and lumber mills. Diversifying, in 1959 Jasper bought W. W. Kimball Piano and Organ Co., a piano maker established in 1857. Jasper bought Vienna-based piano maker Boesendorfer in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the early 1970s demand for television cabinets had declined, compelling Jasper to shift its focus to other types of furniture. The firm changed its name to Kimball International in 1974 and went public two years later. In the 1980s the firm began making furniture for the health care and lodging industries. Kimball stopped making organs in 1985 and focused instead on electrical components for the auto, computer, and telecommunications industries.

   In 1992 the company acquired Harpers Manufacturing, a metal furniture manufacturer. In 1996 Kimball management halted production of its namesake piano due to long-term market decline. CEO Douglas Habig (Arnold's son) was named chairman the following year, succeeding his brother Thomas.

   Kimball nearly doubled its timber holdings to 27,000 acres in 1998 by purchasing a forest in Kentucky, and it bought panel system maker Transwall. A year later the company bought Florida-based store display fixture maker Southeast Millworks, renaming it Kimball Store Fixtures. Also in 1999 Kimball sold its faux period furniture manufacturer unit and ToolPro, a maker of cutting tools.
  </p>

   Arnold and Herb died in March 1999 at ages 91 and 86, respectively. In 2000 Kimball expanded its commercial furniture operations by acquiring Jackson of Danville, a maker of custom seating and chairs for hotels and hospitals. Kimball exited the music business in 2002 when it sold its Austrian-based Boesendorfer piano subsidiary to Austrian bank Bawag-P.S.K. Also that year, citing slow demand for durable goods, the company began consolidating its operations, closing unprofitable businesses, and laying off nearly 2,000 employees by the end of the following year. It exited the branded residential furniture business, which had been incurring losses due to the bankruptcy of a customer, in fiscal 2005.
