   Blowing up plastic shapes is good business for Western Industries, a custom blow molder and a supplier of engineered products and services to OEMs and retailers. It has two main business groups: Plastics Products makes a variety of blow-molded products such as pylons, ramps/stairs, portable outhouses, tanks, containers, tool sheds, and large flat panels; Engineered Products makes fabricated metal sub assemblies and components such as cook tops, ventilators, lighting, pedestals, and other appliance components, as well as industrial, construction, and agricultural assemblies and enclosures. Founded in 1944, the company has several manufacturing facilities in the Midwest.

  <p>
   The Plastic Products Group uses the blow molding process to create objects that are both strong and lightweight by inflating soft plastic with air to create durable and corrosion-resistant products. The manufacturing time is shorter for this process than with other plastic fabrication methods, so output is increased.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineered Products Group serves its customers both in the industrial and consumer market segments with large household appliance products and other complex welded assemblies, such as generator enclosures, tractor support assemblies, and grill screens, to name a few.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's engineers support clients with custom design and manufacturing services. Western Industries' value-added services include complete assemblies, supply chain management, finishing capabilities, robotic and manual welding, cost reduction programs for existing parts and tools, special shipping, and special handling requirements.
