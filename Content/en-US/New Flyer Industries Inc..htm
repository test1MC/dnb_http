   New Flyer Industries isn't just some token transit bus maker. The company is one of North America's largest bus manufacturers and suppliers of aftermarket parts and services. In addition to diesel bus manufacturing, New Flyer's lineup offers alternative fuel propulsion systems, such as diesel electric or gasoline-electric, compressed natural gas or liquid natural gas, zero-emission electric trolleys, and hydrogen fuel cell power. Its core customers are municipal and other local transit authorities in Canada and the US, including the
   <company id="111251">
    NYC Transit Authority
   </company>
   . New Flyer operates mainly in Manitoba and Minnesota and nets about 90% of sales in the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   New Flyer maintains manufacturing facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Crookston, Minnesota; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Pembina, North Dakota; and Anniston, Alabama, with sales and service throughout Canada and the US. The company generates 90% of its sales from the US; Canada accounts for the remainder.

  <p>
   New Flyer operates in two segments: bus and coach manufacturing (79% of sales in 2015) and aftermarket operations (21%). Bus and coach offers heavy-duty transit buses (30-feet to 60-feet in length) and motor coaches (40-foot and 45-foot lengths) as well as rapid transit vehicles, electric trolleys, hydrogen fuel cell and battery-electric propulsion system buses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its aftermarket operations include parts distribution, field services, support documentation, telematics, and remote diagnostics and training. It also includes commercial repair work on buses and coaches at service centers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  New Flyer's primary customers include private tour and charter operators, inter-city line-haul operators, private and public fleet operators, and municipal and other local transit agencies. It has active business relationships (which include the sale of parts) with approximately 400 transit authorities in Canada and the US.
  <p>
   The company sells its products primarily through an internal sales force and through using both new coach and pre-owned coach sales representatives. In addition, the company has distribution or dealer agreements with certain parties to sell and support its Xcelsior and MiDi buses to private and certain public customers. New Flyer's aftermarket parts sales are primarily driven by customer requests for parts quotation and sent directly or placed in the public domain via the Internet.

  <p>
   New Flyer achieved unprecedented growth in 2015, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $1.54 billion and profits reaching $54 million, another company milestone. Its cash from operations, however, dipped by 7% in 2015 due to unfavorable changes in income taxes paid.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth was fueled by a 7% bump in manufacturing sales, related to higher bus and coach deliveries mainly as a result of new coach inventory gained from a previous acquisition. New Flyer was also helped by a 1% jump in aftermarket sales during 2015.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have helped to enhance the benefits of the company's products to existing and new customers. In 2015 the company acquired

    Motor Coach Industries International
   </company>
   (MCI), one of North America's leading manufacturers of intercity coaches serving charter and tour operators, line-haul and scheduled-service operators, transit agencies, and conversion companies. With the acquisition (worth $455 million), New Flyer expanded its service to the private market as well as diversified its product offerings and customer base.
