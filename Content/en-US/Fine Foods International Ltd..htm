   FFI specializes in making and marketing soluble coffee in granulated form, a Brit favorite. To this end, its plant located just north of London in the town of Dunstable is where it focuses its production efforts. FFI has access to more than half a dozen plants companywide through its parent. In turn, FFI offers its parent distribution across the UK and the US.
