   It was the 1980s: the late Robin Williams wore rainbow suspenders, a youg Tom Hanks donned a dress, and if you were hot, you had The Jordache Look. Fast-forward to today, Jordache Enterprises offers jeans, apparel, and accessories primarily for 20-somethings, mostly through decidedly non-designer retailers such as

   . It also licenses the Jordache name for eyewear and luggage. Jordache distributes apparel under owned brands Jordache, KIKIT, Dittos, Gasoline, LoveLola, GAS, and XOXO. The company's premium Jordache Vintage line is sold at specialty stores.

   Owning its own apparel manufacturing plants has enabled Jordache to extend the reach of its business to private labeling for others. The move, too, allows Jordache to diversify its revenue streams.

   The company was founded in 1979 by brothers and Israeli immigrants Joe, Ralph, and Avi Nakash. (A New York City store owned by the brothers was burned and looted in 1977; insurance money funded the launch of Jordache).
