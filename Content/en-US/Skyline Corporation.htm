   Skyline's idea of a beautiful skyline would probably include several rows of double-wides. The company and its subsidiaries design and make manufactured homes. It distributes them to independent dealers and manufactured housing communities throughout the US and Canada. About half of Skyline's revenues come from selling HUD-code manufactured homes (products built according to

   standards); the rest of its typically two- to four-bedroom homes are modular in design.

   Julius Decio started Skyline Coach in 1951 in a friend's welding garage. At first the company made mobile homes, but by 1959 it was also producing travel trailers and recreational vehicles (RVs). Skyline went public in 1960. Two years later it acquired Homette and Layton Homes, and in 1963 it bought Buddy Mobile Homes. The company changed its name to Skyline Corporation and acquired Academy Mobile Homes in 1966. It purchased Country Vans Conversion in 1978.

   Skyline's manufactured home sales increased during the 1990s, but they failed to keep pace with industrywide growth. The company's market share faded. Blaming the loss of market share on a lack of dealers in high-growth regions, in 1995 Skyline made plans to increase production, expand its product line, and boost market penetration. Product lines in 1997 stressed luxury features such as solid-oak cabinets and cedar-lined wardrobes. Harsh winter weather lowered sales that year. A long-reaching industrywide recession, which continued into 2004, began during that time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although RV sales -- especially fifth-wheel and truck camper sales -- dropped in fiscal 1998, sales of higher-priced multi-section homes increased. By 2000 rising interest rates and inventories were contributing to industrywide declines: That year Skyline's RV sales fell nearly 25% and its manufactured homes sales were off by more than 15%. Sales of manufactured homes dropped again in fiscal 2001 by 20%. The company's sales continued to drop in 2002 although its operating income increased by about 10%, due in part to increased RV sales and containment of operating costs. The next year saw more declines for Skyline. By 2004 the manufactured housing industry hit its lowest level in more than a dozen years. Restrictive retail financing, global tensions, and uncertain economic conditions were primary factors that contributed to the recession.
  </p>

   In 2004 Skyline moved to expand its product offerings by gaining approval to produce modular homes at 12 of its manufactured housing facilities. The company also began to reposition its RV segment to accommodate a shift in consumer demand for towable RVs.
