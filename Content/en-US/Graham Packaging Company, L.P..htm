   Graham's earnings are impacted most significantly by the swing in availability and price of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) -- core materials used in manufacturing packaging. Although an increase in their costs can be difficult to pass on to established customers, extended-period contracts typically call for a decrease to be reflected in lower prices, and consequently depress net sales when volumes are flat. A dip in sales and earnings can also be tied to unfavorable exchanges rates.

  <p>
   Graham Packaging has 93 facilities in 17 countries, about a third are located on-site at its customers' plants. It has 69 plants in North America, 14 in Europe, eight in South America, and two in Asia. The US accounts for about 75% of sales.

   Financial Performance
  </p>
  <p>
   Graham operates as part of Reynolds Group Holdings and contributes about 22% of its parent's revenue. For 2013 Graham reported a 1% drop in revenue, from $3.05 billion to $3.02 billion, as demand for consumer goods were soft. Strong sales in emerging markets helped make up for some of the softness.

  <p>
   Rolling forward, Graham is targeting end markets where it can capitalize on the conversion of metal, glass, and paperboard packaging to plastic. Industries in food and beverage, and household goods lead in packaging makeovers that aim to differentiate their products from those of rivals as well as reduce their weight (to trim transportation costs). The company generates approximately 80% of its revenues from the intensely competitive food and beverage, and household goods packaging segments, where the bottle is sometimes more important than what is in it.

  <p>
   Although Graham is well-established in North America, it has accelerated its presence in Europe, South America, and Asia, regions that are picking up their repackaging pace. One-third of the company's manufacturing facilities now operate outside of the US though a majority of its sales still happen at home. In 2014 it closed a Chicago manufacturing plant and said it would consolidate its operations in other facilities. About 170 people were laid off.
