   CareFusion cares about eliminating human error and infection in hospital settings. The company sells medical equipment -- infusion and respiratory ventilation systems -- and accompanying disposables for infection prevention. Its Pyxis automated medication dispensing units cut down on clinician error when dealing with patients in critical care settings. Its Alaris infusion products include software to reduce IV medication errors. The company also makes AVEA respiratory ventilation devices, SensorMedics pulmonary care products, and V. Mueller surgical instruments. Other products and software help prevent the spread of hospital-acquired infections. Medical equipment maker
   <company id="10195">
    Becton, Dickinson
   </company>
   bought CareFusion in 2015.

   After being acquired by
   <company id="10195">
    Becton, Dickinson
   </company>
   (BD), CareFusion terminated its listing on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   . The $12.2 billion acquisition broadened Becton, Dickinson's business as a provider of medical equipment to hospitals. CareFusion now operates as part of BD's Medical segment.

  <p>
   In early 2015 CareFusion was acquired by fellow medical equipment maker
   <company id="10195">
    Becton, Dickinson
   </company>
   (BD). The move gave CareFusion access to BD's established global distribution system. It also helped BD reach its goal of becoming more customer-focused.
  </p>
  <p>
   CareFusion's growth has been built upon new product introductions and enhancements, as well as acquisitions. At the same time, the company has tidied up its operations in recent years through cost-reduction and restructuring efforts, shedding a handful of businesses.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired Surgical Site Solutions, expanding its surgical clipper portfolio by adding the ClipVac pre-surgical hair removal system.

  <p>
   The business that eventually became CareFusion was built up through a series of acquisitions. In 2007 former parent
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   spent about $1.5 billion on medical equipment manufacturer
   <company id="103825">
    VIASYS Healthcare
   </company>
   . The acquisition added specialized equipment including ventilators, patient monitoring systems, medical disposables, and imaging components. It also expanded the company's customer base to include VIASYS's international presence in 100 countries outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Cardinal Health acquired private health care firm Enturia, maker of the ChloraPrep brand line of skin disinfectant products, for $490 million. When it came time to create CareFusion, these and other manufacturing operations were rolled together under one company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former parent Cardinal Health spun off CareFusion into a separate, publicly traded company in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   A top US distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, Cardinal Health distributed 81% of CareFusion's stock to its existing shareholders in mid-2009. It then sold the remaining 19% stake in CareFusion to
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   for $706 million in 2010. By spinning off the medical equipment manufacturing business Cardinal Health allowed each company to focus on independent goals for growth and delivered shareholder value.
  </p>
  <p>
   CareFusion's first acquisition following independence was the purchase of
   <company id="124571">
    Medegen
   </company>
   in 2010. The $225 million deal helped to expand its range of needleless IV disposable products with valve technology to help prevent bloodstream infections.
  </p>
  <p>
   After its first year of independence, CareFusion set to tidying up with a bit of cost reduction and restructuring efforts. To better focus on equipment manufacturing it sold off its research services division to
   <company id="52759">
    eResearchTechnology
   </company>
   in 2010 for about $81 million. The division provided respiratory diagnostic services for electronically gathered cardiac-safety and patient-reported data.
