   MedImmune works to boost the immune systems of babies and grown-ups. Its flagship biotech product, Synagis, prevents respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of pneumonia and other respiratory disease in infants and children. Also on the market are FluMist, its nasal spray flu vaccine, and Ethyol (amifostine), which treats side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. The company is working on dozens of investigational therapies -- including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and small molecule drugs -- in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune and respiratory conditions. MedImmune is a subsidiary of UK-based pharmaceutical giant

  <p>
   Former Walter Reed Army Hospital doctors Wayne Hockmeyer and Franklin Top (chairman and former EVP and medical director, respectively) formed MedImmune in 1988. The firm targeted well-understood diseases and gathered funding through strategic alliances, including a 1990 R&amp;D agreement with Canadian vaccine maker Connaught Laboratories to develop vaccines for hepatitis B and Lyme disease. The next year CytoGam was approved, and the company went public. MedImmune's stock climbed in 1993, fueled by expectations that RespiGam would receive quick FDA approval. When the FDA, citing errors in the human trials, failed to approve the drug, MedImmune's stock sank, which derailed the company's purchase of Melville Biologics.
  </p>
  <p>
   RespiGam was finally approved in 1996. That year the firm began working on a pneumonia vaccine with Rockefeller University, using the school's proprietary methodology to uncover genes critical to bacteria replication. Though the company still hadn't made money, sales and the number of drugs in development were increasing. In 1997 MedImmune inked a deal with
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   to market Synagis, and CytoGam was cleared for marketing in Canada, Mexico, and Poland. The growing company also completed a manufacturing plant in Frederick, Maryland. The next year it teamed with biotech giant
   <company id="12972">
    Chiron
   </company>
   on vaccines.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 Synagis had nearly saturated the US market, and the drug's seasonality (it is used mostly in the winter) and slow growth in Europe prompted the company to look for new products. That year MedImmune moved into the oncology market when it bought U.S. Bioscience, which had a marketing deal with
   <company id="11677">
    ALZA
   </company>
   for its flagship drug, Ethyol (the company reacquired marketing rights in late 2001). The firm also sought new drug candidates through inlicensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost flagging revenues, MedImmune in 2000 licensed its streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine technology to
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   and sold Hexalen, its treatment for ovarian cancer, to
   <company id="14154">
    MGI PHARMA
   </company>
   (which was later acquired by
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai Co.
   </company>
   ). Its 2002 purchase of
   <company id="51397">
    Aviron
   </company>
   expanded the company's vaccine pipeline and brought FluMist into its fold. An agreement with
   <company id="10093">
    Wyeth
   </company>
   (which later became part of
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ) to co-promote FluMist ended in 2004, following disappointing sales of the product.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 MedImmune acquired privately-held drug maker Cellective Therapeutics, adding three preclinical-stage therapies that regulate the immune system.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold CytoGam, which treats cytomegalovirus in organ transplant patients, to
   <company id="48079">
    CSL Behring
   </company>
   in 2006. Also that year MedImmune began promoting Synagis domestically on its own; the drug had previously been promoted by Ross Products, a division of
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 MedImmune attracted the attention of UK drugmarket AstraZeneca. The global pharma firm acquired MedImmune for some $15 billion that year to expand in the biotech and vaccines arenas. Following the purchase, AstraZeneca merged a previous purchase,
   <company id="61777">
    Cambridge Antibody Technologies
   </company>
   , into MedImmune and changed the entity's name from MedImmune, Inc. to MedImmune L.L.C.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of FluMist doubled in 2008 after the company worked to address certain problems that had plagued the drug in previous years, including distribution difficulties and a limited target audience. Additionally, it received a boost when the
   <company id="104757">
    CDC
   </company>
   announced new recommendations that all children ages 2 to 18 receive a flu vaccine. Sales of Ethyol slowed in 2008 on the entry of generic versions of the drug into the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company received contracts totaling over $450 million from the HHS to develop and produce an H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine using its nasal technology. The product was swiftly approved by the FDA during the swine flu outbreak, with distribution of the vaccine beginning shortly thereafter.
