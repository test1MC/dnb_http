   GCP Applied Technologies graced the world as a brand new publicly traded company in 2016 as the result of the spin-off of
   <company id="11592">
    W. R. Grace &amp; Co.

   's (Grace) construction products and packaging technologies businesses. Grace spun off its Grace Construction Products segment (which makes concrete and cement products, including specialty construction chemicals and specialty building materials) and its Darex Packaging business as GCP Applied Technologies. The separation was made by Grace to create value for shareholders and sharpen its strategic focus on its customers. In 2017
