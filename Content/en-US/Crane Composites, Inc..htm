   <company id="10415">
    Crane Co.

   , the company manufactures fiberglass-reinforced plastics to replace traditional metals and woods for applications including containers, building products like wall and ceiling tiles, and for sidewalls and roofs of truck trailers and recreational vehicles. Crane Composites sells directly to truck trailer and recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturers, but uses distributors for its construction markets.

  <p>
   There are separate financials for the company. However, the parent company reported that Engineered Materials segment sales (which accounted for 9% of Crane Co.'s revenues in 2013) increased by 7% that year, reflecting higher sales to RV makers, partially offset by lower sales to its transportation-related, non-US, and building product customers.

  <p>
   The demand for Crane Composites' products is closely tied to the fluctuating conditions within the transportation industry. In 2012 the company shut down production at its UK-based Alton manufacturing plant due to slump in demand in Europe stemming from weaker economic conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the innovation front, in 2013 the company launched a fiberglass reinforced panel line for cleanroom applications requiring "cleanability", low particle emission, biological resistance, and chemical resistance.
