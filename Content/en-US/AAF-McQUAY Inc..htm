   Daikin has big ambitions to become the top air conditioning, heating, and ventilation company in the world. AAF-McQUAY is part of its parent's larger goals of doubling sales by 2015. In order to get there, the company has made investments to improve facilities and drive innovation and sales. In late 2014, Daikin announced plans to push its
   <company id="40983">
    Goodman
   </company>
   brand (acquired in 2012) to expand sales in North America, utilizing Goodman's sales network to introduce Daikin's superior-efficiency ductless air conditioners.

   To cut manufacturing costs, the company in 2013 announced a restructuring effort to increase high-end product manufacturing operations and make its supply chain operations more efficient. The program included the construction of a new R&amp;D center near its headquarters, as well as the closure of an Indiana manufacturing plant (balanced by expansions at other regional plants).

   In mid-2013, the company's AAF International division began growing its Asian filtration business by investing in facility expansion efforts in China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.

   Reflecting its focus on production growth in Asia, AAF acquired Thailand-based filter distributor Chaimitr Engineering in 2013. The purchase established AAF as a leading filter provider in the country and other areas of southeast Asia.
