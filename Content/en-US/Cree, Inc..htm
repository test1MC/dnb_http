   Cree has its name in lights. Its blue, green, and near-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) -- made from silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) -- are used in dashboard lights, architectural light fixtures, market tickers, and video screens. Cree also sells SiC wafers, which work better at higher temperatures and voltages than other silicon devices, and SiC and GaN materials. In addition, it offers lighting systems (both LED and traditional), as well as power and radio-frequency (RF) products such as Schottky diodes and transistors. The company makes most of its products at plants in the US (North Carolina, Wisconsin) and China. More than 50% of sales come from outside the US.

  <p>
   LED products (chips, components, and SiC wafers) account for about 37% of Cree's sales, but that's down from about 50% in previous years. The lighting systems segment grew to about 55% of sales in 2015 (ended June), a 28% increase from 2014. Power and RF products round out the company's segments with 8% of sales.

  <p>
   The US is Cree's largest geographic market and its impact has increased substantially, having grown from less than 20% of sales in fiscal 2010 to 57% in 2015. The China has declined to account for just 21%; all Asian countries together represent about 28% of total revenue.

  <p>
   More than 50% of Cree's sales are made to distributors; in 2015
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   accounted for 12% and 11% of total sales, respectively.

  <p>
   After several years of steady growth, Cree's revenue stepped back 1% in 2015 (ended June) to $1.6 billion from 2014. A sharp 28% decline in LED product sales outweighed strong revenue growth from lighting products, 28% higher, and power and RF products, 15% higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cree posted a loss of $64 million in 2015, a turnaround from a $124 million profit in 2014. The loss was blamed on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets. Cash flow from operations fell to $181 million in 2015 from $319 million in 2014.

   Cree created the first blue LED, which, when combined with red and yellow LEDs, creates a full spectrum of colors. The technology has become an industry standard and expands the applications of LED lighting. To leverage this core technology, Cree has introduced the XLamp family of high-power packaged LEDs for specialty lighting applications, hoping to stay one step ahead of the competition. Cree's XLamp products have a wide array of residential and commercial uses, including appliance lighting and reading lamps, as well as backlighting for large flat-panel and retail displays.

   The trends towards increased energy-efficient and environmental lighting, and the growing number of standard lighting products that use LEDs, have helped Cree weather a challenging economic environment better than many in the electronics industry. The company has combined external acquisitions and internal R&amp;D to broaden its offerings -- and increase its sales and market reach -- into LED lighting fixtures, power switching, and RF products.

   In 2015 Cree announced it would spin off the Power and RF segment, named Wolfspeed, into a public company. In 2016, however, it sold the unit to Infineon for $850 million. The move unlocked the value of the unit for Cree

   In 2015 Cree bought Arkansas Power Electronics International Inc., a maker of power modules and power electronics applications, for  $13.8 million. APEI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cree and was renamed Cree Fayetteville.

  <p>
   Cree started at
   <company id="118153">
    North Carolina State University
   </company>
   , where brothers Eric and Neal Hunter and Calvin Carter researched silicon carbide (SiC) applications, in part with US government funding. In 1987 the trio founded Cree Research to continue their research. The company shipped its first-to-market blue light-emitting diode (LED) in 1991, and went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company began developing blue lasers -- a project that continued for years to follow -- via a 1999 pact with
   <company id="52223">
    Microvision
   </company>
   . Also that year Cree and
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   formed a development and manufacturing agreement for blue and green LEDs. In 1997 Cree began supplying SiC crystals to gemstone manufacturer C3.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cree in 1998 signed or extended pacts with
   <company id="47323">
    Kansai Electric Power
   </company>
   , Siemens, and Asea Brown Boveri (now
   <company id="40615">
    ABB Ltd.
   </company>
   ). The next year the company shortened its name to Cree, Inc., and released its first radio-frequency transistor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Cree acquired semiconductor R&amp;D boutique Nitres for $233 million and, to close out the year, purchased the UltraRF division of
   <company id="42206">
    Spectrian
   </company>
   (a maker of linear power amplifiers) for $113.5 million. (It later renamed the unit Cree Microwave.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Cree acquired the gallium nitride substrate and epitaxy assets of Advanced Technology Materials, a subsidiary of
   <company id="16681">
    ATMI
   </company>
   , for about $10 million, boosting its materials business and IP portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-founder Neal Hunter, who served as CEO of Cree from 1994 to 2001, resigned as chairman in 2005 after a decade in that post, and left the company's board of directors. Charles Swoboda, who had succeeded Hunter as CEO in 2001, succeeded him as chairman, as well.
