   IntriCon hears its future calling, and that future is in precision microminiature components and molded plastic parts, such as volume controls and switches, primarily used in hearing aids. IntriCon's components are also used in professional audio equipment, such as headsets and microphones, and in biotelemetry devices for such uses as diagnostic monitoring and drug delivery. The company has concentrated its product portfolio on what it terms "body-worn devices" through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, including the 2010 sale of its RTI Electronics business line to Shackleton Equity Partners.

  <p>
   About 70% of IntriCon's sales come from the US.

  <p>
   IntriCon's annual revenue and net income have been wildly inconsistent. The company's revenue decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous fiscal period. It reported $53 million in revenue for revenue in fiscal 2013, down from the $63.9 million IntriCon claimed in revenue for fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   IntriCon's net income dropped from a profit of $700,000 in fiscal 2012 to a net loss of more than $6 in fiscal 2013. However, the company's cash on hand actually increased year-over-year.

  <p>
   The focus for IntriCon includes expanding operations at its Asian manufacturing facilities, securing additional supply agreements with health care firms, and continuing to enhance current products while developing new technologies. The company is also looking to drive efficiencies that will enable it to return to profitability.
