   Martin-Baker Aircraft can help you keep your seat when your plane is going down in flames. The company's ejection seats are used in such notable jet aircraft as the Gripen, Eurofighter, and Joint Strike Fighter (officially named Lightning II). Martin-Baker also makes "crashworthy" seats designed to absorb crash impact and integrates safety equipment such as oxygen systems and survival kits into its seats. Other offerings include automatic inflation products, specialist survival equipment, and spacecraft entry, descent, escape, and recovery systems. The Martin family continues to run the business.

   Martin-Baker has produced over 75,000 seats to date, saving over 7,400 aircrews and equipped over 200 different aircraft around the world. The company has expanded its crash-worthy seating concept to other vehicles. It has developed "mine-proof" seats used in troop carrying vehicles. The seats are based on the firm's helicopter seats which are also designed to protect against a variety of life threatening projectiles and crashes.
