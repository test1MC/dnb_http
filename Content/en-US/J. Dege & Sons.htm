   J. Dege &amp; Sons wants you to strive for the Savile Row-proper look, even if you are on your way to take part in a fox hunt. The company, which does business under the Dege &amp; Skinner name, custom-makes shirts and suits that can cost about $8,000. It also makes specialty club ties, hunting coats, ready-to-wear shirts, riding jackets, and shooting suits, as well military uniforms and traditional Scottish Highland dress, such as kilts. Its tailors regularly visit clients in the US, Europe, and the UK. Founded in 1865, the retailer is owned and operated by the Skinner family.

   While it has just one store in London, the company's tailors have served clients in the US (New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.); Japan (Tokyo and Matsue); Europe (Paris, Geneva, and Zurich); and the UK (Midlands, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Northumberland, the Borders, and Edinburgh).

   J. Dege &amp; Sons continues to appeal to its savvy clientele with new clothing offerings. In early 2015, the company launched its "Anniversary Collection" of clothing and accessories, which included five different Super 100's, wool worsted and cashmere suits that were "caringly woven in Huddersfield and feature a special anniversary selvedge."

   In March 2012, for the first time in some 30 years, Dege &amp; Skinner's tailoring workshops returned to Savile Row, via the Number 10 basement. Before this, Savile Row tailors had been a dying breed, not from a lack of clientele, but because city developers purchased much of the real estate where the tailors had operated their shops and have made known their plans to develop that property instead of offering lease extensions.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1865; when the first member of the Skinner family joined its ranks in 1916, it added the Dege &amp; Skinner moniker to its banner. It is owned and operated by the Skinner family.
