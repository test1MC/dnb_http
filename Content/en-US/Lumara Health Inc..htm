   Lumara Health (formerly K-V Pharmaceutical) hopes to help women feel cooler, calmer, and healthier. The company's Ther-Rx subsidiary markets branded drugs, with a focus on women's health therapies manufactured by third parties through licensing agreements, including estrogen spray EvaMist licensed from
   <company id="17215">
    VIVUS
   </company>
   and preterm birth prevention drug Makena from
   <company id="13907">
    Hologic
   </company>
   .  Historically, the company manufactured and sold a variety of branded and generic drugs in the US market, as well as drug delivery technologies used to make its drugs dissolve faster, release slower, or absorb better. However, the company has been struggling financially and has sold off much of its operations. In 2014 the company was acquired by
   <company id="12524">
    AMAG Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .

   Lumara, which had recently exited a one-year stint in chapter 11 bankruptcy due to debt struggles, restructured itself as a primarily maternal health care-focused company. Related to the AMAG acquisition, the new parent established a new maternal health division, led by Lumara chief Ken Wilson.

  <p>
   Ther-Rx licensed the rights to market preterm birth prevention drug Makena from Hologic for some $199 million upon FDA approval of the drug in 2011. However, as K-V prepared Makena for market, public backlash erupted over the pricing as the drug which was already available on a non-FDA approved (and cheaper) basis from compound pharmacies. As a result, reimbursements and sales on the drug have been limited. Manufacturing problems and related legal expenses have also hindered the company's operations in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the urging of the Inspector General of the
   <company id="150448">
    US Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   , in 2011 the firm sold off the Nesher Pharmaceuticals generics unit to Zydus Pharmaceuticals for some $60 million. Nesher operated the former generic assets of the dissolved ETHEX subsidiary, which was at the root of the FDA manufacturing investigations and was historically the company's largest revenue producer. The divestiture marked the company's exit from all manufacturing operations; all remaining products are supplied by third-party manufacturers.

  <p>
   Lumara Health has experienced an extreme drop in revenues over the past few years due to its regulatory and operational troubles. The firm reported revenues of some $23 million in 2012, a 15% decline over 2011 results due to lower sales of Makena and Evamist. It has reported net income losses each year since 2009 as its operating expenses have outweighed revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the company sought to reduce operating costs and bring in some revenues through restructuring measures, including laying off large portions of its workforce and divesting multiple assets, from 2009 through 2011.

  <p>
   Lumara Health is focused on bringing more of its women's health products back into the marketplace. The company no longer has active internal research programs for new product development; instead, it is working to license or acquire additional pharmaceutical products.

  <p>
   In 2008 the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   launched investigations into the company's manufacturing practices following reports of oversized morphine sulfate tables in commercial distribution. After multiple product recalls, in early 2009 the company halted manufacturing and distribution of all its products. While working to correct the manufacturing problems in 2009 and 2010, it dissolved its ETHEX subsidiary and moved the former generic drug manufacturing operations over to a new subsidiary called Nesher Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, in September 2010, the FDA finished its final inspection and approved the company's Nesher manufacturing facility to gradually begin reintroducing generic products. The company also paid some $23 million to the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   in 2010 for failing to alert the FDA to its manufacturing problems.
