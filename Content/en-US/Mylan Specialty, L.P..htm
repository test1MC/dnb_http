   The EpiPen is&#160;Mylan Specialty's&#160;top-selling product, accounting for more than half of sales and&#160;is the most-prescribed treatment for severe allergic reactions in the US. The epinephrine auto-injector is a matter of life and death for some, and commands more than 95% of the US market share.

   The Emsam patch&#160;is the result of Mylan Specialty's attempts to diversify its product lines. The selegiline transdermal system is in a class of anti-depressants called MAOIs (or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and is administered via a skin patch. Emsam is manufactured by

   subsidiary, Mylan Technologies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Mylan changed the company's name from Dey Pharma&#160;to Mylan Specialty as part of its efforts to align operations under the Mylan brand.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2010, the company agreed to pay $280 million to settle claims that it reported false prices for several of its generic asthma treatments. The&#160;case&#160;filed by the
   <company id="150279">
    Department of Justice
   </company>
   claimed that it had&#160;inflated the prices of certain products so programs such as
   <company id="103380">
    Medicare and Medicaid
   </company>
   would&#160;pay higher reimbursements to the physicians who prescribed them. The company did not say that agreeing to the settlement was an admission of guilt.
