   For more than 170 years B. Braun Melsungen has made supplies to treat what ails you. The company makes a wide variety of medical and surgical equipment for clients all over the world. It operates through four divisions: Hospital Care (anesthesia and infusion equipment, IV solutions, and catheters); Aesculap (surgical instruments, sutures, orthopedic implants); Out Patient Market (diabetes, wound care, and nutrition products); and B. Braun Avitum (dialysis products). The company also operates dialysis clinics in Europe and provides contract manufacturing services. B. Braun plans to continue to operate as a family-run business, with no near-term plans to pursue a public offering.

  <p>
   B. Braun has more than 260 subsidiaries operating in more than 60 countries. It has major manufacturing facilities in Switzerland, the US, Brazil, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
  </p>

   Germany represents the group's largest single market, bringing in nearly 20% of sales. The rest of Europe accounts for 35% of sales. North America and the Asia/Pacific region account for 20% and 16%, respectively. Although Africa and the Middle East bring in less sales, the region showed 11% growth in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company's revenues rose 5% to €5.4 billion as all divisions saw growth. The strongest contributor to sales growth was the B. Braun Avitum dialysis division, which saw a revenue increase of 21% on higher demand for products; the acquisition of additional dialysis clinics in Europe and South America also helped. Other products showing growth included IV catheters,  infusion devices (Hospital Care division) and surgical instruments and sutures (Aesculap). Most geographic markets saw growth, particularly the US, China, and South Korea; currency exchange rates impacted gains in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   An increase in operating expenses, such as selling expenses, led to a modest increase (less than half a percent) in net income, which totaled €295.1 million. Cash flow from operations declined 3% to €520.7 million due to changes in inventories and other assets.

  <p>
   Along with introducing new products, B. Braun grows through creating next-generation models of some of its best sellers. For example, the company's Braunüle IV catheter has long been a staple in B. Braun's continence care line-up and since the model was launched more than 50 years ago, B. Braun has introduced a number of improvements and newer generation models by collaborating with the products' users as to how they could be improved -- a key strategy in the company's growth for all of its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2014 and 2015, the group invested some €3.2 billion towards company and asset acquisitions. B. Braun has also invested in expansion of its manufacturing facilities and, to further boost overall sales, has established partnerships with several hospitals.
