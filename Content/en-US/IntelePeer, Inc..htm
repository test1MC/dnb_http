   IntelePeer isn't afraid to exert a little peer pressure in order to help phone companies switch to next-generation networks. Founded in 2003, the company offers voice peering services that enable Internet telephone communications to bypass the traditional public telephone system for a cheaper, clearer call that doesn't have to be routed through a bunch of different networks. Its cloud-based communications platform, called the CloudWorx platform, supports VoIP, email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and large-volume contact center operations. Top customers include

   and

    Qwest

   The availability of broadband Internet connectivity has led to technology advances beyond surfing the Web; IP telephony is substantially cheaper and offers more operating flexibility and features than traditional telephony. Before voice peering, however, the traditional public telephone system (known as the Public Switched Telephone Network, or PSTN) had to serve as a bridge for traffic between VoIP and other networks. Communications routed through the PSTN are subject to fees and don't support rich media applications, such as streaming video. As an IP managed service provider, IntelePeer's technology removes the PSTN barrier that blocks an open communications system. The company makes its money by charging customers by the minute for using CloudWorx.
