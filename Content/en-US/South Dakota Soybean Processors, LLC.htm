   Things are "soy-good" at South Dakota Soybean Processors. The agricultural cooperative turns the 219.7 million bushels per year of soybeans from its 2,200 farmer/members into soybean oil, soybean hulls, and soybean meal. Its soybean meal is mainly sold to livestock feed companies and independent livestock producers. Most of South Dakota Soybean's crude soybean oil is processed into refined and bleached oil under the name Soyol, which is sold to manufacturers of various consumer items (plastics and biodiesel manufacturers, for example), who further process it for use in their products. The co-op owns 91% of Urethane Soy Systems Company (USSC), which it supplies with Soyol products.

  <p>
   In 2014 net revenues decreased 7% due to a 17% decline in the sales price of soybean oil from the reduction of soybean oil exports and increased production of competing oilseeds such as canola and sunflowers.
  </p>
  <p>
   South Dakota Soybean Processors' net income decreased by 5% due to increased production and operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 96% due to a decrease in inventory and accounts receivable, partially offsetting the declines in inventories and accounts receivable and a decline in accrued commodity purchases driven by lower commodity prices.

  <p>
   South Dakota Soybean's two main customers for soybean meal and hulls are
   <company id="10124">
    Archer Daniels Midland
   </company>
   and Commodity Specialists. Until 2008 its largest refined-oil customer was
   <company id="109702">
    ACH
   </company>
   , with which the company had a supply agreement. However ACH and Archer Daniels formed a soybean-oil joint venture, decreasing both companies' need for South Dakota's refined oil products; therefore South Dakota sells refined oil to ACH on a bid-only basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The co-op's facilities consist of facilities consist of one soybean processing plant, a soybean oil refinery, a bio-based polyurethane production facility, a quality-control laboratory, and administrative and operations buildings.
