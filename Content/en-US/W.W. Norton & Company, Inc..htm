   Anyone who ever lugged around one of W.W. Norton's literary anthologies knows that this company isn't really into light reading. But its publishing activities go beyond hefty college textbooks to include general-interest (fiction, history, biography) and professional (psychotherapy, architecture and design) books. W.W. Norton has published the works of authors ranging from Sigmund Freud and Henry David Thoreau to Paul Krugman (economics) and Fareed Zakaria (foreign affairs). The employee-owned company also owns book publisher Countryman Press and its Berkshire House Publishers, and serves as a distributor for about 20 smaller publishers, such as

   , Atlas &amp; Co., and Persea Books.

   Keeping up with the times, the company has a digital presence through a deal with

   William Warder Norton and his wife, M. D. Herter Norton, launched the company in 1923 by publishing pamphlets of lectures given at the adult education division of New York City's
   <company id="129839">
    Cooper Union
   </company>
   . They soon branched into book publishing and began publishing textbooks in 1930. William Warnder Norton died in 1945, and two years later his widow sold nearly all of the company's stock to W.W. Norton's managers, who later sold it to other employees.

   During the 1950s the publisher developed its literary anthologies. It began publishing paperbacks and poetry in the 1960s. The company made its first acquisition in 1974 when it bought Liveright Publishing. Beginning in the 1980s, the company extended its reach across Asia, Canada, Latin America, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company created Norton Professional Books in the mid-1980s. In 1994 Drake McFeely, who had joined the company in 1976, became W.W. Norton's president. W.W. Norton acquired Countryman Press in 1996. Two years later it lured back novelist Michael Lewis (the author of
   <i>
    Liar's Poker
   </i>
   who had previously departed W.W. Norton) with an advance of $1.2 million, the largest in its history.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company published Lewis'
   <i>
    The New New Thing,
   </i>
   an account of James H. Clark's impact on Silicon Valley, in 1999. That year W.W. Norton formed the Outside Books imprint with Mariah Media's
   <i>
    Outside
   </i>
   magazine. Outside Books issued its first book,
   <i>
    Points Unknown: A Century of Great Explorations,
   </i>
   in 2000. Berkshire House Press joined W.W. Norton in 2003.
