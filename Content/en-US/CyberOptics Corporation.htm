   CyberOptics keeps a close eye on the printed circuit board market. The company makes non-contact sensors and integrated systems used during and after the assembly of printed circuit boards and solar cells. Incorporating proprietary laser and optics three-dimensional sensing technology, most of the company's products are used in surface mount technology (SMT) assembly and solar cell manufacturing, as components used by assembly system manufacturers and as stand-alone products sold directly to end users. It also offers products used for yield improvement in semiconductor fabrication.

  <p>
   Besides its facilities in the US, including subsidiary CyberOptics Semiconductor in Oregon, it maintains locations in Singapore, Shanghai and the UK. Customers in Asia account for more than half of sales, with about a quarter coming from China.

  <p>
   CyberOptics operates in two segments: electronic assembly (about 90% of sales, most of which are exports to Asia) and semiconductor. Major product groups in electronic assembly are component placement, solder paste inspection (SPI), and automated optical inspection (AOI), each of which contribute to the segment's sales about equally.

  <p>
   Top customers for its largest product group, SMT assembly alignment sensors (including repairs), are Assembl√©on (a subsidiary of Dutch consumer products maker Philips) at nearly 10% of those products' sales and its largest LaserAlign customer JUKI at more than 15%.

  <p>
   The company's revenue has been declining year-over-year. It reported revenue of $33.3 million in fiscal 2013, down from $41.6 million in fiscal 2012 and $61.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decreased revenue has caused CyberOptics to claim a net loss of about $6 million in each of the past two fiscal years. The company's cash flow has also suffered as its top line revenue has continued to drop.

  <p>
   CyberOptics is banking on trends toward smaller components and increased production speeds to drive demand for its SMT systems. Partnerships with other companies play an important role in CyberOptics' growth strategy as well.

  <p>
   Dr. Steven Case, a professor of optical engineering at the
   <company id="42306">
    University of Minnesota
   </company>
   , founded CyberOptics in 1984 to create products using non-contact 3-D sensing systems. In 1985 the company won a $1.5 million development contract from a
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   agency. The Point Range Sensor debuted in 1986 and was later incorporated into systems for measurement, computer design and engineering, and electronics inspection. The company went public in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1990s CyberOptics began developing products for the emerging surface-mount technology (SMT) market. Owing to miniaturization in the electronics industry, the expanding use of microchips, and timely investment in SMT, CyberOptics' sales doubled in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   A soft market for production machinery in 1996 led the company to reduce its workforce by 15%. Also that year CyberOptics sued
   <company id="54040">
    Yamaha Motor Co.
   </company>
   for patent infringement. In 1997 CyberOptics introduced two next-generation measurement products: the CyberSentry 2000 and LSM2.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Steven Case relinquished his position as president to Steven Quist in 1998. Case remained as chairman and shifted his focus to overall product direction and strategic relationships toward product diversity. Case died in 2009 at the age of 60 when a small plane he was piloting crashed upon landing at an airport in the Minneapolis area.
