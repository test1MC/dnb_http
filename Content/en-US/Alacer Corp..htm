   Alacer will "C" you through your cold. Maker of the popular Emergen-C fizzy drink mix, the company set the cornerstone on branded vitamin C products. In addition to Emergen-C, which blends mineral ascorbates with B vitamins and mineral complexes, the company's products include ElectroMIX (electrolyte drink mix) and its Immune + bottled drink. Alacer also develops other dissolving nutritional supplement products, all with a walloping dose of vitamin C stirred in. Its products are sold through natural foods retailers, grocers, mass market retailers, and chain drug stores. Chemist Jay Patrick founded Alacer in 1972; pharmaceuticals giant

   acquired the company in 2012.

   Alacer regularly formulates new product offerings -- including new flavor tweaks to existing products. To support its growing product offerings and sales, the California-based company built a second manufacturing plant to double its production capacity. (Alacer makes some 500 million packets of Emergen-C annually.) The new plant in Pennsylvania also helped the company increase distribution efforts in the eastern US.
