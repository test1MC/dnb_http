   Time may eventually heal all wounds, but in the meantime there's Derma Sciences. The company operates in three segments: advanced wound care, traditional wound care, and pharmaceutical wound care products. Advanced wound care products include dressings, bandages, and ointments designed to promote wound healing and/or prevent infection. Traditional wound care products consist of commodity related dressings, ointments, gauze bandages, adhesive bandages, wound closer strips, catheter fasteners and skin care products.
   <company id="47176">
    Integra Lifesciences
   </company>
   , a manufacturer of specialty medical devices, reached an agreement to acquire Derma Sciences in early 2017.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Derma Sciences' key brands include Medihoney, a line of dressings containing active leptospermum (a plant family) honey from New Zealand for the management of chronic and acute wounds and burns; Bioguard, a line of dressings that provide a barrier to bacterial penetration protecting patients from external contaminants, a reduction in bacteria, and other pathogens from wound fluid, as well as protection against cross-contamination to the caregiver during dressing changes; and, Xtrasorb, a line of novel super-absorbent wound dressings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Pharmaceutical wound care products include DSC127, a novel product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers which is presently under development having completed its Phase 2 trial.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's direct sales force sells Derma Sciences' products, which are designed for use in nursing homes, hospitals, and other health care facilities, to distributors and large institutions in the US. It also sells in Canada (and to a limited extent other international markets) through distribution agreements.

        <p>
   Derma Sciences manufactures its products at facilities in Canada and China. It also performs contract manufacturing services at those manufacturing facilities for traditional and advanced wound care, skin care and bathing, and specialty fixation and closure products. Its clients range from multi-national corporations to small companies. Derma Sciences also employs contract manufacturers for its own products in China, Mexico, and the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2011 sales in the US accounted for 66% of the company's total  revenues; Canada accounted for 25%; select international markets made up the remainder.
  </p>
        <p>
   Just about all of Derma Sciences' revenue is derived from sales of its wound care products (Medihoney, Bioguard, etc.). It has seen such success with its key product lines that it is developing ways to expand their uses to capture additional sales and new customers. The company's revenues grew by 11% in 2011 thanks to an increase in advanced wound care sales and traditional wound care sales. The advanced wound care sales increase was driven by promoted products (led by Medihoney), which increased 49%, partially offset by a decrease in its older  advanced wound care products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net loss grew by 77% in 2011 because of an increase in total expenses (primarily marketing and sales expenses), partially offset by an increase in overall revenues.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Derma Sciences licensed the worldwide rights to its Medihoney product in 2010, which it expects will serve as a catalyst for the company's international growth strategy.
  </p>
        <p>
   Along with extending its existing product lines, Derma Sciences works to develop completely new products through in-house research. One such candidate, DSC127 is an analog of a naturally occurring peptide, Angiotensin, that has been shown to increase keratinocyte proliferation, increase extracellular matrix production, and increase vascularization; all of which is a convoluted way of saying the product is being tested for its ability to accelerate dermal tissue repair.
  </p>
        <p>
   Derma Sciences is hoping that getting DSC127 to market, expanding internationally, and taking advantage of opportunities it sees in its first aid business will help it shore up some of the financial losses the company incurred over the past couple of years. Derma Sciences intends to grow its first aid business by using it to introduce some of its wound care products to the consumer market, thereby capturing a whole new customer base.
  </p>
        <p>
   Though it's developing DSC127 on its own, Derma Sciences continues to evaluate the market for new product opportunities and hasn't ruled out the possibility of entering into licensing or joint venture agreements or making acquisitions to obtain new products. In 2012, for example, the company paid $14.5 million to purchase privately held MedEfficiency, manufacturer of the TCC-EZ Total Contact Cast system for treating foot ulcers in diabetic patients.
