   In the competitive mattress-making industry, Serta sleeps with one eye open. The company is one of the nation's top mattress producers, but has seen rival
   <company id="121501">
    Tempur Sealy
   </company>
   leapfrog it in industry rankings. Serta asserts that it's also one of the world's top manufacturers of mattresses. To its benefit, Serta supplies hotels and motels, such as
   <company id="10733">
    Hilton

Founded in 1931, Serta boasts nearly 30 manufacturing facilities in North America. Serta is controlled by the private equity firm

   With the two mattress makers under one ownership umbrella, Serta and Simmons anticipated heating up competition with Tempur Sealy in the US and abroad through licensing deals. While super high-end mattresses garnered much attention in recent years, the housing bust and concurrent downturn in the US economy has bedding manufacturers focused on getting consumers back into stores. To that end, Serta has rolled out promotional and mid-priced lines, such as its Five Star Mattress, that retails from $799 to $1,599. Serta has also been working to update and expand its upscale lines with new features.
  </p>
  <p>
   To improve customer retention, in 2014 Serta rolled out its latest iComfort gel memory foam and iSeries hybrid mattress collections, new online shopping tools, and launched its VIP Rewards consumer loyalty program
  </p>
  <p>
   That year The Trump Organization and Serta redesigned the Trump Home iSeries mattress collection, offering a luxurious yet affordable mattresses for shoppers interested in the benefits of gel memory foam, but who prefer the support of a traditional innerspring.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Serta launched a new corporate social responsibility program, 'Serta Comforts Our Heroes' through a partnership with Fisher House Foundation. Since 1990, Fisher House Foundation has provided more than 5,200,000 days of lodging to 200,000 families that have loved ones receiving treatments at military and veteran's hospitals. Serta's new program will aim to bring comfort to the growing number of occupants staying at Fisher House locations all over the US
