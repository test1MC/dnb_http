   Autoliv ASP, the North American subsidiary of Sweden-based
   <company id="53694">
    Autoliv Inc.
   </company>
   , designs and manufactures automobile safety restraint systems, such as airbags and airbag inflators (the highest-cost item in making an airbag module), seat belts, night vision systems, radar sensors, gas generators, and other airbag modules. It is credited with the invention of the side-impact airbag, the Inflatable Curtain (for head protection), the Anti-Whiplash Seat, and night vision systems. It also provides testing of automotive safety products for vehicle manufacturers, as well as engineering design of products at its technical center and test laboratory.

  <p>
   Autoliv ASP, with 10 locations across the US, was founded in 1996. Its manufacturing plants, technical centers, and offices are located in California, Massachusetts, and Utah. While most of its parent's manufacturing operations have been outsourced to lower-cost regions in China, Eastern Europe, and Mexico, the company still does much of its product development in the West.

   In 2011 it launched the Mono Vision Sensing System (MVSS), a camera-based driver assistance system for
   <company id="41758">

   </company>
   vehicles that alerts a driver about traffic signs, changes in lane markings, and the distance of the car in front of it. It also automatically switches the vehicle's headlights from high- to low-beam at the approach of oncoming vehicles. Another boon to Autoliv's US business is the federal government's mandate that side and head airbags be included in all new light vehicles sold in the US starting in 2013.

  <p>
   Autoliv ASP saw its revenues climb 12% from $2.6 billion in 2011 to nearly $2.9 billion in 2012. The rise was attributed to organic sales growth and strong performances from Honda, Ford, and Chrysler.
