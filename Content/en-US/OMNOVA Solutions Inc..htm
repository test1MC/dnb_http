   In fiscal 2013 OMNOVA's revenue declined by 10% due to an 11% drop Performance Chemicals sales decreased by 11% (as the result of  reduced customer pricing caused by lower raw material costs as well as competitive pricing pressure) and 6% decline in Engineered Surfaces  sales due to due to lower volumes.

  </p>
  <p>
   OMNOVA's operating cash inflow decreased to $45.8 million in fiscal 2013 (from $65.3 million in fiscal 2012) primarily due to a decline in net income and a change in working capital as a result of cash spent on liabilities.

   In 2014 OMNNOVA and Muraspec announced an expanded distribution arrangement that will enable Muraspec to offer OMNOVA's complete range of coated fabrics to customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year OMNOVA introduced PreVaill XMT and XMT Plus vinyl upholsteries, designed to meet the rigors of the transit market's busy buses and trains, while creating a comfortable and easy-to-maintain passenger environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its higher value operations, OMNOVA has divested its commercial wallcovering businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the sale and exit from the commercial wallcovering business (in 2012), the company changed the name of its Decorative Products segment to Engineered Surfaces to better reflect the role of innovation and the functional performance features that are valued in its served markets. (It sold some of its North American wallcovering operations to J. Josephon, and ts UK-based Muraspec wallcovering business to a2e Venture Catalysts. The divestments, which have netted the company about $10 million for the North American business and $6.2 million for the UK business, allowed OMNOVA to focus on its global performance chemicals unit and the coated fabrics, laminates, and performance films operations within its decorative products unit).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired specialty chemicals manufacturer ELIOKEM International from
   <company id="90779">
    AXA Private Equity
   </company>
   in 2011 for $300 million. The deal  creates a larger, more diverse company by adding manufacturing capabilities in Europe and Asia to OMNOVA's production facilities in the US. France-based ELIOKEM is now part of OMNOVA's performance chemicals business. As part of the ELOKEM integration, in 2012 OMNOVA expanded manufacturing capability for its Pliotec water-based acrylic coating resins to include three locations in the US.

    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   's hollow sphere plastic pigment, or HPP, product line. At the same time, the company terminated its RohmNova joint venture with partner
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
