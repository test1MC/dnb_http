   This capitol rules over a music nation. Capitol Records is a major recording label in the US, sporting a roster that includes such artists as Coldplay, Katy Perry, Lily Allen, the Beastie Boys, and the Decemberists. It also distributes R&amp;B and hip-hop through sister label Priority Records, which boasts such top sellers as Snoop Dogg and Cypress Hill. (Snoop Dogg was appointed creative chairman of the newly resurrected Priority Records in 2009.) Founded in 1942, its offices are housed in the iconic Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles, at the famed intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. The company is now part of
