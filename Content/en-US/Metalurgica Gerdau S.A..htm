  <p>
   The company's net revenues have risen over last five years. In 2014 Metalúrgica Gerdau's net revenue increased by 7% in local currency due to higher North American revenues (as the result of currency exchange variation and, to a lesser extent, higher net sales per ton sold).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has been decreasing over a period of years (2010-2014), except a slight increase in 2013. In 2014 Metalúrgica Gerdau's net income decreased by 12%, primarily due to asset impairments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash inflow decreased by 37% due to lower net income and changes in working capital.
