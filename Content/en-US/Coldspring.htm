   Coldspring has been chipping away as a granite business since the late 1800s. Formerly Cold Spring Granite, it operates about 30 granite quarries and five fabrication facilities in Canada and the US that produce 1.5 million net cube of granites per year for commercial, residential, and institutional use. Granite products include floor tiles, countertop slabs, paving materials, and exterior building blocks. Its Memorialization unit makes upright monuments, bronze markers, urns, bases, and mausoleums. Coldspring's granite can be found in national monuments, cemeteries, and the columns of Minnesota's state capitol. It was founded by Scottish-born Henry Alexander, grandfather of chairman and CEO Patrick Alexander.

  <p>
   Based in Cold Spring, Minnesota, the company steers its business from a 22,500-sq.-ft. headquarters office that in 2008 received the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification. Half a dozen other buildings join the headquarters office on the 435-acre site. As part of its operations, Coldspring also has a bronze foundry, a handful of fabrication facilities, and 30 quarries across North America.

  <p>
   Coldspring quarries are located in Minnesota, Texas, New York, California, and Canada. In addition to products that are supplied by its own quarries, Coldspring imports and fabricates about 100 different granites quarried in other locations globally. Coldspring provides its clients with 730 contour and carving designs on 100 granite colors and a variety of products from about 30 active quarries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is split into two divisions: Memorialization and Commercial.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Memorialization group features several subsidiaries, including Royal Melrose Granites and Granit-Bronz. Coldspring offers cemetery maintenance and construction, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Commercial group handles orders for architectural building products, which include granite specialties, such as residential slabs for countertops, furniture and tile, landscape products, granite blocks, and granite for industrial applications. Within the division, subdivision DiamondWright makes plated tools, drills, anchoring, and other items for working with granite

   In recent years, Coldspring has focused on making its products more easily available to professionals. In 2012 Coldspring began to offer its New World Stoneworks system to architects. The system uses natural stone for full masonry veneer intended for interior or exterior building projects. By offering pre-cut and numbered stones -- delivered to jobsites on pallets and stacked in order of assembly -- the company aims to cater to these professionals and compete more aggressively with other granite suppliers. Also, the company's DiamondWright Tools division launched an online store in 2011 to make diamond tooling available for purchase. Designed and manufactured by the Coldspring's master engineers, the specialty diamond tools are used to cut, grind, shape, and profile a variety of stone fabrication, metal cutting, concrete projects, and other items.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also enhancing its memorial design portfolio. In 2013 the company added functionality to its Personal Reflections Memorial Design System, an online tool that consolidates memorial selection, design, and ordering. The updated version makes available memorial benches, crypt plaques, and niche front plaques, as well as scroll features.

  <p>
   Coldspring serves several key international markets and sells about 15% of its annual volume to overseas customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   After more than 115 years in business and 89 years operating under the Cold Spring Granite name, the company in 2013 changed its name to Coldspring. Blending Cold Spring into one word allows the company to differentiate itself from fellow Cold Spring, Minnesota, businesses and to align all its divisions under a unified masterbrand.
