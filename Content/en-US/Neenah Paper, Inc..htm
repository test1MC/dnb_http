  <p>
   Neenah has achieved significant growth over the last few years, with revenues climbing 7% from $845 million in 2013 to $903 million in 2014. The growth for 2014 was fueled by a spike in technical products sales related to an acquisition and higher average net prices for its legacy products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products jumped 32% from $52 million in 2013 to $69 million in 2014 primarily due to the higher revenue coupled with a tax rate decrease. Neenah has also experienced two straight years of operating cash flow growth, with cash flows increasing 13% to $95 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Neenah is looking for new customers by expanding its portfolio of products and by extending its reach into new geographic regions. To this end, the company's working to enter adjacent markets that are growing and profitable. In 2013, for example, Neenah rolled out the Design Collection, which comprises 11 paper brands that blend half a dozen paper lines from North America and five from Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also makes strategic acquisitions. In 2014 Neenah bought Crane Technical Materials from upscale paper firm
   <company id="48033">
    Crane &amp; Co.
   </company>
   for $72 million, renaming the Crane entity Neenah Technical Materials. Technical lines, which are manufactured in Michigan and Germany, include filtration, component materials, tape, graphics and identification, and wall covering. The segment is anticipated to continue to grow at a faster and more profitable rate as demand in niche technical markets evolves and sales volume and operating scale efficiencies improve.
