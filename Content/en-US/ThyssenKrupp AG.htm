   How do you say "giant engineering and steel company" in German? Try ThyssenKrupp and pronounce it "TISS-in kroop." The company is one of the world's largest steel producers and operates worldwide in two business areas: Materials and Technologies. The first comprises the company's steel (carbon and stainless steel) and materials services businesses. ThyssenKrupp's Technologies group consists of its elevators unit, marine systems, components technology (for the auto and engineering markets), and plant technology (construction and environmental services) segments. Although its combined interests range from elevators to shipbuilding, the company has historically relied upon the steel market.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Led by regional headquarters, ThyssenKrupp serves customers in North and South America, China, India, and the Asia-Pacific region. It has operations in 78 countries, and has 546 subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's business operations are organized into two divisions and seven operating business areas. The Materials division consists of the Steel Europe, Steel Americas, and Materials Services units. The Technologies division comprises the company's Elevator Technology, Plant Technology, Components Technology, and Marine Systems units.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 (ended September) ThyssenKrupp's revenues grew by 7% due to strong growth in its capital goods business and sales from the recent acquisitions of Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) and VDM.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company posted net income of €195 million (compared to net loss of €1.58 billion in 2013) thanks to higher revenues and lower operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   ThyssenKrupp's operating cash inflow increased to €887 million in 2014 (up from €786 million in the previous year) as the result of improved net income and a change in working capital.

   In 2014 ThyssenKrupp Metallurgical Products expanded its operations in South America, opening its first location in Bolivia, extending its global network of sales offices. As well as marketing nonferrous metal tin, ThyssenKrupp Metallurgical Products will focus on trading copper and tungsten from that country. That year it also began construction of a new automotive supply plant in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash to reinvest in core operations, in 2014 ThyssenKrupp sold ThyssenKrupp Steel USA's rolling and coating plant in Calvert, Alabama to a consortium of
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41878">
    Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal
   </company>
   for $1.55 billion. (The deal is expected to deliver $60 million in annual savings). That year the company also arranged for a long-term slab supply contract with the ThyssenKrupp CSA steel mill in Brazil. The consortium will purchase 2 million tons of slabs per year from ThyssenKrupp CSA up to 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 ThyssenKrupp Metallurgical Products expanded its product portfolio, signing an 10-year offtake agreement with NioCorp Developments for ferroniobium, a rare heavy metal. This offtake agreement makes the ThyssenKrupp Metallurgical Products the exclusive European distribution partner to NioCorp, which is developing the only primary niobium deposits in the US at its Elk Creek project in Nebraska.

  <p>
   As part of the 2014 acquisitions of the AST and VDM service centers from
   <company id="58301">
    Outokumpu
   </company>
   , ThyssenKrupp sold its 29.9% holdings in that company. (The deal stems from the sale of ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel company Inoxumto to Outokumpu in 2012).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 ThyssenKrupp Aerospace acquired UK-based The Waterjet Group. With its equipment ThyssenKrupp is able to process a wide range of materials and sizes for its European and international customer base.

   Formed separately in the 1800s, both Thyssen and Krupp flourished in their early years under family control. Friedrich Krupp opened his steel factory in 1811. He died in 1826 and left the nearly bankrupt factory in the hands of his 14-year-old son Alfred, who turned the business around. At the first World's Fair in 1851, Alfred unveiled a steel cannon far superior to earlier bronze models.
  </p>
  <p>
   Twenty years later August Thyssen founded a puddling and rolling mill near Mulheim. He bought small factories and mines, and by WWI he ran Germany's largest iron and steel company. During the world wars the resources of both companies were turned toward military efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Post-WWII years were tough for both companies.
   <l1>
    Thyssen
   </l1>
   was split up by the Allies, and when it began production again in 1953, it consisted of one steel plant. In the Krupp camp, Alfred's great-grandson Alfried was convicted in 1948 of using slave labor during WWII. Released from prison in 1951, Alfried rebuilt Krupp. After near ruin following WWII, both companies emerged and enjoyed a resurgence, along with the German economy, in which they prospered and expanded during the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1980s Thyssen's businesses included ships, locomotives, offshore oil rigs, specialty steel, and metals trading and distribution. Krupp continued to grow, and in 1992 it took over engineering and steelmaking concern Hoesch AG. (Eberhard Hoesch had begun making railroad tracks in the 1820s. The company grew and expanded into infrastructure and building products.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The new
   <l2>
    Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp
   </l2>
   bought Italian specialty steelmaker Acciai Speciali Terni, chemical-plant builder Uhde, and South African shipper J.H. Bachmann. Its automotive division formed a joint venture in Brazil and added production sites in China, Mexico, Romania, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Thyssen expanded in North America with its $675 million acquisition of
   <company id="13572">
    Giddings &amp; Lewis
   </company>
   (machine tools, US) and the purchase of Copper &amp; Brass Sales (metals processing and distributing).
  </p>
  <p>
   Krupp attempted a hostile takeover of Thyssen in 1997. The takeover failed, but the companies soon agreed to merge their steel operations to form Thyssen Krupp Stahl. Bigger plans were in the works, and in 1998 the two companies agreed to merge. That year Thyssen sold its Plusnet fixed-line phone business to Esprit Telecom Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Krupp's automotive division (Krupp Hoesch Automotive) bought
   <company id="10423">
    Cummins'
   </company>
   Atlas Crankshaft subsidiary. Thyssen also bought US-based Dover's elevator business for $1.1 billion. Krupp and Thyssen completed their merger in 1999. The company planned to spin off its steel operations, but held off due to its success in 2000. ThyssenKrupp did, however, sell its Krupp Kunststofftechnik unit (plastic molding machines) for about $183 million. To speed corporate decision-making, the company made plans to scrap its dual-management structure in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 ThyssenKrupp agreed to buy 51% of Fiat unit
   <company id="99474">
    Magneti Marelli's
   </company>
   suspension-systems and shock-absorbers business. It also had the option of buying the remainder after 2004. In 2002 the company formed alliances with
   <company id="52309">
    NKK
   </company>
   and
   <company id="52343">
    Kawasaki Steel
   </company>
   to share its steel sheet making technologies while expanding its business with Japanese automotive makers in Europe. ThyssenKrupp's joint venture with Chinese steelmaker ANSC Angang New Steel, known as TAGAL, began producing galvanized coil of which about 80% will be used in China's burgeoning automotive industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 ThyssenKrupp sold its residential real estate unit for around $2.8 billion to a consortium of real estate funds operated by
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   and Corpus-Immobiliengruppe. It divested the automotive segment of the capital goods unit in 2006, selling it off in pieces.
  </p>
  <p>
   ThyssenKrupp opened three major, new steel facilities in the Americas in 2010. A new integrated steel mill in Santa Cruz, Brazil, started production in mid-year. The $7 billion plant, the company's biggest project ever, is a partnership with South American giant
   <company id="95034">
    Vale SA
   </company>
   , which owns a 25% stake in the venture. The company also began production at two plants in Calvert, Alabama: a $3.6 billion carbon steel plant and a $1.4 billion stainless steel rolling plant. The company also constructed -- and consolidated its corporate staff in -- a new headquarters building in Essen, Germany in 2010.
