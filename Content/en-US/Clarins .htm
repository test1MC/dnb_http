   Some say that French women are born beautiful. Clarins prefers that women, instead, place their faith in its upscale skin-care products, makeup, and perfume. The company touts ingredients such as herbal and marine extracts and air-pollution-defying complexes in its products, which are sold through department and specialty stores in Asia, Europe, and the US. Clarins targets skin-conscious consumers with its antiwrinkle and firming creams. The company also serves the sweet-smelling fragrance market. Its top scents include Azzaro, as well as par Amour and par Amour toujours.

  <p>
   Clarins' products are sold in about 150 countries. The group produces its skin care products and perfumes exclusively in France, and exports 88% of its products worldwide.

   The company has its own research and development laboratories which develops new products in three years.

   Clarins sells its products primarily through pharmacies, department stores, and more than 50 of its own beauty treatment salons. The company also makes cosmetics, perfume, and high-fashion clothing. More than half of its sales come from its skin-care products. Made of all-natural plant extracts and offering anti-aging and anti-pollution properties, the products target a wide range of women -- from the mature woman with wrinkles to teen girls with acne.

   As part of the company's focus on fragrance, Clarins has introduced scents for Thierry Mugler, Porsche Design, and American jeweler David Yurman.

   Jacques Courtin-Clarins always wanted to be a doctor, but WWII interrupted his plans. He couldn't afford medical school after the war, so he decided to become a chiropractor. While giving both chiropractic adjustments and body massages, Courtin-Clarins found that his clients -- especially the women -- were looking for information about skin care and for natural skin-care products. He also noticed that the body massages resulted in better skin tone for his clients. In 1954 he opened his first beauty salon in Neuilly, an upscale neighborhood near Paris.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the beginning, the entrepreneur stressed personalized advice for his clients, and he offered only natural products made from plant extracts. The first products included an aromatic relaxation oil, a skin-toning tonic oil, and a water-retention oil (for cellulite). He soon developed the Paris Method, a manual method of massage -- just for the face at first, but later developed for the body in general and the bust -- designed to improve circulation, eliminate toxins, and tone the skin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Courtin-Clarins added more products over the years, and began moving the company toward an international presence in 1972 with some exclusive distribution contracts. But it was his son Christian, who joined the family firm in 1974, who made the company an international concern. Clarins led the skin care market in France by 1980, and the company established its first international subsidiary the next year, in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clarins was listed on the Paris Bourse in 1984. The company increased its marketing in the US in 1988, and by 1990 product sales had risen 30% in the US. That year Clarins became the European market leader in skin care products sold in prestige distribution channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1990 Clarins began expanding beyond skin care products as it started distributing fragrances such as Azzaro, Montana, and Giorgio through its German and Italian subsidiaries. The company also set up a perfume joint venture: Thierry Mugler Parfums. Clarins launched its first cosmetics products in 1991. The company also introduced an anti-pollution cream that year. By that time, Clarins had distribution centers in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the US, and minority stakes in exclusive distributors in other parts of Europe and in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thierry Mugler Parfums introduced its Angel fragrance in 1992. Following its usual strategy, the perfume was made available on a limited basis -- just department stores and two Thierry Mugler boutiques in Paris and fewer than 300 stores in the rest of France. The perfume debuted later in the rest of Europe and in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its expansion beyond skin care products, Clarins acquired the Azzaro and Montana perfumes in 1995 (the Montana brand was sold in 2000) and a majority interest in Thierry Mugler Couture in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Clarins and Procter &amp; Gamble agreed that Clarins would distribute Hugo Boss and Giorgio Beverly Hills perfumes in department stores beginning in 2000. Christian Courtin became CEO of Clarins in mid-2000. In 2001 the company bought a minority stake in L'Occitane, another French cosmetics company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clarins transferred its Thierry Mugler couture fashions and men's boutique business in 2003 to Italian company Tombolini.  The company had enjoyed a distribution deal with
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   to distribute Hugo Boss and Giorgio Beverly Hills in US department stores. But with P&amp;G's acquisition of
   <company id="91241">
    Wella
   </company>
   in late 2003 and growth in its fine fragrance unit, the distribution agreement with Clarins was not renewed in mid-2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2007 founder and chairman Jacques Courtin-Clarins died, more than 50 years after he founded his first beauty salon in Neuilly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the family of the late founder, Jacques Courtin-Clarins, took the company private through its holding company Financière FC Financière. CF paid about $923 million for the outstanding shares. (Previously, the founder's sons, Christian and Olivier, owned about two-thirds of the company.) Chairman Christian Courtin-Clarins decided to take the French cosmetics group private following persistent speculation -- after the death of Jacques Courtin-Clarins in 2007 -- that Clarins would become a takeover target. (Likely suitors were even said to include luxury goods purveyor PPR (later renamed Kering) and rival

    L'Oréal
   </company>
   .) The firm said its underlying motivation in going private was the need to focus on a long-term strategy and to develop its brands. To that end, the French beauty brand aims to up its profile in the US, where it is best known for its self-tanners and sunscreen, rather than its facial products. Clarins will begin opening spas inside department stores, including
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdales
   </company>
   , and is reaching out to Hispanic women, known for their willingness to spend money on beauty products.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Clarins is the best-selling luxury skin-care brand in Europe, it ranks fourth in America. In recent years Clarins has concentrated on growth in the US. The company opened more stores in the US -- one on Columbus Avenue in New York and another in Short Hills, New Jersey. It also entered the natural-cosmetics marketplace in 2006 when it acquired a 10% stake in organic cosmetics company Kibio. Clarins bought the remaining share of Kibio in early 2010
