   One of the world's largest materials groups, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain is in a "glass" by itself. The mega-group develops, manufactures, and distributes a wide variety of products for construction, transportation, industrial, food storage, and solar energy use. Saint-Gobain operates in four primary sectors:
   <company id="93480">
    Building Distribution
   </company>
   , Construction Products (insulation, roofing, and other products), Innovative Materials (Flat Glass and High-Performance Materials such as polymers and glass fabrics), and Packaging (glass bottles). It owns notable brands such as Norton, Rencol, Winter, and
   <company id="43943">
    CertainTeed
   </company>
   . Saint-Gobain dates to the 1660s, when it made mirrors for the Palace of Versailles.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Saint-Gobain operates in about 65 countries around the world and has offices in 18 different countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through four segments that are based on its served sectors. The Innovative Materials (IM) segment comprises the two activities of making flat glass and high-performance materials and has a worldwide manufacturing presence in 42 countries. Construction offers interior and exterior building products including partitions, acoustic and thermal insulation products, wall facings, and roofing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Building Distribution segment targets the renovation, new building, and habitat improvement markets. Operating under the Verallia name, the company's Packaging segment designs and produces bottles and jars primarily for the wine and spirits and food markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Saint-Gobain's revenues decreased 2% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates between the Latin American and Scandinavian (to Euro) currencies and due to the disposal of its Verallia North American packaging operations. (Note: the company restated its 2013 annual financial statement due to changing in accounting policies.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing years of declines, the company's net income climbed by 22% from 2013 to 2014 due to recent cost-cutting efforts in addition to lower restructuring expenses. In addition, Saint-Gobain's cash flow from operations decreased by 38% over that same time period.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Saint-Gobaine's blueprint for growth involves engaging in cost-cutting initiatives, expanding its manufacturing in key markets, and acquiring complementary businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company opened its first plasterboard plant in Indonesia, near Jakarta, with an annual capacity of 30 million sq. meters. The production site will enable the company to respond better to local demand and continue its growth within the rapidly growing Indonesian plasterboard market. As part of its focus on these Indonesian markets, Saint-Gobain will soon have six plants in Indonesia for its abrasives, industrial mortars, and performance plastics businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another key strategy is developing more sustainability technologies to take advantage of increasing interest in environmental issues. Some of its products include self-cleaning windows and green insulation systems and water supply systems. Saint-Gobain has a particular focus on solar power. Its solar unit is dedicated to solar-related products including photovoltaic panels and solar heating systems.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Turkey-based Atlas Zimpara, which offers a broad spectrum of products for the industrial supplies, automotive repair, and building markets. The acquisition is part of the company's focus on the Turkish market, a region in which the company has also recently launched a new organic grinding wheel plant at Istanbul, serving the Middle East and Central Asia.

  <p>
   Originally called Dunoyer, Saint-Gobain (named after the factory location) was founded in 1665 by order of the Sun King, Louis XIV, who needed mirrors to adorn his palaces. Because Venice had the monopoly on glass, Louis lured Venetian artisans to Paris. Some were poisoned by Italian assassins, but enough remained to teach Parisians their secrets. Saint-Gobain glass decorates the Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its decreed glass monopoly in France, the company grew steadily until the French Revolution interrupted its prosperity. By the early 1800s, however, Saint-Gobain was shining again. It set up a sales office in New York in 1830 and its first foreign subsidiary in Germany in 1857. Under chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac's direction, Saint-Gobain began dabbling in chemicals in the mid-1800s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding to Italy (1889) and Spain (1904), the firm was Europe's leading glassmaker by 1913. Saint-Gobain pioneered the production of tempered security glass in the 1920s; it diversified into glass fiber in the 1930s.
