   The keys to success for Baldwin alternate in color -- black and white. One of the top piano manufacturers in the US, Baldwin Piano is best known for making concert and upright pianos under the Baldwin, Howard, Hamilton, Chickering, and Wurlitzer names. The company also makes ConcertMaster computerized player pianos. Its custom models feature hand-painted designs, including gold-leaf scrollwork and pinstripes, marble finishes, and exotic leopard spots and zebra stripes.

   , which has been working to breathe new life into Baldwin, bought the ailing piano maker from GE Capital in 2001. Dwight Hamilton Baldwin established the company as Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ in 1862.

   Itinerant minister and music teacher Dwight Hamilton Baldwin settled in Cincinnati in 1862 and founded Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Company as a retail piano business. By 1925, however, the company was making pianos to the tune of $1 million a year. Income fell during WWII as Baldwin built wooden aircraft wings, but postwar consumer demand lifted sales to $33 million by 1954.
  </p>
  <p>
   Much of Baldwin's historic success can be attributed to a nonmusical invention, the installment sales plan. The company got deeper into financial services by acquiring a series of banking and insurance firms, beginning with Colorado-based Central Bank &amp; Trust in 1968. Baldwin merged with Cincinnati investment firm United Corp. in 1977 to form Baldwin-United, which went on to buy MGIC Investment Corp. (the #1 home mortgage insurer in the US) and Sperry &amp; Hutchinson (S&amp;H green stamps). Baldwin-United bought more than it could handle, and it entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983.

   The next year the Baldwin assets were bought by a group led by then CEO Richard Harrison and VP Harold Smith. To counter a long slump in the piano and organ business, Baldwin began making printed circuit boards, electromechanical assemblies, and grandfather clocks. The new company went public in 1986 amid a rebound in the keyboard instrument industry. Baldwin bought the piano and electronic keyboard business of rival Wurlitzer two years later.

   An agreement by Baldwin to be bought by a Florida investment firm collapsed in 1993. Piano-playing former

   executive Karen Hendricks replaced Harrison as CEO in 1995. To boost Baldwin's profits, she cut jobs, reduced the company's sales and distribution forces, phased out a dealer consignment sales plan, and in 1997 sold its church organ division. Competition from inexpensive piano imports led to a sour note in Baldwin's 1998 earnings. Citing unfair competition, executives testified before the International Trade Commission in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999 Providence Capital, an aggressive investment firm headed by Herbert Denton (quoted as lacking confidence in Baldwin's management), bought about 7% of the company; Denton was subsequently added to Baldwin's board. Baldwin also began another round of job cuts and sold a plant in Mexico that year. In March 2000 the company sold its two finance businesses (Keyboard Acceptance and Signature Leasing) to Deutsche Financial for $35 million.

   Baldwin sold its contract electronics division in January 2001 to Ayrshire Electronics for about $9 million in an effort to restore its core piano business to profitability. In March it sold 11 of its 14 retail piano stores to Chicago-based Biasco Musical Instrument Company (its largest dealer) with the agreement that Biasco would only sell Baldwin products in those stores. In April Hendricks resigned; Robert Jones was appointed CEO and shareholder Kenneth Pavia was named chairman.

   In May 2001 Baldwin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and sold its assets to GE Capital in October (at a credit auction). In November

   acquired Baldwin's assets, including its name and its manufacturing facilities in Arkansas, and Gibson's top officers took over the top-level positions at Baldwin. Gibson sounded a discordant note in 2002 when it ousted up to 85% of Baldwin's dealers.

   To strengthen its foothold in China and significantly expand its manufacturing capacity there, parent Gibson in late 2006 acquired Dongbei Piano Co., a major player in China's piano market. The firm was renamed the Baldwin-Dongbei Piano &amp; Musical Instruments Co.
