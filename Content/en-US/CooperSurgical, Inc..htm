  <p>
   CooperSurgical net revenues in 2014 increased by 2% thanks to a growth in the demand of fertility products (contributing 35%) partially offset by slower growth in sales of medical equipment. Sales from medical office and surgical procedures by ob/gyns (contributing 65%) decreased, also due to a decline in medical equipment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating as a segment of
   <company id="10404">
    The Cooper Companies
   </company>
   , CooperSurgical accounted for 19% of its parent's net revenues in 2014.

  <p>
   Although
   <company id="138627">
    CooperVision
   </company>
   accounts for the bulk of its parent company's revenues, CooperSurgical maintains a steady strategy of acquiring smaller businesses and complementary product lines that either improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, it is working to expand its offerings to larger hospitals and outpatient surgical procedures. CooperSurgical also spends and focuses on R&amp;D to fuel growth.
  </p>
