   Zhone Technologies helps network service providers get into the SLMS zone. The company's all-IP Single Line Multi-Service (SLMS) platform uses existing local-loop infrastructures to deliver broadband services. Telecommunications service providers and wireless and cable operators use SLMS to offer their business and residential subscribers bundled broadband Internet access, local and long-distance voice, and broadcast video services. Its products are assembled at its plant in Florida using components manufactured in Asia. The company serves some 1,000 customers worldwide; about 70% of sales come from outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SLMS allows telecom companies to easily transition from circuit-based networks to packet-based networks and from copper systems to fiber systems without having to discontinue service. About 95% of its revenue are generated by its products with services bringing in the other 5%.

  <p>
   Customers in Europe along with the Middle East and Africa account for nearly 50% of Zhone's revenue. The US is the biggest single national market generating 30% of the company's revenue. Latin American customers contribute about 17% of Zhone's sales.

   Zhone markets its products worldwide, selling directly and through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and service providers. Customers Baud Telecom and
   <company id="106016">
    Emirates Telecommunications

   accounted for 14% and 11% of revenue in 2014. The company's other customers include
   <company id="127141">
    Sigmanet

   , KanOkla Networks, Estracom, City of Salisbury, and

  <p>
   In 2014 revenue notched down 1% to $121 million from a decrease in service revenue related to slower installation services. Product revenue 2014 was flat. In the US, revenue dropped 6% with fewer broadband development projects as federal stimulus funding slowed. The 17% revenue gain in Europe and the Middle East was the only geographic increase Zhone posted in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sluggish revenue report and increase in research and development expenses combine to send Zhone to a net loss of $4 million in 2014 following a profitable 2013. The company had an accumulated deficit of $1 billion at the end of 2014.

  <p>
   Zhone Technologies' strategy for more sales growth is a combination of infrastructure expansion to provide more support for network service providers, development of its SLMS product, and pre- and post-sales support.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's new MXK-F platform is to be a significant performance upgrade for current customers and is to attract new customers. The company's FiberLAN technology does provide higher performance and networks connected by copper cables, but the expense can be a drawback. That leads to a number of incremental upgrades as customers try to manage upgrades and budgets.

   The company used acquisitions to build its product portfolio and customer roster, purchasing
   <company id="99863">
    Tellium
   </company>
   in 2003, Sorrento Networks in 2004, and
   <company id="54723">
    Paradyne Networks
   </company>
   in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also has divested a number of legacy products. It sold its iMARC product line (frame relay, ATM, and IP service units, monitors, and branch office routers) to
   <company id="45499">
    Verso Technologies
   </company>
   in 2006. It sold its AccessNode suite to
   <company id="112281">
    Communications Test Design
   </company>
   in 2007. In 2008 the co-founders of Sorrento Networks purchased Zhone's GigaMux optical access product line and revived Sorrento as a private, standalone company. The divestitures fit a strategy of concentrating on its core SLMS products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sale of legacy product lines accounted for most of the revenue decline that the company experienced in 2008. Zhone was also impacted by reduced spending in the telecom sector resulting from the global recession.
