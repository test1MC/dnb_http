   Crime pays for Napco Security Technologies. If you're trying to prevent it, Napco manufactures a slew of security products used in commercial and residential buildings, as well as government and institutional facilities. Products include burglary and fire alarm systems, exit alarm-locks and digital-access control locks, video surveillance systems such as cameras and monitors, and emergency communications systems. Napco also buys and resells security devices made by third-party manufacturers. The company sells its products worldwide mainly through independent distributors, dealers, and installers of security equipment.

  <p>
   Napco operates manufacturing plants in the US and the Dominican Republic, and a sales office in the UK. The US accounts for nearly 95% of its net revenues.

  <p>
   Napco operates through four divisions and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alarm Lock, Continental Access Systems, and Marks USA. Its three three primary product lines include access control systems (identification readers, hand scanners, locking devices), alarm systems (detectors, control panels, and signaling equipment), and video surveillance systems (cameras and monitors).

  <p>
   The company's products are installed worldwide in commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and government applications. Napco sells to 15,000 security dealers, integrators, locksmiths, contractors, and wholesalers of security alarm and security hardware equipment in more than 40 countries. These channels represented 53% of its total sales in 2013.

  <p>
   Napco's revenues hovered around the record-setting mark of $71 million from 2011 to 2013. Revenues remained stable in 2013 as the company experienced increased sales in its Marks brand door-locking products and Alarm Lock brand door-locking products. The company also experienced a decrease in demand for its intrusion products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits grew 32% from $2.3 million in 2012 to $3 million in 2013 due to decreased interest expenses, a positive shift in product mix, and a decrease in its investing activities.

  <p>
   Going forward, Napco intends to exploit its breadth of equipment offerings by targeting security concerns expressed by the

   and other agencies. Concurrently it is introducing new products with higher-profit margins and high-growth security applications, such as schools, hospitals, and offices.
