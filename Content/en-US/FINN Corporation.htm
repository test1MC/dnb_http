   FINN isn't adverse to water, but its products do work better on land. The company manufactures a line of landscape and erosion control machinery, which are used for mulching, seed distribution, watering, fire and dust suppression, fertilizing, straw blowing, and other purposes. FINN also sells turf-enhancing additives such as plant hormones, microbial bacteria (to aid germination and fight disease), and polymers. Its customers include golf courses, land development companies, residential and commercial landscaping businesses, fire departments, sports fields, and farmers. Selling its products through dealers, FINN distributes throughout the US and Canada, and also distributes to select international markets.

   In addition to its landscaping and erosion products, the company sells alternative covering machinery and related covering products to landfill companies. FINN's landfill customers use the machinery to spray a daily cover on landfills instead of soil to suppress odors, compress materials, and otherwise submerge the contents of the landfill.

   FINN grows its national footprint by augmenting its dealer network. In 2015 the company signed a dealer agreement with Thomson Equipment and Yukon Equipment to increase coverage in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The deal gave the companies access to sell FINN HydroSeeders, Straw Blowers, and Bark Blowers.
