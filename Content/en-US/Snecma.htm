   Engines are the driving force behind Snecma (Société Nationale d'Étude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Avion). The manufacturer of engines for aircraft and rockets is the oldest engine maker in the world and one of the largest engine makers worldwide, along with

    GE Aircraft Engines
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41834">
    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="99062">
    Pratt &amp; Whitney
   </company>
   . Nearly a century of acquisitions have added aircraft equipment and services to its offerings. The Messier-Dowty unit is a leader among landing gear companies, and Messier-Bugatti is Europe's braking systems leader. Snecma was acquired by electronics maker Sagem in 2005 and the two companies combined to form

  <p>
   Snecma traces its roots back to Louis Seguin, a descendant of the Montgolfier brothers, who ushered in the Golden Age of Ballooning in 1783. Seguin founded a company by the name of Gnome in 1905, adding car engine production to that of gasoline engines already under way.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1914 Gnome pooled its design and production resources with engine maker Le Rhone and bought out the company the next year. At the outbreak of WWI, some 4,000 Gnome engines already were powering aircraft for Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul-Louis Weiller -- war hero and inventor of aerial photography -- was named head of Gnome &amp; Rhone in 1922. The company's strong performance led to its stock market listing, as well as a global reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1945 Gnome &amp; Rhone became Société Nationale d'Étude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Avion (Snecma), with the French government holding two-thirds of the company. During the late 1950s Snecma started to diversify into equipment. In 1968 it acquired power transmission maker Hispano-Suiza, which in turn owned Bugatti, a manufacturer of landing gears.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snecma linked up with General Electric Aircraft Engines (US) in 1974 in a joint venture known as CFM International, formed to manage the CFM56 engine program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jean-Paul Béchat, a career veteran of Snecma, was named chairman and CEO of the company in 1996. Béchat began building up its aircraft services as a buffer against the cyclicality of aerospace manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Snecma converted itself into a holding company and created Snecma Moteurs to consolidate its air and space propulsion operations. During the year Snecma expanded through a series of acquisitions. It took control of the Labinal group (propulsion equipment, aircraft systems and electrical wiring) and Hurel-Dubois. Through the latter buy, Snecma created Hurel Hispano, the European leader in engine nacelles and thrust reversers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company announced that it would delay an IPO (amounting to about 30% of Snecma) in light of the poor aerospace market. In 2004 plans for an IPO were back on; the French government finally sold 35% of Snecma in June 2004, raising about $1.76 billion. In October of 2004 French electronics maker
   <company id="90795">
    Sagem
   </company>
   announced that it was making a bid to acquire Snecma in an $8.9 billion merger. Snecma's board agreed to the deal in November of 2004. The merger was completed in May of 2005, creating the SAFRAN Group. Jean-Paul Béchat stepped aside as chairman and CEO of Snecma, becoming chairman of the SAFRAN management board, and was succeeded by Mark Ventre.
  </p>
  <p>
   CFM International booked multiple orders for CFM56 engines in 2006, including a $1 billion order from
   <company id="11377">
    Southwest Airlines
   </company>
   , for deliveries to take place between 2007 and 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2006 Marc Ventre, chairman and CEO of Snecma, was promoted to EVP of aerospace propulsion with the SAFRAN Group. Philippe Petitcolin, the one-time CEO of Labinal, was named to succeed Ventre as chairman and CEO of Snecma.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 General Electra and Snecma extended their partnership by more than 30 years to 2040.
