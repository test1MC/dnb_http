   Yamaha Corporation of America (YCA) and its customers make beautiful music together. The North American arm of Japan's

   , YCA is a top supplier of musical instruments nationwide. YCA's products include pianos and electronic keyboards, woodwind and brass instruments, electric guitars and otherwise, and drums. Its Yamaha Commercial Audio Systems subsidiary makes audio products and distributes Nexo speakers in North America. Established in 1960, it's also a top supplier of home audio and video equipment, such as stereo receivers, home theater systems, DVD and CD players, loudspeakers, and video displays. Its other units include Yamaha Music Interactive and Yamaha Entertainment Group of America.

  <p>
   The company serves North America, selling its audio products in the US and Canada. North America generated about 15% of Yamaha Corporation's 2013 total revenue.

   YCA is one of Yamaha Corporation's largest subsidiaries. YCA operates wholly owned subsidiary Yamaha Commercial Audio Systems (YCAS), which sells a line of commercial audio products for the US and Canadian markets and distributes Nexo-branded speakers in the US and Canada. Yamaha Electronics Corporation (YEC), which also operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary, offers audio and video products to the US home entertainment market. Its Music Marketing Group (MMG) operates several sales and marketing divisions for specific product groups, such as piano and keyboard products, band and orchestral instruments, live sound and music production products, guitars, drums, and consumer products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides its product divisions, YCA operates corporate administrative divisions, such as Finance, Information Technology, Operations, Human Resources, Customer Financial Services, Advertising &amp; Creative Services, and Administration.
  </p>
  <p>
   YCA manages pertinent artist relations from five US-based facilities: Yamaha Artist Services, Inc. (YASI) in New York City; Yamaha Artist Services Nashville (YASN) in Franklin, Tennessee; Yamaha Artist Services Indianapolis (YASIN); Yamaha Artist Services Burbank (YASB); and the Los Angeles Atelier in Buena Park, California.

  <p>
   YCA accounts for 15% of Yamaha Corporation's sales. North American sales rose some 10% in 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to higher sales of all music instruments and its audio visual products through major mass retailers. Piano sales rose year-over-year while wind instruments saw a boost from rental demand. Professional audio equipment sales were brisk, as well, thanks to new product launches during the second half of the fiscal year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following previous declines in the US, the company's parent had reorganized its production structure and shuttered factories that made pianos and wind instruments.

  <p>
   Parent Yamaha is expecting sales growth in 2014 by product in the digital musical instruments and professional audio equipment sectors. Regionally, it's banking on North America and China, as well as other emerging markets in key countries. The company has been focused on electric acoustic guitars, guitar peripherals, and drums as it seeks to grow sales in its key North American business as the economy rebounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   To streamline its operations, Yamaha in 2012 folded its Yamaha Electronics Corporation USA (YEC), which is responsible for US sales and marketing activities for audiovisual products, into YCA. As part of the move, Yamaha is able to house these functions in one building in Buena Park, California, and better coordinate its administrative business processes and implement collaborated sales and marketing of musical instruments and audio visual products.

  <p>
   As part of its focus, YCA targets a variety of markets to expand its customer base. It caters to hobbyists, education, worship, professionals, and the installation and consumer markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost marketing of its musical instruments, Yamaha has put considerable muscle behind its artist relation efforts in recent years, such as signing endorsement deals with such recording artists as Anton Fig (from the
   <em>
    Late Night with David Letterman
   </em>
   show), Elton John, and Alicia Keys. The company also inked a deal with Walt Disney to become the official supplier of musical instruments for its Disneyland Resort theme park.
