   Anheuser-Busch (A-B) has brewed up a billion-dollar business with its Buds. The company is best known for brewing Budweiser, one of the world's largest-selling beers by volume. Other A-B labels include Bud Light, Busch, Michelob, O'Doul's, and Kirin under license. A-B's dozen breweries ships beverages to about 600 independent wholesalers nationwide. Besides beer, the company also produces distilled beverages, energy drinks, and non-alcoholic malt beverages. It has operated as a subsidiary of
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   (AB InBev), the world's largest beer maker, since the Belgium brewer acquired A-B for $52 billion in 2008.

   's market position, A-B offers some 200 beer brands and holds a nearly 50% share in US beer sales to retailers. A-B's non-alcohol brews include O'Doul's, malt liquors King Cobra and Hurricane Ice, and specialty malts (via an alliance with

   non-alcoholic beverages, including Monster Energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep all its products moving, the brewer distributes them through a network of more than 600 independent wholesalers and company-owned distributors in Massachusetts, Ohio, Colorado, Oregon, California, Kentucky, New York, Hawaii, and Oklahoma. Its business is supported through the company's dozen US breweries. Incidentally, it's a major maker of aluminum cans and a top recycler of them for three decades).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its business, A-B operates the global Busch Agricultural Resources, which sources and produces raw materials for its brew masters, and an extensive packing operation that includes Anheuser-Bush Packaging Group, Metal Container Corp., Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corp., Longhorn Glass Corp., and Eagle Packaging.

   A-B has continued to evolve its business by tapping the premium and specialty beer markets. In 2011 it bought Chicago's Goose Island Beer (also known as Fulton Street Brewery) from
   <company id="44090">
    Craft Brewers Alliance
   </company>
   for $38 million. Licensing agreements have helped to extend A-B's reach. It has a licensing agreement with Japan's
   <company id="41768">

   ), in Italy through
   <company id="41852">

  <p>
   Worldwide sales of Budweiser, considered the national beer brand of the US, grew 6% in 2012 after the brand's introduction in Brazil and Ukraine. It generated more than 10% of AB InBev's global volumes in 2012. Bud sales outside the US now account for just over half the beer's volume.

   A-B also shares in the cost saving synergies created by its takeover as well as the benefits from exchanging best practices in sales, distribution, and marketing, to name a few. The company became the North American headquarters of the Belgium brewer after the combination.

  <p>
   George Schneider founded the Bavarian Brewery in St. Louis in 1852. Eight years later he sold the unprofitable brewery to Eberhard Anheuser. Anheuser's son-in-law, Adolphus Busch, joined the company in 1864 and in 1876 assisted restaurateur Carl Conrad in creating Budweiser, a light beer like those brewed in Bohemia. The brewery's rapid growth was based in part on the popularity of Budweiser over heavier, darker beers.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Adolphus died in 1913, his son August took over the company, which was renamed Anheuser-Busch Companies in 1919. During Prohibition (1920-33), August saved the company by selling yeast, refrigeration units, truck bodies, syrup, and soft drinks. When repeal came in 1933, August quickly resumed brewing; he delivered a case of Budweiser to Franklin Roosevelt in a carriage drawn by Clydesdale horses, which became Anheuser-Busch's symbol.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anheuser-Busch acquired the
   <company id="46730">
    St. Louis Cardinals
   </company>
   baseball team in 1953. Four years later the brewer knocked Schlitz out of first place among US brewers. In 1959 the company established its Busch Entertainment theme park division.
  </p>
  <p>
   August Busch III was named CEO in 1975, beginning a reign that would last 27 years. The company bought Campbell Taggart (baked goods) and created its Eagle snack foods unit in 1982. Budweiser was introduced in England and Japan in 1984 through licensing. In 1989 Anheuser-Busch acquired SeaWorld from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anheuser-Busch formed a joint venture with Kirin Brewery in 1993 to distribute Budweiser in Japan. In 1999 the arrangement became a licensing agreement. The company also acquired a minority stake in Redhook Ale Brewery in 1994 and rights to distribute Redhook products. (Redhook Ale changed its name to
   <company id="44090">
    Craft Brewers Alliance
   </company>
   in 2008.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Anheuser-Busch sold the Cardinals baseball team and stadium for $150 million and spun off its Campbell Taggart baking unit in 1996. The company then closed its Eagle Snacks unit, completing its exit from the food business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To increase its presence internationally, Anheuser-Busch acquired interests in brewers in China (Budweiser Wuhan International Brewing) in 1995 and Argentina (Compañía Cervecerías) and Brazil (Antarctica Paulista) in 1996. To boost its presence in the specialty beer sector, the company began brewing and selling Kirin beers in the US in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company increased its holding in GRUPO MODELO from 18% (acquired in 1993) to about 50%. In 1999 Anheuser-Busch sold its interest in Brazilian brewer, Antarctica Paulista.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 the company purchased nearly 20% of top Chilean brewer Compañía Cervecerías to further develop its business in Latin America. In February of that year the company sold its SeaWorld Cleveland theme park to Six Flags, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company veteran Patrick Stokes became the first nonfamily member to lead Anheuser-Busch when he succeeded Busch III (who remained chairman) as president and CEO in 2002. Later in the year, Anheuser-Busch introduced Michelob Ultra, claiming it as the first low-carbohydrate beer. Also in 2002 the company sold its communications arm, Busch Creative Services, to a group of that operation's top executives.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its focus on international growth, in 2003 Anheuser-Busch began selling Budweiser in the Dominican Republic through local distributor Bacardi Dominicana. In August, rival
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   dropped distribution of Budweiser in Italy as the competitor moved toward an Italian launch of Miller Genuine Draft. Anheuser-Busch signed a new licensing agreement for marketing Bud in Italy with
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   . Capitalizing on the success of

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Busch introduced B

   , a new flavored brew containing caffeine, guarana, and ginseng. It was largely seen as a brand to compete in bars where energy drinks and flavored spirits have seen growing popularity. That year the company lost its

   sponsorship to
   <company id="12519">

   <company id="91611">
    Grolsch
   </company>
   brand beers in 2005 as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   August A. Busch IV took over as president and CEO in 2006, replacing Patrick Stokes, who moved to the role of chairman. Busch IV, great great grandchild of company co-founder, Adolphus Busch, was the fifth generation of the family to run the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   A-B launched a new energy drink in 2006 called 180 Blue, featuring the acai berry as an ingredient. In late 2006 A-B struck a deal to import some of InBev's premium European labels, including Beck's, Bass Pale Ale, and Stella Artois. The company followed up in 2007 with a deal to be the US importer of Czech beer, Czechvar Premium Czech Larger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made its first foray into India in 2007, forming a 50-50 joint venture with Crown Beers India to make and sell A-B products in the country. A dominant Indian brewer, Crown offers India's thirsty throngs such well-known brands as Kingfisher. Adding to its small brewery holdings that year, A-B formed a joint venture with Fordham Brewing to buy Virginia-based craft brewer, Old Dominion. The operation is named Coastal Brewing and is 51% owned by Fordham and 49% owned by A-B.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 A-B established a subsidiary called 9th Street Beverages, in order to expand the company's non-alcohol energy drinks, high-end waters, and other non-alcohol specialty brands. These included 180 Energy, BORBA Skin Balance Water, Icelandic Glacial, and Monster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late 2008 InBev acquired A-B; InBev's initial $47 billion bid received a cool reception from the St. Louis cornerstone brewer. In a counter-move, A-B started informal talks with GRUPO MODELO; the addition of the Corona brewer to its operations was intended to to make A-B too expensive for InBev's tastes. The MODELO talks, however, fell though. In an effort to avoid a costly hostile takeover, InBev subsequently sweetened its offer by several billion dollars to approximately $52 billion and won A-B's acceptance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anheuser president and CEO, August A. Busch IV, stepped down from his managerial role and became a non-executive board member of the new company and has largely slipped from public view. Less than a month after the merger, the new company announced that as a cost-cutting measure it would eliminate 1,400 jobs in the US. Representing about 6% of its US workforce, most of the layoffs took place at Anheuser-Busch's former St. Louis headquarters.
