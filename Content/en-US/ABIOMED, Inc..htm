   ABIOMED gives weary hearts a rest. The medical device maker has developed a range of cardiac assist devices and is developing a self-contained artificial heart. Its Impella micro heart pumps can temporarily take over blood circulation during surgery or catheterization. Its AB5000 ventricular assist device temporarily takes over the heart's pumping function and improves circulatory flow in patients with acute heart failure, thus allowing their hearts to rest and recover. ABIOMED markets its products through both a direct sales force and distributors.

  <p>
   ABIOMED has also developed a battery-powered, implantable replacement heart system called AbioCor, which can be used to extend life for dying patients who aren't eligible for a heart transplant. ABIOMED developed the AbioCor system based on technology developed at
   <company id="40360">
    Pennsylvania State University
   </company>
   . However, due to the limited number of patients that qualify for use of the AbioCor, the company places little emphasis on marketing efforts for this product line.
  </p>

  <p>
   While many of ABIOMED's products are approved for use in other countries, international sales to Canada, parts of Europe, Asia, South America, and the Middle East only make up some 10% of its revenue. The company intends to improve its international results with more sales and support teams in Europe. It manufactures its Impella products at a facility in Germany while the rest of its products are made in Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its locations in Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany, the company has a sales and marketing office in Paris and another office in Tokyo, where it is preparing for a commercial launch of products.

  <p>
   After years of steady sales growth, ABIOMED made its first profit in 2012. Sales have continued to rise and, in fiscal 2015 (ended March), revenue rose 25% to $230.3 million on higher sales of the Impella system. This was largely due to disposable catheter sales in the US and growing business in Europe, primarily Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped more than 1,000% in fiscal 2015 to $113.7 million. That sharp increase was driven both by the higher revenues and changes in income tax benefit provisions. Operating cash flow increased 84% to $43.3 million that year.

  <p>
   The company's research efforts are focused on developing new products for acute heart failure patients, as well as next-generation versions and support systems for its existing products. The company has shifted more of its development and sales efforts onto the Impella product line in order to expand its uses and variations while gradually discontinuing its other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to expanding its product portfolio and approvals, the company also dedicates personnel and financial resources to raising awareness of its products in the medical community. ABIOMED also continuously evaluates opportunities for strategic acquisitions. To that end, it acquired a German heart catheter pump maker in 2014, expanding its product line and German sales efforts.

  <p>
   In 2014, as part of its plan to expand it product line and its German sales force, ABIOMED purchased Berlin-based ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft for $14 million. ECP produces heart catheter pumps that use an external drive shaft to increase circulation.

  <p>
   David Lederman founded ABIOMED in 1981 to make products he had designed (such as artificial heart pumps and valves), as well as dental diagnostic products. ABIOMED went public in 1987. In 1988 it got about $1 million from the National Institutes of Health for heart replacement device (HRD) research and development. In 1990 it began working with Canada's World Heart on HRD technology. In 1992 ABIOMED launched BVS-5000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company formed ABIODENT to consolidate its dental operations. It received FDA clearance to market the PerioTemp device in 1994. In 1996 it voluntarily recalled some of its BVS-5000 blood pumps, citing component irregularities (it said no patients were affected).
  </p>
  <p>
   To fund product development, ABIOMED accepted government funding to finish testing its battery-powered HRD (1996) and to develop a laser-based tissue-welding system (1998). Biotech firm Genzyme invested about $15 million in ABIOMED that year, acquiring 14% of the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998, ABIOMED again recalled some lots of BVS-5000, this time for electrical problems. The company attributed 1998's losses to an increase in self-funding on the HRD project, as well as to red ink in its now-discontinued dental business.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABIOMED received funding from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institutes in 2000 to support the testing of its AbioCor product, an implantable heart replacement device. The following year AbioCor became the first artificial heart implanted in a patient.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FDA approved the use of the artificial hearts in five patients in 2001, all of whom were considered too sick to receive heart transplants. The first patient died the same year, but the cause of death was not attributed to AbioCor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fifth patient to receive the device died early in 2002. By late 2002 seven patients had been fitted with the device, but only one was living. A moratorium on recruiting new patients was imposed. ABIOMED wanted patients that were healthy enough to live long past the time of implantation, but only patients that were extremely ill would be considered candidates for the device.
  </p>
  <p>
   By January of 2003 the moratorium had been lifted and three more patients had received implants by March. Because of the troubles with finding qualified recipients for its AbioCor product, the company began focusing on other products to sustain revenues. It got good news on that front that same year when the FDA approved ABIOMED's AB5000 Circulatory Support System Console, a device that temporarily pumps the patient's blood when the heart has failed.
