   Audiophiles beware -- Polk Audio is letting the masses in on its speaker secret. The company makes and markets home and car loudspeakers under the Polk Audio brand that range from elaborate home theater systems to small bookshelf speakers to satellite radio home component tuners. Polk Audio sells its products through audio specialty and mass retailers in North America, distributors in more than 75 other countries, and online. The company was founded in 1972 by Johns Hopkins classmates Matthew Polk, George Klopfer, and Sandy Gross. Today it is a subsidiary of

   To its benefit and as part of its strategy, Polk Audio's engineers and designers hold 65-plus patents in pioneering audio design and technology. To this end, the company regularly lends its expertise to others through partnerships. In 2014, for instance, the company launched the new 4 Shot Headset for

  <p>
   Graduates of Johns Hopkins University, Matthew Polk, a physics major, and George Klopfer, a history major, started Polk Audio in 1972 with just $3,000. (They chose Polk's name because it was easier to pronounce.) By focusing on performance rather than frills, they built the company rapidly during the late 1970s and 1980s, aided by consumers willing to pay for high-end products. The firm went public in 1986. But as the economic boom quieted in the early 1990s, Polk fell on harder times, including a loss of almost $900,000 due to a failed attempt to acquire British electronics manufacturer AGI in 1991.

  <p>
   A restructuring in 1995 included shifting most production to Tijuana, Mexico, and hiring a new president, James Herd, formerly with rival
   <company id="40673">
    Bose Corporation
   </company>
   . Banking on home theater sound as the future of the industry, Polk created a new corporate entity, Eosone, the next year to make home theater loudspeakers sold mainly at
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Financial necessity has pushed the company to consider new sales channels. In 1997 Polk inked agreements to incorporate its technology in
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   computers and
   <company id="58187">
    Samsung
   </company>
   TVs. Still, sales sank that year; the company blamed a soft electronics market. It struck a deal in 1998 to sell its products at
   <company id="56992">
    Circuit City
   </company>
   stores. Polk also agreed to sell its Eosone trademark and its stake in speaker maker
   <company id="55772">
    Genesis Technologies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999, after more than a year of lackluster stock performance, management decided to take the company private.
  </p>
  <p>
   Polk Audio began selling its products at Best Buy and
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   retail stores in 2008.
