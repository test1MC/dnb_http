   Red Dot has expanded in the past through the use of acquisitions. In 2011 it picked up JBAR A/C, an Ohio-based designer and maker of off-the shelf heating and AC units for heavy-duty vehicles. The deal strengthened Red Dot's presence in the eastern US and Canada.

  <p>
   Red Dot was founded by H.G. "Harky" Runnings, who started making custom-designed, heavy-duty radiators and heaters while he was running his own radiator service shop in the late 1950s. A family-owned business for the first 35 years of its history, Red Dot became employee-owned when Runnings transferred 100% ownership of the company to the Red Dot Employee Stock Ownership Program in 2000. The company is still run by the Runnings' family -- Harky's grandson Randy Gardiner is Red Dot's president.
