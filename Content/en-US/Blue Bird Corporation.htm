   Blue Bird (formerly Hennessy Capital Acquisition) is from the "old school" of bus manufacturers. The largest school bus maker in the US, Blue Bird also produces commercial and specialty/activity buses such as security buses, shell buses, and buses for export. School buses vary in size, engine location, and fuel used. Independent distributors sell the buses to school districts, churches, businesses, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. It also provides financing services through its Blue Bird Financial Services affiliate. In late 2014 Hennessy Capital Acquisition acquired Blue Bird Global and changed its name to Blue Bird Corporation.

  <p>
   The company's buses are globally exported to 60 countries throughout Africa, Asia/Pacific, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. In Georgia, Blue Bird builds around 10,000 buses a year at its Fort Valley plant.

   Growing its geographic coverage, in 2013 Blue Bird added Dynamic Specialty Vehicles to its dealer network to serve British Columbia and the Yukon Territory; it also added Busworx Blue Bird as its dealer for Alabama, and Carter Machinery Company, for Virginia.

   To meet government requirements for greater fuel efficiency and fewer emissions, Blue Bird has adopted

   SCR (selective catalytic reduction) technology, which allows the company to make propane-powered buses and activity vehicles that are less expensive to run than diesel or gas equivalents and will comply with
   <company id="130205">

   </company>
   's emissions standards. With federal and local governments and agencies giving incentives to fleets buying alternative fuel vehicles, Blue Bird is looking to tap these markets.
