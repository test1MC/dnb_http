   Horizon Pharma sees commercial drug success in its future. The biopharmaceutical develops medicines for arthritis, pain, and inflammatory diseases through its three operating subsidiaries in the US, Switzerland, and Germany. Its DUEXIS and Vimovo pills combine two existing drugs to treat mild to moderate pain from rheumatoid arthritis while reducing the risk of stomach ulcers associated with some pain relievers. Its RAYOS (known as LODOTRA outside the US) is a form of prednisone, formulated to reduce morning stiffness from rheumatoid arthritis. Horizon Pharma sells its products in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The company bought
   <company id="102289">
    Raptor Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   in 2016 for some $800 million.

  <p>
   Net proceeds from its $46 million initial public offering were used to fund the remaining clinical development, regulatory approval, and US commercialization efforts. DUEXIS received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval in 2011.

  <p>
   With DUEXIS Horizon is hoping it has built a better mousetrap. There are already plenty of effective pain relief medications on the market, but existing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also result in upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as ulcers. DUEXIS and Vimovo (purchased from AstraZeneca in 2014) are designed to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced GI complications.  Part of the company's marketing strategy will be to make physicians who prescribe NSAIDs aware of GI complications and the need to treat both arthritic pain and side effects from existing treatments.

   Horizon partners with
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , Mundipharma, and
   <company id="57592">
    SkyePharma
   </company>
   to produce its products.

  <p>
   The company sells RAYOS with its own sales force in the US and through Mundipharma in the Middle East and Africa, co-promotes DUEXIS with Mallinckrodt in the US, and licenses DUEXIS to Gr√ºnenthal for sales in Latin America. It licenses Vimovo for sale in the US from its owner, AstraZeneca.

  <p>
   With its products finally being on the market, Horizon really started to show positive financial results in 2012. It reported a 183% increase in revenue due to a full year of DUEXIS sales, higher LODOTRA sales, and Mundipharma's contributions from selling RAYOS. The company isn't fully in the black yet but net loss improved by 22% and cash flow increased by $73 million.

  <p>
   Horizon Pharma's broader strategy is to build a fully-integrated, US-focused pharmaceutical business, with a commercial sales, marketing, and distribution force for US sales. It will continue to work with partners to commercialize its products overseas. The company has also said it will look to in-license additional products while continuing its R&amp;D. To that end, it acquired the US rights to DUEXIS competitor Vimovo from AstraZeneca in early 2014.
