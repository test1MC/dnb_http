   CryoLife preserves lives by conserving the tissues that sustain them. The company takes human heart valves and blood vessels from deceased volunteer donors, processes them, and stores them in liquid nitrogen freezers (a process called cryopreservation). It then ships them to US surgeons, who implant them during surgical procedures. For some preserved tissue, the company uses its proprietary SynerGraft technology, which reduces the presence of donor cells and makes the tissue more compatible with the recipient. CryoLife also develops implantable biomaterials, including BioGlue, an adhesive used to seal internal surgical wounds.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has two reportable operating segments: Medical Devices (57% of sales in 2014) and Preservation Services (43% of sales). The Medical Devices segment sells products including surgical sealants BioGlue, BioFoam, and PerClot; the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line; and pericardial patch PhotoFix. The Preservation Services segment preserves cardiac and vascular tissues.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the center of the company's product development efforts is its SynerGraft decellularization technology, which not only disinfects donated tissue but also removes some donor cells and aims to reduce the risk that a recipient's body will reject the implanted tissue. CryoLife's CryoValve SG pulmonary heart valve is its first human heart valve using the SynerGraft process. A second SynerGraft product is the CryoPatch human cardiac patch material.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Georgia, CryoLife generates almost 80% of its revenues in the US. The company has marketing centers in the UK, Singapore, Argentina, and Germany, and representation in 75 countries worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of the US, it markets its products in Europe, Africa, India, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its preservation services and products directly to physicians. In the US, its cardiac specialists market to cardiac surgeons, while cardiovascular specialists market to vascular surgeons.
  </p>
  <p>
   European subsidiary Europa markets and distributes the Company's range of services and products, in both of its reportable segments, through its direct sales representatives in the U.K., Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Ireland and through a network of independent distributors in the rest of the EMEA region. Europa also distributes tissue to certain hospitals in the EMEA region, primarily in Austria, Germany, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported advertising expenses of $821,000 in 2014, down from $880,000 in 2013 and $1.5 million in 2012.

  <p>
   CryoLife revenues have seen slow growth over the past five years. In 2014 revenue grew 3% to $145 million, primarily on higher BioGlue sales but also on increased sales of PerClot and HeRO Graft. The surgical sealants line, of which BioGlue is a part, saw higher international sales and -- to a lesser extent -- higher domestic sales. PerClot sales rose in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific, as the company entered new geographies and as PerClot was used for new indications. Finally, HeRO Graft sales rose primarily in the US, where more surgeons are using the line.
  </p>
  <p>
   After peaking in 2013, largely due to CryoLife's sale of its stake in development firm Medafor, net income fell 55% to $7 million in 2014. The decline was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses, plus a decline in the gains on sale of the Medafor investment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations declined 52% to $8 million in 2014.

  <p>
   In recent years, CryoLife has been focused on expanding its cardiovascular market offerings through physician education efforts, the expansion of its network of donating tissue and organ procurement organizations, and the development of new products and technologies. As part of its strategy to zero in on cardiovascular products, CryoLife completed the phase-out of its orthopedic tissue operations. CryoLife is repositioning its products portfolio with higher growth, higher margin medical devices for cardiac and vascular surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
   CryoLife is also focused on developing the market for BioGlue and creating similar products using its underlying Protein Hydrogel Technology. To that end, the company conducts clinical trials in the US on BioFoam as a treatment for severe bleeding of the liver and spleen following transplant surgery. It already sells the product in some markets in Europe. Century Medical is CryoLife's distribution partner in Japan. BioGlue revenues account for more than 40% of CryoLife's total revenues, making the company quite reliant on BioGlue's sales for success. The company is selling PerClot in Europe through distributors as part of an agreement with SMI. CryoLife is seeking FDA approval to distribute PerClot in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategies for growth include expanding into new markets (including emerging markets) and developing new direct sales territories abroad. In 2014 the company established CryoLife Asia Pacific to expand into that growing region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, the company entered into an agreement with Genesee Biomedical to exclusively distribute the PhotoFix line. After PhotoFix sales reached $1.4 million in 2015, the company went ahead and bought the product outright in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016, Cryolife sold its Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow Graft (HeRO Graft) product line for end-stage renal disease to
   <company id="15310">
    Merit Medical Systems
   </company>
   for $18.5 million. It also sold distribution rights for ProCol, another solution for end-stage renal disease in certain hemodialysis patients, to
   <company id="139709">
    LeMaitre Vascular
   </company>
   . Those moves further underscored the firm's focus on valve repair and surgery products.

   The company bought Texas-based mechanical heart valve company On-X Life Technologies for $130 million in early 2016. On-X's products have been gaining in sales, and CryoLife plans to take advantage of its entry into the market with a sales and marketing push.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1984.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   When the University of Alabama began using cryopreserved heart valves instead of the mechanical ones he sold, Roy Holloway saw an opportunity. In 1984 he teamed with Steven Anderson, a former marketing executive at pacemaker manufacturer Intermedics (now Guidant) to offer cryopreservation services to hospitals and medical examiners' offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   CryoLife initially met resistance to its cryopreserved valves (harvested from hearts unsuitable for transplanting). But as word of the valves' superiority spread, CryoLife began to grow. (Cryopreserved human valves do not fail, like mechanical ones, or calcify, like pig valves.)
  </p>
  <p>
   CryoLife went public in 1993. In 1995 it bought the rights to the synergraft technology. The next year it bought United Cryopreservation Foundation, expanding its line of body parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 CryoLife started selling BioGlue in Europe. It also diversified into surgical instruments with the purchase of Ideas for Medicine (IFM). The next year CryoLife sold IFM's product line to Horizon Medical Products (HMP). But HMP's failure to fulfill a supply contract that was part of the deal forced CryoLife to take a charge in 1999. In 2000 CryoLife was hit by publicity surrounding press reports highlighting the profits derived from the "sale" of body parts harvested along with major organs from volunteer donors. The next year it formed AuraZyme Pharmaceuticals to develop light-activated drug delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The year 2002 was a tough one for CryoLife, as questions from the FDA about the safety of CryoLife's human tissue and heart valves put the company on the defensive. Following the 2001 death of a patient who received a CryoLife implant as well as an inspection of the company's facilities, the FDA issued a recall of some of CryoLife's already distributed products, saying it couldn't guarantee that the tissue wasn't contaminated. Several years of legal  troubles and financial losses followed. The company has since laid to rest the lawsuits related to the recall, including a class action suit that it settled in 2005 by agreeing to pay $23 million. It returned to profitability in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made a deal with fellow human tissue processor
   <company id="100824">
    RTI Surgical
   </company>
   , under which CryoLife transferred the bulk of its orthopedic tissue business to RTI in return for that company's cardiovascular and vascular processing arrangements in 2006.
