   Suzuki Motor Corporation is a leading Japanese carmaker and a global motorcycle manufacturer, competing head-to-head with rivals

   and

   . Suzuki's passenger car models include the Alto, Grand Vitara, Swift, Splash, and SX4. Its motorcycle products include cruiser, motocross, offroad, scooter, street, and touring models, as well as ATVs. Suzuki Motor's non-vehicle products include outboard motors for boats and motorized wheelchairs. It builds its lineup on its own and through numerous subsidiaries and joint ventures overseas. Japan accounts for nearly 45% of sales. Suzuki entered the US car market in 1985 with the Samurai, the country' first compact SUV.

   The company has man production facilities in 22 countries and serves more than 200 countries. Outside of Japan (around 45% of its total sales), Asian consumers represent nearly 35% of its sales, whereas North American and European purchases combined account for nearly 15%. Suzuki subsidiary

   Suzuki divides its operations into four reportable segments. The Automobile segment generated 88% of the company's total sales for 2012, while its motorcycle operations accounted for 10%. The other segments -- marine and power products; and financial services -- accounted for the remaining 2%.

  <p>
   Suzuki's balance sheet has been up and down over the years. After posting increases in both revenue and net income in 2011, the company saw its revenues decrease by 4% in 2012. The lower revenue was attributed to a 1% decrease in its motorcycle segment and a 4% dip in its automobile segment. The company, however, did recognize a 19% increase in its net income for 2012 due to lower expenses related to sales, marketing, and promotions.

   Suzuki is expanding its vehicle lineup in China through Suzuki China, which imports and sells Japanese-made cars. The company imports and exports Suzuki-brand vehicles through
   <company id="153635">
    Suzuki Automobile (Thailand)
   </company>
   , a joint venture with Siam International Corp. Demand in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia has continued to grow modestly, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Suzuki began construction of a new motorcycle plant in Rohtak, Haryana of India and a second plant through Chongqing Changan Suzuki Automobile, Co., Ltd. (Changan Suzuki), an automobile manufacturing and sales joint venture company in China. The Indian motorcycle market in 2011 exceeded 13 million units, and Suzuki expects continuous growth in the region. To capitalize on the expanding Chinese automobile market and to establish an annual capacity of 500,000 units, Suzuki has decided to construct its second plant in the area next to its current plant.

   In 1909 Michio Suzuki started Suzuki Loom Works in Hamamatsu, Japan. The company went public in 1920 and continued producing weaving equipment until the onset of WWII, when it began to make war-related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suzuki began developing inexpensive motor vehicles in 1947, and in 1952 it introduced a 36cc engine to motorize bicycles. The company changed its name to Suzuki Motor and launched its first motorcycle in 1954. Suzuki's entry into the minicar market came in 1955 with the Suzulight, followed by the Suzumoped (1958), a delivery van (1959), and the Suzulight Carry FB small truck (1961).
  </p>
  <p>
   Suzuki's triumph in the 1962 50cc-class Isle of Man TT motorcycle race started a string of racing successes that brought international prominence to the Suzuki name. The company established its first overseas plant in Thailand in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Suzuki met market demand for motorcycles with large engines. Meanwhile, a mid-1970s recession and falling demand for low-powered cars in Japan led the minicar industry there to produce two-thirds fewer minicars in 1974 than in 1970. Suzuki responded by pushing overseas, beginning auto exports, and expanding foreign distribution. In 1975 it started producing motorcycles in Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suzuki boosted capacity internationally throughout the 1980s through joint ventures. Motorcycle sales in Japan peaked in 1982, then tapered off, but enjoyed a modest rebound in the late 1980s. In 1988 the company agreed to handle distribution of Peugeot cars in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suzuki and
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   began their longstanding relationship in 1981 when GM bought a small stake in Suzuki. The company began producing Swift subcompacts in 1983 and sold them through GM as the Chevy Sprint and, later, the Geo Metro. In 1986 Suzuki and GM of Canada jointly formed CAMI Automotive to produce vehicles, including Sprints, Metros, and Geo Trackers (Suzuki Sidekicks), in Ontario; production began in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although sales via GM increased through 1990, US efforts with the Suzuki nameplate faltered shortly after Suzuki formed its US subsidiary in Brea, California, in 1986. A 1988
   <i>
    Consumer Reports
   </i>
   claim that the company's Samurai SUV was prone to rolling over devastated US sales. The next year Suzuki's top US executives quit, apparently questioning the company's commitment to the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suzuki established Magyar Suzuki, a joint venture with Hungarian automaker Autokonszern Rt., C. Itoh &amp; Co., and International Finance Corporation in 1991 to begin producing the Swift sedan in Hungary. The company expanded a licensing agreement with a Chinese government partner in 1993, becoming the first Japanese company to take an equity stake in a Chinese carmaking venture. The next year Suzuki introduced the Alto van, Japan's cheapest car, at just over $5,000, and the Wagon R miniwagon, which quickly became one of Japan's top-selling vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a case that was later overturned, a woman was awarded $90 million from Suzuki after being paralyzed in a Samurai rollover in 1990. The company sued Consumers Union, publisher of
   <i>
    Consumer Reports,
   </i>
   in 1996, charging it had intended to fix the results in the 1988 Samurai testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   GM raised its 3% stake in Suzuki to 10% in 1998. The company teamed up with GM and
   <company id="52361">
    Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru)
   </company>
   in 2000 to develop compact cars for the European market. It was also announced that GM would spend about $600 million to double its stake in Suzuki to 20%. In 2001 Suzuki announced that it had agreed to cooperate with Kawasaki in the development of new motorcycles, scooters, and ATVs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Suzuki agreed to take control of
   <company id="56733">
    Maruti Udyog Ltd.
   </company>
   , the state-owned India-based car manufacturer, in an $80 million rights issue deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   GM sold almost all of its 20% stake in Suzuki in early 2006 to raise cash for its own beleaguered operations. GM divested the remaining 3% stake in late 2008 for about $230 million as it endured a dire cash crisis.
