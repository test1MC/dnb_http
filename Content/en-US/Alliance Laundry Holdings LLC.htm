   Laundry day can't come often enough for Alliance Laundry Holdings (ALH). Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Alliance Laundry Systems, the company designs, makes, and markets commercial laundry equipment used in Laundromats, multi-housing laundry facilities (such as apartments, dormitories, and military bases), and on-premise laundries (hotels, hospitals, and prisons). Its washers and dryers are sold under the brands Speed Queen, UniMac, Huebsch, IPSO, and Cissell. They're sold primarily in the US and Canada, but also overseas. Investment firm BDT Capital Partners controls the company, which was founded in 1908.

        <p>
   North America is Wisconsin-based ALH's largest market, accounting for about 70% of sales. Europe and Asia each represent about 10% of sales. The remainder comes from markets in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. The company's manufacturing facilities are located in Wisconsin and Wevelgem, Belgium.

        <p>
   Commercial laundry equipment, service, and parts account for 98% of the firm's revenue. It also operates an equipment financing business, which accounts for the rest.

        <p>
   ALH relies on an expansive distribution network to bring its goods to market. The company's more than 550 distributors in North America and 150-plus international distributors serve its Laundromat and on-premise laundry customers. Its multifamily housing laundry customers are served by ALH's roster of more than 100 route operators.

        <p>
   The company's sales topped $505 million in 2012, a 10% increase compared with 2011. Net income fell 30% over the same period to $16.4 million, as a result of a loss from early retirement of debt and higher expenses. The company attributed the gain in sales (its third in as many years) to increases across all of its markets, with the exception of Europe. Increased sales volumes and price increases, primarily in the US and Canada, drove results. The strong performance over the past three years pushed sales to an all-time high following a drop-off during the recession.

        <p>
   Despite difficult economic conditions globally, ALH has seen its business strengthen, driven by resilience in North America and international expansion. (The company is fortunate that consumers view clean clothes as an necessity, with economic conditions historically having limited effect on frequency of use of commercial laundry equipment.) In the US and Canada the equipment financing business is posting higher earnings and demand for commercial laundry equipment is rising. Markets in Latin America, including Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, are driving double-digit sales growth in the region. Expansion in Asia, in such markets as Australia, China, the Philippines, and Thailand, is another growth driver.
  </p>
        <p>
   In pursuit of future growth, in 2013 the company completed a $23 million investment to increase production capacity for current and new products and to purchase tooling and equipment for its plant in Wisconsin. The expansion added more than 20,000 square feet to the plant's existing assembly, metal stamping,and press shop facilities. The project increased ALH's production capacity for small chassis washers and dryers by more than 40%, enabling the company to meet increasing consumer demand for its products.
