   Cepheid helps doctors and scientists see DNA faster. The molecular diagnostics firm develops and manufactures systems that automate the process of preparing and amplifying DNA in order to quickly detect diseases and harmful agents. Its two instrument platforms -- GeneXpert and SmartCycler -- can perform rapid molecular testing for a number of purposes, including diagnosing infectious diseases and cancer, as well as detecting biothreats such as anthrax. Cepheid also makes reagents (testing chemicals) and other disposable testing components for use with its systems. Medical and industrial device maker
   <company id="10434">
    Danaher Corporation
   </company>
   acquired Cepheid for some $4 billion in November 2016.

  <p>
   By being taken over by Danaher, Cepheid should be able to reach customers and patients more quickly and expand on a global basis. Danaher added Cepheid to its $5 billion diagnostics platform.

  <p>
   While Cepheid's test processing systems are big ticket items, the firm makes more money (about 80% of revenues) on sales of the disposable testing components, including DNA sample cartridges and diagnostic reagents. Cepheid's in vitro diagnostic product range includes common and complex pathogens ranging from
   <em>
    Streptococcus
   </em>
   and meningitis to hospital-acquired MRSA (methicillin-resistant
   <em>
    Staphylococcus aureus
   </em>
   ) and
   <em>
    C. difficile
   </em>
   . The company also makes basic rapid chemical tests for infectious diseases including influenza and hepatitis. Other product offerings include tests for women's health ailments, viruses, cancers, and genetic disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The GeneXpert system is designed for a broad range of users, including reference laboratories, hospital central laboratories, and satellite testing locations including emergency departments, intensive care units, and physician offices. Tests are offered in the areas of critical infectious disease, sexual health, women's health, virology, oncology, and genetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its non-clinical operations receive less attention but it still maintains a contract to provide the

   with equipment to detect DNA from anthrax spores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cepheid's R&amp;D program focuses on assay development efforts to design new tests and chemistry research to develop new ways to optimize the speed and performance of its assay. The company is also working to extend the capabilities of its systems and targeting research to identify novel micro RNA targets for the development of future assays.

  <p>
   Outside of North America (which generates more than 40% of product sales), Cepheid's primary international market is Europe, where it operates through a direct subsidiary located in France. It also sells products in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   The company sells its products worldwide through a combination of direct sales and distributorship deals. It has direct sales representatives in markets including the US, Australia, Italy, the UK, France, Germany, Benelux countries, and South Africa. It also has representative offices in China, India, Dubai, Singapore, and Japan, and it is spreading its international presence. A majority of the company's product revenue (more than 90%) comes from clinical customers, including hospitals, physician offices, and reference laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some customers are members of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs); these customers' purchases represented 36% of total sales in 2014.

  <p>
   Cepheid has enjoyed steady growth across the years, including a 17% increase in revenues to $470 million in 2014. Thegrowth was driven by a 23% increase in clinical revenue as the number of systems shipments rose. Clinical reagants revenue grew 22% as its installed base of GeneXpert instruments and expanding portfolio of Xpert tests increased. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in non-clinical revenue under the USPS contract and other contract, grant, and research revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of yet, 2011 has been the only profitable year for the company, and net income has been on the decline. In 2014 net loss increased 179% due to higher interest expenses and legal contingencies and settlements. At the end of 2014, Cepheid had accumulated debt of approximately $293.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations, which has been fluctuating, fell to $9.2 million as a result of the higher net losses and an increase in cash used in accounts receivable.

   Cepheid is catering to the clinical molecular diagnostic market by developing rapid diagnostic tests that can be run on its GeneXpert system. Though it conducts occasional acquisition and partnership efforts, the company is more focused on internal updates to its existing platforms and developing new tests. It is also intent on taking its products to new geographic markets. Having established itself in the EU, it is now looking to bring its products to China and Japan. With an endorsement from the
   <company id="100397">
    World Health Organization
   </company>
   , the company sells its systems at a discount in markets that are considered High Burden Developing Countries to help combat tuberculosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is pushing its portfolio of Xpert tests in the areas of critical infectious disease, sexual health, women's health, virology, oncology, and genetics. In 2013 its Xpert CT/NG and Xpert MTB/RIF were introduced in the US, and the Xpert Norovirus and Xpert Flu/RSV XC were introduced the following year. In 2015, the Xpert HIV-1 Qual (HIV test) and Xpert HCV Viral Load (hepatitis C test) received CE-IVD status in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company agreed to buy the customer relationships from its former distribution partner, the Laboratory Supply Company (LABSCO) for $21 million.
