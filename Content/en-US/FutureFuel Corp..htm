   FutureFuel's future may be in biofuels, but for now it still relies on chemicals. The company manufactures biodiesel and other biofuels; however, its core business is specialty chemicals, which include a bleach activator and detergent additives, a proprietary herbicide, and chlorinated polyolefin adhesion promoters (used in coatings for the automotive industry). It synthesizes custom chemicals for a variety of industries and applications. Selling its products primarily in North America, FutureFuel markets to customers that include industrial and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as pharmaceutical companies and agribusinesses. It manufactures its biofuels and chemicals at a single plant in Arkansas.

   Missouri-based FutureFuel has manufacturing plants, laboratories, an on-site liquid waste treatment site and other infrastructure, and a warehouse in Batesville, Arkansas. It sells primarily to customers in the US and Mexico.

   FutureFuel divides its operations into two main segments: Biofuels and Chemicals. It splits its Chemicals segment further into Custom Manufacturing and Performance Chemicals (which include its own brands of specialty chemical products).
  </p>
        <p>
   Its Biofuels segment produces biodiesel from feedstock with high fatty acids. The company, which makes its biodiesel from organic products like soybean oil, animal lard, and cooking oils, intends to continue growing its biofuels business by broadening its production and distribution capabilities. In 2011 the company redesigned its production line to achieve a capacity of about 35 million gallons of biodiesel per year. Additional debottlenecking increased the capacity to more than 45 millions gallons per year. The redesigned line enables it to make biodiesel from lower quality, and less expensive, feedstock. FutureFuels distributes its biofuels, as well as its chemical products, through its own tanker-truck fleet, as well as leased vehicles.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's chemical products are used in a range of end uses, including agrochemical, automotive, coatings, detergents, nutrition, photographic imaging, and polymer additives. About half of its total revenues comes from custom manufacturing specialty or performance chemicals for specific customers, and a smaller portion comes from producing specialty chemicals or performance chemicals for several customers. The company also sells an intermediate anode powder, which is used to produce lithium-ion batteries. Its Performance Chemicals unit includes polymer (nylon and polyester) modifiers and some specialty chemicals and solvents for various applications.

        <p>
   FutureFuel's revenues grew by 14% in 2012 due to a 35% increase in the Biofuels results caused by higher biodiesel production ans sales  Revenues from their biofuels  also been benefited by sales to a refined petroleum products shipper on a common carrier pipeline. These gains were offset by 5% decline in chemical segment revenues.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income of $351.8 million (14% up on 2011) was the result of higher net sales, increased interest and dividend income, and a gain on marketable securities.
  </p>
        <p>
   With the exception of the revenue slump in 2009 (when the global recession and weakened demand for oil and gas products) FutureFuel has reported an upward trend in revenue between 2008 and 2012.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   FutureFuel's long-term strategy seeks to grow both its chemicals and biofuels businesses. The company also wants to commercialize other products, such as building block chemicals. It is seeking to establish new markets for its biofuels business, and hopes to accelerate marketing efforts to serve fleets and regional/national customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   FutureFuel has had a multiyear contract with
   <company id="11211">
    The Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   </company>
   (which ends in 2016) to sell all of its bleach activator product. However, Procter &amp; Gamble notified FutureFuels in 2011 that it was reducing the quantities of bleach activator it purchases. FutureFuel also sells its proprietary herbicide and certain intermediates used in its production to Arysta LifeScience North America. Arysta reduced its purchase volumes of the herbicide by half in 2012.
