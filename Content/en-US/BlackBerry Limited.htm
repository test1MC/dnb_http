   The mounting competition has taken its toll on BlackBerry's revenue and net income. The company's sales were $3.3 billion in 2015 (ended February) from $6.8 billion in 2014. Just three years ago the company had sales of $18.4 billion. In 2015, Blackberry faced intense competition, particularly from the introduction of the

    Apple
   </company>
   iPhone 6 models during the year. Pricing adjustments made to maintain a user base resulted in fewer customers in higher revenue unlimited plans and more customers in prepaid and lower revenue plans. While the company posted a loss for 2015, it was $304 million, compared to the $5.8 billion loss of 2014. Blackberry slashed operating costs in 2015 by about $5 billion including big cuts in research and development and sales, marketing, and administration. Cash flow from operations was $813 million in 2015, a turnaround from a $159 million outflow in 2014.
