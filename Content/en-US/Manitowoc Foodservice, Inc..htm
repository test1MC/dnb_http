   Manitowoc Foodservice retains the
   <company id="120494">
    Manitowoc Ice
   </company>
   brand, enabling it to offer a one-stop shop of hot and cold kitchen equipment. Its portfolio includes more than 1,000 products, 500 of which qualify for the ENERGY STAR rating -- satisfying demand for efficient, green alternatives. In addition, Manitowoc Foodservice has enlarged its manufacturing and distribution footprint to cater to developing markets in the Asia/Pacific region. Domestically, the business is targeting the US government's School Stimulus Program and related initiatives that support investment in K-12 foodservice kitchens.
