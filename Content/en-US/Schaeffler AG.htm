   As technology advances, Schaeffler keeps businesses rolling along. Schaeffler manufactures a vast array of bearings: cylindrical and plain roller bearings, linear systems, needle roller bearings, to name a few. The bearings are used in aerospace, automotive, industrial machinery applications. Its three main brands are INA,
   <company id="91187">
    FAG
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="113114">
    LuK
   </company>
   ; though separate, the brands work collaboratively on specific product development. The company operates in two segments, including its Automotive Division (about 70% of sales) and its Industrial Division (30%). Schaeffler's products serve more than 60 industrial sectors.

  <p>
   Schaeffler's networks operate in about 180 locations in 50 countries worldwide, which include almost 100 fabrication facilities and research and design centers. Europe is its largest market, representing 56% of total sales. Other major markets include South America (23%), North America (16%), and the Asia/Pacific (5%).

   Schaeffler's manufactures bearings ranging in size from 2mm to 4.25m in diameter. The majority of its revenue is attributed to the automotive division and the rest to its industrial, aviation, and aerospace divisions.

   The Group's INA brands are used in automotive transmissions and engines. The FAG brand makes products for aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications; these precision bearings have been used on the Space Shuttle (the program made its last flight in late 2010) and

   A380. LuK products are used in automotive drivetrains, and it is estimated that one in four cars today has an LuK clutch.

  <p>
   Schaeffler's revenue increased by 1% to â‚¬11.2 billion in 2013 due to an increase in sales from its Automotive division as a result of a surge in new customer projects and related production start-ups. The growth was also fueled by an uptick in the transmission systems sector as a result of the positive growth generated by dry double clutches. The chassis systems sector was also helped by a solid performance of ball screw drives used for instance in electromechanical power steering systems and chassis products.

  <p>
   Schaeffler grows by opening new manufacturing facilities in select markets. In 2015 announced it was expanding its manufacturing capacity in the important Asia/Pacific market through the opening of a new facility on the eastern coast of Thailand.
