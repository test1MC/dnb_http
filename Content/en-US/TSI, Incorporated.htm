   For TSI, there really isn't TMI. Founded in 1961 as Thermo-Systems Inc., TSI makes sensors and instruments that provide information for a wide range of environmental safety and quality control applications. The company's products monitor air quality, temperature, and humidity in working environments; measure pollution conditions; detect gasses and analyze gas pressure and temperature; and measure the flow rate of liquids. Wholly-owned subsidiaries include Environmental Systems (products for outdoor environmental monitoring), DICKEY-john (instrumentation for agriculture and public works), and Tekran Instruments (mercury monitoring).

  <p>
   TSI has three wholly owned subsidiaries: DICKEY-john Corporation (Auburn, Illinois), a manufacturer of specialized instrumentation used in public works and agriculture; Environmental Systems Corporation (Knoxville, Tennessee), a leading supplier of products and services for outdoor environmental monitoring; and Tekran Instruments Corporation (Knoxville, Tennessee), a top supplier of ambient mercury monitoring technology.

  <p>
   The global company has offices in China, France, Germany, India, Singapore, the UK, and the US.

   TSI sells through its own sales force and through distributors. It expanded its relationship with the US General Services Administration in 2015 to include state and local governments. They can purchase instruments at a lower cost through the GSA Advantage Disaster Purchasing Program.

  <p>
   TSI grows organically, with an engineering staff that regularly develops new products. It also expands geographically through partnerships and distribution agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, TSI introduced a new product for the recycling industry. The PolyMax Plastics Analyzer is a handheld tool designed to identify light and dark plastics, which would allow plastics brokers and recycling facilities to buy and sell with more confidence. The analyzer comes with a library of materials to help ID plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   For another environment the company released the MacroIMS Macroion Mobility Spectrometer in 2014. It was developed from TSI's core technology for nanoparticle analysis and it can be used in several biochemical applications, including analysis of antibody aggregation, lipoproteins, viruses/vaccines/VLPs, polymers, and nanoparticle colloids.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014 TSI and Netronix teamed up to provide a comprehensive turnkey Cloud-based remote dust monitoring technology. This partnership leverages Netronix's existing remote monitoring technology with TSI's position as a global leader in dust monitoring instrumentation.

  <p>
   The company also expands through acquisitions. In 2014 TSI acquired the business assets and Raman Spectroscopy Technology from Enwave Optronics, Inc. Enwave delivers laboratory grade measurements to its complete product line that includes handheld, portable, bench top and installed process control instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it bought the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology from Photon Machines Corporation. The optical spectroscopy tech strengthens the chemical characterization measuring capabilities of TSI's aerosol measurement instrumentation products.

  <p>
   In 2011, the company signed up Inteccon to distribute several of its product lines in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region not served by local TSI offices. The following year it launched versions of its website in Chinese, French, and German.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 TSI acquired Quant Technologies, a maker of water-based condensation particle counters (WCPCs), as part of its move into nanoparticle measurement. WCPCs measure the concentration of nano-particulates in the air, and are used in monitoring, contamination control, and basic research applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   TSI was started by a group of engineering graduates from the
   <company id="42306">
    University of Minnesota
   </company>
   . The company began selling overseas in 1966, and changed its name to TSI Inc. in 1977. After an extended negotiation that started with a failed 1999 takeover bid, the company was acquired and taken private in 2000 by JJF Group, a private investment vehicle formed by former TSI chairman John Fauth.
