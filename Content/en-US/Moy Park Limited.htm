   In 2016 Moy Par announced a significant Â£4 million investment in its facilities at Craigavon, Northern Ireland positioning its 'ready to eat' cooked chicken production for further innovation and growth. The investment will enhance production capabilities.

   That year John Thompson &amp; Sons acquired the GE McLarnon &amp; Sons ruminant business and brand from Moy Park. It will transfer the volume to its Belfast Mill, while Moy Park will invest in the former McLarnon feed mill at Randalstown to make it a dedicated poultry facility.
