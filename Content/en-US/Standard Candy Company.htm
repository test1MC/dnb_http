   Standard Candy Company wants consumers to go gaga -- or rather Goo Goo -- over its candy. The company makes the Goo Goo Cluster, a milk chocolate candy filled with caramel, marshmallow, and peanuts. Considered one of the first combination candy bars (as opposed to solid bars), its Goo Goo Cluster has been around since 1912. Since that time, Standard Candy Company has added The Howie, Supreme, and Peanut Butter Goo Goo versions. Also a contract manufacturer for other food companies, Standard Candy Company sells its products through its flagship store and website as well as other US retailers.

   Based in Tennessee, Standard Candy Company operates its business nationwide, mostly across the South. It supplies consumers in both the US and Canada with its candy through its e-commerce website.

   Standard Candy Company serves as the parent company to both Goo Goo Cluster, LLC, formed as a subsidiary in 2011, and its manufacturing arm, Standard Functional Foods Group, Inc. (SFFG). SFFG makes the company's Goo Goo Cluster candy, as well as other products, as a contract food manufacturer. It works with major food companies to develop a variety of products, such as organic foods, meal replacements, functional foods, and sports nutrition products.

   The company's Nashville plant can produce some 20,000 Goo Goo Clusters per hour.
