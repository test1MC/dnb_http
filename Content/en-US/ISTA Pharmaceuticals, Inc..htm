   ISTA Pharmaceuticals has set its sights on treating eye diseases. The
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch &amp; Lomb
   </company>
   pharmaceutical subsidiary has products in development and on the market. ISTA's marketed products include Bepreve (for itchy eyes associated with allergic conjunctivitis), Istalol (a glaucoma treatment), and Bromday (used for pain and inflammation following cataract surgery) in the US. Its drug Vitrase is a spreading agent that promotes absorption of injected drugs. The drug candidates in the company's pipeline include treatments for dry eye syndrome, ocular pain, and inflammation. ISTA has additional ocular and allergy treatments in research and development stages.

  <p>
   As a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company, ISTA is focused on bringing new products through the last stages of development and ushering them to market.

   Its marketing operations are targeted towards ophthalmologists, optometrists, and allergists. Products are distributed through drug wholesalers, including

   The firm is developing Remura, a new treatment for dry eye disease. It is also investigating the active ingredient in Bepreve for use as a nasal spray to treat allergy symptoms. Other R&amp;D areas include additional inflammation, allergic conjunctivitis, and age-related macular degeneration treatments.

  <p>
   Prior to its acquisition by
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch &amp; Lomb
   </company>
   the company obtained the bulk of its pipeline candidates and eventual products through licensing agreements with Japanese firm Senju Pharmaceuticals. Through the agreements, ISTA coverered the costs of developing and marketing the products in the US, and paid Senju fees and milestone payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, ISTA typically did not handle its own manufacturing functions, leaving most of the production of its marketed products (and the active pharmaceutical ingredients or APIs, for those products) to contract manufacturers. For instance Senju supplied ISTA with the API for Bepreve, and Regis Technologies makes the API for Bromday.

  <p>
   The company was acquired by Bausch &amp; Lomb for approximately $500 million in March 2012. Bausch &amp; Lomb expects the acquisition to accelerate its strategy to strengthen its pharmaceutical pipeline, marketed products, and capabilities, as it nearly doubled the number of mid- to late-stage products it has under development. Additionally, the companies share a strong customer base. The purchase provides ISTA shareholders a premium of 10% on its current share price.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to this agreement, ISTA had been pursued by
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , beginning with its unsolicited $314 million acquisition proposal in late 2011, followed by an increased bid of about $360 million in January 2012. ISTA promptly rejected the first offer as inadequate, and by the end of January, Valeant had withdrawn its offer due to a lack of progress. (ISTA had agreed to review Valeant's proposal, but also stated that it was reviewing other strategic options.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for and launched Bromday in 2010. The drug was a next-generation version of its Xibrom offering, allowing for once-daily inflammation treatment (as opposed to Xibrom's twice-daily regimen). Upon Bromday's acceptance in the market, ISTA stopped selling Xibrom in mid-2011. Another ISTA drug is Bepreve, which received FDA approval in 2009.
