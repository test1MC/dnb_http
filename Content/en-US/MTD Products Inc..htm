   MTD Products wants to mow down its foes in the outdoor equipment market. The family-owned outdoor power equipment manufacturer makes walk-behind and tractor mowers, snow throwers, edgers, and tillers under such brands as Cub Cadet, Bolens, Troy-Bilt, White Outdoor, Yard-Man, and Yard Machines. The company produces a wide range equipment for both the residential and commercial markets. Its MTD Pro and Cub Cadet Commercial lines are geared toward professional landscapers. MTD sells its products through home improvement and farm supply stores, big-box retailers, and hardware shops.

  <p>
   In 2015 MTD acquired CORE Outdoor Power, a Montana-based maker of outdoor lawn care equipment with gasless motor technology that produces higher torque and increased efficiencies than traditional electric motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also bought Indianapolis-based Precise Path Robotics, which makes world's only commercially available autonomous greens mower, the RG3, designed specifically for golf course putting greens. Advanced robotic technology allows the RG3 to travel in straight lines and along curved perimeters without the need of an operator to guide it.

  <p>
   In early 2010 MTD's Australian arm added the Rover Mowers name to its portfolio after purchasing the brand and related assets from fixtures and fittings maker GWA International for between A$10 million and A$12 million (roughly US$9 million to US$11 million). MTD's emphasis on its global presence arose as its North American business took a hit from the US recession and rising Canadian dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the recession behind it, MTD focused on bolstering its US operations. MTD invested $6 million to expand its base in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 2010. The firm added a 525,000-sq.-ft. county-owned building to its network as well as about 100 jobs; the building is located next to MTD's other Tupelo facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2009 MTD acquired most of Germany-based garden tool manufacturer WOLF-Garten, which provided inroads to the UK market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed in 1932 by German immigrants Theo Moll, Emil Jochum, and Erwin Gerhard as the Modern Tool and Die Company.
