  <p>
   Guardian faces off stiff industry competition by continuing to expand its manufacturing footprint and portfolio of glass and building materials. Its direction has gained traction largely through investment in eco-friendly product research and development, as well as pursuit of favorable business acquisitions and partnerships.

   Guardian has also set to take advantage of the current demand for alternative energy. The company manufactures specially coated mirrors used in the technology of concentrating solar power. The power vaporizes water into steam to power a turbine for the generation of electricity.

  <p>
   Guardian Glass Company began as a small maker of car windshields in Detroit in 1932 during the Great Depression. The company spent the 1930s and 1940s building its business to gain a foothold in glassmaking, historically one of the world's most monopolized industries. In 1949 PPG Industries and Libbey-Owens-Ford (now owned by the UK's Pilkington) agreed to stop their alleged monopolistic activity. William Davidson took over Guardian Glass from his uncle in 1957. As president, he tried to boost the enterprise's standing in the windshield niche, but PPG and Libbey-Owens-Ford refused to sell him raw glass. That year Guardian Glass filed for bankruptcy to reorganize.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1960 (the same year Pilkington developed the float process for glassmaking), and in 1965 it was hit with its first patent infringement lawsuit. Three years later the company went public, changed its name to Guardian Industries, and was refused a license to use Pilkington's float technology.
