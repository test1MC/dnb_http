   The scope of Pericom Semiconductor's product line covers analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits that communicate with other devices. The company specializes in chips that control the routing and transfer of data among a system's microprocessor, memory, and peripherals. Targeting the automotive, computer, networking, and telecom markets, Pericom offers various chip product lines: interfaces for data transfer, switches for digital and analog signals, clock management chips, and telecommunications switches and component bridges. Most sales come from customers located outside the US, primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. Pericom was acquired by

   Pericom became part of Diodes when the $413 million deal closed in November 2015. The addition Pericoms broadened Diodes' analog products line and added mixed-signal connectivity to its mix. Diodes expected combined revenue to reach $1 billion a year with Pericom products selling to markets for cloud computing and server storage, embedded automotive information and entertainment systems, and Internet of Things applications.
