   In the beginning Koninklijke Philips (Royal Philips in English) created light bulbs. Now, it's the #1 producer of them worldwide while also making LED lighting and lamps. Its Lighting business also makes professional and consumer indoor and outdoor lighting systems, electronics, and controls. Philips' Healthcare group, its largest money maker, creates a slew of high-end medical equipment for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management including imaging systems, home healthcare equipment, and clinical IT management products.  Its Consumer unit makes audio/multimedia entertainment electronics, electric shavers and toothbrushes, coffee makers, and other kitchen appliances. The Dutch company traces its roots to 1891.

  <p>
   Philips organizes its business into three key units. The largest is Healthcare, which contributes more than 45% of sales. It's further divided into Imaging Systems, Patient Care &amp; Clinical Informatics, Home Healthcare Solutions, and Healthcare Transformation Services. Next is the company's legacy business, Lighting, which offers indoor and outdoor lighting for homes, schools, factories, hotels, hospitals and other locations through divisions that include Light Sources &amp; Electronics, Consumer Luminaires, Professional Lighting Solutions, Automotive Lighting, and Lumileds. It accounts for 31% of the company's sales and will soon be its own standalone company. Finally, Consumer Lifestyle covers Health &amp; Wellness, Personal Care, and Domestic Appliances and turns in 22% of sales.

  <p>
   The company operates in more than 100 countries. Its single biggest market, the US, contributes sales, 31%, followed by China with 11%.

  <p>
   Revenue rose 13% to €24.24 billion in 2015 from €21.4 billion in 2014. A healthy 19% increase in healthcare sales boosted the company's top line. Also, sales were higher in all geographic markets, including a 22% rise in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philips posted a 55% profit leap to €645 million in 2015 from €415 million in 2014. Besides higher revenue, the company didn't have impairment charges in 2015 that it had the year before.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow was lower in 2015 at €1 billion compared to €1.3 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   The company intends to embrace the future through two separate companies, HealthTech and Lighting Solutions. HealthTech will include current institutional and personal healthcare along with mobile and cloud-based medical technologies (the rest of Consumer Lifestyle, including appliances, will live here).
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of that plan Philips sold seven health care and lighting units in 2015, including Assembléon Holding, OEM Remote Controls, and Axsun Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philips extended it HealthSuite digital platform to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud in 2015. The partnership with AWS expands the connectivity, capabilities, and services of the HealthSuite platform, which supports secure management of personal health care data as well as large-scale clinical data.

   In 2015, the company bought
   <company id="148940">
    Volcano Corporation
   </company>
   , which makes medical imaging devices for cardiovascular care and other specialties. Volcano became the impetus for Philips plan to split into two companies. It will anchor the HealthTech company.

  <p>
   Gerard Philips (later joined by brother Anton) founded Philips &amp; Co. in the Dutch city of Eindhoven in 1891. Surviving an industry shakeout, Philips prospered as a result of Gerard's engineering and Anton's foreign sales efforts. The company had become Europe's #3 light bulb maker by 1900. It adopted the name Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken (light bulb factory) in 1912.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Netherlands' neutrality during WWI allowed Philips to expand and integrate into glass manufacturing (1915) and X-ray and radio tubes (1918). The company set up its first foreign sales office in Belgium in 1919; it started building plants abroad in the 1930s to avoid trade barriers and tariffs.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Philips created US and British trusts to hold majority interests in North American Philips (NAP) and in Philips' British operations. Following the war, the company established hundreds of subsidiaries worldwide. It repurchased its British businesses in 1955; NAP operated independently until it was reacquired in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company started marketing televisions and appliances in the 1950s. Philips introduced audiocassette, VCR, and laser disc technology in the 1960s but had limited success with computers and office equipment. Despite its development of new technologies, in the 1970s Philips was unable to maintain market share against an onslaught of inexpensive goods from Japan. Meanwhile, NAP acquired Magnavox (consumer electronics, US) in 1974. NAP also purchased GTE Television in 1981 and Westinghouse's lighting business in 1983. In 1986 it provided $60 million in seed money to start
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   with the Taiwanese government.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philips' successful PolyGram unit (formed in 1972) went public in 1989 and bought record companies Island (UK) that year and A&amp;M (US) the next. In 1991 the company changed its name to Royal Philips Electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ill-timed product introductions contributed to huge losses in the early 1990s. After cutting jobs and selling units, the company formed an alliance with
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   in 1999 to develop appliances that use the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2001 Philips completed its acquisition of the Healthcare Solutions Group of
   <company id="60896">
    Agilent Technologies
   </company>
   for $1.7 billion, and in October the firm acquired
   <company id="54219">
    Marconi Medical Systems
   </company>
   , a distributor of medical imaging systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a transaction valued at $2 billion, Philips in 2005 sold its computer-monitor manufacturing operations and a portion of its flat screen TV business to Hong Kong-based
   <company id="136133">
    TPV Technology
   </company>
   , making that company the world's largest manufacturer of PC monitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Frits Philips, son of founder Anton Philips and the last member of the Philips family to manage the company (he retired in 1977) and who helped develop audio cassettes and the compact disc, died at the age of 100.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focused on strengthening its presence in its core lighting industry during 2005. It extended its reach into LEDs with the purchase of
   <company id="60896">
    Agilent Technologies
   </company>
   that year. It also focused on developing its presence in health care, making several purchases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company announced a reorganization of its top units in order to simplify structure. The company established three core units:
   <company id="104728">
    Philips Lighting
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="143932">
    Philips Consumer Lifestyle
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="113101">
    Philips Healthcare
   </company>
   .
