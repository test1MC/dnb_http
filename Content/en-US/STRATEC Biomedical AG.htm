  <p>
   The company, which focuses on immunological, immunohematological, and molecular diagnostics, operates through three divisions. Instrumentation makes analyzer systems for diagnostics and biotech customers. It accounts for nearly all sales. Molecular makes products for nucleic acid sample collection, stabilization, and purification. Data Management develops lab software to bring all the data together. The company also creates networking software to make its systems work together. STRATEC sells about 3,000 systems a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although most of its systems are designed and manufactured specifically for third-party companies, STRATEC Biomedical also offers a handful of smaller, off-the-shelf analyzer models sold through distributors.

  <p>
   STRATEC's headquarters is in Birkenfeld, Germany and it has major operations in the US, Italy, Ireland, France, Belgium, the UK, and China.

  <p>
   The company sells its analyzer systems through distributors who package them with necessary supplies and sell them under their own brand names. Since the customers redistribute STRATEC's systems across national borders, the numbers the company reports for regional sales do not necessarily reflect the actual locations where the systems operate.

  <p>
   In 2012 STRATEC reported a 5% revenue increase, which was less than the company expected as its distributors launched products later and the consumables part of the business underperformed. Net income and cash flow dropped as the company lost money on financing and investments.

  <p>
   STRATEC points to an industry-wide trend of outsourcing instrumentation and automation systems as its hope for the future. Accordingly, it is continually working to widen its geographic and product ranges.

  <p>
   STRATEC Biomedical was founded in 1979 by Hermann Leistner, who retired as chairman in 2011. STRATEC Biomedical bought its first US subsidiary in 2010 when it paid $5.2 million for California-based Ballista, Inc. Ballista specialized in precision optics technology for the diagnostics and medical technology, biotechnology, and aerospace industries.
