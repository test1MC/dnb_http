   In 2013 the Morpho Mobile Gateway was developed by Morpho (
   <company id="90795">
    SAFRAN
   </company>
   ) and supplied by its US subsidiary, MorphoTrak. The software allows Morpho mobile biometric devices to interface not only with the FBI's Repository for Individuals of Special Concern database, but with any Automated Fingerprint Identification System regardless of the vendor.

   MorphoTrak expanded in mid-2011 when its parent company acquired L-1 Identity Solutions for more than $1 billion and changed its name to
   <company id="52212">
    MorphoTrust
   </company>
   . SAFRAN garnered L-1's Solutions (biometrics, secure credentialing, and enterprise access) and Enrollment Services divisions. The purchase makes SAFRAN the leader in biometric identity solutions and significantly enhances MorphoTrak's earlier acquisitions, which include the 2010 purchase of tattoo matching technology developed by
   <company id="56096">
    Michigan State University
   </company>
   . The technology, known as Tattoo ID, allows for the searching of a tattoo image database in order to identify suspects, criminals, and victims.
  </p>
  <p>
   Formerly SAGEM Morpho, the company became MorphoTrak in 2009 after SAFRAN acquired Printrak, the biometric business division of Motorola.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 1985, the company was once a subsidiary of French fingerprint-system developer MORPHO Syst√®mes. SAFRAN (then known as the SAGEM Group) bought the company in 1993.
