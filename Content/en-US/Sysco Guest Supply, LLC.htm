   Part of Sysco's Other segment, Sysco Guest Supply's business represented slightly more than 6% of overall revenue in fiscal 2014 (vs. about the same in 2013). The segment's operating income dropped some 5% in fiscal 2014 as compared to 2013, thanks in part to startup costs from Sysco Ventures offset by increased earnings from specialty produce and lodging industry products.

   Sysco Guest Supply customers can tap into Sysco's distribution network and vast selection of foodservice and other related products, while Sysco lodging customers have access to Guest Supply products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company works to provide its customers with new and improved products, technologies, and services. Sysco looks to new international markets and niche markets that are adjacent to its core foodservice distribution business to grow. To this end, Sysco Guest Supply in 2013 rolled out a range of luxury amenities under Chinese brand name Shanghai Tang in the hospitality sector in the Middle East.

  <p>
   Guest Supply was founded in 1978 when John Todd, a former toiletries marketer for GAF, read about
   <company id="40403">
    S.C. Johnson
   </company>
   's $30 million effort to put product samples in people's homes. Thinking hotels would be another obvious samples market, he approached a few with the idea and got his first break in 1980 when Marriott bought $100,000 worth of amenities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Guest Supply went public in 1986 and in 1987 acquired rival Breckenridge-Remy. Clifford Stanley, a former executive at
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , succeeded Todd as CEO the next year. After an unsuccessful bid to diversify into department stores in the early 1990s, the company shifted its focus to vertical integration.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Guest Supply teamed up with
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   (P&amp;G) to distribute the latter's personal care products to hotels. Distribution problems and rapid sales growth delayed the launch of a catalog until 1996. The next year the company secured more hotel supply contracts (Promus Hotel and Marriott International). P&amp;G let its contract with Guest Supply expire in 1997. Also that year Summerset Group, a firm affiliated with manufacturer Emlin Cosmetics, acquired a 6% stake in the firm (later increased to 9%). Overall sales continued to climb in 1998 despite a dip in sales to consumer product companies. Also that year, Guest Supply inked a five-year contract with
   <company id="10733">
    Hilton Worldwide
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company purchased Nasco Supply, a leading textile products supplier for the lodging industry. In early 2000 the company announced a partnership with GoCo-op to sell its products online in a bid to expand Guest Supply's customer base beyond the hospitality business. The company later purchased Canadian textile supply company T.J. MacDonald Institutional Textiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Guest Supply was purchased by top food distributor SYSCO for about $238 million. Guest Supply then purchased Franklin Supply Company, a housekeeping products supplier, later that year.
