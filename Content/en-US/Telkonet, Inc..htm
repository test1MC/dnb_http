   Telkonet runs its own Internet of things, but its things are thermostats and other energy controls for hotels, campuses, and other properties. The company's SmartEnergy and EcoSmart line of energy efficiency-related systems are used to manage and monitor HVAC consumption. It also provides high-speed Internet access without the high-cost network upgrades through its EthoStream product line, which enables computer network and Internet access over electrical lines rather than communications cables. In addition to equipment sales, it recognizes recurring support revenue from the 2,300 hotels that use its EthoStream broadband Internet systems. All of its product are marketed primarily to the hospitality industry. Customers include
