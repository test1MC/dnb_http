   You might say this company is made from matzo. The Manischewitz Company is a leading producer of a growing portfolio of packaged kosher foods. Besides its namesake brand of traditional matzo, it makes Guiltless Gourmet dips and chips, Asian Harvest vegetables and sauces, and Tam Tams snack crackers. The company, which also licenses the Manischewitz name for use with wine and other items, has earned the title as the largest maker of processed kosher food products in the world. The Manischewitz Company does not limit its kosher food marketing to the Jewish community alone, and is seeking mainstream acceptance of certain food product lines.

  <p>
   Having secured a strategic investment from Sankaty Advisors,
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   's credit affiliate and one of the world's leading private managers of fixed income and credit instruments, Manischewitz in 2014 is rolling out several new products in time for its primary Passover season. They include new macaroons, cookies, granola, and Kosher for Passover chicken broth. Serving the Sephardic tradition, which allows the consumption of Kitniyot (including legumes, corn, peas, soy, rice, and lentils, for instance) at Passover, the company introduced a new Kosher for Passover brand called Kitni.

   "Bringing families to the table since 1888," The Manischewitz Company spent $10 million on ads and marketing in 2012 as it worked to sell its Manischewitz-brand broths and gravies alongside those offered by
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell Soup
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40118">
    Del Monte
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company began the strategy of creating kosher products that also appeal to the general public (gentiles) and that can be positioned in the main aisle of food stores, rather than in the ethnic/specialty food aisles. A new broth made by the company is shelved in the soup aisle alongside popular mainstream broths such as Swanson and College Inn. It also make gravies for mainstream consumption.

  <p>
   The company traces its heritage to 1888, when Lithuanian immigrant Rabbi Dov Behr (who subsequently added "Manischewitz" to his name) began baking and selling matzo in Cincinnati.

  <p>
   The company changed its name in 2008 from R.A.B. Holdings to The Manischewitz Company to take advantage of its best-known brand.

    Millbrook Distribution Services
   </company>
   , as a separate entity in 2007 in an effort to focus on ethnic food production. Millbrook was later acquired by
