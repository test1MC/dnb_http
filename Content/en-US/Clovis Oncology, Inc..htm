   Clovis Oncology isn't trying to treat all cancers, just a few very specific ones. The development-stage biopharmaceutical company acquires and develops therapies for subsets of ovarian, lung, and other cancers that don't respond well to existing commercial drugs. The company has candidates in its pipeline including oral treatments for ovarian solid tumors as well as a drug for gastrointestinal cancer. Clovis also works with partners to develop companion diagnostics for its treatment drugs. The company was founded in 2009 and became a publicly traded entity in 2011.

   In 2016 the company ended studies of its lung cancer drug rociletinib after being notified of its rejection by the FDA. It also announced that it would withdraw its European application for the drug. It switched its focus to research recaparib, a treatment for ovarian cancer.

  <p>
   Along with the shutdown of rociletinib, Clovis cut 35% of its workforce.
