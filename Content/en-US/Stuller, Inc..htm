   Stuller has become one of the largest manufacturers and distributors nationwide and is a leader in both domestic and international wholesale jewelry sectors. One of Stuller's areas of focus is "just in time" delivery, as founder Matt Stuller discovered that the industry is not known for its speedy product delivery. To this end, Stuller specializes in next day delivery of its merchandise.

  <p>
   The company has devoted time to inking several licensing deals in recent years to add new products and brands to its portfolio. In 2013 Stuller partnered with BlingGuard to become the exclusive distributor of BlingWraps and BlingDots to retailers. The invisible ring guards keep jewelry from twisting, turning, and pulling. An agreement with Quadamas, entered in 2013, designates Stuller as the distributor of the new patented line of Asscher Cut Princess sapphires to the US market for Quadamas. Making it the exclusive distributor of the Bfly line to US independent retailers, Stuller partnered with the company, which is known for its patented Butterfly Gem cut.
