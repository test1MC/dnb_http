  <p>
   Reflecting its parent company Nortek's wishes to bring a more unified strategy for accelerated global growth, energy-efficient product innovation, and expanded product offerings, Nordyne and its Nordyne International subsidiary changed their names to Nortek Global HVAC LLC and Nortek Global HVAC Latin America, Inc in early 2015, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortek Global HVAC has been winding down many of its US manufacturing plants in recent years to cut costs. In 2014, for example, the company shut down and relocated both of its Missouri factories, which had employed some 700-plus workers in Polar Bluff and Boonville, to consolidate the operations into its newly-opened plant in Saltillo, Mexico.

  <p>
   During the downturn in the construction industry, parent company Nortek filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, but emerged soon after. The filing included Nortek's subsidiaries. As part of the reorganization Nortek was able to eliminate some $1.3 billion of debt.
