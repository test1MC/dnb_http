  <p>
   Steel is ThyssenKrupp's largest business, with the deepest roots in its history: Friedrich Krupp opened his first steel factory in 1811, and August Thyssen founded his first steel mill in the 1870s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 ThyssenKrupp acquired German logistics service provider Eisenbahn und Häfen GmbH. Under the terms of merger, the operating activities -- port, rail, and technology -- will be integrated into the Logistics Services unit of ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe. Prior to the merger, Eisenbahn und Häfen had been a provider of logistics services to ThyssenKrupp.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has expanded its business in Asia in part through joint ventures and alliances with other steelmakers, including

    JFE Holdings
   </company>
   and China's TAGAL. In 2006 the company also acquired
   <company id="10068">
    Arconic
   </company>
   's aerospace service business. The main steelmaking unit is in the process of expanding internationally and began production in 2009 at a mill in Brazil.
