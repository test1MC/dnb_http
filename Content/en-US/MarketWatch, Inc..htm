   Data Broadcasting Corporation launched its online financial news service, DBC Online, in 1995 and expanded the following year with MarketWatch, a real-time quote service. Looking to expand its content and beef up its marketing prowess, Data Broadcasting found a partner in CBS, which had been seeking an online outlet for its news content.

  <p>
   The two companies joined forces in 1997 in a 50-50 joint venture. They christened their collaboration MarketWatch.com, and Larry Kramer, who had originally been appointed to oversee DBC Online's editorial content, was appointed CEO. CBS granted the new company use of its name and logo, as well as news content and $30 million in free promotions in return for a percentage of the Web site's revenue. DBC Online agreed to give its financial data free of charge, and also provide infrastructure and management services.

   MarketWatch.com started 1999 with a chart-busting IPO that helped fuel the Internet stock craze (MarketWatch.com's stock rose nearly 475% on its first day). Later that year it acquired BigCharts, enhancing its array of online financial content. The following year it launched European site FTMarketWatch.com, a joint venture with the

   In early 2001 Data Broadcasting Corporation (now
   <company id="42114">
    Interactive Data Corporation
   </company>
   ) sold its 34% stake in MarketWatch.com to UK media firm
   <company id="41338">
    Pearson
   </company>
   (which bought 60% of Data Broadcasting in 2000). Later that year MarketWatch.com announced that the worldwide dip in advertising sales forced it to lay off 15% of its workforce. It also sold its stake in FTMarketWatch.com back to the
   <i>
    Financial Times
   </i>
   . In 2004 MarketWatch.com dropped the ".com" from its name to reflect the company's expansion of its operations beyond the Internet.
