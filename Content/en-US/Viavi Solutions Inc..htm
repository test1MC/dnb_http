   Viavi Solutions, formerly a part of JDS Uniphase (JDSU), facilitates better communication. The company develops test and measurement instruments and test tools that are used to build and improve communications equipment and broadband networks. Formerly operated as JDSU's Network and Service Enablement unit, Viavi develops instruments and software and provides product support that helps customers build and maintain communication equipment and broadband networks. It also provides test products and services for private enterprise networks. The break up of JDSU occurred in August 2015. The former optical security and performance unit of JDSU now operates as Lumentum.

  <p>
   Prior to the break up, the company divided its business into three segments, each of which has its own engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing groups. The Communications and Commercial Optical Products (CCOP) segment generated about 46% of sales and serves the optical communications, laser, and photovoltaic markets. Optical communications products include transponders, transceivers, modules, and amplifiers for transmission and transport of video, audio, and text data over fiber-optic cables. Its range of solid-state, fiber, diode, and gas lasers are used in everything from biotechnology and imaging to materials processing and precision machining. Laser sales account for about 7% of overall revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Network and Service Enablement (NES) generated about 43% of sales. NSE provides test instruments, software, and product support services that help with the deployment of communication equipment and broadband networks. It also provides test products and services for private enterprise networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Optical Security and Performance Products (OSPP) was the smallest segment with about 12% of sales. It provides advanced optical technologies such as color-shifting pigments and thin-film coatings used in products such as night-vision goggles, satellite solar covers, medical instrumentation, information displays, office equipment, 3D cinema, and gesture recognition. Its pigments safeguard the currencies of more than 100 countries, including China, the US, and those in the European Union.

  <p>
   As one company, it operated in more than 25 countries with its key manufacturing locations in China, France, Germany, and the US. Its main manufacturing partners are in China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand. The US-Americas made up about 45% of sales, with the Europe, Middle East and Africa region accounting for about 30%, and the rest are in the Asia-Pacific region.

  <p>
   The company's products have been marketed to telecommunications and cable service providers, OEMs, government agencies, distributors, and partners worldwide. Each segment has a dedicated sales force, and each segment is working to expand both direct selling and distribution opportunities in emerging geographic markets
  </p>
  <p>
   As one company, customers have included some of the world's largest communications service providers (

  <p>
   The company reported its 2015 (ended June) financials for the pre-breakup entity. Overall revenue dropped 2% to $1.70 billion in 2014 (ended June) from 2014's $1.74 billion. Sales increased 2.6% in its CCOP unit but fell about 12% in the NSE segment. Sales decreased 4% in the OSPP segment. The company posted a loss of $85.3 million in 2015 compared to an $18 million loss in 2014.

   Since September 2014, the company has been pointing toward the split, which is to help each better focus on their markets and be more agile in responding to changing technology demands. Combined expenses were expected to be $50 million lower.

  <p>
   Prior to the break, in 2014, JDSU acquired Network Instruments, a developer of enterprise network and application-performance management products, for about $208 million in cash, strengthening its products for enterprise and mobile networks. It paid $15 million for Time-Bandwidth, a provider of high powered and ultrafast lasers for industrial and scientific markets. JDSU added to its product line of lasers for micromachining.

   Engineer Dale Crane was already making helium neon lasers in his garage when he left laser developer

   </company>
   in 1979 to start Uniphase. Initially the company developed and marketed gas laser subsystems to manufacturers of biomedical, industrial process control, and printing equipment. In 1992 Demax Software executive Kevin Kalkhoven became CEO, and Uniphase formed Ultrapointe, introducing the Ultrapointe laser imaging system for semiconductor production the following year. Expenses related to a gas laser subsystem patent-infringement suit filed by Spectra-Physics caused losses in 1993, the year Uniphase went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1990s Uniphase began to use acquisitions to expand its market share and consolidate product lines. In 1995 the company bought optical components supplier United Technologies Photonics from
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   , entering the telecom market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 it bought
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   's laser business and Australia-based Indx, a maker of reflection filters used to increase the carrying capacity of a fiber-optic strand. Uniphase's 1998 acquisitions included Philips Optoelectronics (semiconductor lasers) and Broadband Communications Products (fiber-optic transmitters and receivers). The company sold its Ultrapointe unit to chip equipment maker
   <company id="13881">
    KLA-Tencor
   </company>
   late that year. The acquisition spree contributed to losses for fiscal 1997 and 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Uniphase merged with JDS FITEL, a Canada-based maker of fiber-optic communications gear, in a $7 billion deal. JDS FITEL, founded in 1981 by four
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel
   </company>
   engineers, focused on making so-called "passive" fiber-optic components that route and manipulate optical signals. It was a complementary fit to Uniphase's "active" gear that generates and transmits signals. The combined company named itself JDS Uniphase. Both JDS FITEL and Uniphase aggressively pursued acquisitions prior to the merger, and JDS Uniphase continued shopping.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2000, following a huge run-up in its share price, JDS Uniphase made 10 acquisitions, including EPITAXX (optical detectors and receivers) and Optical Coating Laboratory. Its largest acquisition was of rival
   <company id="58076">
    E-Tek Dynamics
   </company>
   (for $20.4 billion), which JDSU used to further increase its capacity to produce passive components such as amplifiers and better equip itself to offer customers complete optical systems. That year Kalkhoven retired, and co-chairman Jozef Straus (former CEO of JDS FITEL) was named as his replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   After making a series of acquisitions in the early 2000s, JDSU announced that it would split into two companies.
