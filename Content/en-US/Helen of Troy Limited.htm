   Need help battling your hair? You might call on those warriors who sailed in search of Helen of Troy. The firm, Helen of Troy, sells licensed personal care products and accessories under the
   <company id="11211">
    Vidal Sassoon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="48062">
    Revlon
   </company>
   brand names, as well as its own brands (Helen of Troy, Karina, Wigo). Its products include appliances (humidifiers, hair dryers, curling irons, shavers, massagers), personal care products (liquid hair styling products, liquid and powdered skin care products), and hair accessories. The company has made inroads into the housewares market with its OXO International purchase. Helen of Troy has boosted its grooming, skin care, and hair care segment in the US through acquisitions.

   Helen of Troy products, which are marketed in more than 70 countries, are made under contract by manufacturers in Asia and are marketed mostly to US mass merchants, drug chains, warehouse clubs, supermarkets, and beauty supply stores. US sales represent 79% of Helen of Troy's revenue.
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

   accounts for about 18% of company sales.

        <p>
   The company's strategy is to focus on developing new products or buying them from other companies to enhance its vast products portfolio. Indeed, two recent acquisitions opened a promising new niche for the company: healthcare and home environment products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Licensing deals have been the push for Helen of Troy, as well. The personal appliances company inked a five-year deal with Mascolo that extends through 2011 to use the Toni&amp;Guy name on hair care appliances, such as hair dryers, straighteners, and stylers, as well as male grooming products in the UK, Western Europe, and Asia. In 2008, the Toni&amp;Guy name had become the company's third-highest selling brand in Europe. Two more licensing agreements put well-known names on Helen of Troy's personal care products and hair care appliances marketed in the Western Hemisphere. Its deal with MBL/TIGI Products allows Helen of Troy to use the Bed Head by TIGI trademark. Another agreement with MBL/Toni&amp;Guy Products extends Helen of Troy's use of the Toni&amp;Guy trademark.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its deal with Vessel gave Helen of Troy the intellectual property rights to Vessel's rechargeable lighting products and allowed Helen of Troy entrance into a new niche market. Products with brand names, including Candela and Candeloo, are sold by the firm's OXO International unit. As part of the agreement Vessel and Helen of Troy are expanding their offerings and developing new applications in the rechargeable lighting products category.

        <p>
   In 2016 Helen of Troy acquired Steel Technology LLC (DBA Hydro Flask), a designer and distributor of sporty insulated mugs, flasks, and bottles. The acquisition broadens Helen of Troy's consumer product and brand name line up. The company bought Hydro Flask for about $210 million in cash.

   Louis Rubin and his son, Gerald, started Helen of Troy in 1969, mostly as a wig-selling business. In the next few years, wigs became less fashionable, so the company switched its focus to high-end hair appliances for salons. In 1978 Gerald bought the company from his father.
  </p>
        <p>
   Two years later Helen of Troy bought licensing rights from hairstylist Vidal Sassoon, outbidding personal appliance bigwigs
   <company id="10655">
    Gillette
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   . Helen of Troy went public in 1981 to help finance the licensing. By 1982 Sassoon products accounted for some 80% of sales. Around 1986 Gillette and General Electric, perhaps sensing slings and stones, exited the hair appliance segments occupied by Helen of Troy.
  </p>
        <p>
   The firm bought the Beauty Biz beauty supply chain in 1987, expanding to 35 locations in the Southwest US. Results weren't pretty, however, and Helen of Troy sold the business to Sally Beauty Supply in 1993. That year it started shipping Revlon-brand products under license.
  </p>
        <p>
   Helen of Troy went head-to-heel in 1996. It acquired several businesses of Dazey, including the rights to licenses for Dr. Scholl's foot baths and massagers and Dazey- and Carel-brand hard-hat hair dryers for salons. In 1997 the company acquired Caruso International, maker of steam hairsetters. Things afoot in 1998 included Helen of Troy's purchases of the Wigo line of professional salon products and hair accessory marketers Karina and DCNL.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Helen of Troy signed a licensing deal with
   <company id="10966">
    Mattel
   </company>
   to make Barbie-brand hair accessories for children. In 2000 the company acquired a 55% stake in Tactica International, a maker of personal care products (and sold it back to Tactica's management in 2004).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the company signed a licensing agreement with Proctor &amp; Gamble to market Vidal Sassoon products. That year it also acquired six consumer brands from P&amp;G in a cash deal -- four directly: Ammens, Condition 3-in-1, Final Net, and Vitalis -- and two through license agreements: Sea Breeze and Vitapointe. A new division of Helen of Troy (Hair and Skin Care) was created to market the products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company purchased the Brut product line (in the Americas) from
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   in September 2003, thereby expanding the company's presence in men's personal care products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company boosted its professional distribution product line in 2007 with the acquisition of Belson Products, a supplier of salon products in North America and the UK, from
   <company id="119461">
    Applica Consumer Products
   </company>
   . The deal brought with it brands such as Belson, Belson Pro, Gold 'N Hot, Curlmaster, Premiere, Profiles, Comare, Mega Hot, and Shear Technology. During 2008, the company's Wigo line logged noteworthy growth for the professional category. Helen of Troy purchased Belson in 2007, Ogilvie in 2008, and Infusium 23 in 2009.
