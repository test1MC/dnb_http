   Are you

   you want to remember high school? If so, look to Jostens, the leading US producer of yearbooks and class rings through its memory book and scholastic business segments. Class rings are sold on school campuses and through bookstores, retail jewelers, and the Web, while Jostens' sports rings commemorate professional sports champions (it has made more than 25 Super Bowl rings). Its other graduation products include diplomas, announcements, caps, and gowns. Jostens, founded in 1897 and purchased by

   Otto Jostens founded Jostens as a jewelry and watch repair business in Owatonna, Minnesota, in 1897. He began making school awards in 1900 and class rings in 1906. In 1922 Daniel Gainey became Jostens' first ring salesman; the charismatic Gainey recruited more sales representatives and sales followed. Jostens exited the watch repair business in 1930 and built its first ring manufacturing plant; Gainey became chairman and CEO in 1933.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years Jostens added graduation announcements (1946), yearbooks (1950), diplomas (1958), and specially commissioned rings (1960). Gainey retired in 1968, and the firm moved to Minneapolis in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jostens divested some noncore businesses and added sportswear, caps and gowns, and business recognition awards in the 1970s. It bought educational software companies and vocational schools in the mid-1980s but sold the schools in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits slipped in 1992 and 1993. New CEO Robert Buhrmaster, hired in 1992, consolidated operations, cut jobs, centralized management, and sold software and sportswear interests. Paring away slow sellers, Jostens reduced the recognition line by half during 1996 and ring styles from 200 to 75 in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Jostens was hit with a judgment of up to $36 million in an antitrust suit brought by
   <company id="16999">
    Insilco
   </company>
   's Taylor Publishing, a school yearbook rival. A federal judge overturned the verdict in early 1999. Also in 1999 it formed an alliance with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   to expand its use of digital photography in Canadian schools; related to the deal, Jostens acquired Sony's Canadian school photography business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 1999 the company agreed to a $950 million buyout led by Investcorp. Jostens also said it would refocus on its school-based units, eliminating about 100 jobs. The Investcorp-led investment group acquired 94% of Jostens, effectively taking the company private in May 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jostens announced in late 2001 that it would exit the recognition business, which provided organizations with programs to recognize and reward employee service and achievement. To that end, it sold most of that business to Midwest Trophy Manufacturing, an Oklahoma awards and trophy maker that had been a key supplier.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Jostens' shareholders approved the company's sale to a unit of CSFB in a cash deal valued at $494 million. Ring Acquisition Corp., a newly formed company controlled by the private equity arm of CSFB, was merged with Jostens; Jostens was the surviving corporation.

   Visant Holding Corp., the specialty publishing and marketing services company created in 2004, consists of Jostens, as well as

    Von Hoffmann Corporation

   (a leading printer of educational textbooks and supplemental materials) and Arcade Marketing (a printer and manufacturer of sampling products for the fragrance, cosmetics, consumer products, and food and beverage industries). Publishing powerhouse
   <company id="11244">
    R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company
   </company>
   acquired Von Hoffmann for more than $412 million in cash in May 2007. DLJ Merchant Banking Partners III is the CSFB affiliate that co-owns Jostens.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2004 Michael Bailey succeeded Buhrmaster (who retired) as CEO of the company. Bailey, himself, retired in January 2008 and passed his titles of president and CEO to Tim Larson. In 2005 Jostens moved its diploma operations out of its Red Wing, Minnesota, manufacturing plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jostens sold its US and Canadian school photography business (about 8% of net sales in 2005) to photography company
   <company id="54904">
    Lifetouch
   </company>
   . The deal, which closed in mid-2006, allowed Jostens to focus on its core Scholastic and Yearbook businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2008 Tim Larson succeeded Bailey as president and CEO of the company.
