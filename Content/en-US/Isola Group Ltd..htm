   Isola puts the "board" in printed circuit board (PCB). The company manufactures base materials used to make PCBs at more than a dozen facilities around the globe. Its manufacturing processes for laminates and other materials, such as glass, cellulose, and epoxy, use state-of-the-art technologies (closed-loop feed-forward and feed-back cure, and thickness control systems) to ensure composite integrity. Other technical innovations ensure tight dielectric thickness control. End users include customers in the automotive, computer, medical, military, and wireless communications markets. More than 80% of sales come from outside the US. Investment firm
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   owns Isola, which filed to go public in 2011.

  <p>
   More than three years after Isola Group filed to go public, the offering has yet to be completed. In its October 2011 filing the company stated that it plans to use the anticipated $100 million in proceeds to repay debt.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Asia is Arizona-based Isola's largest market, accounting for about two-thirds of sales. The Americas represent nearly 20% of sales, while Europe contributes about 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm has 10 manufacturing plants and three research centers located in China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UK.

   Isola counts PCB fabricators such as

  <p>
   Isola's lackluster financial performance presumably has damped demand for its IPO. The company reported revenue of $555.5 million in 2012, a 7% decline versus 2011 and it was unprofitable. Indeed, Isola posted a net loss of nearly $53 million in 2012, after turning a modest profit in 2011 and 2010. Reductions in unit volumes were the cause of the decline in 2012 sales. On a geographic basis, sales were essentially flat in Asia (Isola's largest market) in 2012 compared with 2011, while declining in the Americas, and even more steeply in Europe (down 28%).

  <p>
   Going forward, Isola intends to introduce new products, find new uses for existing products, and look for possible acquisitions. It also plans to continue its push into China, where it already has five manufacturing facilities.

  <p>
   Isola Group celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012. The company was founded in 1912 as Continentale Isola Werke AG, based in Germany. It began making base materials in 1956. Following the acquisition of US-based ADI in 1987, it renamed that business Isola USA and eventually moved its corporate headquarters to the US. The PCB maker was acquired by
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   in 2004. Prior to filing for its IPO, the company took the corporate name Isola Group Ltd.
