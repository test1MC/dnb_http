  <p>
   The company has experienced strong revenue growth the last three years. In 2015 revenues climbed by 12% to peak at $3 billion, primarily due to a 59% surge in its Grede segment, partially offset by declines in its Metaldyne segment. Net income also surged by 72% in 2015 mainly due to a decline in losses related to paying down debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth in its Grede segment was fueled by its
   <company id="161639">
    Grede
   </company>
   acquisition which contributed approximately $409 million of extra revenue and increased volumes, mainly due to light vehicle production volumes. Also a 2% increase in HHI net sales was primarily attributable to increased volumes due to higher North American light vehicle production levels. The decrease in Metaldyne net sales was attributable to unfavorable foreign currency movements, net price decreases, and lower raw material pass-through.
