   If it were that easy to treat ADHD, Alcobra would wave a magic wand and say "Abracadabra!" Instead, the Israeli company is developing a new type of drug to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The drug candidate, MG01CI, differs from traditional pharmaceuticals prescribed to manage ADHD in that it is not a stimulant like its well-known counterparts Adderall and Ritalin. MG01CI aims to be a safer alternative for patients who cannot tolerate the side effects, such as insomnia and high blood pressure, associated with stimulants. The company teamed up with equity investor
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   to complete a Phase II study in adults in 2011. Alcobra went public in the US in 2013.

   As a development-stage company with no products on the market, Alcobra raised $25 million in the US capital market. It plans to use about $6 million of the proceeds to complete Phase II/III trials, about $3 million to begin the regulatory process in the US and the European Union, about $2 million to evaluate whether MG01CI might be effective in other psychiatric disorders, and any remainder will go toward general corporate purposes.

   While MG01CI aims to be an alternative to the stimulants commonly prescribed to manage ADHD in adults, there is already a non-stimulant drug on the market called Strattera, launched in 2003 by
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   . However, Strattera can take months to become effective and patients can also experience side effects such as sexual problems, heart palpitations, and high blood pressure. Alcobra's Phase II study showed MG01C1 to be a well-tolerated, immediate, and effective treatment. The company hopes to explore using MG01CI to treat other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and cognitive impairment in mood disorders.
