   Rengo is one of the Japan's top producers of corrugated cardboard, and it also makes paperboard, paperboard packaging, containerboards, cartons, whiteboard, and packaging machinery. Corrugated boxes accounts for roughly 50% of its sales, while paperboard, corrugated board, flexible packaging, and other segments collectively account for the remainder. Rengo operates through roughly 90 plants and offices concentrated in China, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the US. The company traces its historical roots back to 1909, when it was the first company in Japan to produce corrugated cardboard.

  <p>
   Rengo's net sales increased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. The growth was fueled by a surge in demand for corrugated packaging products and additional revenue from its flexible packaging and heavy duty packaging-related business segments. It was particularly helped by a 33% surge in heavy duty packaging business sales in 2014. Sales volumes of corrugated boxes in Japan increased 8% from 2013 to 2014, benefiting from increased demand for food and beverage-related applications.

  <p>
   Rengo often strengthens its core business through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it purchased Hirooka Shiki Co., making it a subsidiary of Rengo. Hirooka Shiki has a long history as a manufacturer of corrugated boxes. Through the purchase, Rengo further enhanced its corrugated packaging business within the Hokuriku region.
