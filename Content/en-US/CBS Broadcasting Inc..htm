   The forensic evidence shows this company is tops in the TV ratings. CBS Broadcasting owns and operates the CBS Television Network, the #1 watched broadcast network in the US. Its top shows include
   <em>
    CSI: Crime Scene Investigation
   </em>
   and its two spinoffs, as well as
   <em>
    The Mentalist, NCIS,
   </em>
   and a host of primetime comedies. It boasts more than 200 affiliate stations around the country, including about 15 stations that are company-owned and -operated. In addition, CBS Broadcasting oversees

   Like most other big media businesses, CBS Corporation aims to integrate its content creation and distribution arms in order to generate multiple streams of revenue, and the CBS network plays a pivotal role within that strategy. The network generates revenue from advertising for shows created by the company's production units (namely
   <company id="161460">
    CBS Television Studios
   </company>
   ), and it serves as a point of contact with a large audience to help cross-promote other CBS properties, including books (
   <company id="43566">
    Simon &amp; Schuster
   </company>
   ), consumer products and DVDs, and Internet sites (
   <company id="147700">
    CBS Interactive
   </company>
   ). It is also the biggest portion of CBS Corporation's entertainment segment, which accounts for about 55% of sales.

   The CBS network depends on advertising for the lion's share of its revenue, which means it is constantly focused on fine-tuning its programming to keep audiences glued to the television. In that endeavor CBS had been very successful: The network has dominated the ratings race for most of the past decade thanks to its primetime criminal dramas and sitcoms, including
   <em>
    Two and a Half Men
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Big Bang Theory
   </em>
   . It is also second only to
   <company id="103359">
    FOX
   </company>
   in the coveted 18-49 demographic, though its core primetime shows still skew more towards older audiences than some of the other networks.

  <p>
   Heavy investment in sports programming also helps boost the network's audience numbers. CBS is also focused on the financial health of its broadcasting affiliates, including such big station groups as
   <company id="45714">
    Gray Television
   </company>
   and
   <company id="43432">
    LIN Media
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While positions in the broadcast ratings game have become largely entrenched, CBS has not rested on its laurels. CBS is continuing to diversify its revenue streams through interactive media. The network distributes many of its shows online as well as through
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's iTunes store.

   Arthur Judson founded radio broadcasting company United Independent Broadcasters (UIB) in 1927. Columbia Phonograph bought UIB's broadcasting rights later that year, and the company was rechristened the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting System, a moniker later shortened to the Columbia Broadcasting System. When cigar maker Sam Paley took a controlling interest in the company in 1928, he installed his son William as president, and the younger Paley set about changing the face of broadcasting. He promoted daytime dramas, raided stars from rival NBC, and built a strong news organization.

   CBS branched into TV broadcasting during the 1940s, picking up its Tiffany Network nickname for programming considered classier than the norm. The network found itself red-faced when its
   <i>
    $64,000 Question
   </i>
   was front and center in the 1958 quiz show scandal, but thanks to shows such as
   <i>
    I Love Lucy
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    The Beverly Hillbillies,
   </i>
   CBS was #1 in ratings for much of the 1950s and 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In spite of a flurry of turnover among top management during the 1970s, programming such as
   <i>
    The Mary Tyler Moore Show
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    All in the Family
   </i>
   helped CBS stay on top in the ratings. The series finale of
   <em>
    M*A*S*H
   </em>
   in 1983 set a record for TV audiences when 106 million people tuned in. (The mark stood unbroken until CBS' broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV in early 2010.) Laurence Tisch became CEO in 1987; he led the sale of CBS's publishing and record operations. When William Paley died in 1990, Tisch became chairman.

   A stunned CBS lost broadcasting rights to
   <company id="40330">
    NFL
   </company>
   football games and several affiliates to the
   <company id="103359">
    FOX
   </company>
   network in 1994. After a no-confidence vote from one of its top institutional investors the following year, Westinghouse Electric acquired CBS for $5.4 billion. Committing itself to broadcasting, Westinghouse started selling its non-broadcasting holdings and acquired radio firm Infinity Broadcasting (now named
   <company id="58372">
    CBS Radio
   </company>
   ) in 1996. It also expanded into cable, buying The Nashville Network (now
   <company id="138764">
    Spike TV
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="138244">
    Country Music Television
   </company>
   . The company changed its name from Westinghouse to CBS Corporation in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   CBS got back on the gridiron in 1998 when it outbid NBC for an NFL contract. President and COO Mel Karmazin (former CEO of Infinity Broadcasting) was appointed CEO in 1999 and led CBS to a swarm of Internet acquisitions, including stakes in
   <company id="45216">
    Hollywood Media Corp.
   </company>
   (disposed in 2002),
   <company id="60281">
    Medscape
   </company>
   (acquired by WebMD -- later
   <company id="52100">
    HLTH Corporation

   <company id="99047">
    Switchboard
   </company>
   (acquired by Infospace, now
   <company id="56246">
    Blucora
   </company>
   , in 2004). Other deals included the $2.5 billion acquisition of syndication giant King World Productions (now part of
   <company id="107099">
    CBS Television Distribution
   </company>
   ) and an 11-year, $6 billion deal for exclusive rights to the
   <company id="106802">
    NCAA
   </company>
   college basketball championship tournament.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a mega-deal to keep up with other media giants such as
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41816">
    News Corp.
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12435">
    Viacom
   </company>
   bought CBS in 2000 for about $45 billion. Many of CBS's assets, such as its cable networks and radio operations, were reorganized under Viacom. Karmazin became president and COO of Viacom, and Leslie Moonves became CEO of the new CBS Broadcasting subsidiary. In 2002 the network gained 32% of sports news Web site operator
   <company id="46657">
    SportsLine.com
   </company>
   . (CBS bought the rest of SportsLine.com in late 2004.) Viacom put fledgling network
   <company id="101166">
    UPN
   </company>
   under the CBS umbrella in 2002, combining management and operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moonves added chairman to his title in 2003 when he signed a five-year contract; the following year he was named co-president of Viacom (along with
   <company id="101156">
    MTV
   </company>
   chief Tom Freston) when Karmazin abruptly resigned from the company. The
   <company id="105650">
    FCC
   </company>
   fined the CBS network a record $550,000 for its 2004 Super Bowl halftime show in which singer Janet Jackson bared her breast in what has since been called a "wardrobe malfunction."
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of the following year, Viacom split into two separately traded public companies. CBS Broadcasting ended up as the largest unit of
   <company id="12435">
    CBS Corporation
   </company>
   , which combined broadcast TV and radio operations with outdoor advertising assets. In 2006 CBS merged its UPN network with
   <company id="101420">
    The WB Network
   </company>
   , owned by
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   's
   <company id="103206">
    Warner Bros. Entertainment
   </company>
   , to create
   <company id="153120">
    The CW Network
   </company>
   . CBS lost its crown as the #1 watched network during the 2007-08 season when FOX managed to surpass it in total viewers. (That season was marred by a writers' strike that delayed production of most scripted programs.) The following year, though, CBS regained the top spot and has not relinquished the crown since.
