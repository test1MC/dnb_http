   Even a senior can be flexible. Senior plc's Flexonics division makes flexible components for vehicle exhaust and emissions control systems. The unit's sectors include Land Vehicle Emission Control (for passenger and heavy-duty diesel engines) and Industrial Process Control (for temperature/pressure). The company's larger division -- Aerospace (65% of sales) -- comprises Structures, Fluid Conveyance Systems, and Gas Turbine Engines; it manufactures non-metallic air and hydraulic systems, aero-engines, and aerostructures for military, commercial, regional, and business jet aircraft. Major OEM customers include

   , and

   . Senior has 25 operations in about a dozen countries.

   Incorporated as Senior Economisers in 1933, the company was named in 1970 as Senior Engineering Group. In 1992 the company acquired US-based Flexonics, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Senior Engineering picked up US-based Metal Bellows in 1994, adding edge-welded bellows to its product line and increasing the company's aerospace operations. It also added German flexible hose and expansion joint company Berghofer to its European operations that year. Other acquisitions included Stainless Steel Products (airplane ducting, US) and Ermeto Hydexco (high-pressure diesel tubes, France) in 1995, and Habia (vinyl polymer products, Sweden) and Jackson (vinyl polymer products distribution, US) in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Senior Engineer again broadened its involvement in the fast-growing aerospace market by acquiring California-based Ketema, a maker of stainless steel, titanium, and aluminum assemblies for jet engines, as well as cryogenic valves used in rockets and other aerospace applications. Also that year the company acquired another US-based edge-welded bellows company, Metal Fab, and commissioned a new Flexonics plant in South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Senior Engineer picked up its biggest acquisition to date in 1998, with the $56 million purchase of US-based Jet Products, a maker of precision components for aerospace and land based turbines. Among its half dozen or so other acquisitions during the year were three Brazilian companies that manufactured automotive exhaust decouplers and flexible metallic hoses and expansion joints.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 CEO Andrew Parrish announced that the company would continue bolstering its Flexonics segment and that aerospace would probably account for about 40% of sales -- up from 18% when he joined the company in 1997. Sure enough, in 1999 the company jettisoned its Precision Tube (precision welded tube) and Heat Treatment (heat treatment of metals) businesses to concentrate on its Flexonics operations. The company acquired expansion joint manufacturer Pathway Bellows and the aerospace ducting division of Cork Industries. Also in 1999 Senior's holding company changed its name from Senior Engineering Group plc to Senior plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Graham Menzies, former CEO of Adwest (automotive components maker), replaced Parrish in 2000. That year the company announced plans to dispose of its specialized industrial division (niche industrial market products) to concentrate on its aerospace and automotive divisions (in 2001 Senior put those plans on hold in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks). In 2001 Senior sold its Senior Air Systems (air-conditioning equipment) subsidiary to Nortek. It renamed its flexible tubes division Flexonics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Senior continued to narrow its focus in 2004 by selling five industrial hose businesses. The moves marked Senior's exit from the industrial sector -- leaving Aerospace and Flexonics as its two remaining business segments. (Flexonics, however, continued to serve certain industrial sectors including power generation, and oil and gas.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Senior's Flexonics division suffered flat performance due to reduced production by carmakers in North America and Europe. However, in late 2006 Flexonics introduced new products for North America's heavy-duty diesel engine sector -- a new market for Senior.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, Senior's Aerospace division enjoyed an increase in orders for and deliveries of new aircraft at

    Boeing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , as worldwide air travel grew. On the defense side, Senior's aerospace unit enjoyed heightened demand, as well. Outside the organic growth arena, Senior's Aerospace portfolio grew in 2006 with the purchase of two companies: Sterling Machine Co. (a maker of precision machined parts) and Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies Inc. (AMT; manufactures aluminum parts for aerospace manufacturers). Additionally, the company acquired Absolute, a US maker of precision machined parts for aerospace, in 2007, and Capo Industries, a specialized US producer of aero-engine components, in 2008.
