  <p>
   Robert Leff, a software developer for Citibank (now part of Citigroup), got started in the distribution business in 1980 when he invested $1,700 in game and entertainment software to sell in his spare time. He and co-worker David Wagman quit their jobs and founded Softsel Computer Products. Working out of Leff's house and using a list of authorized Apple Computer distributors as a prospect sheet, the pair had sales of $350,000 their first year. By the end of 1981, sales had jumped to $7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Softsel moved into Europe in 1983 and entered the software mass market two years later. However, the computer industry slumped, and Softsel suffered returns on unsold products amounting to millions of dollars; this led to its first loss. To lower costs the company sold its software publishing division and its unprofitable German subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Softsel rebounded, and in 1988 it went public. By 1989 the company had sales of more than $600 million, but it had set its sights on bigger targets. When it acquired hardware distributor Microamerica in 1990, Softsel became one of the largest computer products distributors in the world, with sales of more than $1 billion. The acquisition included Microamerica's warehouses in Europe and Latin America. The companies combined their names to create Merisel.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, merging the two corporate cultures proved problematic. California-based Softsel had a laid-back atmosphere (Leff's taste ran to Hawaiian shirts), while Boston-based Microamerica was more button-down in dress and atmosphere. As the company struggled to meld decentralized Microamerica with the centralized operations of Softsel, costs soared and profits plummeted.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1991, however, profits began to recover. That year Merisel made another, more successful push into mass market channels as the computer industry shifted away from traditional retailers and toward big chains and warehouse stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merisel became a master distributor -- both a distributor and a reseller -- when it acquired the franchise and distribution operations of ComputerLand in 1994. The deal prompted Merisel to issue $125 million in debt to cover the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leff and Wagman both retired from the company in 1995, a year that saw Merisel fall deep into the red and struggle under its rising debt. In early 1996 Dwight Steffensen, a former president and COO of pharmaceuticals distributor Bergen Brunswig (now AmerisourceBergen) and a Merisel board member since 1990, was named chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steffensen started Merisel on a major restructuring, selling the company's Australian operations, as well as its European and Latin American operations (to now defunct rival CHS Electronics). The deals left Merisel with more losses for 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company sold its reseller businesses to SYNNEX Information Technologies. Merisel restructured its debt by selling a majority stake in the company to investment firm Stonington Partners. The company began stepping up its activities in the networking market in 1998. Also that year widespread speculation arose that CHS would acquire Merisel, but no deal ever materialized.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the wake of another year of losses, Merisel in 2000 made its higher-growth Sun Microsystems support and resale arm, Merisel Open Computing Alliance (MOCA), a separate subsidiary. Later that year turnaround specialist David Sadler replaced Steffensen as CEO; the company sold MOCA to rival Arrow Electronics. The company in 2000 also bought out the assets of ailing online retailer Value America, which it merged into its Optisel unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2001 Merisel, as part of its shift into software license distribution, sold its Canadian computer products distribution business (nearly $300 million in 2001 sales) to

    Synnex
   </company>
   . Also that year the company promoted its CFO, Timothy Jenson, to the position of CEO. Merisel discontinued the operations of Optisel in early 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, the company sold its software licensing business to D&amp;H Services. Jenson resigned that year after the company's audit committee launched an investigation into the sale, and former EDS executive Donald Uzzi replaced him. The dispute between Merisel and Jenson was settled in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merisel went several months without any operations before entering the digital imaging business by acquiring Color Edge, Color Edge Visual, Crush Creative, and Comp 24 in 2005. The following year Merisel acquired prototype companies Dennis Curtin Studios and Advertising Props (AdProps), as well as premedia and retouching company Fuel Digital.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company consolidated Crush Creative and Fuel Digital under the ColorEdge brand.
