   Monterey Mushrooms has operations popping up all over. A leading cultivator and marketer of fresh mushrooms, the company started with a single farm in 1971 and has since grown into an international giant. Monterey Mushrooms maintains about a dozen North American farms.

In addition to fresh mushrooms, the company offers mushroom products packed in cans, jars, and in frozen sauces.
