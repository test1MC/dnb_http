  <p>
   Smithfield Foods Ltd. is the result of its parent's Smithfield Foods, Inc.'s acquisition of UK-based meat company Norwich Food and Polish company Ridpath PEK in 2004. Norwich supplied fresh meat, poultry, and game to retailers, wholesalers, food processors, and caterers; Ridpath distributed PEK and other brand name canned and deli meats.
  </p>
  <p>
   Combined as Smithfield Foods Ltd., the deal enabled Smithfield Foods to target the entire UK food supply chain with a domestic presence. The UK subsidiary benefits from Smithfield Foods' well-known brand name and deep pockets, particularly a supply relationship with Polish and Romanian hog farms, and a minority interest in one of Europe's largest packaged meat companies, Campofrio. In 2006 Smithfield Foods Ltd. went on to take over

   's European meats business, which strengthened its portfolio of deli and processed meats.
