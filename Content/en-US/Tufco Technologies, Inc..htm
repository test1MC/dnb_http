   Tough stains are no match for Tufco Technologies' cleaning products. Its cleaning wipes are used for industrial, automotive, personal care, home, and institutional applications. To complement the needs of its wipes customers, Tufco also offers custom formulation development and blending as well as microbiological services. Customers are multinational consumer products businesses and, less so, business paper distributors. The company was originally founded in 1974 by converting industry veterans Samuel Bero and Patrick Garland; it was acquired by investment firm Griffin Holdings in 2014.

  <p>
   In March 2014 investment firm Griffin Holdings purchased Tufco after Tufco had begun considering strategic alternatives.

   Tufco markets its products and services nationally through nearly 15 sales and customer service representatives and roughly 40 manufacturer's representatives and distributors. Its customer base consists of over 250 companies, including multinational consumer products companies and dealers or distributors of business imaging papers.

  <p>
   The company drives a two-fold strategy. It aims to exploit its manufacturing efficiencies and expertise to capture existing and developing demand for converted paper products. Concurrently, it strives to transform one-time orders to long-term relationships that supplement or replace customers' own production and distribution operations.
