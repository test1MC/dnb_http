   Formosa Plastics Corporation ranks among the world's foremost plastics companies. The flagship of the Formosa Plastics Group, it is one of Taiwan's top petrochemical companies and the world's No. 2 producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins (after Japan's

   .). In addition to producing PVC, it makes several other plastic products: acrylic acid, polyolefins like LDPE and HDPE, caustic soda, chlorine, calcium carbonates, and hydrochloric acid. Subsidiaries include

  <p>
   In 1932 Yung-Ching Wang borrowed $200 from his father, a Taiwanese tea merchant, to buy a rice mill near the town of Jiayi. The mill was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1944, but Wang went on to make a fortune in timber and founded Formosa Plastics, a small polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant, in 1954. He bought the technology from the Japanese, later joking that he didn't even know then what the "P" in PVC stood for.
  </p>
  <p>
   At first Wang had trouble finding buyers for his PVC resins. In 1958 he set up his own resin processor,
   <company id="57902">
    Nan Ya Plastics
   </company>
   , and later formed Formosa Chemicals &amp; Fibre to make rayon backing for PVC leather (1965). For the next 15 years, the company grew into the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), an exclusively Taiwanese enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1980 and 1988 Wang bought 14 US PVC manufacturers, including
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical
   </company>
   's vinyl chloride monomer plant (1981), Stauffer Chemical's PVC plant (1981), and Manville Corporation's PVC businesses (1983). He started building a Texas PVC plant in 1981 and cut construction costs up to 40% by importing equipment from Taiwan. When the PVC market became saturated in the mid-1980s, Wang diversified, building plants to make semiconductor chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wang bought several Texas-based oil and gas properties in 1988, including 218 producing wells, a gas-processing plant, and a pipeline firm. Faced with stricter pollution controls in Taiwan, Wang began building an ethylene plant in Point Comfort, Texas, in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Wang wanted to build an ethylene complex in mainland China, where there were no pollution controls. Taiwan balked at the proposal, suggesting that FPG build at home. Attempting to circumvent a Taiwanese law against direct investment in the mainland, Wang sought Chinese approval through subsidiary
   <company id="42415">
    Formosa Plastics Corporation, U.S.A
   </company>
   . In 1993 Chinese authorities rejected a plan that would require them to finance up to two-thirds of a $7 billion petrochemical complex.
  </p>
  <p>
   Formosa Plastics bought bankrupt US computer maker Everex Systems in 1993. Meanwhile, the group's focus again turned to mainland China when Nan Ya Plastics made plans in 1994 to build three plants along China's Long River.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1995 death of Wang's mother (at age 108) set off a power struggle between family factions. The company won licenses in 1996 to build power plants, which would make FPG Taiwan's first private-sector power supplier and end a 50-year government utility monopoly. That year, in defiance of Taiwan's policy of limiting investment in China, FPG announced it would build a power plant there. Pressure from the Taiwanese government put the project on hold in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   FPG upped its investment in a new Taiwanese petrochemical complex in 1998. It formed ventures with Asahi Chemical to make spandex fiber and with France's
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   to make hybrid (gasoline/electric) cars. Also that year the group admitted to combining mercury-laden waste with cement and sneaking the toxic mixture to Cambodia disguised as 3,000 tons of cement block. FPG apologized after villagers living near the dump became ill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Undaunted by a history of animosity between the two countries, Formosa Plastics and FPG's other flagship companies in 1999 invested a 60% stake in the production of power plants in the Chinese province of Fujian.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wang retired in 2006, leaving the company in the control of his children and other family members.
