   The Automotive Technology business segment is Bosch LLC's largest, generating about 65% of annual revenues. With the rebound of the automotive industry in 2010 -- vehicle production increased almost 40% -- the company's Automotive Technology unit realized a 13% increase in sales over 2010. The improvement was attributed to a better economy, but also to the increased demand for the company's advanced vehicle technology offerings that are touted as safer, cleaner, and more economical.

  <p>
   The company's Consumer Goods and Building Technology division -- portable power tools, security systems, thermotechnology, and home appliances units -- generated 20% of its total sales for 2011. This division also has expertise in making home appliances, such as refrigerators and freezers, washers and dryers, dishwashers, and ovens and cooktops.

   The Bosch Automotive Aftermarket division in 2011 acquired Taiwan-based Uni­point Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of starters, alternators, temperature control units, and wiper blades. Unipoint manufactures products in Asia which is distributed throughout North America, South America and Europe. The dell augmented Bosch's position as the leading supplier of starters and alternators and added another Asian production facility to its wiper blade business unit.
