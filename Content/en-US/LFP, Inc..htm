   The founding fathers probably never imagined anything like this company when they wrote the First Amendment. LFP (which also does business as Larry Flynt Publications) runs the adult entertainment empire owned by infamous porn purveyor Larry Flynt, including his flagship magazine
   <i>
    Hustler
   </i>
   . The company's publishing portfolio includes two additional magazine titles (
   <em>
    Barely Legal
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Taboo
   </em>
   ). LFP also produces and distributes adult videos (through its Hustler Video), and has a number of adult websites. In addition, the company runs about 10 Hustler Hollywood retail stores. Flynt started publishing
   <em>
    Hustler
   </em>
   magazine in 1974 and founded Larry Flynt Publications two years later.

   Born to a poor Kentucky tobacco farmer, Larry Flynt started publishing
   <i>
    Hustler
   </i>
   in 1974 as a giveaway to patrons of his topless bars in Ohio. Described by Flynt as "tasteless, but what people want," the magazine was raunchier than
   <i>
    Penthouse
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    Playboy,
   </i>
   and it gained an immediate following. When he founded Larry Flynt Publications (later shortened to just LFP) in 1976 and began publishing the monthly nationwide,
   <i>
    Hustler
   </i>
   quickly became known not only for its bawdy photos, but also for its satirical cartoons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not only attracting readers, Flynt's publication quickly drew protests and lawsuits. Charles Keating (later convicted of fraud during the savings and loan scandal) helped lead a crusade in Cincinnati that got Flynt a 25-year prison sentence, which was overturned on appeal. Outrage over his magazine also landed Flynt in a wheelchair in 1978 when white supremacist John Paul Franklin paralyzed him in a sniper attack outside a Georgia courthouse. (Always the flamboyant one, Flynt uses a solid gold wheelchair.) Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell sued Flynt over a 1983
   <em>
    Hustler
   </em>
   cartoon depicting him engaged in a sexual encounter with his mother, but Flynt eventually won a Supreme Court decision protecting his First Amendment rights.

   By the mid-1980s, however,
   <i>
    Hustler
   </i>
   sales began sliding, so LFP moved into mainstream magazines in 1985. By the early 1990s the company's roster of publications had grown to more than two dozen, including such innocuous periodicals as
   <i>
    Maternity Fashion &amp; Beauty.
   </i>
   Milos Forman's biopic
   <i>
    The People vs. Larry Flynt
   </i>
   (1996) revitalized the popular porn magnate's image, and soon Larry Flynt was getting into trouble again.
  </p>
  <p>
   He returned LFP to Cincinnati in 1997 to open a downtown store selling items including magazines and adult videos. Ohio authorities responded the following year by indicting Flynt and his brother on several counts of pandering obscenity (the charges were dropped in 1999 after Flynt paid a $10,000 fine and agreed to stop selling videos at the store). Flynt also took out a full-page ad in the
   <i>
    Washington Post
   </i>
   in 1998 to protest the impeachment of President Clinton. He offered $1 million to any woman who would go public about affairs with members of Congress. Several women responded, and Flynt published the stories in a special issue called
   <i>
    The Flynt Report,
   </i>
   which led to the resignation of Representative Robert Livingston, who had been gearing up to become Newt Gingrich's successor as Speaker of the House.
  </p>
  <p>
   LFP opened its Hustler Hollywood "boutique" in 1999; the following year it moved its Cincinnati store to a new downtown location to make way for a civic center and began construction of another store in nearby Monroe, Ohio. The company opened the Hustler Casino, a card room, outside Los Angeles in 2000. In 2002 the company's casino aspirations took a blow when its bid to gain a full gaming license was denied.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company closed or sold 20 of its non-adult titles including
   <em>
    Big Brother
   </em>
   (skateboarding) and
   <em>
    Skin &amp; Ink
   </em>
   (tattoos). The following year, Hustler Hollywood expanded with a new location in Miami. Flynt, meanwhile, was ordered to pay $1.1 million as a result of a sexual harassment suit brought by a former employee. In 2007 Flynt promoted Michael Klein to the position of president; Klein had previously run LFP's broadcasting and Internet operations.
