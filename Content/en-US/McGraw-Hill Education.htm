   The McGraw-Hill Companies sold the education division, once its core segment, to focus on its
   <company id="126367">
    Standard &amp; Poor's
   </company>
   credit reporting company. As a traditional textbook publisher, McGraw-Hill Education faces increasing competition from online publishers as schools and universities looks to cut costs. Sales of new textbooks are also impacted by the used book and rental market. As such, the company is focused on offering more digital learning products.

   MHE is working to boost its digital operations through acquisitions. In 2011 it bought Bookette, a software company that provides programs to help instructors with grading online tests. The previous year, it acquired Tegrity, a provider of software that lets colleges and universities record classroom lectures and store them in a searchable database. Also in 2010, the company formed a partnership with education software firm
   <company id="99204">
    Blackboard
   </company>
   that allows users to access MHE's interactive titles via the Blackboard platform. The deal significantly boosted the company's flagship McGraw-Hill Connect homework management platform, which allows college instructors to organize assignments for online use by students.

   Other key MHE brands include Glencoe (instructional materials), Wright Group (elementary literacy and mathematics programs), and CTB (standardized achievement tests). The company's Open University Press subsidiary is a social science and health publisher with operations in the UK and the US. International operations include businesses in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, India, and Latin America.
