   Whether you have cats or cattle, Zoetis has something to keep them healthy and happy. The company manufactures and sells veterinary medicines such as parasiticides (for fleas, ticks, and worms), anti-infectives, medicated feed additives, vaccines, and other pharmaceuticals. Zoetis boasts more than 300 product lines sold in more than 100 countries around the world, making it one of the world's largest animal health businesses. In addition to medications and vaccines, Zoetis offers diagnostics, genetics, devices, and services such as dairy data management and consulting.
  </p>

  <p>
   Veterinary medications don't have the same rigorous regulatory processes that human medicines do, and research and development time is faster (about three years), less expensive, and more predictable. In addition, pet owners and ranchers pay out-of-pocket for products; Zoetis doesn't have to wait to be reimbursed by private or government-owned insurance companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   With discretionary spending on pet products in established markets on the rise, Zoetis makes about 40% of sales on products for companion animals such as house pets and horses. Medicine and vaccines for livestock (including cattle, swine, poultry, and fish), which assist in the global food supply chain, account for the other 60% of revenue. The company's product sales are diverse - with 300 different lines, no one product accounts for more than 10% of sales. Its top seller, the antibiotic ceftiofur (sold under the brands Excede, Excenel, Spectramast, and Naxcel) made up 8% of overall revenues in 2015. Ceftiofur sales, combined with Zoetis' second- and third-largest sellers (Revolution and Draxxin), accounted for 21% of sales that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anti-infective sales provide more than a quarter of total revenues, followed by vaccines (24%), parasiticides (14%), and other pharmaceuticals (19%). The remaining earnings come from medicated feed additives, non-pharmaceuticals, and contract manufacturing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US is Zoetis' largest market, accounting for about half of sales. Internationally, the company operates in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia/Pacific region, Canada, and Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zoetis has a direct sales presence in 45 countries (the Americas, Europe, the Asia/Pacific region, and Africa), where it sells directly to livestock producers and veterinarians. In the nearly 60 other countries where it does not have a direct sales presence, the company uses distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zoetis' manufacturing capabilities encompass some 30 plants in a dozen countries. But it also relies on about 200 contract manufacturers (including former parent
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ) to produce about 40% of its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has a 1.5 million-sq.-ft. research and development facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
  </p>

  <p>
   Zoetis uses distributors for most of its products, which are available by prescription from veterinarians. It also sells direct to retail outlets including farming supply and pet stores. Some livestock products are sold directly to ranchers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marketing efforts target veterinarians, livestock producers, and pet owners. Advertising and promotional expenses in 2015 totaled some $106 million, down from $132 million in 2014 and $143 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After four years of growth, revenue remained relatively flat at $4.8 billion in 2015 due to an 11% decline in international sales as a result of unfavorable currency rates. Sales in the US that year rose 13%, driven by sales of companion animal products (partly due to the addition of a portfolio of products acquired from Abbott Animal Health, as well as the strong performance of dog allergy medication Apoquel) and livestock products for swine, cattle, and poultry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed revenue's trend for the past few years. In 2015, though, it dropped 42% to $339 million as a result of restructuring charges and acquisition-related expenses. Cash flow from operations has been fluctuating and, in 2015, it rose 6% to $664 million due to an increase in accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zoetis' plan for sustained growth is to expand into new geographic markets, both through acquisitions and through organic means. It intends to develop new products and expand existing products lines to new species (such as taking an antibiotic for cattle and reformulating it for swine and poultry.) The company also plans to pursue emerging markets in Brazil, China, and India, where protein consumption is up, by introducing more expensive products such as new vaccines and single-injection anti-infectives, including Draxxin for livestock and Convenia for pets. The company also plans to expand into diagnostics, testing, and services for its core market.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Zoetis has also undertaken major restructuring moves to cut costs and increase production. In 2015 it announced plans to exit 10 manufacturing sites over time; the following year it sold facilities in Colorado and North Carolina. Also in 2016, it divested its majority stake in a Taiwan joint venture, selling that holding for some $13 million, and it sold a manufacturing site in India. On the other hand, it is investing $70 million on its Lincoln, Nebraska, manufacturing site.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company spent some $364 million on research and development, down from $396 million in 2014 and $399 million in 2013.

  <p>
   In 2015, Zoetis acquired Pharmaq, which specializes in making vaccines for farmed fish, for $765 million. It also bought KL Products, a Canadian firm that makes automated systems for the poultry industry, complementing its existing Embrex in egg vaccine delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, in 2015 the company bought certain assets of Abbott Animal Health, which makes products for companion animals, for $229 million. That deal added veterinarian solutions for anesthesia, pain management, and the diagnosis of diabetes.

   Formerly named Pfizer Animal Health, Zoetis was separated from former parent
