   Introducing innovative technology to large-scale commercial and industrial developments is key to GE Water's growth strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company launched commercial operations of Australia's largest seawater desalination plant (and one of the largest reverse osmosis plants in the world). It is located in the Mebourne area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also announced plans to bring a desalination plant to South Africa and has built two technology centers to the Gulf region (one each in Dubai and Saudi Arabia). Other projects in the region include a mobile water treatment fleet in Saudi Arabia and a sustainability center in Qatar, which was done in partnership with

  <p>
   It has formed a joint venture with FilterBoxx Water &amp; Environmental Corp. to develop de-oiling and water treatment options for Alberta's oil sands region. The project will develop treatment solutions for water used for injected steam to force the crude oil out of the mine. FilterBoxx's de-oiling and GE's evaporation technologies will achieve a significantly higher recovery rate for produced water, resulting in 30% to 50% less additional water required for the steam-assisted gravity drainage process.
