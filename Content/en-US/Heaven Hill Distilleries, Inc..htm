   Angels don't help the Christian Brothers bottle their brandy, port, and sherry; Heaven Hill does. One of Kentucky's oldest and largest distilling operations, Heaven Hill Distilleries makes Evan Williams Bourbon, as well as super-premium bourbons under the brands Elijah Craig and Henry McKenna. As the nation's largest independent and family-owned and -operated spirits producer, Heaven Hill also owns and markets the Christian Brothers and Old Fitzgerald brand names. Heaven Hill distributes a variety of other spirits, including the aperitif Dubonnet, Ansac cognac, Burnett's gin, and Blackheart Premium Spiced Rum, among others. Founded in 1934 by five brothers from the Shapira family, Heaven Hill is still family-owned.

   The company's flagship Evan Williams Bourbon brand is the second-largest selling bourbon in the US and the world. Heaven Hill boasts nearly 1 million aging barrels of Kentucky bourbon in its inventory or about 17% of the world's supply.

   Heaven Hill has been working to expand its portfolio of cordials, which are popular with club crowds and bartenders looking to create new drink concoctions. To this end, the distiller owns the distribution rights to HPNOTIQ, an imported blend of French vodka, cognac, and fruit juice that boasts a distinctive blue hue. It also relies on its pomegranate-flavored liqueur PAMA to satisfy those who prefer to make Pomtinis. It has also released cinnamon flavored whiskey (Cinerator) and special bottles for its Elijah Craig Bourbon.

  <p>
   Heaven Hill distillery is the second longest operating Bourbon producer and the only private, family-owned company to have filled its 6.5-millionth barrel of bourbon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began operations in 1934; Earl Beam left the Jim Beam company to join Heaven Hill in 1946. His grandson Craig Beam is the current master distiller at Heaven Hill.
