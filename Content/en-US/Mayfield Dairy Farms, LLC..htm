   Mayfield has kept on "moo-ving" for more than a century. Founded in 1910, Mayfield Dairy Farms produces and distributes milk (including buttermilk, chocolate milk, half-and-half, and egg nog), ice cream, and other cultured dairy products, such as cottage cheese, sour cream, and frozen yogurt. The company also offers beverages such as lemonade, orange juice, and bottled sweet tea. Mayfield Dairy serves nine southeastern US states from its plants in Athens, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; and Braselton, Georgia. The company is owned by the nation's largest milk bottler,

   </company>
   , and is run by CEO Scottie Mayfield, grandson of founder T.B. Mayfield.
