  <p>
   Willhelm Gustav Dyckerhoff began the company along with his sons Gustav and Rudolf on July 4, 1864, in Amoneburg, Germany. The three called their new business Portland Cement Factory Dyckerhoff &amp; Sons. The company grew, and by 1886 Dyckerhoff was exporting cement for the foundation of the Statue of Liberty. In 1909 the company installed rotary kilns to modernize its operations, and in 1911 it changed its name to Dyckerhoff &amp; Sohne GmbH.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dyckerhoff and Wicking AG merged in 1931 to form Dyckerhoff Wicking AG. Still churning out portland cement five years later, the company once again changed its name, this time to Dyckerhoff Portland-Zementwerke AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even before WWII began in September 1939, Germany's cement industry was called upon to provide cement for massive wartime construction projects such as the Sigfried Line, a fortification line designed to protect Germany from invasion. During the war, companies such as Dyckerhoff provided the materials to build pillboxes and casemates as the Germans sought to fend off attackers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1948 (three years after Germany lost the war), Dyckerhoff adopted a new company logo and left the war years behind. It began the shipment of loose cement in bulk transporters in 1949. The 1950s brought another name change -- Dyckerhoff Zementwerke AG -- and the production of ready-mixed concrete and the introduction of drying kilns.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1985 the company adopted its present name -- Dyckerhoff AG. During the 1990s the company took over a number of companies and cement plants, including Deuna Zement GmgH (1991), Ciments Luxembourgeois (1994), the Nowiny cement plant in Poland (1996), and the Hranice and Ostrava cement plants in the Czech Republic (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on international expansion, in 1999 Dyckerhoff acquired Buildex Beton Sp. z.o.o. in Poland and increased its stakes in five Poland- and Czech Republic-based companies. To further strengthen its global push, the company acquired US-based Lone Star Industries, which operates five cement plants and a cement mill, in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 and 2002 the struggling Dyckerhoff reduced employment by more than 12% and sold its Finishing Products segment (14% of sales; do-it-yourself hardware) to concentrate its efforts on cement and concrete. In 2003 the company exited Spain by selling Cementos de Hispania to LafargeHolcim. Dyckerhoff also dumped Anneliese Zementwerke, which was sold to HeidelbergCement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Dyckerhoff combined its US operations with Buzzi Unicem's, and Buzzi increased its stake in Dykerhoff to 76%.
