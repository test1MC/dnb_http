   Advaxis is making a bad bacteria do good. A clinical-stage biotechnology firm, it is developing vaccine therapies using its proprietary Lm Technology that modifies the infectious microorganism known as Listeria monocytogenes (commonly associated with food poisoning) to activate the immune system to fight various cancers. (Listeria is thought to be an unusually strong stimulator of the immune system.) Advaxis' lead candidate, axalimogene filolisbac, targets HPV-associated cancers and is being tested for the treatment of cervical, head and neck, and anal cancer. Other candidates in development target prostate cancer and solid tumors.

  <p>
   Advaxis has more than 20 Lm Technology-based immunotherapies under development, both on its own and through collaborations with cancer centers of excellence. It owns or carries the rights for 200 patents and applications, either owned by, licensed from, or co-owned with academic research institutions or other pharmaceutical firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a collaboration with Global BioPharma for the development and commercialization of lead candidate axalimogene filolisbac.

  <p>
   Headquartered in New Jersey, Advaxis has no manufacturing facilities of its own. It depends on third parties to produce its immunotherapies for R&amp;D and testing.

  <p>
   Advaxis was incorporated in 2002 and is still a development-stage company. As such, it has reported recurring losses, which are expected to continue for an extended period of time as it pursues heavy R&amp;D activity. (Whatever modest amount of revenues Advaxis has reported so far have come from grants, but in 2015, ended October, it reported no revenue.) In 2015, net loss more than doubled to $47 million as R&amp;D and administrative costs rose. That led to an increase in operating cash outflow, which totaled $24 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of October 31, 2015, the company had an accumulated deficit of $134 million.

   Advaxis is banking on forming collaborations with others to research, develop, market, and commercialize its immunotherapies. In 2014 it established a partnership with Biocon, which gained the right to submit axalimogene filolisbac for approval in a number of nations in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It also formed a collaboration with

    Merck
   </company>
   to test its ADXS-PSA, a potential treatment for prostate cancer, in combination with Merck's Keytruda medicine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other partnerships include research programs with

    MedImmune

   ,
   <company id="180263">
    Sorrento Therapeutics
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="16850">
    Incyte Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Aratana has been given exclusive license to develop and commercialize ADXS-HER2 for osteosarcoma in pets.
