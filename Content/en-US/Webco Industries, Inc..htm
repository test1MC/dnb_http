   Making carbon steel and stainless steel tubes is a competitive business and Webco Industries is working hard to keep up with its rivals. Facing stiff competition from larger US and foreign tubing suppliers, Webco Industries aims to succeed by targeting niche industry markets. The company's primary products include mechanical tubing, heat exchanger and boiler tubing, and stainless steel tube and pipe. Subsidiary Phillips &amp; Johnston makes tubular products from aluminum, brass, copper, and carbon steel. Webco Industries' customers include customers in the agricultural, automotive, beverage, oil and gas, and refrigeration industries. The family of founder William Weber controls Webco Industries.

   Webco Industries' divisions include Oil City (welded and cold draw mechanical tubing), Phillips &amp; Johnston (aluminum, brass, copper, and carbon steel tubing), Southwest Tube (carbon steel tubing), Specialty Tube, and Stare Center Tube.

   The company has six production facilities in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania and five distribution/value-added facilities in Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, and Michigan, which serve customers around the world.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (July year end) the company reported a 20% slump in revenues (to $330 million), largely due to low oil and gas prices crimping demand for oil-related equipment, and the dumping of cheaper metal tubing in US  markets by foreign competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Webco Industries reported a net loss of $3.2 million (compared to net income of $0.9 million a year earlier) due to weak market conditions. The company's essentially flat costs (selling, general and administrative charges were $23.3 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $24.1 million a year earlier) could not keep pace with the decline in revenue.

  <p>
   The impacts of low oil prices, commodity volatility, a strong US dollar, and foreign competition made 2016 a difficult year for US metal tube manufacturers. However, Webco Industries was successful in purging its high cost inventories over the course of fiscal 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2017 the company was looking to its core strengths, including quality, efficiency, yield improvement, and enhanced capabilities to help it not lose momentum until the commodity markets turn around and spur stronger product demand from its end users.

  <p>
   William Weber formed Webco Industries in 1969 to supply heat exchanger tubing to the growing Southwest energy industry. By locating company production near his customers, Weber could compete with larger, northeastern companies. By 1982 Webco had three production facilities and two distribution centers in Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Despite an extended downturn in demand from 1982 to 1987, Webco continued to improve its plants and expand sales throughout the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Webco went public in 1994, the same year it completed construction of a $10 million welded carbon tube mill in Sand Springs, Oklahoma. A shareholder lawsuit that year accused the company of falsifying information to inflate its stock price. The company admitted it had made erroneous accounting adjustments, and the suit was settled in 1995 at a cost of $2.4 million. There were production problems at the new plant when equipment didn't work satisfactorily. Also in 1995, Weber's daughter Dana succeeded him as president.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Tulsa-based QuikWater in 1996 and replaced the troublesome equipment at its Sand Springs plant in 1997. Webco shipped about 2,000 tons of tubing to China for boiler and power-station projects that year. In 1998 the company broadened its offerings by acquiring Phillips &amp; Johnston, a seller of a wide range of tubular products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suffering from flagging sales and profits in 1999, Webco laid off 53 workers at its Southwest Tube division (about 5% of its total workforce) and did not replace another 40 employees lost to attrition. Sales increased but profits fell in 2000 due to a price decline for the company's products and increased raw material costs. In 2001 the company was hampered by maintenance and repair costs to its Sand Springs facility; and a fire at its Oil City facility held back operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Webco sold its QuikWater unit in order to concentrate solely on its tubing operations. The following year, the company sales increased about 13% from the prior year because of the increase of sales in its specialty tubing and increase productivity from its Oil City, Pennsylvania facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   To avoid the regulatory costs associated with trading on a major stock exchange, Webco's board of directors in 2004 decided to deregister the company's stock with the SEC. The move took effect in January 2005.
