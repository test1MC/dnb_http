   Hardinge keeps on turning. The company manufactures precision turning, milling, and grinding machine tools that shape metals, composites, and plastics. It makes industrial machine tools for small and midsized shops that create machined parts for the aerospace, automotive, construction, medical equipment, and farm equipment industries. Its computer-controlled machines cut horizontally or vertically and can be connected to automatic material feeders for unattended machining. Hardinge also offers a line of work- and tool-holding devices. It gets about 70% of its sales outside of North America, predominantly in China and Western Europe.

  <p>
   Hardinge has manufacturing facilities in China, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. It has sales operations in China, France, Germany, the Netherlands, North America, and the UK.

  <p>
   The company operates through two segments: metalcutting machine solutions (MMS; 85% of sales), which includes operations related to grinding, turning, and milling; and aftermarket tooling and accessories (ATA; 15%), which includes products that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their machines.

  <p>
   The company sells products under brand names that include Bridgeport, Hauser, Jones &amp; Shipman, Kellenberger, and Tschudin. Products are sold through a direct sales force, but about 69% of sales are made through distributors and agents. Machine sales account for about 77% of sales. Non-machine products and services include workholding, repair parts, and accessories.

  <p>
   Hardinge's revenues have marginally decreased the last few years. Revenues dipped 1% from $334 million in 2012 to $329 million in 2013. Profits also fell 44% from $18 million in 2012 to $10 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower revenue for 2013 was driven by a 9% decrease in MMS sales fueled by softer demand for machine tool consumption in Europe and North America. Europe sales dipped by 26% due to continued economic uncertainty throughout most of Europe, especially for high end machine tools. Asia sales also decreased due to a decelerating Chinese economy, in addition to the absence of several large specialty multi-machine orders to the consumer electronics industry over the course of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its erosion of profits for 2013 was due to an increase in an impairment charge as part of the company's review of goodwill and other intangible assets. It also paid higher interest expenses in 2013. After experiencing negative operating cash flow in 2011, Hardinge saw its cash flow steadily rise in 2012 and 2013.

  <p>
   To create new products Hardinge goes beyond internal product development to expand its offerings through acquisitions, joint ventures, license agreements, and partnerships. To extend its international reach, in late 2014 Hardinge announced it was acquiring Germany-based Voumard Internal Diameter Grinding, an expert in the internal diameter grinding market with an installed base of over 9,000 machine products serving more than 2,500 customers around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its core offerings, Hardinge in 2012 bought Usach Technologies, an Illinois-based manufacturer of custom built high precision internal and external grinding machines and systems. The acquisition complemented and enhanced its grinding product portfolio.
