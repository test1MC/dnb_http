   Jack and Jill went up a hill to fetch a pail of water; Nestlé Waters North America (NWNA) offers Americans an easier alternative. The Swiss company (a unit of
   <company id="103387">
    Nestlé Waters
   </company>
   ) entered North America in 1976 with Perrier Sparkling Mineral Water; it has since grown to represent about one-third of the bottled water market. Its portfolio boasts national top seller Nestlé Pure Life and a dozen or so international and regional water brands: Acqua Panna, Deer Park, Ozarka, Poland Spring, and S. Pellegrino, to name a few. Non-sparking waters generate some 90% of its sales. NWNA also sells tea. In addition to selling its products via retail outlets, the company provides home and office delivery.

  <p>
   Seven of the company's bottled water brands reportedly rank among the top 10 US bottled waters. (Six of the seven are sold only regionally; Nestlé Pure Life is sold nationally.)

   NWNA's operations comprise 29 bottling facilities across the US and Canada. It manufactures its own bottles, about 20 billion each year. Its Swiss parent,
   <company id="41815">

   , is continuing to invest in North America as it pushes to support innovation in core categories. NWNA is the exclusive supplier of bottled water to

  <p>
   In the nutritional water market, Nestlé Pure Life plays a leading role. The non-carbonated, zero-calorie, Splenda-sweetened water is said to be the #1 water brand in the US and Canada. Acting on concerns that children aren't getting enough fluoride, NWNA offers fluoridated, lunch-box-sized versions of its Deer Park, Ozarka, and Poland Spring brand waters. In 2014 Nestlé Pure Life expanded its product portfolio with the introduction of Nestlé Pure Life Exotics Sparkling Water, a line of unsweetened sparkling water with unique, bold, and all-natural exotic fruit flavors.

  <p>
   That year Nestle Waters teamed up with Waterkeeper Alliance in a global partnership to support Waterkeeper Alliance's endeavors to protect all watersheds by promoting drinkable, swimmable, and fishable waterways.
  </p>

   NWNA's plans include making bottles more environmentally friendly and cheaper. The company now offers its French carbonated water Perrier in glass as well as plastic bottles, which have been reduced in weight by 40% since 2005. As part of the roll out, the company states that Bisphenol-A (or BPA) is not present in any of its water packaging that is smaller than three gallons. Public concern surrounding BPA and water safety is spurring Nestlé to explore alternative materials for its plus-three-gallon products, too.

   NWNA's 2011 acquisition of
   <company id="135954">
    Sweet Leaf Tea Co.
   </company>
   was part of its strategy to win over what is anticipated to be a continuing rise in consumer demand for bottled all-natural beverages, including tea, lemonade, and juice drinks. (Sweet Leaf was NWNA's first step outside of the bottled-water category.) The move took advantage of NWNA's established distribution network to launch Sweet Leaf onto the national stage. (Sweet Leaf's products had previously been available in only about 30% of the US market.)
