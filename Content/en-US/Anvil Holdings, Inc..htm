   Strike while it's hot: Anvil Holdings offers apparel that's ready for a print. The company, through subsidiary Anvil Knitwear, makes and supplies undecorated men's, women's, and children's activewear to wholesale distributors and decorators. Prior to retail, the products are often embellished with characters, designs, or logos. Anvil also makes and distributes its activewear products directly for major consumer brand sportswear and family entertainment companies. Its lineup includes an array of short- and long-sleeve sport and t-shirts, and some bags, caps, and towels. Anvil Holdings has been owned by Canadian t-shirt, sock, and underwear maker
   <company id="57292">
    Gildan Activewear
   </company>
   since 2012.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Gildan Activewear acquired the company for $88 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Anvil enjoys a global reach, with a printwear unit in Barbados, nearly 50 distributors in the US, and a handful of distributors located in both Canada and Japan.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Following the acquisition, Anvil's operations were consolidated with Gildan's and segmented by target market. A printwear segment comprises Anvil's Barbados-based printwear business, which designs, makes, sources, and distributes activewear to distributors and decorators in more than 30 countries across North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Much smaller, Gildan's branded apparel segment consists of both Anvil's and Gildan's wares, designed, made, and distributed to mainly US retailers.

  <p>
   Among its distributors, Anvil relies on

   . and Gauss Sales to market its products to screen printers and other imprinters and embroiderers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While parent Gildan Activewear does not break out separate financials for Anvil, it reports that Printwear segment net sales in fiscal 2012 amounted to $1.33 million, up slightly from $1.32 million in 2011. The slight improvement in sales reflects the benefit of the Anvil acquisition and sales growth from its international markets driven by increased market share penetration, which essentially offset lower net selling prices for the year that resulted from the company's decision to reduce selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Excluding the impact of Anvil, unit sales volumes were up in 2012 due to rising unit volumes from international markets, partly offset by a unit volume decline in the US printwear market from significant inventory destocking by US distributors.

  <p>
   A strategic acquisition, Anvil is anticipated to broaden Gildan's printwear distributor channel, as well as bring costs savings through combined facilities. Anvil also adds new brands and styles that distance the branded apparel business from the commoditized activewear market where price is king. Anvil's Eco Collection, for example, has gained a foothold in the lucrative organic-apparel market. The collection debuted with a 100% organic t-shirt line, AnvilOrganic, followed by rolling out AnvilRecycled (t-shirts made with pre-consumer recycled cotton, acrylic, and pre-shrunk jersey) and AnvilSustainable (t-shirts made from recycled PET plastic bottles and transitional cotton). The collection's growth places Anvil head-to-head with the likes of manufacturers

    American Apparel
   </company>
   . To Anvil's benefit, sales of organic cotton clothing defied the recession while mainstream textiles fell. Other brands include Anvil Logo, AnvilOrganic, chromaZONE by Anvil, and Cotton Deluxe Towels Plus by Anvil.
