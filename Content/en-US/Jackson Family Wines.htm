   Jackson Family Wines (JFW) stakes its success on the fruit of the vine. Among the largest winemakers in the US, JFW produces the best-selling chardonnay: Vintner's Reserve. The company's other flagship wine is its trophy Grand Reserve label. Sold in restaurants, retail stores, and via the company's website (where legal), JFW's dozens of fermented offerings include its well-known chardonnay, as well as merlot, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, pinot gris, cabernet sauvignon, and zinfandel. JFW encompasses more than 30 wineries around the world that support production of more than five million cases a year. Founded in 1982 by the late Jess Jackson, the winemaking and marketing enterprise is carried on by his family.

        <p>
   Branching out (through acquisitions) is what keeps JFW competitive in a constantly evolving industry.

        <p>
   In 2013 JFW bought its first winery in Oregon, expanding its presence in the Willamette Valley. It also bought Soléna Estate, a 15,000-case winery in the Yamhill-Carlton district with 35 acres of vineyards and Zena Crown, an 80-acre vineyard in the Willamette Valley and Gran Moraine, a 200-acre vineyard in the Yamhill-Carlton district. That year its also bought three vineyards (818 acres) in the Willamette Valley.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 the company's La Crema brand introduced a new pinot gris extension as a result of its flurry of acquisitions in Oregon.
  </p>
        <p>
   JFW branched out in 2011 as it acquired Australian-based vineyard Hickinbotham known for such notable wines as Clarendon, Hardys Eileen Hardy, and Penfolds Grange. The purchase price for Hickinbotham was estimated to be around $10 million. Also in 2011, the company launched the 2009 Avant Chardonnay. Unlike its big oaky style Vintner's Reserve, the Avant is intended for palettes preferring a delicately oaked white wine.
  </p>
        <p>
   JFW has viewed China as an important footprint in wine consumption. With the purchase of the landmark Hickinbotham vineyard in South Australia, JFW moves closer to selling its wines to the Chinese wine connoisseur. It's estimated that China is Australia's fastest-growing wine export destination as sales grew around 25% by value, a reflection Chinese consumers are trending toward more expensive wines.

   After growing and selling grapes since the 1970s, San Francisco lawyer Jess Jackson established Kendall-Jackson Winery in 1982 to make Chardonnay. (Kendall was his first wife's maiden name.) Jackson recruited wine maker Jedidiah Steele to create Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay; a mishap resulted in the wine containing unfermented sugar, which added to its popularity.
  </p>
        <p>
   Jackson branched out with new labels Cambria and Stonestreet, and in 1987 he began expanding his vineyard holdings. Steele resigned in 1991; in a legal wrangling that followed, Kendall-Jackson won a controversial ruling that established the company's chardonnay-making techniques as trade secrets and barred Steele from revealing them.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 Jackson created the Artisans and Estates wineries to foster a more exclusive image for some labels. The next year Jackson sued the world's largest wine maker,
   <company id="40140">
    E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery
   </company>
   , for trademark infringement, alleging that Gallo copied Kendall-Jackson's colored leaf logo and bottle design. A jury unanimously rejected the claim in 1997, and a federal appeals court affirmed the decision in 1998.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company changed its name to Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates in 1999 to reflect its growth beyond the Kendall-Jackson brand. Thinking of breaking from its private roots, Kendall-Jackson began lengthy consideration of buyout offers or an IPO. Jackson retired in 1999 and former Hewlett-Packard chairman Lew Platt succeeded him as CEO. Jackson's wife and co-founder Barbara Banke replaced him as chairman on the first day of 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Platt quelled buyout talk when he confirmed that the company would remain an independent, family-owned winery. (Beverage companies including
   <company id="55181">

   ,
   <company id="11781">
    Brown-Forman
   </company>
   , and Australia's
   <company id="104140">
    BRL Hardy
   </company>
   had reportedly bid as much as $2 billion for Kendall-Jackson.) Shortly after, Platt left the business and John Grant took on the day-to-day operations of the company.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired California winery, Legacy Estate Group, which specializes in ultra premium wines, in 2006. Branching into spirits distribution, Kendall-Jackson agreed that year to distribute businessman Donald Trump's brand, Trump Super Premium Vodka.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2011, founder, chairman, and CEO Jess Jackson died.
