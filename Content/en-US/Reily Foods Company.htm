   Reily Foods, which hails from New Orleans, hopes that you'll slap gobs of its mayo on your po'boy and wash it down with a gigantic tumbler of the company's tea. Besides making and marketing regionally revered Blue Plate mayonnaise and Luzianne teas, Reily Foods counts several other popular brand names among its portfolio of products. It manufactures and sells more than 100 products, including Swans Down cake flour, No Pudge! brownie mix, CDM Coffee &amp; Chicory, Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili, and Carroll Shelby Chili Kits. The food firm sells its products nationwide and across Europe. Chairman William B. Reily III is the third-generation member of the Reily family to run the company, which was founded in 1902.
