   Akzo Nobel may be the world's largest paint manufacturer, but it does more than just paint a pretty picture. The company is also among the world's largest chemical manufacturers and salt producers. Akzo Nobel divides its business into three main lines: Decorative Paints, which produces consumer and commercial paints and primarily serves Europe and North America; Performance Coatings, which manufactures marine and protective coatings, packaging coatings, automotive finishes, and industrial coatings; and Specialty Chemicals, which makes pulp and performance chemicals, functional chemicals (flame retardants, crop nutrients), industrial chemicals (salt and chlor-alkalis), surfactants, and specialty starches.
  </p>

  <p>
   Akzo Nobel's Specialty Chemicals segment holds a number of leading positions for various chemicals, such as ethyline amines, salt specialties, and organic peroxides produced by its functional chemicals unit. Its industrial chemicals unit also is a leading producer of caustic lye and chlorine in Europe, as well as salt. Surface Chemistry produced surfactants, synthetic polymers and bio-polymers. The segment's products are used to make a number of everyday items, including cosmetics, detergents, disinfectants, ice cream, plastics, and soaps. The segment accounts for around 40% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akzo Nobel has established a global leadership position in Decorative Paints, enjoying economies of scale while expanding its global footprint. In the US it has introduced its products in Wal-mart and relaunched the Glidden brand for its Home Depot sales. In Canada it markets through major retailer RONA. It has strengthened its presence in the high-growth markets of Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. In China it has penetrated mass markets, and in India, it is gaining momentum with an investment in its flagship Dulux brand. The segment accounts for around 34% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Performance Coatings segment is represented in most markets of the industry, including general industrial coatings for metals and plastic; and protective coatings for oil and gas, airports and stadia, power generation, mining and minerals, and water and wastewater markets. The segment holds market leadership positions in marine coatings, protective coatings, and yacht coatings, and it also supplies coatings for commercial vehicles and aircraft. Its powder coatings unit provides electrostatically applied coatings that are sprayed and then cured by applying heat. And its wood finishes and adhesives are used for furniture, flooring, cabinets, windows, and doors. The segment accounts for around 27% of revenue.

  <p>
   The Netherlands-based Akzo Nobel operates in more than 80 countries, but most of its holdings are in Western Europe, North America, and the Asia/Pacific. It is expanding in emerging markets within Latin America and Eastern Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Europe as a whole brings in around 43% of revenue, with Germany and the UK the biggest two European markets at around 7% each. North America provides some 17% of revenue, and China 12%.

    Financial Performance
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of €14.9 billion in 2015 represented a 4% rise on prior year, a reversal of recent trends of slight negative growth. Sales growth came from increases in Specialty Chemicals and Decorative Paints. Much of the 2% increase in Specialty Chemicals, however, was due to favorable currency effects; overall volumes were flat. Growth of 3% in Decorative Paints came from higher revenue in Asia more than compensating for flat growth in Europe and a fall in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income climbed 79% to €979 million, from €546 million, in 2015 due mostly to an increase in operating income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities rose 40% to €1.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Strategy
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to invest in its brands, distribution system, and people, with a focus on expansion in mid-tier markets. Akzo Nobel is concentrating on growth in regions such as Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, as demand begins to decline in mature markets such as Western Europe and North America (though those two regions still account for about half of Akzo Nobel's business). In addition to growing in strong emerging markets, the company seeks strategic bolt-on acquisitions and continues to make significant investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Akzo-Nobel strengthened its position in the North American hydrogen peroxide market after it acquired OCI Peroxygen's shares in joint venture EkO Peroxide. In the same year, the company acquired BASF's industrial coatings business for €475 million to strengthen its position in the coatings market, which processes coiled metal sheets into facades, fridges and window blinds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Promoting its global brand, in 2015 Akzo Nobel extended its official supplier partnership with McLaren Racing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Innovations in 2014 included the launch of a new barrier coating which made it possible to create the world's first fully compostable and recyclable paper cup for cold drinks. Its Decorative Paints business launched the Visualizer app, enabling users to see in real time what a room will look like in a wide range of different colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has also sold non-core assets to pay down debt. In 2015 Akzo Nobel sold its Paper Chemicals portfolio for €153 million. In the same year, the company announced plans to sell Zeta Fraction biofunctional technology to Ashland, in order to focus on its core technology platforms of specialty surfactants and polymers.

  <p>
   In 2016 Azko Nobel bought German chemicals producer
   <company id="41755">
    BASF'
   </company>
   s industrial coatings business (which makes products for use in wind farms and in other areas) for about $499 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   The Akzo side of Akzo Nobel traces its roots to two companies -- German rayon and coatings maker Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken (founded 1899) and Dutch rayon maker Nederlandsche Kunstzijdebariek (founded 1911 and known as NK or Enka). In 1928 NK built a plant near Asheville, North Carolina, in what later became the town of Enka. The two companies merged in 1929 to create Algemene Kunstzijde-Unie (AKU).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1967 two Dutch companies merged to form Koninklijke Zout-Organon (KZO). Two years later KZO bought US-based International Salt and merged with AKU to form Akzo. In the 1980s Akzo focused on building its chemicals, coatings, and pharmaceuticals businesses. Akzo sold its paper and pulp business to Nobel in 1993. A few months later the company reclaimed that business when it bought Nobel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Best remembered for the prizes that bear his name (which were first awarded in 1901 through a bequest in his will), Alfred Nobel invented the blasting cap in 1863, making it possible to control the detonation of nitroglycerin. He then persuaded Stockholm merchant J. W. Smitt to help him finance Nitroglycerin Ltd. to make and sell the volatile fluid (1864). Nobel's quest to improve nitroglycerin led to his invention of dynamite in 1867.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Nobel's death in 1896, Nitroglycerin Ltd. remained an explosives maker, and in 1965 it changed its name to Nitro Nobel. In 1978 Swedish industrialist Marcus Wallenberg bought Nitro Nobel for his KemaNord chemical group, known afterward as KemaNobel. Within six years industrialist Erik Penser controlled both KemaNobel and armaments maker Bofors, and he merged them in 1984 as Nobel Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Risky investments led Penser to ruin in 1991. His holdings, including Nobel, were taken over by a government-owned bank and conveyed into Securum, a state-owned holding company (which still owns 18% of Akzo Nobel). In 1992 Nobel spun off its consumer-goods segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akzo bought Nobel in 1994. Although the company had good financial results in 1995, it faced pressure from rising costs for raw materials and a difficult foreign-exchange environment. Akzo announced major closings and layoffs -- it sold its polyethylene packaging resin business and moved some clothing-grade rayon operations to Poland.
  </p>
  <p>
   The merger between Akzo and Nobel was legally completed in 1996. That year the company introduced Puregon, a fertility drug, and Remeron, touted as a replacement for Prozac, in the US and other countries. In 1997 Akzo Nobel put most of its worst-performing segment, fibers, into a joint venture with Turkish conglomerate Sabanci. It also sold its North American salt unit to Cargill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akzo Nobel acquired Courtaulds (coatings, sealants, and fibers) in 1998 and changed the firm's name to Akzo Nobel UK. AkzoNobel also bought BASF deco, the European decorative-coatings business of BASF Coatings. Akzo Nobel combined its fiber business with AkzoNobel UK to form a new division, Acordis. AkzoNobel then sold Acordis to investment firm CVC Capital Partners in 1999 for $859 million (AkzoNobel retains a minority share). That year AkzoNobel bought Hoechst's animal-health unit, Hoechst Roussel Vet, for $712 million. In 2000 the company bought Dexter Corporation's aircraft coatings business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Akzo Nobel sold its medical diagnostics division to French drugmaker bioMérieux-Pierre Fabre. Later that year the company picked up the vehicle refinishes business of MAC Specialty Coatings of the US. It also agreed to sell its printing inks business to a private equity firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Cees van Lede retired in mid-2003, succeeded by Hans Wijers, who immediately set about restructuring, cutting costs, and erasing debt. By year's end more than 3,300 jobs were cut and AkzoNobel had sold off three big chemical units: catalysts (to
   <company id="16955">
    Albemarle
   </company>
   for about $750 million), coating resins, and phosphorous chemicals (to
   <company id="61408">
    Ripplewood Holdings
   </company>
   for another $270 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   The fruits of those sell-offs came with 2005 acquisitions in Germany, France, and Switzerland. The last purchase, of Swiss Lack, made Akzo Nobel the largest paint company in Switzerland as well. The following year the company made a bigger buy, that of Canadian coatings maker
   <company id="105235">
    Sico
   </company>
   for $285 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 Akzo Nobel decided to pare down its operations further with the sale of its inks and adhesive resins business to
   <company id="138217">
    Hexion Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   . The business was concentrated in Europe but had strong international operations as well. The deal brought the company about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2006 Akzo announced plans to split off its pharmaceuticals segment, Organon. It originally planned to float a minority share early in 2007 and then fully separate the new company by 2009. In a surprise move, however,
   <company id="11326">
    Schering-Plough
   </company>
   came in and bought the unit for $14.4 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In what turned out to be a major turning point for the company, Akzo Nobel approached UK coatings and chemicals maker ICI with a $14 billion takeover offer in late 2007. ICI's board rejected the price tag as insufficient. Akzo Nobel countered, twice, and ended up agreeing to a deal worth $16 billion. As part of the deal,
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   bought the adhesives and electronic materials businesses of ICI subsidiary
   <company id="103878">
    National Starch and Chemical
   </company>
   . The buy of ICI built up Akzo's coatings business even further. The acquired businesses have great strength in retail decorative paints and
   <company id="105382">
    in North America
   </company>
   , both areas in which Akzo Nobel's coatings business had been lacking.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another business acquired in the deal was Akzo Nobel's new Chemicals Pakistan division, which was composed of the company's majority holdings in two publicly traded companies. Those subsidiaries made soda ash, polyester fibers, and pure terephthalic acid (PTA). In 2009, though, the company sold its 75% stake in the subsidiary that makes PTA to Korean manufacturer KP Chemical.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akzo Nobel subsidiary
   <company id="103878">
    National Starch
   </company>
   acquired
   <company id="14360">
    Penford Australia's
   </company>
   specialty grain wet milling and manufacturing facility in 2009, expanding National Starch's reach into the Asia/Pacific region. However, in 2010
   <company id="55621">
    Corn Products International
   </company>
   (renamed Ingredion) acquired National Starch for $2.7 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Akzo Nobel acquired the powder coatings business of
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical Company
   </company>
   . The deal brought technological know-how and significant synergy potential to Akzo Nobel's Powder Coatings line and enhanced the company's position in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its three-year performance improvement program launched in late 2011, Azko Nobel restructured business lines, such as its European and North American decorative paints and its performance coatings' wood finishes and adhesives. The company has managed to raise prices enough in 2012 to offset most of the raw material price increases. Although the costs of titanium dioxide continue to rise, Akzo Nobel has been successful in passing on most of its raw material cost increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2012 the company completed its acquisition of Boxing Oleochemicals, a leading Chinese surfactants producer. Boxing makes nitrile amines and derivatives, used for industrial and consumer applications ranging from asphalt additives to fabric softeners. The buy enhances Azko Nobel's position in specialty surfactants and broadens its reach in Asia. Boxing's operations will be integrated into the company's Surface Chemistry unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2012 the company also moved to strengthen its packaging coatings operations by trying to acquire the part of Italy's Packaging Coatings Metlac Group it doesn't own (it holds a 49% stake). However,  the UK's office of Fair Trading put the brakes on the deal because of competition concerns and referred the case to the UK's Competition Commission. Both Metlac and Akzo Nobel supply metal packaging coatings used in food and beverage cans.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Akzon Nobel split its ICI Pakistan subsidiary into two new companies: AkzoNobel Pakistan Limited (comprising the paints and specialty chemicals business) and ICI Pakistan Limited (comprising all other businesses of ICI Pakistan). In the process, AkzoNobel maintains 76% control of the paints business while seeking a buyer for ICI Pakistan.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its industrial coatings business, Akzo Nobel acquired Germany-based Schramm Holding in 2011. Akzo Nobel believes the acquisition makes it the global leader for specialty plastic coatings for the lucrative market serving mobile devices, laptops, TVs, and auto interiors. Also in 2011, Akzo Nobel opened a new coatings plant in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company's Decorative Paints unit expanded with the company's entry into a partnership in China with Quangxi CAVA Titanium Industry Co. to ensure a supply of titanium dioxide. It also invested €110 million ($135 million) in 2011 in a replacement manufacturing plant in the North East of England.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash to pay down debt, in 2012 AkzoNobel divested its North American Decorative Paints business to
   <company id="11139">
    PPG Industries
   </company>
   for $1.05 billion.
