   Greif (rhymes with "life") produces rigid industrial packaging products, including steel, plastic, and fibre drums, and related closure systems. Greif also makes flexible intermediate bulk containers (based on polypropylene woven fabric), used to ship an array of bulk industrial and consumer goods. It sells corrugated products, and containerboard, as well, for packaging home appliances and small machinery, and grocery and building products. Greif caters to a diverse group of industries, from chemical to food and beverage, petroleum, agricultural, and pharmaceutical. It traces its history back to 1877.

  <p>
   Greif operates through four business segments: Rigid Industrial Packaging and Services (70% of total sales); Paper Packaging (20%); Flexible Products and Services (9%); and Land Management (1%). (This last segment is responsible for harvesting the company's timber properties in the southeastern US.)

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's 200 operating locations span 45 countries within the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region. Although North America remains the sole market for its corrugated products (accounting for roughly 50% of total sales), Greif has evolved into a global player in distributing its packaging and container products. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa accounts for 35% of sales; the Asia/Pacific and other regions, 15%.

  <p>
   The company sells timber to third parties from its timberland in the southeastern US. Its customers range from Fortune 500 companies to medium and small-sized companies in a cross section of industries such as chemicals, paints and pigments, food and beverage, petroleum, industrial coatings, agricultural, pharmaceutical and mineral products.

  <p>
   Greif's revenues fell 8% from $3.62 billion in 2015 to $3.32 billion in 2016. This was driven by sales decreases form its Land Management (23%) and Flexible Products and Services (11%) segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greif was also affected by the negative impact of foreign currency translations, primarily attributable to the revaluation of its Venezuelan operations in 2015. The company also experienced a decrease in volumes largely attributable to divestitures completed during 2015 and 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2015 to 2016, the company's profits increased 4% from $72 million to $75 million and cash flow from operations jumped from $206 million to $301 million. The rise in cash flow was attributed to favorable fluctuations from accounts payable.

  <p>
   Greif has streamlined its business recently. During 2016 it completed four divestitures it deemed as nonstrategic businesses; three were within the Rigid Industrial Packaging and Services segment and one resided in Flexible Products and Services. In late 2015, the company sold approximately 5,200 acres of development properties in Canada, which represented all of its remaining timber properties in Canada.

  <p>
   Charles Greif co-founded Vanderwyst and Greif, a Cleveland-based maker of casks, kegs, and barrels, in 1877. The next year his brothers William, Louis, and Thomas joined the company, which was renamed Greif Bros. to reflect the sibling involvement. The thriving company bought timberland as a source for raw materials and in 1926 went public as Greif Bros. Cooperage.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1946 Jack Dempsey became chairman (his wife and mother-in-law owned minority stakes) and acquired a controlling interest. Dempsey moved Greif beyond barrels and kegs into fiber containers and steel drums. The company relocated to Delaware, Ohio, in 1951. Greif entered the multiwall bag and corrugated packaging businesses in the 1960s and cut "Cooperage" from its name in 1969.
