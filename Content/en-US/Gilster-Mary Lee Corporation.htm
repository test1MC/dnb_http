   To boost its output of shredded wheat cereals, Gilster-Mary Lee has been investing in its production facilities in recent years. The company added conveying equipment, rotary cereal cookers, shredding rolls, and a roughly 230-ft. cereal oven that was specially designed to its production line. Gilster's facilities upgrade comes amid rising demand for more affordable private-label food products -- cereals included.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company sold its Centralia, Illinois, production facility -- which for more than 15 years has been responsible for making Duncan Hines products for Pinnacle Foods under a third-party manufacturing agreement -- to

  </p>

   The company is also expanding its product offering and production capacity through acquisitions.
