   The financial fortunes of Alps hiked to a higher altitude in 2015 (ended March) after several uneven years. Revenue rose 25%, with each segment posting higher sales. The company benefited from higher auto sales in the US and Europe, which has Alps components on board as well as continued strong sales of smart phones. Net income recovered into positive territory in 2015, pushed by stronger sales. Almost as dramatic was the upswing in cash flow from operations, which rose 133% from 2014 to 2015.
