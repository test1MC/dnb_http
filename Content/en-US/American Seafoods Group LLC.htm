   With operations in the northern Pacific (
   <em>
    i.e
   </em>
   ., in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands), American Seafoods Group casts a bountiful net. The vertically integrated company offers frozen and processed fish such as Alaska pollock, Pacific whiting, Pacific cod, sea and bay scallops, haddock, sole, and farm-raised tilapia and catfish. It operates its own fleet of ships that process and freeze the catch while at sea, as well as a fleet of transport trucks. American Seafoods' land-based operation in Massachusetts makes breaded seafood products. The company sells its fish under the American Pride brand name in North America, Asia, and Europe.

   American Seafoods Group (ASG) has three primary operating companies: American Seafoods Company harvests, processes, and markets seafood products from fisheries in the US waters off Alaska and the Pacific Northwest; New Bedford, Massachusetts-based American Pride Seafoods is a processor of value-added seafood products, including fresh and frozen Atlantic sea scallops; and American Marine Ingredients, specializes in developing new products from ASG's fisheries for human and animal nutrition, cosmetics, and industrial applications. Also, ASC's Pacific Longline Company harvests and processes Pacific cod.
  </p>
        <p>
   American Seafoods Company operates six catcher-processor vessels, which harvest fish and process the catch onboard.

        <p>
   Already one of the top seafood suppliers in North America, American Seafoods is growing by acquiring other companies in the consolidating seafood processing industry. The company is the largest harvester in the US Bering Sea fishery (located off the coast of Alaska), with an approximate 45% catcher-processor market share. Its customers include retail food stores, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, and restaurants and other food service operators. The company also harvests fish eggs (roe) for sale to mainly the Japanese market.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   ASC acquired frozen seafood processor Good Harbor Fillet from private equity owner Creo Capital Partners in early 2012. The purchase bolstered operating company American Pride's processing presence on the East Coast. In 2010 the company acquired pollock catcher/processor Northern Hawk, along with three freezer-longline vessels.
  </p>
        <p>
   Due to poor catfish sales and subsequent falling prices for the product, ASC sold its Alabama-based Southern Pride Catfish farming operations to Heartland Catfish in Mississippi.
