   and local favorites such as Castle Lager, the #1 beer in Africa. In Latin America, it owns
   <company id="95185">
    Bavaria
   </company>
   and
   <company id="57444">
    Cervecería Nacional.
   </company>
   Beyond brewing, SABMiller is one of the world's top bottlers of
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   products. In Q4 2016 rival
   <company id="47435">
    AB InBev
   </company>
   acquired the company for £79 billion. To meet regulator requirements, AB InBev sold some of SABMiller's biggest brands, including
   <company id="91611">
    Grolsch
   </company>
   , Peroni and Pilsener Urquell.

  <p>
   SABMiller owns more than 100 breweries and 40 bottling plants. It also produces at plants owned and operated through several strategic alliances and joint ventures. Production is organized among six regions: Latin America, Europe, North America, Africa, Asia/Pacific, and South Africa. In addition to bottling products for
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   , it has hotel and gaming interests through Tsogo Sun Holdings, South Africa's largest gaming group doing business as Gold Reef Resorts.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SABMiller has offices and facilities in more than 80 countries dotting Latin America, Europe, North America, Africa, the Asia/Pacific region, and South Africa. Approximately 90% of its beverages are sold in markets in which it is the #1 or #2 beer maker. Africa, led by South Africa, accounts for 31% of the company's net sales. Other major markets include Latin America (35%), Europe (19%), and the Asia Pacific (14%). (North America only accounts for 1%.)

  <p>
   SABMiller's revenues remained flat from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a 5% drop in Asia Pacific sales and a 3% decline from Europe sales. This was offset by gains in the UK (8%) and the US (2%) throughout 2015.

   Many global giants are feeling competitive pressure from local craft makers and are considering mergers as a means to dominate additional market share. Feeling the pressure, SABMiller agreed in late 2015 to be acquired by primary competitor
   <company id="47435">
    AB InBev
   </company>
   , which was finalized in late 2016 after 13 months of negotiations and regulatory hurdles. The final price was around $108 billion, making it the biggest takeover of a British company in history. The combined company is responsible for about a third of the global beer supply and could lead other brewers to consider mergers as they try to stay competitive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to gain regulatory approval, various SABMiller interests were sold off. AB InBev sold SABMiller's 58% stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, who owned the remaining 42%. In Europe, SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands were sold to Japanese brewer Asahi for around $2.9 billion; it will also sell its Central and Eastern European interests once a buyer is found. Additionally, SABMiller's 49% stake in CR Snow, the maker of China's Snow beer, was sold to
   <company id="55206">
    China Resources Beer Company Limited
   </company>
   for $1.6 billion.

  <p>
   British sailor Frederick Mead purchased the Castle Brewery in Johannesburg in 1892, about 15 years after gold was discovered in South Africa. Mead took his brewing operation public as South African Breweries (SAB) in 1895. The company launched its flagship Castle Lager three years later and survived the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) as South Africa's fastest-growing non-industrial firm. Mead died in 1915.
  </p>
  <p>
   The brewer acquired the Grand Hotel in Cape Town in 1921 and a stake in
   <company id="103458">
    Schweppes
   </company>
   (carbonated drinks) in 1925. In the late 1940s SAB began an extensive expansion program involving its breweries, small hotels, and pubs. In 1951 it acquired the Hotel Victoria in Johannesburg. An increase in beer taxes during the 1950s led SAB to start producing liquors. With beer demand slackening, South Africa's three largest brewers -- SAB, Ohlsson's, and United Breweries -- merged in 1956. The new company, which took the SAB name, controlled about 90% of the beer market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beer taxes continued to pressure sales, and in 1960 SAB acquired control of Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery to extend its product range. In 1962 the restriction prohibiting alcohol consumption by blacks was lifted, opening an enormous market. SAB continued to extend its range of beer brands during the 1960s by adding licenses to brew Amstel and Carling Black Label.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 SAB gobbled up
   <company id="55826">
    Miller Brewing
   </company>
   from Philip Morris (now Altria Group) for $5.6 billion, making it the world's second-largest brewer at the time. SAB then changed its name to SABMiller plc. SABMiller moved into Western Europe in 2003 with the $270 million purchase of Italian brewer Birra Peroni. In 2005 SABMiller acquired almost 97% of
   <company id="95185">
    Bavaria S.A.
   </company>
   , the second-largest brewer in South America. Bavaria's brands include Águila, Atlas, Cristal, and Pilsener.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an attempt to gain market share, SABMiller formed
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   with
   <company id="12519">
    Molson Coors
   </company>
   in 2008, adding the popular domestic labels Miller and Coors, as well as imports including Molson Canadian and Pilsner Urquell, and craft brews such as
   <company id="123118">
    Leinenkugel's
   </company>
   and Blue Moon to its US offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it acquired Dutch brewer
   <company id="91611">
    Royal Grolsch
   </company>
   for about $1.2 billion. In its largest acquisition to date, SABMiller purchased Australia's oldest and biggest brewer,
   <company id="42414">
    Foster's Group
   </company>
   , for $12.3 billion in 2011.
