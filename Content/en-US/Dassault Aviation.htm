  <p>
   Marcel Bloch, one of France's first aeronautical engineers, designed the propeller for the famous SPAD fighter of WWI. Between the world wars the talented aeronautical engineer achieved fame designing bombers, fighters, and transports. When France fell during WWII, Marcel joined the Resistance movement and operated under the code name Dassault. In 1944 the Gestapo arrested him and sent him to the infamous Buchenwald concentration camp. Bloch survived and after the war changed his name to his Resistance code name -- Dassault.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1945 Marcel founded the Dassault Company just as the French government was rebuilding its air force. Dassault began work on a straight-wing jet fighter -- the Ouragan -- in 1947 and had it airborne by 1949. The French government ordered 350 Ouragans and received its first delivery in 1952. While the Ouragan was the first French fighter to attain production status, Dassault quickly replaced the Ouragan with a swept-wing fighter -- the Mystere IV -- in 1955. The Mystere IV would see action in the Suez Crisis of 1956 in both the French and Israeli air forces. Lessons learned from the Korean War and the Suez Crisis led Dassault to design the Mirage IV, a high-performance strategic bomber.
  </p>
  <p>
   International conflicts and the Cold War created a worldwide need for combat aircraft, and export sales became a major growth opportunity for the company between 1950 and 1960. During the 1960s, the company also produced its first business jet -- the Falcon 20. The company continued to build successful military and business aircraft throughout the 1970s, producing such venerable aircraft as the Falcon 30 (1973), the Falcon 50 (1976), and the Mirage 2000 (1978).
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s the company introduced its successful Falcon 900, a tri-engine business jet, and the Rafale, a fighter with voice-operated controls and extensive use of composites, such as aluminum lithium. In 1986 Marcel Dassault died and his son, Serge Dassault, assumed the duties of chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dassault continued to advance its business jets during the 1990s, building the Falcon 2000, the first business jet with a head-up guidance system. In 1999 Serge Dassault stepped down as chairman and CEO upon reaching his 75th birthday, the company's mandatory retirement age. Vice-CEO Charles Edelstenne replaced Dassault, who remained as honorary chairman and the company's controlling shareholder. Profits fell 15% that year because of a drop in foreign sales of fighter aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had a successful run at the 2001 Paris Air Show, where it announced the signing of a letter of intent with UnitedBizJet Holdings (owned by
   <company id="11520">
    United Continental
   </company>
   , formerly UAL) for 100 business jets for more than $2 billion. The next year Dassault announced that it was joining with French communications and defense company Sagem (later
   <company id="90795">
    SAFRAN
   </company>
   ) to develop tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dassault unveiled its Falcon 900DX in 2004. It also inked a deal that made it prime contractor for
