  <p>
   Triumph's journey traces back to 1887, when two Germans, Siegfried Bettmann and Maurtiz Schulte began selling the "safety" bicycle. The Triumph motorcycle was rolled out in 1902. The original company went bankrupt in the early 1980s, but was resurrected in 1991 by Bloor Holdings, which is owned by Sir John Bloor. Bloor was knighted for bringing the motorcycle maker back to life.
