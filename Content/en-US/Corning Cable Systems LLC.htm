  <p>
   The company operates under two product categories - carrier network and enterprise network.
  </p>
  <p>
   The carrier network consists of products and solutions for optical-based communications infrastructure for services such as video, data and voice communications; whereas the enterprise network product group primarily consists of optical-based communication networks sold to businesses, governments and individuals for their own use.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corning Optical Communications' carrier network contributed more 77% of the company's total revenues in 2014, with the rest generated by the Enterprise network. The company accounted for more than 25% of annual sales of the parent company Corning's total revenue in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep pace with the growing demand for mobile bandwidth, Corning has a full complement of operator-grade distributed antenna systems, including the recently developed Optical Network Evolution wireless platform, which is the first of its kind, which provides virtually unlimited bandwidth, and meets all of the wireless service needs of large-scale enterprises at a lower cost than the typical distributed antenna systems product.

  <p>
   The company has maintained a steady revenue growth over the last three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Corning Optical Communications' revenues increased by 14% due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America and Europe, partially offset by a $52 million drop in optical fiber sales in China due to a slowing economy in the region.
