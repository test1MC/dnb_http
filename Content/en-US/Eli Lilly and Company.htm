   Best known for its neuroscience products, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly also makes endocrinology, oncology, and cardiovascular care medicines. Its top-selling drugs include Cymbalta for depression and pain, Alimta for lung cancer, Humalog and Humulin insulin for diabetes, and Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Lilly also makes medications to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Zyprexa), osteoporosis (Evista and Forteo), heart conditions (Effient), ADHD (Strattera), gastric and lung cancer (Cyramza), and diabetes (Jardiance and Trulicity), as well as anti-infective agents and a growing line of animal health products.

  <p>
   Lilly has been around for more than 130 years and, unlike many other drug companies, has kept its operations focused almost exclusively on the task of pharmaceutical manufacturing. The company operates in two business segments: human pharmaceutical products and animal health. Pharmaceuticals for human consumption account for about 85% of annual revenues, while medicines for livestock and companion animals (including Rumensin, Posilac, Tylan, and Optaflexx, produced through its Elanco animal health unit) make up the rest of sales. The company has sailed steadily through a number of ups and downs without making drastic changes to its business model or its growth strategy of conducting focused R&amp;D, forming joint ventures and collaborations, and making selective acquisitions. For example, the company co-promotes Cymbalta in Japan with
   <company id="56875">
    Shionogi &amp; Co.
   </company>
   ; Erbitux is marketed in the US and Canada by Lilly and elsewhere by
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   . Additionally, the company has a diabetes collaboration with
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   through which they jointly develop and commercialize Trajenta, Jentadueto, Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Basalgar.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's steady operational performance places it on firm ground even as Lilly enters a challenging time of significant patent expirations. For example, its Cymbalta and Evista offerings lost US protection in December 2013 and March 2014, respectively. Its pipeline is progressing, though, with new drug approvals and launches helping to offset the impact of generic competition on sales of aging products. In 2015 the company launched Jardiance and Trulicity for type 2 diabetes and Basalgar for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lilly sells its products in some 125 countries, with the US market accounting for about half of the company's sales. Europe accounts for about 20% of sales while Japan accounts for about 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates research, manufacturing, and distribution facilities in the US and 15 other countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. It owns 13 production and distribution sites in the US and Puerto Rico; major production sites are located in Indianapolis and Clinton, Indiana; Branchburg, New Jersey; and Carolina, Puerto Rico. Lilly's major international production sites are located in Ireland, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Altogether, Lilly conducts R&amp;D in six countries, clinical trials in about 50 countries, and has manufacturing facilities in more than a dozen countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, Lilly's products are promoted to physicians, hospitals, veterinarians, and pharmacies through direct sales representatives and contract sales organizations. Products are distributed through independent wholesalers, primarily
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   . These three distributors each account for between 8% and 19% of annual sales. Internationally, the company uses a direct sales force in most markets, though it occasionally markets products through independent distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lilly also advertises in medical journals and markets its products at medical conferences.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After years of steady revenue growth, patent expirations and a lack of new blockbusters have taken their toll. Lilly has seen fluctuation revenue in the last five years, with peaks in fiscal 2011 and 2013 and dips in 2012 and 2014. In 2015, revenue rose 2% to $19.9 billion thanks to sales of new drugs (Cyramza and Trulicity) and contributions from the newly acquired Novartis Animal Health. The Elanco animal health business also boosted earnings, but these gains were partially offset by revenue declines from Cymbalta, Evista, and Alimta as a result of foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   After net income fell 49% in 2014 (due to lower revenue that year as well as restructuring expenses), it rose less than 1% to $2.4 billion in 2015. That modest gain was driven by the 2% revenue increase and a decrease in income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has been falling and, in 2015, it dropped a further 37% to $2.8 billion due to increases in receivables and inventories.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has sailed steadily through a number of ups and downs without making drastic changes to its business model or its growth strategy of conducting focused R&amp;D (it spends about $5 billion per year on research), forming joint ventures and collaborations, and making selective acquisitions. It has some 50 drug candidates in clinical development stages, as well as additional preclinical candidates. Its R&amp;D programs focus on five therapeutic categories -- neurology, endocrinology, oncology, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases -- and include potential treatments for cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, vascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Lilly launched three new medicines: Cyramza (for advanced gastric and metastatic lung cancer), Jardiance, and Trulicity (both for type 2 diabetes). That year the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approved Cyramza to be used with paclitaxel, a type of chemotherapy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also pursuing additional indications for existing drugs. Biotechnology has become an increasingly important area of R&amp;D, with about half of the drugs in Lilly's pipeline coming from biotech molecules (derived from proteins). Its programs are conducted both independently and through collaborations and licensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company entered into a global agreement with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   to co-develop and co-commercialize AstraZeneca's AZD3293, which is being investigated for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In a similar agreement, it will develop and commercialize Adocia's BioChaperone Lispro, an ultra-rapid insulin compound designed to treat patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Lilly gained global rights to Locemia Solutions' clinical-stage intranasal glucagon, which is being tested for severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. The following year, the company entered a collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to study the combination of Lilly's cyclin-dependent CDK 4/6 inhibitors and Boehringer's IGF 1/2 antibody for patients with breast cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help offset any declines in its human pharmaceutical products segment, Lilly has also been expanding its animal health segment, primarily through acquisitions. After acquiring Novartis Animal Health in early 2015, Lilly became the second-largest animal health company in the world. It plans to continue investing in the segment to maintain its leading position in the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is expanding its global R&amp;D headquarters in Indianapolis. It is adding 130,000 sq. ft. to the facility; the space will include a multi-disciplinary laboratory to promote research across multiple research functions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions are another key way in which Lilly boosts its development pipeline. In 2014 Lilly acquired the development rights for a calcitonin gene-related peptide antibody that is being studied as a possible treatment for frequent migraine headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lilly has also been expanding its animal health division, primarily through acquisitions, to help offset potential future losses in the core pharmaceuticals segment. In 2014 its Elanco Animal Health unit acquired Germany's Lohmann Animal Health, a producer of poultry vaccines and feed additives. Lohmann also brought on board vaccine production facilities in the US and Germany as well as nearly 20 subsidiaries in Europe, Asia, and North America. Shortly thereafter, Lilly picked up
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   Animal Health and its nine manufacturing plants, six R&amp;D facilities, 600 products, and global distribution infrastructure for $5.4 billion. The move created the second-largest animal health company in the world. In early 2017 Elanco bought the US feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio of
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Inghelheim
   </company>
   's Vetmedica unit for $885 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in early 2017, the company bought CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for some $960 million. CoLucid is developing Lasmiditan, an oral medication for the management of pain caused by migraine headaches. That addition boosted Lilly's pain management pipeline.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Colonel Eli Lilly, pharmacist and Union officer in the Civil War, started Eli Lilly and Company in 1876 with $1,300. His process of gelatin-coating pills led to sales of nearly $82,000 in 1881. Later, the company made gelatin capsules, which it still sells. Lilly died in 1898, and his son and two grandsons ran the business until 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eli Lilly began extracting insulin from the pancreases of hogs and cattle in 1923; 6,000 cattle glands or 24,000 hog glands made one ounce of the substance. Other products created in the 1920s and 1930s included antiseptic Merthiolate, sedative Seconal, and treatments for pernicious anemia and heart disease. In 1947 the company began selling diethylstilbestrol (DES), a drug to prevent miscarriages. Eli Lilly researchers isolated the antibiotic erythromycin from a species of mold found in the Philippines in 1952. Lilly was also the major supplier of Salk polio vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company enjoyed a 70% share of the DES market by 1971, when researchers noticed that a rare form of cervical cancer afflicted many of the daughters of women who had taken the drug. The FDA restricted the drug's use and Lilly found itself on the receiving (and frequently losing) end of a number of trailblazing product-liability suits that stretched into the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm diversified in the 1970s, buying Elizabeth Arden (cosmetics, 1971; sold 1987) and IVAC (medical instruments, 1977). It launched such products as analgesic Darvon and antibiotic Ceclor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lilly's 1982 launch of Humulin, a synthetic insulin developed by
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   , made it the first company to market a genetically engineered product. In 1986 the company introduced Prozac; that year it also bought biotech firm Hybritech for $300 million (sold in 1995 for less than $10 million). In 1988 Lilly introduced anti-ulcerative Axid. It founded pesticides and herbicides maker DowElanco with
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to find a new product outlet, the firm bought pharmacy benefit management company PCS Health Systems from what is now
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   in 1994. But an FTC mandate to offer rival drugs and a lack of mail-order sales contributed to poor results, which ultimately led Lilly to sell PCS to
   <company id="11278">
    Rite Aid
   </company>
   and exit this arena completely in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eli Lilly in 1995 bought medical communications network developer Integrated Medical Systems. That year the firm and developer
   <company id="12923">
    Centocor
   </company>
   introduced ReoPro, a blood-clot inhibitor used in angioplasties. The next year it launched antipsychotic Zyprexa, Humalog, and Gemzar, and Prozac was approved to treat bulimia nervosa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the firm sold its DowElanco stake to Dow. In 1998 the Lilly Endowment passed the Ford Foundation as the US's largest charity, largely due to Prozac (it has since been passed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation). That year Lilly began trying to stop Chinese drugmakers from infringing on its patents for Prozac's active ingredient.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 a US federal judge found the firm illegally promoted osteoporosis drug Evista as a breast cancer preventative similar to
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca's
   </company>
   Nolvadex. Lilly halted tests on its variation of heart drug Moxonidine after 53 patients died. Also that year Zyprexa was approved to treat bipolar disorder.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the firm began marketing Prozac under the Sarafem name for severe premenstrual syndrome. A federal appeals court knocked more than two years off Prozac's patent, reducing the expected 2003 expiration date to 2001, creating a negative impact on Lilly's annual sales (Prozac had accounted for 30% of revenues). Lilly suffered another blow when a potential successor to Prozac failed in clinical trials and became embroiled in legal maneuverings with generics maker
   <company id="11754">
    Barr Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While the firm fretted over Prozac and its patents, it continued work to find its next blockbuster. In 2000 Lilly and partner
   <company id="12419">
    ICOS
   </company>
   announced favorable results from a study of erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis, which was approved in Europe in 2002 and in the US in 2004. (Several years later, Lilly acquired ICOS and, with it, full ownership of the Cialis franchise.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Lilly bought a minority stake in
   <company id="14081">
    Isis Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , a developer of antisense drugs, and licensed from it an antisense lung cancer drug. Also that year the firm launched Lilly BioVentures, a venture fund aimed at private biotech startup companies. In 2002 the company settled with eight states in an infringement-of-privacy case involving the company's accidental disclosure of e-mail addresses for more than 600 Prozac patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004 the druggernaut was one of several pharmas hit by bad news about drug side effects. Lilly announced its attention-deficit disorder drug Strattera had been linked to rare liver problems. The company agreed to add warning labels about the potential side effects to the drug's packaging and advertisements. The company also began facing trouble over Zyprexa, as consumer lawsuits claiming diabetes and high blood pressure began pouring in. The majority of suits were settled in 2005 and 2007 for some $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Generalized anxiety disorder drug Cymbalta was approved by the FDA and released in 2006, and osteoporosis drug Evista was approved for an expanded indication as a breast cancer preventative for postmenopausal women in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 the company acquired and absorbed development partner
   <company id="12419">
    ICOS
   </company>
   for $2.1 billion; the deal gave Lilly full ownership of Viagra-competitor Cialis. Lilly dropped a joint-development effort with another partner,
   <company id="12736">
    Alkermes
   </company>
   , for an inhaled insulin device in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gradually reduced its workforce by more than 10% between 2003 and 2008 to fight off the effects of generic competition and other challenges. Other restructuring measures included an employee attrition plan announced in 2007, a management restructuring in 2008, and a  manufacturing consolidation program launched in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a lengthy lawsuit regarding its patents for its top seller, Zyprexa, a federal judge ruled in Lilly's favor in 2008 against generic manufacturers
   <company id="12043">
    IVAX
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103484">
    Dr. Reddy's Laboratories
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
   </company>
   . Federal courts ruled that the drug's patents would remain valid until October 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   To fuel growth in the biopharmaceuticals market, the firm completed a $1 billion biotech research facility in Indianapolis in 2008. It further expanded through the 2008 acquisition of biotech firm
   <company id="15468">
    ImClone
   </company>
   for about $6.5 billion; ImClone began operating as a research subsidiary of Lilly following the transaction. ImClone already had one approved blockbuster therapy, Erbitux for colorectal and head/neck cancers, and was developing numerous other cancer therapy candidates. Lilly also expanded its biotech oncology program earlier that year by purchasing development partner
   <company id="140250">
    SGX Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $64 million. SGX was absorbed into Lilly's research operations.
