  <p>
   In 2015, revenue increased a slim 2% to CHF9.4 billion as higher demand from India and China boosted revenue in the Asia-Pacific and Africa segment. Net income fell 17% to CHF747 million due to lower income from associates. Cash flow from operations increased 19% to CHF1.1 billion due to changes in working capital.

  <p>
   The company focuses on geographical presence and its production and R&amp;D capacity in growth markets, which China and India. In China, the number of branches and sales offices increased to over 200 in 2015. The company completed its new R&amp;D center in India, which will provide an additional boost to the growth strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The continued urbanization of population centers bodes well for the elevator industry as high-rise buildings are thrown up into the sky in increasing numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is scaling back its involvement in ALSO Holdings, and in recent years reduced its stake to below 10%, with the intention of eventually exiting the business entirely.

  <p>
   Robert Schindler and Eduard Villiger established Schindler &amp; Villiger in 1874 to make lift equipment and machinery in Lucerne, Switzerland. Villiger left the firm in 1892, and the enterprise became known as Robert Schindler, Machinery Manufacturer. The company added an iron foundry in 1895.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert sold the business to his brother, Alfred, in 1901 and the company was renamed Alfred Schindler. The following year it delivered its first electric passenger elevator with automatic push-button controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alfred Schindler took on a partner in 1906 by the name of Fritz Geilfuss. The company's name was changed to Schindler &amp; Cie. Around this time the company's first subsidiary was established in Berlin. Other subsidiaries soon followed in France and another in Germany. Sales offices were opened in Argentina (1910), Belgium and Russia (1912), and Egypt, Poland, and Spain (1914).
  </p>
  <p>
   Schindler &amp; Cie. continued to grow, adding elevator motor manufacturing (1915) and cranes (1920) to its product line. By 1923 the company had opened a factory in Mulhouse, France. Geilfuss died in 1920, and Adolf Sigg became Alfred Schindler's partner in 1925.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI the company's iron foundry produced munitions; it eventually became independent in 1925. By 1931 the company had expanded into Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece, Lithuania, Morocco, South Africa, and Yugoslavia. The firm was incorporated as Aufzüge und Elektromotorenfabrik, Schindler &amp; Cie. AG in 1932. Schindler delivered its first escalator in 1936.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales fell off during WWII, as demand for elevators diminished, but the company managed to expand modestly (Venezuela, UK, South Africa). By 1959 Schindler had become Europe's largest elevator company. Schindler acquired a stake in Dutch firm Westdijk in 1967 and bought Wertheim-Werk of Austria in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was restructured under the name Schindler Holding AG in 1970. By 1974 it had 56 subsidiaries throughout Europe, South America, and South Africa. Schindler entered the US in 1979 with the purchase of Reliance Electric Cleveland's Haughton Elevator division in Toledo, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>
   The advent of the 1980s marked the beginning of a 15-year period of continued growth for Schindler. It established the first industrial joint venture with China in 1980 (another followed in 1988). Schindler went on to open an Australian subsidiary (1981) and strike a licensing deal with Bharat Bijlee Ltd., India's largest elevator company (1986). In 1987 Schindler bought a controlling interest in Japan's Nippon Elevator Industry Co. The company's 1988 purchase of a majority share of Swiss computer wholesaler ALSO Holding AG was deemed risky at the time, but after some restructuring measures were taken, the unit thrived. That year Schindler took over the North American elevator and escalator operations of Westinghouse.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the first half of the 1990s, Schindler began to emphasize its role as a service provider (maintenance and repair) and focused on growing in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The second half of the 1990s saw Schindler introduce several elevating innovations. The machine room-less elevator debuted in 1997. That year the company made it possible to order elevators online.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999, the company's 125th anniversary, 40% of sales came from outside Europe, and non-elevator operations climbed to 20% of sales. In 2000 Schindler inked a deal with
   <company id="52289">
    Mitsubishi Electric
   </company>
   to supply each other with elevator components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to tap new markets, in 2002 Schindler acquired a 51% stake in Russian elevator maker Liftremont. The company closed factories in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, and Turkey that year. In 2003 Schindler acquired South Korea's Joong Ang Elevator Company and Austria's Doppelmayr Aufzüge.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ALSO Group sold its Systems Business unit to Germany's
   <company id="136366">
    Bechtle
   </company>
   in 2004. A year later ALSO bought majority control of GNT Holding, a Finnish distributor of IT products and consumer electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   2005 saw more acquisitions. Schindler bought Eletec Vytahy Spol (Czech Republic) and Mercury Ascensore (Japan). That year Schindler China opened an escalator factory in Shanghai, capable of producing more than 6,000 escalators a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Schindler bought a one-quarter interest in Hyundai Elevator, the second largest vendor of elevators and escalators in South Korea. It also took full ownership of Certus, its long-time partner in Croatia, and established a Schindler Adriatic organization to represent the group's interests in the Balkans. ALSO made GNT Holding a wholly owned subsidiary in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schindler's momentum was affected by a decision made by European Union regulators in 2007. The company was among five elevator manufacturers fined, following a three-year investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands from 1995 to 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2008 Schindler increased its ownership in its Korean subsidiary from 70% to 100% and bought a 49% stake in Al Doha Elevators &amp; Escalators WLL in Qatar. The company has been an exclusive distributor of Schindler products in Qatar since 2005. It was renamed Al Doha Schindler Elevators &amp; Escalators.
