   for Sealed Air. Best known as the company that created Bubble Wrap, Sealed Air also makes Instapak foam, Jiffy mailers, and Fill-Air inflatable packaging systems, through its Product Care segment. Its largest segment, Food Care, makes Cryovac bags, trays, and absorbent pads for use by food processors and supermarkets to protect meat and poultry. Other products include shrink packaging for consumer goods, such as toys and CDs; medical packaging for pacemakers and IV fluid; and specialty packaging for fabricators and the manufacturing industry. Sealed Air serves customers in almost 170 countries and operates through three major subsidiaries: Sealed Air, Cryovac, and

    Diversey
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Geographically, the company's subsidiaries own 103 manufacturing facilities worldwide, with each facility tailoring the products it makes to the demands of the local market. In 2015 its operations generated approximately 65% of its revenue from outside the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sealed Air in 2015 reorganized into three global business segments in order to efficiently integrate Diversey into its operations. It operates through Product Care (food and drink packaging; 21% of total sales), Diversey (representing Diversey's legacy business; almost 30%), and Food Care (new segment featuring the company's former protective packaging, shrink packaging, and specialty materials segments; 48%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sealed Air sells its products through over 7,100 sales, marketing, and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market products to and through a large number of distributors, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It targets food and beverage processors, business supply distributors, consumer products manufacturers, hotel operators, retailers, building contractors, educational institutions, and health care providers as customers.

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $7.8 billion in 2014, Sealed Air saw its revenues decline by 9% to $7.03 billion in 2015. The decline was fueled by revenue drops across its three segments: Food Care (11%), Diversey Care (8%), and Product Care (7%).
  </p>
  <p>
   The segments' (especially Food Care) revenues dropped in 2015 primarily due to the divestiture of its North American foam trays and absorbent pads and European food trays businesses in addition to lower unit volumes in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sealed Air's profits surged by 30% from $258 million in 2014 to $335 million in 2015 due to lower selling and administrative expenses coupled with savings from its restructuring activities. In addition, the company's operating cash flow skyrocketed by over 550% from 2014 to 2015 due to additional cash received from a settlement agreement.

  <p>
   In order to continue to develop and introduce new products, Sealed Air has decided to outsource some of its technically less complex product lines, such as foam and plastic trays, to third-party manufacturers. The outsourcing requires less investment from the company in regard to capital expenditure, and it frees up the company to develop more innovative products (the company has more than 4,900 patents), which the company hopes will continue to improve its competitive advantage.
  </p>
  <p>
   The focus on its flexible packaging products portfolio, Sealed Air in 2015 sold its North American foam trays and absorbent pads business to NOVIPAX, a portfolio company of

   , for net proceeds of $76 million.

  <p>
   Sealed Air often augments its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired Intellibot Robotics, a US-based privately owned company that specializes in the development of robotic commercial floor cleaning machines. The business will be integrated into Sealed Air's Diversey division and its leading brand of TASKI floor cleaning machines.

  <p>
   In the late 1950s, after US engineer Al Fielding and Swiss inventor Marc Chavannes found no takers for their plastic air-bubble-embossed wallpaper, they looked for another use for the material. They came up with Bubble Wrap, the first product of Sealed Air, which they founded in 1960 and took public soon after. AirCap, as the material was first known, didn't just protect products from damage; it also reduced storage and shipping costs.
