   Cavium's revenue increased 23% from $373 million in 2014 compared to $304 million in 2013. The company posted higher sales in products for enterprise network, data center, and access and service provider markets. Sales slowed in the broadband and consumer market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss deepened to $15 million in 2014 from $3 million in 2013 because of a change in estimated fair value of notes payable and other costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to $60.6 million from $55.8 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Cavium strives to keep its product development efforts in pace with rapid growth in the internet, wireless, and enterprise network markets as businesses and consumer adopt new devices and applications. Market demands for devices that provide enhanced functionality and lower manufacturing costs are keeping the company on its toes. Efforts are focused on development of new high-performance, multicore microprocessor semiconductors; it is also working to incorporate functions provided by stand-alone semiconductors into its products. In addition to internal product development efforts, the company expands its offerings through periodic acquisitions and the formation of strategic partnerships.

   Cavium introduced a set of highly integrated single chips that enable a new category of Macrocells and Smart Radio Heads that support a range of deployment scenarios. The OCTEON Fusion-M family ranges from the single chip CNF75xx macrocell to the single chip CNF74xx for use in Smart Radio Heads.

   The company used proceeds from its 2007 IPO to repay a $4 million loan from
   <company id="14720">
    SVB Financial Group
   </company>
   (formerly Silicon Valley Bank) and Gold Hill Ventures 03 LP. Cavium also used the money for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired assets belonging to Taiwan-based Star Semiconductor for about $9 million in cash. The deal gave Cavium Networks a system-on-chip (SoC) and a software design team with broadband and network connectivity experience. Later that year Cavium acquired W&amp;W Communications, a developer of video processors, for about $19 million. W&amp;W's PureVu processor line became a Cavium product family.

   Looking to enter the embedded Linux software market, in 2009 Cavium bought
   <company id="99884">
    MontaVista Software
   </company>
   for about $50 million. MontaVista develops Linux-based operating systems that are embedded into electronics that operate automobiles, electronics, and communications products.
