   Volcom says it is "youth against establishment"; however, this establishment is firmly on the side of youth -- those skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding. The firm designs action sports apparel, footwear, and accessories for men, women, and kids. It operates and licenses 50-plus retail stores and outlets under the Volcom banner in the US and abroad. It also owns two Laguna Surf &amp; Sport stores in California, which sell branded merchandise for surfers and beachgoers. Besides its own shops, Volcom sells its brand through department stores, specialty retailers, and online merchants in the US and more than 40 other countries. Volcom is owned by France's

   Since its purchase by PPR, Volcom has focused on international expansion. In 2014 it made further investments in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. On the e-commerce front, Volcom has announced plans to launch a new Volcom.com website, which will combine the brand, athlete, product, and community into a single, unified experience.

  <p>
   Volcom works to keep its logo front and center with anti-establishment youth through sponsorship of concerts, sports events, board-sports athletes, and cyclists.

   In Winter 2014/2015 Electric released the EG3 snow goggle featuring the proprietary 'quick-change' Electric Press Seal lens system.

   In fall 2013 Volcom launched its closed-toe footwear line developed in cooperation with

   (also owned by Kering). The company also invested in marketing and other operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America, key markets for the Volcom brand. A dozen more new stores were opened in 2013, bringing the chain's global retail footprint to more than 50 company-owned locations.

   Looking to boost its Sport &amp; Lifestyle unit, PPR completed its purchase of Volcom in July 2011. The French luxury group paid $24.50 per share for the action sports brand, valuing Volcom at $608 million. As a wholly owned subsidiary of
   <company id="44004">
    Kering
   </company>
   , Volcom benefits from its parent company's expertise in global markets, where the predominantly US-based brand had been seeking to expand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added new stores in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, and the US in 2011 and 2012. In addition to new store openings, Volcom has been buying stores operated by its licensees. In 2011 the company acquired the assets of a licensee that operated 10 Volcom outlet stores in California, Nevada, Utah, and Washington.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1991 by CEO Richard Woolcott.
