   Genzyme makes it way battling uncommon diseases. The company's product portfolio focuses on treatments for multiple sclerosis and rare diseases, including genetic, endocrine, and cardiovascular disease. One of its main products, Cerezyme, is a leading (and pricey) treatment for Gaucher disease, a rare enzyme-deficiency condition. Founded in 1981, Genzyme has treatments for other enzyme disorders including Fabry disease and Pompe disease. In addition, the company conducts research in heart and kidney disease as well as other areas; resulting products would be commercialized by its parent. With operations in the US and Europe, Genzyme is owned by French pharmaceutical firm
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Genzyme's full list of research areas includes neurological disease, renal disease, orthopedics, cardiovascular disease, neuroimmunology, genetic disease, and immune-mediated disease. Its pipeline includes additional uses for existing drugs as well as treatments for Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, and Niemann-Pick disease, a metabolic disorder. The company operates in two business units: rare diseases and multiple sclerosis (MS).
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's MS franchise includes once-daily oral Aubagio and monoclonal antibody Lemtrada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Genzyme has offices in more than 40 countries with concentrations in the US, where it has 15 locations, and in China, France, the UK, and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has six production sites. It works with more than 15 subcontractors to make a dozen commercial products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue increased 22% to â‚¬2.6 billion in 2014, primarily due to higher sales of Aubagio and Fabrazyme. Genzyme contributed 8% of its parent's total business that year.

  <p>
   Since becoming part of Sanofi, the company has narrowed its focus to rare diseases and multiple sclerosis. The parent calls this approach New Genzyme and considers it one of seven "growth platforms". Rare diseases include genetic disorders, primarily lysomal storage disorders (LSDs), a group of diseases caused by enzyme deficiencies. Products Cerezyme, Fabrazyme, and Myozyme/Lumizyme treat LSDs. It has three candidates in this area.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Genzyme gained European marketing approval for Cerdelga, an oral medication for adults with type 1 Gaucher disease.Also that year, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approved MS treatment Lemtrada and Cerdelga for sale in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2015 the company laid off about 100 employees in the oncology and global research and development departments. The move was part of parent Sanofi's ongoing restructuring of its early-stage research platforms.

  <p>
   The company agreed to buy Caprelsa, a therapy for thyroid carcinoma, from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   in 2015. That purchase will further boost its rare disease portfolio.

  <p>
   Genzyme was acquired by Sanofi for some $20.1 billion in 2011.

  <p>
   From little oaks, mighty biotech companies may grow. In 1981 Tufts professor Henry Blair (who later served as a board member) teamed up with Sherman Snyder and Oak Venture Partners to buy biotech businesses. (The first purchase was an English company that made diagnostic enzymes and had an agreement with the National Institutes of Health to make an enzyme for Gaucher's disease patients.) Armed both with a good therapeutic candidate and a salable product to help fund its development, Genzyme became profitable in 1984 and went public in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genzyme diversified through purchases, adding fine chemicals (for use in clinical chemistry testing; exited 1997), diagnostics (such as cholesterol testing), and biotherapeutics. In 1989 the firm bought prenatal testing company Integrated Genetics, which had molecular biology capabilities, and took it public in 1991. Genzyme's development efforts paid off that year when Ceredase was approved to treat Gaucher's disease. The product's protected orphan drug status quickly made it a cash cow. The company later made purchases in such areas as tissue repair (1995), surgical specialties (1996), and cancer treatments (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 it began selling newly approved Renagel kidney disease treatment (developed with GelTex Pharmaceuticals, which it bought in 2000), as well as Biogen's AVONEX multiple sclerosis drug in Japan. In 1999 the company increased its niche focus by buying Peptimmune, which developed drugs for rare genetic disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Genzyme bought
   <company id="15339">
    Biomatrix
   </company>
   and combined it with Genzyme Tissue Repair and Genzyme Surgical Products to form Genzyme Biosurgery. The next year it bought a private Brazilian pharmaceutical company to regain Renagel distribution rights in that key market. In August 2001 its Fabry disease drug Fabrazyme won European approval, marking the firm's entrance into a niche market; Genzyme then geared up to win FDA approval and claim a large share of this limited market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to capitalize on some R&amp;D, the firm in 2002 created subsidiary
   <company id="105216">
    Peptimmune
   </company>
   to create new therapies for autoimmune and allergy disorders. That year the company settled a 1991 suit with
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   disputing royalty rights to Genentech's TNKase; Genzyme's buy of Integrated Genetics gave it patents the company alleged were key to TNKase. The FDA helped the company in 2003 expand its product portfolio: The agency approved Fabrazyme and Aldurazyme, another niche drug co-developed with
   <company id="59774">
    BioMarin
   </company>
   . That year it bought antibody drugmaker
   <company id="41963">
    SangStat Medical
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of plans to simplify its structure, Genzyme consolidated its tracking stocks under its primary GENZ ticker in 2003. (However, the consolidation resulted in a $64 million class action lawsuit settlement in 2009 for former Genzyme Biosurgery stockholders over alleged market price manipulations.) Instead of three units that included Genzyme Biosurgery and Genzyme General, the company established five business units: Renal, Therapeutics, Biosurgery, Transplant, and Diagnostic Products and Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the 2004 purchase of
   <company id="52855">
    ILEX Oncology
   </company>
   , valued at $1 billion, Genzyme aims to augment its oncology pipeline with two late-stage products and a first-class clinical organization. The next year it bought Verigen, which had developed a cartilage repair cell therapy available in Europe and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further expand its oncology operations, Genzyme in 2006 acquired
   <company id="102666">
    AnorMED
   </company>
   , which was developing a treatment for cancer patients undergoing stem cell transplants (Mozobil, approved by the FDA in 2008). AnorMED's operations were integrated into Genzyme's R&amp;D organization. Genzyme also brought to market a new non-small cell lung cancer test for the KRAS gene (and mutations thereof) designed to help doctors determine therapy regimens.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 it acquired
   <company id="112287">
    Bioenvision
   </company>
   for $345 million, mostly to gain worldwide rights to Bioenvision's acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment for pediatric patients, clofarabine (sold in the US and Canada under the brand name Clolar and in Europe as Evoltra), which the two companies developed collaboratively. The acquisition bumped up against some disapproval from Bioenvision shareholders but was ultimately approved. Bioenvision was promptly absorbed into Genzyme's other operations, expanding Genzyme's global marketing business in the oncology field.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FDA approved Genzyme's Renvela kidney treatment in late 2007; Renvela is the next generation of its Renagel kidney disease medicine. In 2008 the company received approval for Mozobil, a treatment for cancer patients undergoing stem cell transplants.
