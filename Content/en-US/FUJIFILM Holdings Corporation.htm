   FUJIFILM still has film in its name, but FUJIDOCS or FUJI INFO might be more apt. The company's imaging unit is its smallest, by far, making photographic films and papers, digital cameras, photofinishing equipment, and chemicals. FUJIFILM's main businesses, about 85% of revenue together, are document operations and information-related products and services. Its document business includes joint venture
   <company id="104796">
    Fuji Xerox
   </company>
   , offering copy machines, printers, and production services. The information unit provides medical imaging, large-scale printing, recording media, optical and flat panel display devices and components. Customers overseas account for about 60% sales.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's document solutions business generates 47% of revenue with information solutions accounting for 38%. The imaging unit provides 15% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Document solutions includes the company's production services and global services, office products, and office printers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product groups in the information unit are medical and life sciences systems, products and services for graphic arts applications, flat panel displays, industrial products and electronic materials, and recording media and optical devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imaging is a much smaller slice of FUJIFILM's pie now, about 15% of sales, though the company is still a major global force there. Photo imaging sells film, paper, chemicals, photo finishing, and lab services and electronic imaging consists of digital cameras.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue rose 2% in 2015 (ended March) from 2014. Sales increased for photo imaging, medical systems, electronic materials, and the document business. That was almost balanced by decreases in sales in the optical devices, electronic imaging, and flat panel display materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped 46% higher with help from reduced research and developed costs in 2015. Cash from continuing operations dropped from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   FUJIFILM is making investments in three core markets: healthcare, highly functional materials, and document business. Particularly in health care, the company is looking to build its pharmaceuticals business and regenerative medicine businesses and maintain stable profits from medical systems.

  <p>
   FUJIFILM acquired Cellular Dynamics International, , a developer and manufacturer of fully functioning human cells in industrial quantities to precise specifications, in 2015. The purchase provide FUJIFILM's with more advanced capabilities in its bid to build its life sciences business. It continues a series of health and life science related acquisitions FUJIFILM has made in recent years.

  <p>
   Mokichi Morita, president of Japan's leading celluloid maker (Dainippon Celluloid Company, founded 1919), decided to start making motion picture film in the early 1930s. Movies were becoming popular in Japan, but there was no domestic film supplier. Working with a grant from the government, Dainippon Celluloid established Fuji Photo Film Co., an independent company, in 1934 in Minami Ashigara Village, near Mount Fuji.
  </p>
  <p>
   At first the company had trouble gaining acceptance in Japan as a quality film producer. However, German emulsion specialist Dr. Emill Mauerhoff helped Fuji overcome its product deficiencies, producing black-and-white photographic film (1936) and the first Japanese-made color film (1948). In the meantime Fuji added 35mm photographic film, 16mm motion picture film, and X-ray film to its product line. By the early 1940s the company was operating four factories and a research laboratory in Japan. Its first overseas office, opened in Brazil in 1955, was followed by offices in the US (1958) and Europe (1964).
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji continued to expand its product line, adding magnetic tape in 1960. Two years later it formed Fuji Xerox, a Japanese joint venture with Xerox, to sell copiers in Japan and the Pacific Rim. It operated as a private-label film supplier in the US and did not market its products under its own brand name until 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   International marketing VP Minoru Ohnishi became Fuji's youngest president in 1980 at age 55. To decrease dependence on Japanese film sales, he built sales in the US (agreeing to sponsor the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, after Eastman Kodak refused to, was key) and pumped money into the production of videotapes, floppy disks, and medical diagnostic equipment. Fuji introduced Fujicolor Quicksnap, the world's first 35mm disposable camera, in 1986. It began establishing manufacturing operations in the US two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company created the FUJIFILM Micro-devices subsidiary to produce image-processing semiconductors in 1990. In 1992 Fuji scientists completed a crude artificial "eye" (a possible forerunner of more efficient eyes for robots). The following year it launched the Pictrostat instant print system, which produces color prints in one minute from photos, slides, and objects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji was forced to temporarily raise US prices in 1994 after Kodak accused it of illegally dumping its photographic paper exported to the US. But Fuji skirted the problem in 1995 by making the paper at its US plant. That year Kodak asked for economic sanctions against Fuji and the Japanese government, saying that the government encouraged Fuji to use exclusive contracts to control film distribution, thus keeping Kodak from selling film in many stores. (The case was rejected by the World Trade Organization in 1997.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm unveiled the Advanced Photo System (co-developed with Kodak and three other companies) in 1996, combining conventional photography with digital-image processing and printing technology. Also that year Fuji bought six off-site wholesale photofinishing plants from Wal-Mart (the largest US provider of photofinishing services) and won contracts to provide supplies to all of Wal-Mart's in-store one-hour photo labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 it chopped film prices in the US and began making film at its US plant. In 1999 Fuji introduced a high-quality image sensor for digital cameras (Super CCD) and Instax, an instant picture camera. Fuji and Sony launched HiFD, a floppy disk with 140 times the storage capacity of traditional disks, in early 2000. Fuji later announced plans to develop more efficient, low-cost ink jet printers through an alliance with Xerox and

   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2001 Fuji acquired half of Xerox's 50% stake in the companies' Fuji Xerox joint venture. In 2002 the company acquired Japanese film processing company Jusphoto Co. and in 2003 purchased additional shares of Process Shizai Co., renaming it Fujifilm Graphic Systems Co., Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   It bought Sericol from

   in 2005 for $230 million and
   <company id="106621">

   Inkjet in 2006 for $260 million. Also that year the company adopted a new holding company structure and changed its name to FUJIFILM Holdings. Also that year the firm acquired US-based Problem Solving Concepts, a manufacturer of medical imaging information systems for cardiology; TSR Holding S.A., a medical equipment service and maintenance supplier; and the remaining shares of Fuji Medical Systemes France S.A., a medical imaging products distributor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2008 FUJIFILM Holdings acquired Germany's IP Labs GmbH, a developer of online photo service systems. The consolidation of Toyama Chemical into a consolidated subsidiary in March marked the holding company's entry into the pharmceutical business. In November it purchased Empiric Systems LLC, a US-based maker of radiology information systems.
