   II-VI could play a mean game of laser tag, but it's more interested in making things. The company (its name is pronounced "two-six") makes lenses, mirrors, prisms, and other optical components and materials. II-VI's clients -- drawn from the aerospace, health care, industrial, military, and telecom equipment sectors -- use these components in lasers and other systems used in precision manufacturing, communications networks, military targeting and navigation systems, and other applications. The company has manufacturing operations throughout the US, as well as in Asia and Germany. Customers have included

   ,
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   ,

   , and the US government.

        <p>
   II-VI's biggest source of revenue is its Laser Solutions unit, which accounts for 39% of sales. It is followed by Photonics, 35% of revenue, and Performance Products, 26%.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US is II-VI's largest market, accounting for 32% of its sales. China is next, representing more than 19% of annual sales, while Hong Kong represents about 15% and Germany, 10%. The company has production facilities in 10 US states, including its home state of Pennsylvania, and half a dozen foreign countries, such as China and Vietnam.

        <p>
   II-VI's sales have increased each of past six years. The company set another revenue record for itself in 2015 (ended June) posting $742 million in sale -- a 9% increase from 2014. Its photonics segment paced sales for the year with a 20% increase based on customer demand for optical filters, optical components and assemblies, pump lasers, and fiber amplifier modules. Sales in the Performance Products unit, however, fell 9%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income shot up 71% in 2015 as II-VI began to realize contributions from acquisitions that resulted in bigger market share, higher revenue, and operationing efficiencies. Net income was $66 million in 2015 compared to $38 million the year before. Net earnings also benefited from a one-time settlement related to obligations from previous acquisitions of $7.1 million (after-tax).
  </p>
        <p>
   II-VI had $1299 million cash flow from operations in 2015 compared to $95 million in 2014.

        <p>
   II-VI continued a restructuring program in its Photonics and Performance Products segments to adjust costs. It recorded after-tax restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2015 compared to $3.4 million in f2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   Research and development is vital to the company's success. Indeed, II-VI aims to invest between 5% and 7% of its revenues each year in R&amp;D (the figure was 6.9% in 2015). Its recent focus has been in silicon carbide substrates, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthetic diamond materials, photonics, and thermoelectric materials and devices. II-VI uses a mix of internal and external funding for most areas, but devotes only internal funds to CVD diamond and photonics.

   II-VI's Pacific Rare Specialty Metals &amp; Chemicals (PRM) subsidiary in 2013 discontinued its tellurium line and downsized its selenium production line to focus on providing selenium metal to the company's Infrared Optics business, while distancing the business from volatile metal index price fluctuations. !--[if gte mso 9]

   The company uses acquisitions to build its business around core strengths in engineered materials and components.

        <p>
   In early 2016, II-VI agreed to buy two businesses to expand its technology platforms and production capacity for semiconductor lasers for $110 million. The acquisitions of EpiWorks and
   <company id="40594">
    ANADIGICS
   </company>
   position II-VI for the fast-growing markets for Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs). The lasers are used in consumer electronics, data centers, sensing, medical, and industrial markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2013 the company acquired the Switzerland-based semiconductor laser business of
   <company id="100566">
    Oclaro Inc
   </company>
   . for $115 million. II-VI will operate the newly acquired business as II-VI Laser Enterprise GmbH.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 it bought Connecticut-based M Cubed Technologies for about $71 million and California-based LightWorks Optics for about half that amount. M Cubed manufactures advanced ceramic materials and precision motion control products and LightWorks supplies advanced optical systems used in defense, aerospace, and commercial operations. The prior year brought the acquisition of Massachusetts-based Aegis Lightwave for $52 million. Aegis' tunable optical devices are used to expand bandwidth in high speed optical networks, and will contribute to II-VI's near-infrared optics business.

   Electrical engineer Carl Johnson, who had worked at

    Bell Labs
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ), among other companies, founded II-VI in 1971 to produce infrared optical materials for the emerging laser market. These materials -- including cadmium zinc telluride, zinc selenide, and zinc sulfide -- gave the company its name; they are from the "two-six" family of materials. (Cadmium and zinc are from column two on the periodic table; tellurium and selenium are from column six.)
  </p>
        <p>
   By the 1980s II-VI was the leading maker of optical components for carbon dioxide lasers. The company went public in 1987 and the next year added a factory in Singapore.
