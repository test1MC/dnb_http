   Birds of a feather can build careers together at Professional Diversity Network (PDN). An online professional networking company, PDN operates minority-focused websites that facilitate professional networking within ethnic and social communities. Its websites include iHispano.com, which serves Hispanic-American professionals, and AMightyRiver.com, which caters to African-Americans. The company also operates sites that serve other societal subsets, including women, Asian-Americans, gays and lesbians, and enlisted and veteran military personnel. Together, its websites have 1.8 million members and provide access to job listings, a social network, professional groups, and mentoring. PDN went public in 2013.

        <p>
   The company intends to use its $21 million in proceeds to fund its growth strategy, including building a sales and marketing team, bolstering its product development efforts, and acquiring additional minority professional networking websites. Other proceeds may fund general corporate activity.

   PDN is looking to grow its operations and revenue, in large part, by attracting advertisers. The company relies heavily on just two customers for revenue:
   <company id="41617">
    Monster
   </company>
   , which provides PDN's job posting and recruiting services and accounts for more than 70% of the company's revenue, and the University of Phoenix (subsidiary of
   <company id="42338">
    Apollo Education Group
   </company>
   ), which advertises on PDN's sites and accounts for about 20% of revenue.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Despite its limited revenue sources, PDN has been steadily growing its revenue and profits in recent years. Its growth between 2010 and 2011 can be attributed almost entirely to the recent addition of Apollo Group as an advertiser. The company also hopes to continue growing by capitalizing on larger ethnic trends in the US population, which shows minorities representing a larger share of the overall population in the US and, more importantly, in the US job market.
