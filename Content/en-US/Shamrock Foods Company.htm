   You might say Shamrock Foods is milking the food service business for all it's worth. Distribution business Shamrock Foods ranks in the top 10 US food services companies, while its Shamrock Farms unit represents one of the largest dairy operators in the southwestern US. The company's distribution operations supply food and related products to food service operators in 10 states in the Intermountain region through a handful of distribution centers. Shamrock Farms, home to more than 10,000 cows, produces and offers a full line of dairy products including fluid milk, half and half, and ice cream. Founded in 1922 as a mom-and-pop dairy, Shamrock Foods is still owned and operated by the founding McClelland family.
