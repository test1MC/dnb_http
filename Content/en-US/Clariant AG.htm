   Clariant is among the world's largest specialty chemicals companies. Its largest business units make functional chemicals such as adsorbents, biocides, industrial ingredients, and detergents, as well as chemicals and dyes for textiles, leather, and paper. Clariant's other segments make pigments for inks, paints, and masterbatches, which are highly concentrated additives for plastics and textiles. It is also a leading manufacturer of de-icing agents and fire retardants. With 100 companies, Clariant is active worldwide and is now focusing on its fast-growing fine and specialty chemicals and on expanding its operations. Clariant acquired Germany-based
   <company id="91265">
    Süd-Chemie AG
   </company>
   in 2011 in a deal valued at $2.6 billion.

  <p>
   The origins of Clariant go back to 1990 when
   <company id="41838">
    Sandoz Ltd.
   </company>
   (merged with
   <company id="41771">
    Ciba-Geigy
   </company>
   in 1996 to form
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ) reorganized to allow its chemicals division to stand as an independent unit within the Sandoz group. The division was spun off in 1995 as Clariant Ltd. The new company bought the paper chemicals business of Hickson &amp; Welsh, a UK-based subsidiary of Hickson International, the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on life sciences,
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   (merged with
   <company id="43931">
    Rhône-Poulenc
   </company>
   in 1999 to form
   <company id="41833">
    Aventis
   </company>
   and then became
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi-Aventis
   </company>
   in 2004) merged its specialty chemicals business with Clariant in 1997 to form the world's largest specialty chemicals firm. As part of the merger agreement, Hoechst retained a 45% stake in Clariant. Later that year Clariant sold its acylation derivatives business to
   <company id="52959">
    ChemFirst
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Clariant announced that the integration of Hoechst's specialty chemicals division was complete. As part of the process, Clariant sold its superabsorbents business to
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   . The division had been obtained as part of the Hoechst deal, but was not deemed a core business. That year Clariant and
   <company id="53105">
    Ciba Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   announced that they would merge. The deal soon fell apart, however, as it met with investor disapproval, antitrust issues, and concern over customer overlap.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clariant rebounded from the disappointment of the Ciba merger by purchasing Germany-based Boehringer Ingelheim KG's hydrocerol, activex, and exocerol product businesses in 1999. Later that year it was déjà vu when a proposed merger with Laporte plc got scrapped just 24 hours after it had been announced. Also in 1999 Hoechst completed divesting its 45% stake in Clariant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Clariant bought BTP, a leading UK-based maker of fine chemicals. That year the company gave its largest business segment a name more specific to what it does, when it changed Process &amp; Performance Products to Textile, Leather &amp; Paper Chemicals. Battered by the economy, in 2001 Clariant cut about 3,000 jobs, and, in the face of dim prospects, wrote off more than $700 million in goodwill related to its acquisition of BTP. To recoup those losses and in an attempt to reduce debt, Clariant sold some of its non-core businesses. Its former cellulose ethers and polymerisates unit (about 10% of 2001 sales), including its European emulsions unit and its polyvinyl butyral and alcohol businesses, was sold in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clariant began to sell off some of its non-core businesses in 2003 and continued the process into 2004. The company sold its Cellulose Ethers business to
   <company id="56866">
    Shin-Etsu
   </company>
   in late 2003 for around $275 million. In mid-2004 the company sold its electronic materials unit to
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   . That business supplied the semiconductor and flat panel display industries and accounted for about $350 million in 2003. Clariant also sold subsidiary Lancaster Synthesis to
   <company id="90230">
    Johnson Matthey
   </company>
   in July 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, the company sold its pharmaceutical fine ingredients business to investment group TowerBrook Capital Partners, which began to operate the business as a stand-alone entity, for about $85 million. It also added to its masterbatches unit that year with an acquisition from
   <company id="53105">
    Ciba
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The global economic downturn of 2008 and 2009 led to a round of layoffs and divestments at Clariant. The pigments and textile, leather, and paper chemicals units in particular were affected negatively by the recession. Each relies more heavily on the North American market, and the poor state of the US economy hurt Clariant. The company undertook a significant restructuring in late 2008 and in 2009, including temporary shutdowns of production facilities, reduced working hours, involuntary vacations, and other measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2010 it had completed most of its restructuring, and the Süd-Chemie deal was its first major acquisition under the new structure. The company also analyzed its production facilities, which was to result in the closing of 14 sites and downsizing of six sites by 2013.
