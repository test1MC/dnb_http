   United American Healthcare (UAHC) maintains the pulse of medical device manufacturing services. Through California-based subsidiary Pulse Systems, the company provides contract manufacturing services to medical device makers. More specifically, Pulse provides laser-cutting capabilities and other processing technology for cardiovascular devices. Before buying Pulse in 2010, the company operated the UAHC Health Plan of Tennessee, a managed care company whose network covered some 900 physicians and 20 hospitals. However, when its contract to serve Medicaid recipients in western Tennessee was not renewed in 2009, the company sought alternatives.

   The not-for-profit Michigan HMO, Inc., was formed in 1974 to operate OmniCare, an HMO specializing in Medicaid practice. It was on the verge of collapse by 1979, when Julius Combs, a board member of one of the HMO's largest medical practices, and HMO consultant Ronald Dobbins took over and put it in order. Michigan regulators' refusal to allow them to convert the by-then efficient OmniCare into a for-profit company sparked the formation of the for-profit UAH as OmniCare's management company.
  </p>
  <p>
   As UAH grew, OmniCare grew with it, and in 1991 UAH went public. The company fueled its growth through expansion, acquisitions, and joint ventures. Then in 1995 a company executive was suspended in a case in which two independent marketing representatives were convicted of signing up fictitious and ineligible clients for Tennessee's new state health care program, TennCare.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired majority stakes in UltraMedix (Florida) and OmniCare HealthCare (Tennessee) in 1996. However, costs related to a class-action lawsuit and the settlement of its legal problems in Tennessee contributed to UAH reporting losses in 1996 through 1998. The fallout hit the fan in elephantine proportions in 1998 with the liquidation of its Florida operations, a $20 million restructuring charge, and a new turnaround management team led by Gregory Moses, who refocused on the company's management operations in Michigan and Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   With profitability restored, UAH was able to announce a new alliance with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan to provide health care to Detroit's new casino industry workers. After taking a drubbing from its Tennessee operations in fiscal 2000, UAH anticipated some relief: It planned to increase revenue by collecting more management fees as the company expanded its commercial and Medicaid business. In 2001 the company ended its operation of County Care in Michigan and began its push to add more members in Tennessee.
