   It would actually be a lot easier to list the items Toppan Printing

   print. The company produces commercial products (posters, catalogs, calendars), securities and cards (checks, bank passbooks, magnetic cards), publications (magazines, books, CD-ROMs), and packaging products (containers, labels). In addition to traditional print products, Toppan also specializes in electronics materials, such as photomasks for semi-conductors and color filters for LCD TVs. The company boasts 180 group companies across the Asia/Pacific region, as well as in Europe and North America. Toppan Printing was founded in 1900 by engineers from the printing bureau of Japan's Ministry of Finance.

   Toppan Printing has grown to become one of the world's largest printing and publishing companies. The business operates through more than 180 subsidiaries and joint ventures. Just one of these is
   <company id="44463">
    Toppan Photomasks
   </company>
   , which manufactures electronics-related materials and industrial materials (such as decorative sheeting and wallpaper).  The company's printing businesses account for more than half of revenues. Efforts related to printing and publications include ramping up digital content distribution, such as expanding its Shufoo! digital flyer business.

   The company's printing operations provide a stable profit source that allows Toppan to invest in other growth industries, such as clean energy-related packaging products and materials. It's focused on becoming the world's sole comprehensive supplier of packaging materials for lithium-ion batteries, which have applications in personal computers, mobile and smart phones, and environmentally-friendly vehicles. To this end, it formed a joint venture partnership with

   , a provider of molding and sealant technologies. Previously Toppan focused on manufacturing for color filters and rear-projection TV screens. An example of such efforts was its 2010 formation of Ortus Technology, a joint venture with

    CASIO COMPUTER CO.
   </company>
   that manufactures organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid crystals.

   While the Japanese market accounts for about 84% of Toppan's 2014 sales, the company is working to boost its international business and expand globally. Its International Division was created to grow foreign sales and bring information-related overseas business under central control. The company is particularly focused on emerging markets such as China, Thailand, and Indonesia.

  <p>
   Toppan Printing was established as Toppan Printing Limited Partnership in 1900 by engineers from Japan's Ministry of Finance who used the most advanced printing techniques of the day. It was renamed Toppan Printing Co. in 1908. In its early days the company focused primarily on securities (for the Ministry of Finance), books, and business forms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toppan flourished during and immediately after WWI as book and magazine publishing increased. In 1926 it opened the Koishikawa Paper Container Plant. Printing declined in the 1930s, however, as the Japanese dictatorship banned books and stifled writers and publishers. WWII brought a paper shortage and recession, which further depressed Japan's printing industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the printing industry began to recover after the end of WWII, Toppan expanded into specialty packaging materials (1952) and industrial materials (1958). It also acquired children's book publisher Froebel-Kan in 1961 and became the first Japanese printer to open a Hong Kong plant in 1963. The company grew at a steady pace throughout the 1960s, eventually adding planning and designing to its stable of services. Toppan Moore Business Forms, a joint venture between Toppan and Canada's Moore Corporation, was established in 1965 (it would become Japan's largest business form printer by the 1980s).
  </p>
  <p>
   Toppan formed a US subsidiary, Toppan Printing (America), in New York City in 1971 and became the first Japanese printer to establish a production plant in the US with the 1979 opening of a separation plant in Mountainside, New Jersey. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company made several important breakthroughs in containers and packing products; it developed long-term liquid storage containers (1976), easy-to-uncap heat seals for packaging (1978), and long-term food storage containers (1980). In 1983 Toppan Moore developed a smart card with two embedded integrated circuits. Two years later the company purchased decorating products manufacturer Kyodo Kako. By the end of the decade Toppan had moved into the production of videotext, batteries, compact discs, liquid crystal display filters, lottery tickets, postage stamps, and portable smart card systems. It also began emphasizing distribution and direct marketing services and created an industrial materials division.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 Toppan had 21 printing plants and more than 50 sales offices throughout Japan, as well as 21 international offices. That year the company formed a photomask joint venture company with Dallas-based Texas Instruments. Toppan executive Hiromichi Fujita was named president of the firm in 1991 (he later became chairman). The company established a multimedia unit in 1996 and acquired all of Toppan Moore -- renamed Toppan Forms -- the following year (it spun off Toppan Forms in a public offering in 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Toppan joined with Internet Initiative Japan, Intel, Sun Microsystems, and IBM Japan to create Bitway, which focuses on Internet marketing and distribution of digital content. The following year Toppan entered into a variety of partnerships and joint ventures with such firms as Chughwa Picture Tubes (photomasks), Gemplus (smart cards), and Baltimore Technologies Japan Co. (electronic authentication). Also in 2000 the company celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding. In 2001 the company partnered with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. to make chips for other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company invested in another Internet opportunity, joining with NEC Corp. and SGI Japan Ltd. to support businesses using broadband Internet services.
