   RHI helps its customers beat the heat. The company is the world's leading manufacturer of heat-resistant refractory products. RHI's refractories are used in high-temperature industrial processes such as steelmaking, copper and aluminum smelting, and glass production, and in the construction of industrial kilns. Most of the company's refractory product sales are used in steelmaking. RHI has manufacturing and sales operations on five continents. Western Europe is the company's largest market, but RHI has been working to spread out its production and its sales to other regions.

  <p>
   RHI's origins can be traced back to the founding of Radex in Austria in 1908. The company soon patented Heraklith -- a material with unique thermal- and noise-insulation qualities, as well as fire-protection properties. By 1987 the company had come to be known as Radex-Heraklith, and it began trading on the Vienna stock exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Radex-Heraklith merged its refractory business with that of Austrian fireproof products maker Veitsch to form an operating subsidiary, Veitsch-Radex. The following year Radex-Heraklith acquired a majority ownership in Vedag, a German manufacturer of bimutic roofing materials. In 1995, through subsidiary Veitsch-Radex, Radex-Heraklith bought a controlling stake in German fireproof-materials concern Didier Werke AG. Veitsch-Radex increased its stake in Didier Werke AG to 89% in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Radex-Heraklith changed its name in 1998 to RHI AG. That year the company purchased Thueringer Dammstoffwerk, a German maker of insulation for the construction industry. Previously operating as a holding company, RHI reorganized its independent operations (including Veitsch-Radex and Heraklith AG) under a single, strong industrial entity in 1999. Also that year RHI bought a 90% stake in Slovakian insulation firm Izomat. The following year RHI purchased Global Industrial Technologies (GIT), strengthening RHI's refractory business in the US .
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the burden of debt, 2001 was largely the result of problems in the US -- specifically, a sharp rise in asbestos litigation claims and the steel crisis. In response, the company exited the refractory business in the US and deconsolidated those operations (subsidiary North American Refractories Company filed for bankruptcy). In 2002 it made further cuts by divesting its entire engineering and waterproofing operations. The following year RHI sold its real estate company in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 RHI sold its Heraklith AG insulating unit (which makes fire-resistant thermal and noise-insulation products such as stone-wool and wood-wool building board used in the construction of external walls, internal acoustic panels, and pitched roofs) to the Knauf Group for approximately â‚¬230 million.
