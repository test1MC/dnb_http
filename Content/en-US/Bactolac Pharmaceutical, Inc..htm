The company's encapsulated and tablet-based products are available already packaged and branded, or sold in bulk to customers who repackage them for private-label sale. Customers include distributors, retailers, and multi-level marketing companies. Its services include product formulation, sample runs, and product testing. Chairman and CEO Pailla Reddy holds a majority of the company.

  <p>
   David Bertrand founded Nutrition for Life International in 1984; five years later it merged with wholesale distributor Consumer Express. In 1994 Nutrition For Life expanded into Canada and then Puerto Rico.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kevin Trudeau (who had previous fraud and larceny convictions) joined Nutrition For Life in 1995 as a distributor. His energetic recruitment plan, which included incentives not offered by the company, was overseen by his Trudeau Marketing Group. He helped add 15,000 distributors, which boosted sales by 84%. Also in 1995 Trudeau introduced the Mega Memory home study course.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the state of Illinois sued Trudeau. Nutrition For Life was not part of the suit, but the company had been sued on its own account and in 1997 paid $3.5 million to clear its legal slate. All of this led to a loss in 1997 and depressed distributor recruiting. Meanwhile, Nutrition For Life won a $133 million judgment for libel against Greg Caton (formerly affiliated with Consumer Express) relating to his depiction of the company in a book.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nutrition For Life began offering long-distance service (LIFEdial 1 Plus) and Web page design and maintenance services (Adnetic) in 1997. That year it signed Trudeau to an eight-year contract assuring him of 0.75% of annual sales, but the company terminated the agreement (and Trudeau) a year later.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Nutrition For Life International opened a distribution facility in Hawaii to serve its marketers in the Pacific Rim region. The following year the company bought Advanced Nutraceuticals and Bactolac Pharmaceutical to increase its position in the nutrition market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company restructured in 2000, forming a holding company named Advanced Nutraceuticals with Nutrition For Life International and Bactolac becoming subsidiaries. The next year, Advanced Nutraceuticals sold Nutrition For Life International and formed a new subsidiary, ANI Pharmaceuticals. Advanced Nutraceuticals sold ANI Pharmaceuticals in 2004 for $3.4 million. Bactolac was the last business left standing, and its original founder Pailla Reddy took control of the company. In 2006 the company's name was changed to Bactolac Pharmaceutical and it was taken private.
