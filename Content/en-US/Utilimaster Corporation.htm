  <p>
   Utilimaster sells delivery and service vehicles to commercial vehicle dealers, leasing companies, and directly to end-users. It also markets its products directly to several national and fleet accounts and through a network of independent truck dealers in the US and, to a lesser extent, in Canada.

  <p>
   The company operates through its parent company's Delivery and Service Vehicles segment, which represented 38% of its sales in 2013. This segment's revenue decreased by 14% to $179 million in 2013 from $208 million in 2012 due to a decrease in aftermarket parts and field service sales. This was fueled by a dip in keyless entry system sales after the first half of 2012.

   Utilimaster partners with other companies to achieve growth in key markets. In 2013 the company formed an alliance with LandiRenzo to offer compressed natural gas (CNG) conversions on Isuzu NPR-HD Gas vehicles. LandiRenzo provides an alternative fuel technology with over 1.5 million systems sold annually.

   Also in 2013, Utilimaster entered the food truck market through its partnership with Mobi Munch, a preferred services provider for restaurant brands. Utilimaster is targeting a variety of end-user market segments with its new mobile kitchen product line, including independent owner-operators, high-end cuisine providers, and national chain restaurants.
