   Cambridge Mechatronics wants its technology to be the eyes and ears of entertainment devices. The company develops and licenses its proprietary form of "smart metal" technology, called shape memory alloy, to electronics manufacturers. The technology is used for auto focus and image stabilization functions in small form factor cameras such as those in smartphones. Also, with the development of its Digital Sound Projector chipset, the company was one of the pioneers in making a single loudspeaker panel (commonly called a "soundbar") capable of producing surround sound and 3D audio. Cambridge Mechatronics' audio technology is used in equipment from manufacturers such as

   Cambridge sometimes works with customers to develop its technologies. It worked with FoxConn, the China-based electronics manufacturer, for 18 months to develop its smart metal optical image stabilizer (OIS), and Foxconn became the first customer for the product in late 2014.

   Cambridge has found itself the partner of
   <company id="54088">
    TDK
   </company>
   , the giant electronic components supplier. TDK has acquired two Cambridge partners
   <company id="161792">
    InvenSense
   </company>
   and Hutchison Technology. Both companies make precision controlling mechanisms. On one hand, the change puts more of Cambridge's revenue in the hands of one partner. On the other hand, it could open Cambridge to more opportunities with TDK.
