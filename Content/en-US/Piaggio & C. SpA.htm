   The world listened when Piaggio said, "Scoot!" As Europe's #1 maker of two-wheel vehicles (scooters and motorcycles), the company has kept its signature Vespa model on the road for more than half a century. The Vespa became a star after whizzing Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn through Rome in the film
   <i>
    Roman Holiday
   </i>
   . Piaggio makes small to large-engine two-wheelers under such brands as Aprilia and Gilera (racing scooters), Piaggio (urban scooters), Moto Guzzi (motorcyles),  and Derbi (mopeds), as well as light commercial vans and trucks. Customers in Europe, primarily from Italy, account for about 60% of the company's sales. Piaggio has a growing presence in India, the Asia/Pacific region, and Americas, too.

   Piaggio SpA originated in 1884, when Rinaldo Piaggio expanded the family woodshop into a sawmill. Piaggio began making wooden fittings and furniture for ships, and by the turn of the century held a virtual monopoly on naval fittings along the northwest coast of Italy. More than 70 shipping lines used Piaggo's furniture and fittings to outfit their cabins and saloons.

  <p>
   In 1906 the company added sheet metal work to its skills and opened a factory in Finale Ligure to produce railway cars. The firm soon added cars, trucks, and trams to its product mix. During WWI Piaggio's factories also made motor boats and airplanes. Piaggio produced the MAS, an anti-submarine boat used to destroy the Austro-Hungarian submarine fleet.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war, Piaggio continued to make aircraft, including fighter planes and flying boats. As a consequence, the company's plants were heavily bombed during WWII. Founder Rinaldo Piaggio died in 1938, never witnessing the war's destruction of his life's work.

   Sons Armando and Enrico took control of the company after the war. Enrico developed the idea for the Vespa during the late 1940s when only one in 150 Italians owned a car. Piaggio saw the need for cheap transportation in Italy. The Vespa became a hit in Italy and an international star in the 1953 film,

   . The scooter business continued to thrive during the 1960s, with Piaggio selling its models in more than 100 countries. Enrico died in 1965 at age 60. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Umberto Agnelli, a member of the Agnelli family, owners of Italian carmaker

   . (Umberto later would became a managing director of Fiat.)

   Labor disputes dampened production at Piaggio in the 1970s, but the company remained profitable. During this time Piaggio acquired Gilera (motorcycles, Italy).

   The 1980s were hard-hitting for Piaggio. The Vespa never caught on in the US, and in 1982 the company ceased exports there. Japanese competition and the Europeans' growing preference for cars stalled Piaggio. Giorgio Brazzelli took over as managing director in 1984. He cut costs and diversified the company into automotive components, industrial robots, and similar ventures. He also expanded the company's international operations through joint ventures with foreign companies such as Kolbenschmid (engine components, Germany).
  </p>

   The company continued to suffer from a shrinking scooter market. In 1993 Piaggio lost $60 million, and 29-year-old Giovanni Agnelli (Umberto's son) became chairman. Educated in the US, Agnelli refocused the company on its core product -- motor scooters. He sold unprofitable automotive component businesses and spent the money on new model development. By 1996 scooter sales had quadrupled in Italy and doubled across Europe, with Piaggio capturing 50% of the market. Agnelli died in 1997, and control of the company was scattered among several heirs. With no one willing to take the helm, they sold 80% of Piaggio to a unit of Germany's

   and 10% to investment group Texas Pacific Group (now
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   ). The Agnelli family retained a 10% stake.

  <p>
   In 1998 Piaggio scooters also made a return to the US after failure to meet

   standards forced them out in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Piaggio announced it would set up a holding company in India to manage various ventures there, including Piaggio Greaves (three-wheelers) and the stake it bought in Scooters India Ltd. (a government-owned scooter maker). Piaggio Vehicles Private Limited was based in Maharashtra.
