   Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA wants to help us all stand up straight and proud. It is the lead business in
   <company id="10981">
    Medtronic
   </company>
   's Spine division and one of the world's biggest makers of spinal implants. It products treat degenerative diseases, deformities, and spine and cranium trauma. It manufactures both implanted devices and biologic bone graft products. It also develops minimally invasive surgical techniques and computer-assisted surgical instruments. The company's sister business Kyphon develops medical devices to help with spinal fractures caused by osteoporosis and cancer.

  <p>
   Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA's Memphis headquarters serves as the global headquarters for Medtronic's Spine unit, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group division. Medtronic's spinal products are sold to customers worldwide.

  <p>
   The company's offerings include reconstructive systems (screws, rods, and connectors), artificial disks, and interspinous spacer implants. Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA has advanced its offerings beyond traditional spinal systems by offering implants that contain a recombinant human bone growth protein (called bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP). One such biologic fusion product, the Infuse Bone Graft system, treats degenerating discs, a common cause of lower back pain. The Spine division also offers surgical technologies for spinal procedures, including imaging and navigation systems and powered surgical instruments and tools.

  <p>
   Medtronic's Spine unit brought in about $3.1 billion in annual revenues in 2013, accounting for about 20% of total Medtronic sales. Revenues in the Spine division declined slightly (about 4%) in 2013 due to lower sales of the BMP and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) product lines, primarily attributed to demand, competition, pricing, and reimbursement challenges. The company believes that lower customer demand for the BMP Infuse system was prompted by negative press in a medical journal in 2011.

   Medtronic's operating divisions utilize a network of direct sales representatives in the US and a combination of direct and indirect representatives in international markets. Products are marketed to medical providers and facilities, as well as benefit companies and consumers.

   The Medtronic organization invests heavily in research and development programs to add new product offerings. It also pursues growth through development partnerships, licensing deals, and acquisitions. In 2013, for instance, the Medtronic Spine division released new adjusting screws for its CD Horizon Solera spinal system, which is used to correct complex spinal pathologies, as well as the CD Horizon Longitude II system, an upgraded version of its multi-level percutaneous fixation system for spinal stabilization.

  <p>
   Danek Medical was founded in 1983 to make orthopedic soft goods, including slings and braces. In 1985 it merged with Biotechnology, Inc., another orthopedics company, and two years later began making spinal implants. In 1990 the two companies became the Danek Group, which went public in 1991. Danek combined with French rival Sofamor in 1993, forming Sofamor Danek Group and significantly increasing its international presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company took a $50 million charge as a reserve against possible product liability damages in a number of pending lawsuits (some 3,100 were filed). Most of the suits involved the use of spinal screws in procedures for which they were not approved, but in 1997 and 1998 the FDA reclassified the screws and some suits were dismissed. Also in 1997 Sofamor Danek acquired MAN Ceramics, which makes transparent surgical implants. The following year the company acquired rights to Advanced Neuromodulation System's deep brain stimulation technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medtronic bought Sofamor Danek in early 1999 to expand its own neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery products. Shortly thereafter, Medtronic Sofamor Danek received FDA approval to market its INTER FIX spinal fusion device in the US and in 2000 the Reduced Profile version of the same product was accepted. The company also announced an alliance with
   <company id="90390">
    Smith &amp; Nephew
   </company>
   to develop image-guided surgical navigation systems using fluoroscopic technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent Medtronic expanded its spinal segment with the acquisition of orthopedic firm
   <company id="102321">
    Kyphon
   </company>
   for some $4.2 billion including debt in 2007. The acquisition added Kyphon's minimally invasive treatment for compression fractures known as balloon kyphoplasty to its product lineup. Kyphon also brought a complementary set of end users (older patients) and an expanded range of marketing targets (interventional radiologists in addition to orthopedic surgeons).
  </p>
  <p>
   Medtronic Sofamor Danek was part of Medtronic's Spinal business unit (also known as the Spinal and Biologics unit) until late 2009 when Medtronic grouped its operations into two broader categories: The Spine operations were grouped under the Restorative Therapies Group division, which also included Medtronic's Neuromodulation, Diabetes, and Surgical Technologies businesses.
