   A. Schulman might consider itself the master of all masterbatches. The company is a global leader in masterbatches, color, and additive concentrates that are combined with polymer resins by its customers to provide color to plastic products or enhance their performance in some way. A. Schulman also produces engineered plastics (compounded products used in making durable goods, appliances, and toys) and specialty powders (compounded resin powders used in rotationally molded products ranging from kayaks to gas tanks). It also serves as a distributor for polymer producers worldwide. Its high-performance plastic compounds and resins are used in packaging, consumer products, and automotive and industrial products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Globally, the company operates in six product families -- Custom Performance Colors, Engineered Composites, Masterbatch Solutions, Engineered Plastics, Specialty Powders, and Distribution Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered plastics (36% of fiscal 2016 -- August year end -- sales) combine high-performance polymer resins with various modifiers, reinforcements, additives and pigments, which result in a compound tailored to meet stringent customer specifications for durable applications. A. Schulman has been formulating compounds since the early 1950s to meet the needs of the plastics industry. Its blends include polyolefins, nylons, polyesters, elastomers, and PVC (polyvinyl chloride).
  </p>
  <p>
   Masterbatches (28%) are highly concentrated compounds combined with polymer resins by customers at the point-of-process to provide a material solution that meets needed performance criteria for a given product application. Its masterbatches are used as the key ingredient in a customer's product formula. Its additive compounds are used to provide a range of colors or to enhance performance properties, including antibacterial, heat-sensitive, fluorescent, and processing attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a distributor (Distribution Services, 11%) A. Schulman works with leading global polymer producers to assist in servicing market segments that are not easily accessible to these producers, or does not fit into these producers' core customer segment or supply chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty powders (10%) includes size reduction and resins for the injection, blow molding, and rotational molding markets. Specialty powders are used in applications such as powder coating, cosmetics, and the manufacture of additives. The rotational molding process is used to make plastic products including gas and water tanks and playground slides. The company provides other services such as grinding, or size reduction, of specialty powders for its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered Composites (8%) primarily serve customers in the mobility, industrial, building &amp; construction, sports &amp; leisure, consumer, electrical, energy &amp; safety industries where their high strength-to-weight ratio, dimensional stability, chemical resistance and high temperature performance is required.
  </p>
  <p>
   Custom Performance Colors (7%) offers powdered or pelletized color concentrates custom-designed to enhance thermoplastic resins.
  </p>
  <p>
   A. Schulman offers tolling services to customers in all product families except for distribution services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company organizes its core businesses into four main region-based segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), the US and Canada (USCAN), Latin America (LATAM), and Asia/Pacific (APAC). The company operates 54 manufacturing facilities worldwide.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's customers span a wide range of markets such as packaging, mobility, building and construction, electronics and electrical, agriculture, personal care and hygiene, sports, leisure and home, custom services and others. In fiscal 2016, the company's five largest customers accounted in the aggregate for less than 10% of total sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Net sales of the company have seen an upward trend in the past five years, except in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, A. Schulman's net sales increased by 4% compared to fiscal 2015 to $2.5 billion due to higher revenue from Engineered Composites and Engineered Plastics product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company incurred a net loss of about $357.12 million compared to net income of $26.62 million in fiscal 2015. The primary reason was  asset impairment charges driven by incurred goodwill impairment charges and an intangible asset impairment charge.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, A. Schulman's net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 146% (to $148.1 million) compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a change in inventories and accounts receivable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Acquisitions are a key part of the company's strategy for growth, as it continually seeks to expand its global footprint to maximize opportunities. It targets strategic acquisitions that will speed its entry into underserved markets. A. Schulman also looks to new product development to drive growth, and is focusing on higher margin applications. In its engineered plastics business, it seeks to reduce its North American auto capacity and focus on its most profitable lines of business. It also wants to continue development of sustainable "green" products. To counteract the global economic slump, the company has been cutting back on capacity and using the assets of its global operations effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recent acquisitions have strengthened the company's core businesses serving its custom performance colors, masterbatch solutions, engineered plastics and specialty powders customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   A. Schulman focuses its organic growth strategy on increasing the company's ability to leverage new and existing products into new geographic markets, further explore adjacent markets and improve profitability. Creating new and collaborative innovation models is key to the growth strategy. As part of this push, the company has introduced three new global innovation centers in Germany, Mexico and the US (Akron, Ohio) to help align the company's global technology and product development efforts with the current requirements and emerging needs of its customers and end-markets. In 2015 the company also expanded its manufacturing facility in Dongguan, China to accommodate an increase in demand in masterbatch solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also sells underperforming units. In fiscal 2016 A. Schulman approved plans to close three manufacturing facilities in Evansville, Indiana and consolidate production into other existing facilities in the area. In fiscal 2015 the company announced seven restructuring actions to further optimize its back-office and support functions as well as consolidate its manufacturing footprint.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2015 A. Schulman acquired HGGC Citadel Plastics Holdings for $801.6 million. Citadel is a plastics materials science business that produces engineered composites and engineered plastics for specialty product applications spanning multiple industries including transportation, industrial &amp; construction, consumer, electrical, energy and healthcare &amp; safety. The acquisition expands the company's presence substantially, especially in the North America engineered plastics markets, as well as balancing its global geographic footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition enhances the Company's existing portfolio and presents attractive expansion opportunities in other fast-growing sectors such as aerospace, medical, LED lighting and oil &amp; gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   To complement its existing capabilities and expand its product offerings and geographic reach in target markets, in 2014 the company acquired control of the Specialty Plastics business segment from US-based
   <company id="10558">
    Ferro Corporation
   </company>
   for $91 million, and Australia-based marketbatch maker Compco for $6.7 million. The Perrite acquisition is expected to increase revenues in A. Schulman's APAC segment by 35% and will double the size of the company's existing engineered plastics business in the region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Alex Schulman founded A. Schulman in 1928 as a rubber brokerage. In 1937 he hired William Zekan as an office boy after meeting the 18-year-old caddie on a golf course. With rubber in short supply during WWII, A. Schulman began using scrap plastic. Zekan was appointed head of the firm's New York sales office in 1947 and became #2 in the company in 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   A. Schulman abandoned the scrap market in the 1950s to focus on plastic compounds. Schulman died in 1962 and Zekan headed the company, taking it public in 1972. A. Schulman set up a joint venture in 1988 with Mitsubishi to supply plastic compounds to Honda, Nissan, and Toyota.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zekan died in 1991 and was replaced by company veteran Terry Haines. He expanded A. Schulman through acquisitions that included Diffusion Plastique from Atochem (subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, now called
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   ) in 1991 and Exxon's ComAlloy International in 1994. The next year the company bought a polymer unit from
   <company id="40244">
    J. M. Huber
   </company>
   and polypropylene interests from
   <company id="16569">
    Eastman Chemical
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A. Schulman opened its first plant in Asia in 1997. The next year it cut production to compensate for an industry slowdown. The company also bought an Italy-based distributor and agreed to supply all of the color concentrate for Procter &amp; Gamble's molded white containers. In 1999 A. Schulman spent $35 million to renovate manufacturing facilities. It joined
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   that year to make bumper fascias and other moldings for cars such as the Dodge Neon.
  </p>
  <p>
   As pricing pressures continued in 2000, A. Schulman moved to cut its costs by closing a number of sales offices and its plant in Akron, Ohio. The company's 2001 sales were hurt by the weakening economy, especially in the US, where capacity utilization was down by 5%. Although A. Schulman's sales remained flat in 2002, the company managed to boost profits mostly through a workforce reduction and the closing of more costly facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Haines and other members of management came under fire with investors' criticism that began in 2007, and Haines stepped down early in 2008. He was replaced by director Joseph Gingo, a former
   <company id="10668">
    Goodyear
   </company>
   executive. Barington Capital Group had demanded the right to name a director in 2007. Its success spurred another investor group, Ramius Capital, to offer up its own set of directors for A. Schulman's early-2008 elections. Ramius, like Barington, was eager to get Schulman to consider a sale or merger of the company, or, at the very least, a change in company strategy that had led to continually disappointing results. Ultimately, Ramius won the right to nominate candidates for the board.
  </p>
  <p>
   Encouraged by the investors and their representative board members, the company idled one manufacturing facility and sold another in 2008; it also brought in
   <company id="41649">
    UBS
   </company>
   to explore possibilities of selling part or all of the company. (An offer from an unidentified buyer was turned down in mid-2008.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After failing to find a manufacturing partner for its Invision line of plastic sheet products, it discontinued the line and shut down the operation in 2009. The next year, it moved several of its operations from its Crumlin, South Wales, operation to larger facilities and eliminated 30 jobs in a move to improve efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company acquired McCann Color, an Ohio-based producer of color concentrates. The deal, for about $10 million in cash, bolstered A. Schulman's existing master batch manufacturing and product development facilities in Akron, Ohio, and San Luis Potosí, Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also acquired Houston-based ICO in a deal that valued the plastics maker at $190 million. The deal expanded A. Schulman's global presence and its masterbatch and molding businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company completed its acquisition of Brazilian plastics maker Mash Compostos Plásticos in 2011. Mash Compostos is a São Paulo-based producer of additives and engineered plastics compounds. That year it extended its presence in South America by agreeing to acquire a 51% interest in a joint venture with Argentina-based Surplast. Surplast makes rotational molding products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To broaden its stance as a global manfacturer of engineered plastics in niche markets, the company agreed in 2012 to form a joint venture with Saudi Arabia-based National Petrochemical Industrial Company, a subsidiary of Alujain Corp. The 50-50 joint venture is expected to be called NATPET-Schulman Engineering Plastic Compounds and will produce and market polypropylene compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in 2013 included Network Polymers, Inc., a US-based niche engineered plastics compounding business, for $49.5 million; Perrite Group, a thermoplastics manufacturing business with operations in Malaysia, the United Kingdom and France. for $51.3 million, net of cash. Perrite has manufactured and distributed thermoplastic compounds for the electrical, automotive and industrial markets for more than 35 years, offering a broad portfolio of standard and custom compounded polymer products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it sold its Australia-based rotational compounding business and further restructured in its EMEA region, due to the weak economic climate in Europe. This move will allow their APAC team to focus on their considerable opportunities in profitable growth markets and seek out further strategic acquisitions in the region, including in Australia.
