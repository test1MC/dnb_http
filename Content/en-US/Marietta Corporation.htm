   Marietta is known for its high performance skin and hair care product development and manufacturing, as well as bar soap-making; bottle and tube filling for both retail and sample sizes; packet manufacturing and affixing; and bulk compounding.
  </p>
  <p>
   has grown its business in recent years by expanding its slate of partnerships with large consumer products companies, including
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41772">

  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also focused on eco-friendly initiatives. Some of its efforts have included using wind-generated electricity for manufacturing processes, recycled materials and soy-based inks in packaging, and sourcing supplies from local vendors (which reduces transportation emissions). It follows the industry's Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs).

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1976 by New York cabbage farmer Manny Siegle after a trip to Europe during which he received shampoo packets in hotels. He returned to the US and decided to go into the shampoo business, using his sauerkraut packaging equipment. The company's first job was packaging shampoo for a hotel in Salt Lake City. Just two years later the company began packaging personal-care products for Holiday Inn. Through the years it added other contracts with major hotels, including Howard Johnson, Radisson, and Sheraton. In 1989 Marietta acquired manufacturer American Soap Co. and began making some of its own soaps.

   In 1995 former Marietta CFO Thomas Blair was sentenced to a year in federal prison for embezzling over $400,000 in 1991. Blair cooperated in an investigation that led to Nadolski's conviction on charges that he manipulated information to inflate Marietta's stock prices. Nadolski was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and fined $50,000 for securities fraud. In 1996 the company merged with BFMA Holding, a shell owned by Barry Florescue, and went private again. The firm did not change its name, and Florescue became Marietta's chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Marietta signed a seven-year contract with
   <company id="54830">
    Cendant Corp.
   </company>
   to supply amenities to Cendant's hotel holdings. In 2002 Marietta purchased the 430,000 square-foot former Rubbermaid plant in Cortland (plus machinery and equipment to make soap) for about $14 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004 parent company BFMA sold itself and subsidiary Marietta to Ares Management LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marietta acquired Packaging Advantage Corp. (PAC) in late 2005. The purchase added to the company's US capabilities, with manufacturing operations in California, Illinois, Mississippi, and New York.
