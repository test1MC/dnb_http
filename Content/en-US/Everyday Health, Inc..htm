   The company raised $100.1 million through its initial public offering, less than its $115 million target. It intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayment, and investments.

   Primary advertisers include pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, over-the-counter medical product providers, and health care providers such as doctors and dentists. Advertising is sold though the company's direct sales force located in major cities across the country.

  <p>
   Advertising and sponsorship revenues increased 14.3% to $110.0 million in fiscal 2012, up from $96.2 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was attributable to an increase in the number of advertisers that marketed their products and the continued expansion of the company's advertising solutions. The increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was also driven by an increase in revenue per advertiser due to expanded relationships with existing advertisers.

   In fiscal 2012 the company acquired EQAL, a media company that creates and manages digital media properties for consumer brands and celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Bethenny Frankel, and Lauren Conrad. Everyday Health is using the deal to diversify its content, further expanding its core lifestyle offerings. It is particularly attracted to EQAL's expertise in branded digital content, scripted video, social marketing, and celebrity influence.  EQAL will be integrated into Everyday Health's Lifestyle Division.
