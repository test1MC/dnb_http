   Like a reed in a stream, Grasshopper, sometimes the flexible withstand pressure better than the rigid. That's certainly a concept that Omega Flex can get behind: The company makes corrugated metal and flexible tubular and braided metal (stainless steel, bronze) hoses and reinforcements for construction and industrial customers to use in liquid and gas transportation. Its products are designed to deal with high pressure, motion, extreme temperatures, harsh liquids or gases, and abrasion. Other applications include cryogenics and propane and natural gas installations. The estate of John Reed and his son, chairman Stewart Reed, own a majority of Omega Flex, which was spun off from

   in 2005.

  <p>
   Omega Flex's revenues have been rising steadily for the past few years. The flexible metallic hose maker reported sales of $85.2 million in 2014, making it the company's best year yet. That increase was due both to higher demand for its products and a rise in prices (intended to offset higher raw material costs). Net income rose 34% over the same period to $13.5 million, primarily due to the higher net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also increased, rising 20% to $2.4 million.

  <p>
   The company's driving strategy for growth is to continue to innovate, creating new products to meet new demands. For example, in 2014 it introduced the AutoSnap product, which is the only corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) fitting requiring no assembly before installation.
