   DRS Technologies offers mission-critical products and services that support military forces, intelligence agencies, and prime contractors. It has leading market positions in air combat training systems, combat display workstations, electronic sensors, environmental controls, flight recorders, rugged computers, communications systems, thermal imaging devices, and logistics support services. Most of its revenue is derived from the US government, primarily the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   . DRS is a subsidiary of Italy's
   <company id="92969">
    Leonardo - Finmeccanica
   </company>
   and functions as part of its Defense and Security Electronics division.

  <p>
   DRS's business is divided into several operating groups each with a specific focus. Its Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) group provides electro-optical infrared imaging technology and components for applications on land, in the air, or on the water. Its Tactical Systems group provides logistics support, subsystem integration, and connectivity technologies that help military forces preparing for complex missions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Power and Environmental Systems group supplies environmental controls and power generation, conversion, and distribution systems not only for various military uses but for the energy industry, with applications in utility power generation, mobile power and environmental control, and electric motors and generators. Meanwhile, its C3 &amp; Aviation group makes airborne flight recorders, radar and surveillance systems for land and sea, fixed and mobile towers used in border and perimeter security, and rugged servers for networking on the move.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the company's Maryland-based subsidiary DRS Defense Solutions consists of a number of business units that develop advanced electronic systems.

  <p>
   With deep pockets and a big name, Leonardo - Finmeccanica in turn helps to extend DRS's reach overseas to serve international allied forces. Leonardo - Finmeccanica typically ranks within the top 10 global players in aerospace/defense and security. From its base near Washington, DC, the unit has operations in more than 20 US states, Germany, Canada, and the UK.

  <p>
   Defense and Security Electronics is the largest of Leonardo - Finmeccanica's divisions in terms of revenue. With DRS in its arenal, this division contributed positively toward Leonardo - Finmeccanica's improvements in revenues recent fiscal years in large part due to the US's ongoing military presence in areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The US defense market often awards contracts to DRS for products and services that help with force readiness.

   DRS has a number of contracts with agencies with in the US Department of Defense as well as with companies that supply the DOD. IN 2014, DR won a contract to provide logistics support to the US Air Force's Halvorsen 25K Aircraft Cargo Loaders around the globe. The award for DRS's Sustainment Systems is for a 10-year contract valued at more than $175 million. The contract is like many of DRS's in that it is indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ). DRS's Communications and Homeland Security business group was selected to provide US Army battlefield operations with satellite and terrestrial communications.

   Former
   <company id="10915">
    Loral
   </company>
   engineers Leonard Newman and David Gross founded Diagnostic/Retrieval Systems (DRS) in 1968. (Newman died in 1998 and Gross has retired.) DRS pioneered passive sonar submarine-detection systems in 1969, and the company went public in 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contract delays and cost overruns on fixed-price contracts led to losses in the early 1990s. DRS diversified during this time, buying Technology Applications &amp; Service (computer displays), CMC Technology (video recorders), and Ahead Technology (magnetic head products used in computer disk drives).
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS's 1995 revenues increased from the sale of new commercial products. During 1996 and 1997 DRS continued to pursue nonmilitary acquisitions, including Mag-Head Engineering (audio recorder heads) and two commercial lines from International Tapetronics. Its defense-related acquisitions included Pacific Technologies, a software provider to the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   (1996), and the Applied Systems Division of
   <company id="58101">
    Spar Aerospace
   </company>
   (1997). Also in 1997 the company changed its name to DRS Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 DRS bought two electro-optical firms from defense contractor
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   for $90 million, and the next year it expanded its offerings of ruggedized computers and peripherals for the military by acquiring
   <l1>
    NAI Technologies
   </l1>
   . The company sold its profit-draining magnetic tape head businesses in 2000. Also that year investment firm
   <company id="113412">
    Veritas Capital
   </company>
   made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire DRS.
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS acquired
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   's Electronic Systems business for about $70 million in 2001. That December the company issued an additional 3 million shares of common stock (about 25% of all outstanding shares) in order to fund expansion and to pay down existing debt. The next year DRS bought
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton
   </company>
   's Navy Controls (electrical power distribution and control systems for the US Navy) division for $92 million in cash. Later in 2002 the company bought
   <company id="51451">
    Paravant
   </company>
   , a maker of ruggedized computers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 DRS acquired
   <company id="13886">
    Kaman
   </company>
   's Electromagnetics Development Center (now DRS Power Technology). Later that year DRS picked up defense electronics rival
   <company id="104837">
    Integrated Defense Technologies
   </company>
   for about $375 million in cash and stock and the assumption of $175 million in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS rejected a $42 a share buyout offer in 2004 from
   <company id="89493">
    L-3 Communications
   </company>
   . The company stated that the deal was not in the best interest of shareholders, considering DRS's growth prospects. Late in the year DRS acquired assets from Night Vision Equipment Co. and Electro Optics.
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS sold its DRS Broadcast Technology and DRS Weather Systems units to Veritas Capital Fund II in 2005. That year DRS added to its core business by acquiring
   <company id="102615">
    Codem Systems
   </company>
   , a maker of signals intelligence systems, antenna control systems, and network interface modules. DRS also acquired WalkAbout Computers, a maker of rugged computers and mobile docking stations, for an undisclosed amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its biggest purchase to date, DRS acquired
   <company id="13312">
    Engineered Support Systems
   </company>
   (military electronics and logistics) in a deal worth nearly $2 billion in January 2006; the acquisition helped increase fiscal 2007 sales over those of 2006 by more than 60%. The acquisition was made part of DRS's newest operating segment: Sustainment Systems. Also in 2007 the company acquired
   <company id="104837">
    Integrated Defense Technologies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS saw its sales and profits take off after dumping the majority of its disk drives business and expanding its core business: defense contracts. In late 2001 DRS issued an additional 3 million shares of common stock (almost 25% of all outstanding shares) to provide funds for expansion and to pay down existing debt. The company then embarked on a five-year acquisitions spree that bought nearly a dozen companies that complemented DRS's operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   DRS Technologies was acquired by Leonardo - Finmeccanica for $5.2 billion in October 2008. Leonardo - Finmeccanica was willing to assume about $1.6 billion in DRS debt in order to get a piece of the US defense market. DRS's strong position in the US market made it attractive for takeover.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 DRS followed up with an acquisition of its own. It bought
   <company id="125587">
    Soneticom
   </company>
   and its precision geo-location systems and communications products, along with customers in both the government and commercial sectors.
