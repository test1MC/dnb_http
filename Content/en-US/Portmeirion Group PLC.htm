The company also distributes glassware, cutlery, cookware, and decorative household items under the Spode, Royal Worcester, and Pimpernel brands. Products are made locally and distributed in the UK and US directly to retailers and through distributors in 60 other countries. Portmeirion also operates a US subsidiary and Canadian joint venture.
