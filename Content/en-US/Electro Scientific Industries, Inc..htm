   Electro Scientific Industries (ESI) has a laser focus locked on lasers. Lasers that help its customers make and test micron- and submicron-sized electronics that go into bigger electronics. The company's laser-based fabrication equipment is used for ultra-fine work in semiconductors, interconnect devices, and other microtechnology components as well as thin films and glass for touch screens. Its products provide yield improvement, optical inspection, wafer scribing, high-capacity test and inspection, and more. ESI's customers include
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   , which accounts for about 15% of sales. Most sales come from customers in Asia.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ESI's business is divided into three product types. Its largest, interconnect and microfabrication (at about two-thirds of sales), provides hole drilling in components such as circuit layers and circuit boards, as well as etching, routing, nano-structuring, and more in materials ranging from glass to metal, paint, plastic, and ceramics. Its semiconductor group, about 20% of sales, offers equipment for use on silicon and LED wafer substrates. Its remaining business is in equipment that performs functions such as loading, testing, and sorting of passive components such as capacitor arrays, inductors, and resistors.

  <p>
   With 75% of its business in Asia, Portland, Oregon-based ESI has a production facility in Singapore to be nearer its customers and to reduce costs. The company also has research and development offices in Canada, China, France, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The Americas account for 18% of sales and Europe, 7%.

   In 2014 (ended March), ESI's top 10 customers accounted for more than 40% of sales. Sales to Apple, the company's biggest customer, dropped steeply to $27 million, 15% of revenue, in 2014, from $67 million, 31% of revenue, in 2013. Other customers include

    Kyocera

  <p>
   ESI's revenue continued a four-year slide in 2014 coming in at $181 million, 16% lower than the $217 million posted in 2013. The company's biggest customer, Apple, reduced orders of ESI's advanced microfabrication products because of a lack of new designs and meeting capacity through upgrades. Components Group orders decreased because of over capacity. However, sales doubled in the Semiconductor Systems business and accounted for about 20% of sales, up from about 9% the year before. Service revenues also rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reduced its loss to about $38 million in 2014 from nearly $55 million in 2013. In 2014 ESI had lower operating expenses, lower restructuring costs and no legal settlement costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations plunged to negative $19 million in 2014 from positive $17 million in 2013, which was attributed to the net loss and $10 million of cash outflows from working capital.

  <p>
   ESI aims to extend its expertise in laser machining tiny devices to new markets that are several steps beyond its traditional businesses by developing platforms with common elements that can be customized for specific applications. New markets in ESI's sights include advanced technologies for medical, military, automotive, and security uses. ESI also wants to extend the uses of its laser microfabrication products to the making of consumer electronics such as smart phones. In 2014, the company offered new capabilities for in-line inspection of parts with real-time tailored laser machining, ultrafast laser scribing of thin films on semiconductor wafers and singulation of next generation strengthened cover glass for touch screens.
  </p>
  <p>
   ESI has designed products to carry out its strategy. One such technology, introduced in 2014, is the ÂµFlex Series multiaxis precision laser micromachining platform. It offers laser applications for consumer electronics, medical devices, automotive components, and other industries.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have been ESI's method of building out its product line in recent years. In September 2014, it announced it would acquire Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology, which will expand its product offering and extend its reach into China. Topwin develops mid-range laser technology products for the consumer electronics industry in patterning of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass and films, PCB cutting, precision welding, and a variety of marking and cutting applications. The acquisition could give ESI a leg up in China since Topwin's products are designed for the Chinese market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2013 ESI bought a big boost for its semiconductor business with the purchase of the Semiconductor Systems portion of the GSI Group (later renamed
   <company id="44525">
    Novanta
   </company>
   ). The acquisition provided ESI with industry-leading wafer marking, wafer trimming, and circuit trimming laser systems that broadened its product portfolio.

  <p>
   Electro Scientific Industries (ESI) was founded in 1944 by former vice chairman Douglas Strain, his father Clayton, and two classmates. It was incorporated in 1949. ESI initially produced high-precision resistance measurement instruments and reference standards. In 1970 it introduced laser systems for trimming resistors. Ten years later ESI developed memory repair laser systems. The company purchased capacitor test equipment expert Palomar Systems in 1982 and went public the next year. In 1991 it formed a division with the acquisition of Intelledex Vision Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mechanical Technology executive Donald VanLuvanee took over as CEO in 1992. ESI acquired companies in markets where it prospered. In 1994 it bought its top laser trimming competitor, Chicago Laser Systems. The next year the company purchased XRL, its key memory repair rival.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued to drive expansion of ESI's product line throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The company also made several changes to its strategy and product mix as markets and competition shifted.
