   Apotex strives to be at the apex of the Canadian generics industry. The company is one of Canada's leading generic drugmakers, producing more than 300 generic drugs in thousands of dosages and formulations. Its product line includes generic equivalents of
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   's Singulair (asthma),
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's Lipitor (high blood pressure), and
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   's Zyprexa (schizophrenia). Founded in 1974, Apotex markets its drugs throughout Canada and the US, as well as in about 115 other countries in the Asia/Pacific region, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   Apotex conducts most of its business in North America, but it is expanding its global presence by establishing subsidiaries, joint ventures, partnerships, and licensing agreements. It has established a presence in countries including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, and Turkey, and it is focused on expanding in additional European countries. It opened an office in Saudi Arabia in 2012 to meet the growing need for generic medications in the Middle East.

  <p>
   Apotex operates across a full range of generic prescription pharmaceutical services, including manufacturing of active ingredients and final drug products; packaging; marketing and distribution; and the research and development of new products. Outside of generic pharmaceuticals, Apotex has affiliates and subsidiaries that make over-the-counter (OTC) and private label pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and disposable medical supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   One subsidiary, ApoPharma, develops branded prescription drugs; its first proprietary drug, Ferriprox, is sold in more than 50 countries to treat high iron levels in patients with thalassemia (a genetic blood disorder). Another Apotex subsidiary,
   <company id="103201">
    Cangene
   </company>
   , develops and manufactures plasma products.

  <p>
   Apotex reports global annual revenues of more than $1 billion each year.

  <p>
   Apotex markets its products through a direct sales force in North America. In other regions, the company uses a combination of direct sales, partnerships, and independent distributors to promote its offerings. In addition to its own formulations, Apotex sells drugs made by other manufacturers through licensing and marketing agreements.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The development of new generic formulations is key to Apotex's growth strategy and the company annually reinvests about 20% of its revenue in research and development. Some of its generic drug development programs are conducted through partnerships with other drugmakers. In addition, Apotex performs research on new chemical entities through its ApoPharma subsidiary, which is focused on the clinical areas of neurodegenerative disease, hematology, and psoriasis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2010, the company sold about 40 (or nearly 15%) of its pharmaceutical products to AA Pharma. The sale of the drugs is part of Apotex's overall strategy of continually evaluating its portfolio and selling those medications it thinks could be better marketed by another pharmaceutical company. The firm also occasionally licenses out compounds to other drugmakers. In 2012 the firm sold 10 more of its older products to AA Pharma, citing increased costs and lower demand for the drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another Apotex strategy is pursuing early to market opportunities, including the launch of first-to-file generics. Making the first generic version of another company's product can be a risky business, however, and Apotex must regularly incur litigation expenses (in addition to substantial R&amp;D expenses) as it tries to gain approval for products ahead of the branded versions' patent expiration.
