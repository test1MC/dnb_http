   UFP caters to the main markets of medical (41% of net sales), automotive (19%), consumer (12%), electronics (10%), aerospace and defense (9%), and industrial (8%). Its top 10 customers represented nearly 26% of its total sales in 2015.

  <p>
   UFP's revenues remained flat from 2013 to 2015. The flat revenue for 2015 was fueled by sales decreases to customers in the electronics (17%), industrial (17%), and aerospace and defense (13%) markets. This was offset by a sales spike to customers in the medical market (15%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Like its revenues, UFP's net income remained consistent form 2014 to 2015, hovering around the the $7.5 million mark for both years. In addition, UFP's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after declining in 2015, cash flow surged by 18% during 2015.

  <p>
   UFP aims to jump-start its static balance sheet by adding capacity in order to enhance operate inefficiencies in its manufacturing plants. In 2015 it announced plans to cease operations at its Raritan, New Jersey, plant and consolidate operations into its Newburyport, Massachusetts, facility and other UFP facilities. The move was in response to a continued decline in business at its Raritan facility and the recent purchase of a 137,000-sq.-ft. facility in Newburyport.
