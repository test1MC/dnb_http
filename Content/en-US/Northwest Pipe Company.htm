   Northwest Pipe goes with the flow. It makes welded-steel water transmission lines that form the circulatory systems of water suppliers. Its transmission pipes are made to transport water under pressure and sold primarily to water utilities. Northwest Pipe also makes tubular products from 1.5 inches to 16 inches in diameter for the construction, agriculture, and energy markets. The Water Transmission Group is a top supplier of high pressure, highly engineered steel pipe products. The Tubular Products Group operates three technologically-advanced Electric Resistance Weld (ERW) mill facilities. The Fabricated Products segment fabricates pressure vessels, tanks, steel pipe, and miscellaneous metals products.

  <p>
   The company's Water Transmission division has manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, Texas, and West Virginia and in Mexico, and its Tubular Products unit has manufacturing sites in three US locations.

  <p>
   Northwest Pipe operates through two segments: Water Transmission (which makes and markets large diameter, high-pressure steel pipe for water transmission and which are sold primarily to public water agencies); and Tubular Products (which manufactures and markets smaller diameter, ERW steel pipe for use in a wide range of applications, including energy, construction, agricultural, and industrial systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company manufactures water infrastructure steel pipe products through its Water Transmission Group, which in 2014 and 2013, generated 59% and 63% of total revenues, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Northwest Pipe markets its water infrastructure and tubular products products through an in-house sales force (a network of direct sales personnel in the US and Canada). It focuses its marketing on quality, customer service, and customer relationships. Most of the unit's products are sold to distributors, although some are sold to OEMs.
  </p>
  <p>
   It markets Tubular Products through a direct sales force network and sales agents throughout the US, Canada, and Mexico. One Tubular Products customer accounted for 10% of Northwest Pipe's 2014 net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   One customer accounted for 16% and another customer accounted for 10% of total net sales from continuing operations (Water Transmission).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company recorded declining trend in net revenues over the last three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Northwest Pipe's net revenues decreased by 15% due to the disposal of its Oil Country Tubular Goods business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss increased by a whopping 1,188% compared to 2013 due to the  impairment of Tubular Products goodwill and a loss from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Northwest Pipe's cash from operating activities increased by 74% due to changes in trade and other receivables, net.

  <p>
   Northwest Pipe works closely with public water agencies, contractors, and engineering firms, usually years in advance of the projects for which it bids. Its Water Transmission unit is therefore able to evaluate planned projects at early stages and promote the specifications and advantages of its own systems. The company usually submits its bids to installation contractors, who include its bids in their proposals to public water agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sees opportunities to expand in other segments such as structural pipe, industrial, and the water transmission business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core assets, in 2014 Northwest Pipe sold its Oil Country Tubular Goods business to Centric Pipe, LLC, an affiliate of Dallas-based Oil Country Tubular Goods supplier SB International, Inc., for $42.7 million.

  <p>
   In 2014 Northwest Pipe acquired Permalok Corporation, a fabricator of steel piping utilizing the Permalok patented interlocking pipe joining system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Permalok's interlocking pipe joining system complements and expands Northwest Pipe offerings by providing alternate joint solutions to their already comprehensive product line. It also strengthens Northwest Pipe's Water Transmission business with Permalok's rolled and welded steel pipe products currently being used in trenchless applications.

  <p>
   In 2012 Northwest Pipe announced plans to expand its Saginaw, Texas manufacturing facility. The expansion enables the company to better serve the needs of anticipated large water projects in the area. Completion of the Saginaw expansion will allow the company to leverage its proximity to Tarrant Regional Water District's planned Integrated Pipeline Project and give it expanded capabilities to serve additional water projects in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Northwest Pipe was founded in 1966.
