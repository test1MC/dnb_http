  <p>
   ATS has enjoyed significant growth over the years, with revenues surging 37% from 2014 to 2015. Its net income, however, declined by 11% from 2014 to 2015 mostly due to higher operating costs and expenses associated with acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2015 was driven by an 80% increase in consumer products and electronics sales and increases from life sciences (36%), transportation (23%), and energy (36%). Sales in Europe skyrocketed by 72% in 2015, while North America experienced an increase of 37%. Most of this growth across all segments was fueled by additional revenues from a previous acquisition.

  <p>
   ATS achieved revenue milestones for 2015 primarily through the help of acquisitions. In 2014 the company completed the acquisition of engineering services firm Process Automation Solutions (PA). PA expanded ATS' markets and enhanced its customer penetration and capabilities.
