   TAMKO seeks to become a vertically-integrated operation, producing as many of its raw materials as possible for its manufacturing plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   It regularly rolls out new products and services, as well. In 2014 TAMKO introduced the QuickVent continuous ridge vent and EverGrain and Envision Composite Decking, following the 2013 debut of the expanded Heritage series of laminated asphalt shingles. In recent years TAMKO has rolled out new apps to better serve its mobile customers. In 2014 it launched the TAMKO Pro App for TAMKO Pro Certified Contractors and in 2012 the company made its interactive Shingle Styles app available on iPads.
