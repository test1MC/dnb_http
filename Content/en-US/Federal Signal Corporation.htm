   Federal Signal likes to believe it keeps people, property, and the environment safe. Through segments that include environmental solutions, and safety and security systems, the company designs and manufactures products for municipal, governmental, industrial, and commercial customers. Offerings include street sweepers, vacuum trucks, and water blasters for environmental cleanup; emergency communications and public warning systems for public safety. Federal Signal caters primarily to the US market. It sold its Fire Rescue Group segment throughout late 2015 and early 2016.

   Federal Signal divides its operations across two segments. Environmental solutions accounts for 70% of revenue and distributes through dealer networks and a direct sales staff. The environmental solutions dealer channel serves the municipal market, while the direct sales channel addresses the industrial, utility, and construction markets.

   The safety &amp; security systems segment, 30% of revenue, sells to industrial customers, municipal, and governmental customers through wholesalers and distributors.

  <p>
   Federal Signal's net sales rose declined 16% from from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to the divestiture of its Fire Rescue Group operations. The company also experienced declines in safety &amp; security systems sales due to reduced orders for outdoor warning systems. Also environmental solutions revenue decreased in 2015 due to reductions in orders for vacuum trucks, street sweepers, and sewer cleaners.

  <p>
   To focus on its remaining two segments, Federal Signal sold its Fire Rescue Group business throughout late 2015 and 2016. The segment served such customers as fire departments, industrial fire services, electric utilities, and maintenance rental companies.
