  <p>
   Knoll has built its business making and marketing office systems and specialty furniture, which generate about two-thirds of sales. In recent years, it has extended its reach into producing seating, files, storage, casegoods, and other specialty businesses. It is also looking to grw its international business. The move to diversify is intended to reduce Knoll's dependence on peddling office systems in North America and particularly the US.

  <p>
   German immigrant Hans Knoll founded Knoll in 1938 (starting in a single room on Manhattan's East Side that he dubbed Factory No. 1) on the premise that modern buildings would require modern furniture. Knoll and his wife, Florence, an architect, sought out noted architects to design the company's products: Eero Saarinen worked for Knoll, and the company later gained the rights to use designs by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. Knoll moved into textiles in 1947, the same time Hans decided to move manufacturing from New York City. He chose eastern Pennsylvania because of its large population of German immigrants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hans died in a car crash in 1955; his widow worked at Knoll for another decade. The company enjoyed the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s, but it ran into trouble when commercial construction dried up in the 1970s. General Felt acquired Knoll in the early 1980s, took it public in 1983, took it private again in 1986, and sold it to Westinghouse in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Knoll struggled during the early 1990s but eventually got back on track, redesigning its products, consolidating its manufacturing, and restructuring its management contracts. By the time Westinghouse sold Knoll to its top managers and merchant banker Warburg Pincus in 1996, the economy had improved and the company was profitable again.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm went public in 1997 with John Lynch (who previously worked at Westinghouse) as CEO. Continuing its tradition of hiring high-profile architects, the next year Knoll unveiled a line of furniture created by Vietnam War Memorial architect Maya Lin.
  </p>
  <p>
   After settling a shareholder lawsuit to block the deal, Knoll returned to private ownership again in 1999 when Warburg Pincus and a Knoll management group bought the 40% of the company they didn't already own for nearly $500 million. COO Andrew Cogan replaced Lynch as CEO in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had a secondary public offering in 2006. Warburg no longer held an equity interest following the public offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the economy rebounding from a major recession, and with it a growth in demand for office furniture, Knoll kicked off 2012 with a pair of acquisitions. The company acquired FilzFelt, a Boston-based supplier of German-milled 100% wool designed felt and floor coverings and architectural products. The purchase boosted Knoll's high-margin specialty business. It also bought Richard Schultz Design, which designs and makes outdoor furniture for residential, hospitality, and office furniture markets.
