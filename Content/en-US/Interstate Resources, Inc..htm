   Interstate Resources is not a fancy name for the latest US Highway Bill, but a paperboard and packaging products manufacturer. The company's offerings include linerboard, kraft paper (for bags), and corrugated medium board and packaging for consumer products and retail displays. It also produces timber and wood chips, and burns the waste to fuel its plants; it sells the excess to the local power grid. Interstate Resources operates about a dozen plants and produces 350,000 tons of linerboard and 180,000 tons of medium board per year. Its corrugated converting and packaging operations have a total annual capacity of 4 billion sq. ft.

   Interstate Resources opened in 1939 as a single box plant in Glendale, New York. It has continued to grow organically through product research and development of sustainable products, and through business acquisitions (beginning in 1958), which boosted its capacity.
