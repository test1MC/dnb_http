   Lear doesn't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to manufacturing automotive seats. The company's Seating business, by far its most lucrative segment, is a leader in the global market for manufacturing car seat systems and their components. The company's Electrical segment produces automotive electronics, including the manufacture of wire harnesses, junction boxes, terminals and connectors, and body control modules. It operates from 240 facilities in 36 countries. Its largest customers include
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors

   ,
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   . Lear traces its history back to 1917 when it was founded in Detroit as American Metal Products.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Of its 240 total facilities, which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries, 98 are owned and 142 are leased with expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2053.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lear's operations are split between Seating (77% of sales) and Electrical (23%). The company stays on the cutting-edge of technology as part of its strategy to compete with its rivals. It makes its seating systems from the ground up, from the structural design to the assembly and all the parts in between.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products and brands include ProTec head restraints; leather (Aventino brand) and fabrics, some of which fall under its ECO brand; interior materials like Lear's SoyFoam Seating; adjusters; and mechanisms. Lear produces a modular design seating system so they can be used over multiple segments, thus minimizing investment costs. The company's seating systems are supported by its Lear-made electronics that power the adjusters and mechanisms, but also other features like power heating, ventilation, and massage.

  <p>
   Lear operates from some 240 facilities in 36 countries. The US generates about 23% of its total sales each year, while Mexico, Germany, and China contribute 15%, 11%, and 12%, respectively.

   The company serves the worldwide automotive and light truck market, which produced about 86.9 million vehicles in 2015.
   <company id="10640">

   <company id="10597">

   accounted for 20% and 23% of Lear's total revenues in 2015, respectively.
   <company id="41758">

   </company>
   also accounted for 10%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $18.2 billion in 2015. The historic growth was fueled by a 6% surge in Seating sales. This was attributed to positive impact from its acquisition of Eagle Ottawa, new business, and higher production volumes on key Lear platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lear's net income also surged 11% to $746 million in 2015 mainly due to the additional revenue coupled with increased provision for income taxes. Its net cash provided by operating activities increased by 37% in 2015.

  <p>
   Where Lear stays ahead of the game with its Electrical segment is by keeping an eye on the future of the automotive industry. The company cranks up the amperage on its competitors by manufacturing electrical distribution systems, not just for traditional powertrain vehicles but for hybrid and electric vehicles, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   It designs products that require less wiring and are therefore cheaper to make and are lighter in weight. Lear also follows the trends of customers who are showing an increased desire for additional functioning features in vehicles. Industry research indicates that electronic components account for about 35% of a car's total value. The company has exited non-core product lines, such as switches and tire pressure monitoring systems, opting instead to focus on an automobile's electrical distribution system, with wired, as well as wireless systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focused on profitably growing and improving the competitiveness of both its seating and electrical businesses. It has followed a balanced strategy to position Lear to deliver superior long-term shareholder value. This includes investing in its business to grow and improve its competitive position, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and returning cash to its shareholders. From 2010 to 2015, it invested approximately $600 million to open 29 new component facilities across both product segments to expand its component manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets and low-cost countries. It continues to pursue acquisitions that will complement its present product offerings, facilitate further diversification of its sales, increase component capabilities and provide new innovations for its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's product strategy is to develop standardized seat structures and mechanisms that can be adapted to multiple segments to minimize investment costs. By incorporating these key components into its fully assembled seat systems, we are able to provide a higher quality product at a lower total cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Lear announced plans to open a new automotive plant to produce seat covers in Gostivar, Macedonia. Serving all major European automotive manufacturers, Lear's new facility will emphasize leather and fabric cutting and sewing capability.

  <p>
   In early 2015 the company bought Canadian premium automotive leather supplier
   <company id="112652">
    Eagle Ottawa
   </company>
   in a deal valued at about $850 million. The additional revenue from Eagle Ottawa, along with other factors, allowed Lear to post record-setting revenues of $18.2 billion during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding to its software offerings, Lear in 2015 acquired intellectual property and technology from Autonet Mobile, a developer of software and devices for automotive applications. It also purchased Arada Systems, an automotive technology company that specializes in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Both acquisitions added software and hardware capabilities that will improve connectivity and communication features in vehicles, as well as provide growth opportunities for its Electrical segment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lear dates back to 1917, when American Metal Products began supplying seats to Detroit's fledgling car industry. The seat maker incorporated in 1928 and grew during the 1950s and 1960s by buying other auto parts makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siegler Heating, an industrial conglomerate with interests in the aerospace, auto parts, and manufacturing industries, was founded in 1950 as a maker of climate-control equipment. Entrepreneur John Brooks and a group of associates bought the company (renamed Siegler Corporation) in 1954 and led it through a series of acquisitions, including that of aerospace firm Lear in 1962. The company then became Lear Siegler.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lear Siegler acquired American Metal Products in 1966. Beset by project delays, the company's aerospace unit sputtered in the 1970s, but the seat business did well. By 1985 metal seat frames had become Lear Siegler's major auto parts revenue producer. Spurred by growing competition with Japanese carmakers, the company built a plant near a
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   factory in Michigan to allow for swift delivery of its car seats.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986
   <company id="42495">
    Forstmann Little
   </company>
   bought the financially troubled Lear Siegler and began selling off the parts. Two years later the investment firm offered Lear Seating to its management (including Ken Way, who had been with the company since 1966). Way took the company private in a $500 million LBO, with the help of Kidder, Peabody, and the company's name was changed to Lear Seating. Kidder sold its stake in Lear Seating to Lehman Brothers in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lear Seating bought a slice of
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   's North American automotive and trim operation and manufacturing factory in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, in 1993. As a result of the purchase, the company entered into a long-term supply agreement with Ford.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another strategic buy of a customer's seat business, Lear Seating acquired
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat
   </company>
   's seat operations in 1994. This purchase encompassed Sepi Poland, Sepi S.p.A. (Italy), and a 35% stake in a Turkish joint venture, giving Lear Seating a presence in those countries. The purchase also made the company Europe's largest seat maker and gave it access to Fiat's 5% of the global automotive market. That year Lear Seating went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Lear Seating bought Automotive Industries and inked a contract to provide seats for Brazil's top-selling car, the
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   Gol. To reflect the broader scope of its business, the company dropped "Seating" from its name and became Lear Corporation in 1996. That year the company acquired Pennsylvania-based
   <l1>
    Masland
   </l1>
   for $475 million and formed a joint venture with China's Jiangling Motors to make seats and interior trim for Ford and
   <company id="41753">
    Isuzu
   </company>
   vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lear bought German manufacturer Keiper Car Seating in 1997 and BTR's Dunlop Cox, which made a patented seat-adjusting system. It also bought ITT Industries' main North American seat-making unit. In 1998 Lear purchased the automotive seating unit of GM's Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary (now the independent
   <company id="57829">
    Delphi
   </company>
   ), giving it a bigger chunk of GM's business, as well as parts companies in the UK and Italy. To cut costs, the company announced that it would shut down 18 plants and cut 2,800 jobs in the US, Europe, and South America. Acquisitions continued, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company paid $2.3 billion for
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   ' auto unit (but sold the electric motors unit to
   <company id="58682">
    Johnson Electric Holdings
   </company>
   for $310 million) to complete its instrument panel offerings in 1999. Lear also bought
   <company id="55281">
    Hyundai Motor
   </company>
   's seat business to boost Pacific Rim sales. The following year Lear sold its sealants and foam rubber business to GSC Industries' AcoustiSeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 Lear announced it would cut 6,500 more jobs and close 21 manufacturing facilities. In light of the tightening automotive market, Lear planned to shutter older plants and move work to more cost-efficient locations. In 2004 Lear acquired German automotive electronics maker Grote &amp; Hartmann GmbH &amp; Co. for $220 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Lear sold $200 million in common stock to activist investor Carl Icahn, whose funds already held 5% of the company. The sale gave Icahn a combined 16% stake in Lear. Early in 2007 Icahn offered to buy the entire company in a deal valued at $2.8 billion. Amid skepticism among shareholders, Icahn raised his bid to $2.9 billion. However, shareholders voted to reject the offer. Icahn then sold two-thirds of his Lear holdings in late 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company narrowed its product focus and sold its interior product lines (instrument panels, door panels, flooring, acoustic systems, and other interior products) in 2006. Before the year was out, Lear struck a deal with Wilbur Ross, whereby Lear contributed its North American interiors business and $25 million in cash to the
   <company id="160641">
    International Automotive Components Group North America
   </company>
   joint venture. The deal was completed in 2007. Lear got a 25% stake in the venture and warrants for an additional 7% equity interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the midst of the Great Recession, Lear filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, emerging in late 2009. The company came out of bankruptcy with less than $1 billion in debt and $1.6 billion in cash. Lear received debtor-in-possession financing of about $500 million from secured lenders led by
   <company id="121104">
    J.P. Morgan
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58365">
    Citigroup
   </company>
   , allowing it to continue its operations during reorganization.
