   Best known for its consumer electronics, Sharp is a well-known maker of electronic components and computer hardware and peripherals. The company's flagship products are LCDs, which are used in everything from airplane cockpits to PCs to pinball machines. The company also produces flash memory, laser diodes, and optical sensors. Sharp also makes printers and cell phones; consumer audio and video products, such as Blu-ray disc players and LCD TVs; and a variety of appliances, such as air purifiers and steam ovens. The 100-year-old company is also one of the world's largest manufacturers of photovoltaic solar cells.

   Sharp gets more than half of sales from customers located outside of Japan. The company has established regional headquarters in the Americas, China, and in Europe as it looks to expand internationally.

  <p>
   Sharp's financial performance dulled in 2015 (ended March) with revenues falling 18%, resulting in a net loss for the year. The loss was the third on the past four years. The company reported lower sales in its major product categories including TVs, mobile phones, and air conditioners. Sales in the company's business solutions segment rose about 7% based on sales of multi-purpose printers overseas. Cash flow from operations also fell in 2015.

   In mid-2015 Sharp sold its TV business in the US and other markets in the Americas to the Hisense Group, based in China. The sale, which includes a manufacturing plant in Mexico, was for $27 million. The deal is one of several steps Sharp has taken to restructure and refocus its business as it has lost ground to rivals. Sharp has taken outside investment in the past year and is seeking more. The company is cutting about 10% of its work force -- about 5,000 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sharp has taken steps to expand its business in the Asia-Pacific Region. It opened a manufacturing plant in Indonesia and expanded and bolstered sales networks in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The company also is seeking to expand in emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa.

   The company is looking to new technology to revive its display sales. It has developed a manufacturing process that enables it to make displays of various shapes -- not just rectangles.

  <p>
   Tokuji Hayakawa got started in manufacturing in 1912 when he established Hayakawa Electric Industry to make a type of belt buckle he had designed. Three years later he invented the first mechanical pencil, named the Ever-Sharp, which was a commercial success. After an earthquake leveled much of Tokyo in 1923, including Hayakawa's business, he moved to Osaka and sold the rights to his pencil to finance a new factory. He introduced Japan's first crystal radio sets in 1925 and four years later debuted a vacuum tube radio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following WWII, Hayakawa Electric developed an experimental TV, which it began mass-producing in 1953. The company was ready with color TVs when Japan initiated color broadcasts in 1960. Hayakawa Electric grew tremendously during the 1960s, introducing microwave ovens (1962), solar cells (1963), the first electronic all-transistor-diode calculator (1964), and the first gallium arsenide LED (1969). The firm opened a US office in 1962.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 the company began to make its own semiconductor devices and changed its name to Sharp Corporation, a nod to the name of its first product. It began mass production of LCDs in 1973. Sharp later introduced the first electronic calculator with an LCD (1973), solar-powered calculators (1976), and a credit card-sized calculator (1979).
