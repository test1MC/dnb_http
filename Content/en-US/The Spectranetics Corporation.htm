   Spectranetics develops, markets, and distributes an excimer laser system that uses ultraviolet radiation rays to conduct minimally invasive treatment of various coronary and vascular conditions. Its CVX-300 laser unit and disposable delivery devices (fiber-optic catheters and sheaths) remove partial or total arterial blockages caused by plaque buildup; the laser system can also be used to remove lead wires from pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. The company's customers include major cardiac catheterization labs and hospitals in the US. Although its products are sold in some 65 countries, Spectranetics generates nearly 85% of its sales in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   About 900 of the CVX-300 laser systems have been placed in hospitals or physician practices around the globe, and the company is working to increase that number. Most of its annual revenue comes from the sale of consumable supplies to customers that already own a CVX-300 laser system. Spectranetics also markets the ThromCat thrombectomy system, a disposable vacuum device that removes arterial blood clots, and the related QuickCat catheters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vascular intervention products, which account for some 60% of sales, range from the CVX-300 system to the AngioSculpt scoring balloon used in peripheral and coronary procedures. Lead management products, accounting for nearly a third of total sales, include excimer laser sheaths, dilator sheaths, mechanical sheaths, and accessories to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads.

  <p>
   Spectranetics operates through two primary segments -- US Medical (which includes Canada) and International Medical (which includes Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific region). The US accounts for some 80% of sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's direct sales force is split into two groups. One focuses on sales of its vascular intervention products (for plaque blockage and blood-clot treatment in arteries in the heart and legs) and targets vascular surgeons, cardiologists, and radiologists. The other group represents the company's lead management products (removal of lead wires) and works with cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists. Internationally, the company sells directly and through distributor agreements in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific region. Spectranetics maintains its own manufacturing facilities in the US.

  <p>
   In 2014, advertising costs totaled approximately $2 million, up from $1.9 million in 2013 and $1 million in 2012.

  <p>
   Following its upward trend over the past five years, Spectranetics reported revenue growth of 29% in 2014, hitting $205 million. Sales of disposal products in both the vascular intervention and lead management businesses led to the increase that year. However, that growth was partially offset by declines in laser, service, and other revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   After two years of profitability, the company had net losses in 2013 and 2014. The acquisition and integration of balloon catheter maker AngioScore and higher operating expenses (including the expansion of field sales teams) were the primary drivers leading to a $41 million loss in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with the larger loss in 2014, Spectranetics also reported an operating cash outflow of $20 million, versus an inflow of $4.2 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Spectranetics focuses on organic growth through the development of new products, the launching of existing products into new markets, and the addition of new clinical indications for existing products. It also adds to its portfolio of products by making acquisitions. To increase sales, the company invests in expanding its sales teams and presenting commercial and educational programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Target markets for future growth include Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

   In 2014, the company acquired AngioScore, which develops, manufactures, and markets cardiovascular, specialty balloon catheters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, Spectranetics bought the Stellarex drug-coated angioplasty balloon (DCB) platform from

   for $30 million. The DCB platform entered the European market in 2015 and is expected to be marketed in the US by 2017.
