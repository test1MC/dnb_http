        <p>
   To offset losses as a result of the construction industry's downturn, Masco closed down about 100 manufacturing facilities and installation offices in 2008 and 2009, including some Masco Bath locations. It also sold the division's trucking company Tombigbee Transport Corporation to streamline operations.
