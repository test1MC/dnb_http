   After its EBI-005 treatment for dry eye disease failed in late-stage clinical trials, Eleven Biotherapeutics reinvented itself as a cancer fighter. The biologics firm acquired Canadian biotech Viventia Bio in September 2016, gaining that firm's roster of development programs targeting bladder cancer (Vicinium) and head and neck cancer (Proxinium). The new company is developing Targeted Protein Therapeutics (TPTs), some in combination with immunotherapy treatments. Eleven Bio went public in 2014 on the promise of its eye disease treatments but, once its most advanced candidate failed in trials, it cut 70% of its workforce. It began seeking new life in other fields and found hope with the purchase of Viventia Bio.

  <p>
   Eleven conducted an IPO in 2014 and plans to use the $50 million raised to help it develop and commercialize its EBI-005 product.

   The company (financially supported by venture capital firms Third Rock Ventures in Boston and Flagship Ventures in Cambridge) conducts research and development programs directed at both diseases of the front of the eye, such as dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, and diseases of the back of the eye, such as diabetic macular edema and uveitis.
  </p>
  <p>
   It focuses on cytokines (which the company believes play a major role in the pathology underlying eye diseases) and on pursuing protein therapeutics as an effective way to modulate the effects of cytokines in eye diseases. It uses its AMP-Rx platform to rationally design, engineer and generate a pipeline of innovative protein therapeutic candidates that target cytokines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eleven's EBI-005 program is based on the role that elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 play in triggering and maintaining inflammation and pain associated with dry eye disease (as well as the redness and itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis). The company holds worldwide commercialization rights to EBI-005.

  <p>
   In 2013 it completed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of EBI-005 in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease. The company believes that the results of this trial, together with the results of a separate Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2013, support its plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical program evaluating EBI-005 in 2014.
