   GlobeImmune would like to stop disease around the world. For now, it works on its proprietary Tarmogen method of stimulating cell-level immunity to cancer and other diseases. It has five cancer candidates targeting pancreatic, lung, colorectal, and thyroid cancers while the fifth addresses the metastasis mechanism in multiple tumors. GlobeImmune's current infectious disease candidates seek to permanently cure hepatitis B and C. The company, which produces its own products, works with Celgene and Gilead Sciences to develop and commercialize the cancer and infectious disease drugs, respectively. The company was formed in 1995 as Ceres Pharmaceutical and changed its name in 2001. It went public in 2014..

   After filing an IPO and withdrawing it in 2013, GlobeImmune pulled the trigger and began trading publicly in 2014. It raised about $15 million, which it plans to use to see its candidates through the approval process and to make ready its manufacturing facility. It has a 22,000-sq.-ft. plant it believes is capable of commercial scale production of its Tarmogens.Operations

   While the company will do its own manufacturing, its agreement with
   <company id="12913">
    Celgene
   </company>
   grants that drug development company the exclusive option to commercialize and market all oncology products after initial development stages. Its agreement with biotech firm
   <company id="15080">
    Gilead Sciences
   </company>
   is limited to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine that would be marketed in conjunction with Gilead's Viread HBV drug. GlobeImmune is also part of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the
   <company id="110148">
    National Cancer Institute
   </company>
   (NCI) where NCI provides the target cancers and funding for preclinical and early stage drug development.

  <p>
   Though the company hasn't brought a product to market, it has received upfront payments from Celgene and Gilead. It amortizes those payments over the years to show improved revenue and improving losses from operations. As would be expected for a pharma company at this stage, about 90% of GlobeImmune's loss from operations comes from R&amp;D spending. It's totally accumulated deficit as of March 2014 is $213 million.

   GlobeImmune is working for approval by the
   <company id="144161">
    US Food &amp; Drug Administration
   </company>
   . Once that hurdle is cleared, it will look to have its products approved in Europe and Asia.
