   By targeting differences in the oxygen levels of normal and diseased cells, Threshold Pharmaceuticals hopes to develop drugs that are effective at fighting cancer while preserving healthy tissue. The biotechnology company's most advanced candidate is evofosfamide, a hypoxia-activated prodrug, meaning it begins releasing its cell-killing agents only within the low-oxygen environment common to tumor tissues. Evofosfamide is in late-stage trials as a treatment for solid tumors and bone marrow cancer; it is co-developing the drug with

    Merck
   </company>
   . The company is also investigating an imaging agent that would identify patients who could most benefit from prodrugs.

  <p>
   In 2012 Threshold signed an agreement to co-develop TH-302 (evofosfamide) with Merck wherein Threshold has exclusive US rights to the drug for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma but all other development will be shared. Merck is paying 70% of worldwide development costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To augment its product line, Threshold in 2013 purchased a development-stage PET (positron emission topography) tracer from Siemens. The diagnostic tool can help identify patients likely to respond well to hypoxia-targeted treatment.

  <p>
   As a development stage company, Threshold hasn't really seen much in the way of revenue. It did receive $6 million in 2012 as part of its amortized payment from Merck. The company has accumulated losses of $323 million and expects to continue losing money for years.

  <p>
   Going forward, Threshold intends to continue developing evofosfamide for solid tumors while seeking other targets. It also plans to continue development and testing of [18F]-HX4, the diagnostic candidate it purchased from Siemens.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company announced plans to cut about 25% of its workforce in order to cut operating expenses and preserve capital.
