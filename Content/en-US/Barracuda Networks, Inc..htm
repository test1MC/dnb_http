  <p>
   Barracuda sells its appliances, services, and software through a direct sales force and a network of more than 5,000 resellers located in more than 100 countries. North America, however, is its largest market, accounting for about 75% of sales; the US alone generates 68% of sales.

  <p>
   Barracuda's revenue increased 19% to $277.4 million in 2015 (ended February) compared to $233.8 million in 2014. A 19% increase in the number of subscribers drove subscription revenue higher; the company counted some 240,000 subscribers at the end of its 2015 fiscal year. Appliance revenue rose 16% aided by success in efforts to sell additional products to existing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported a loss of $67.5 million in 2015, which was deeper than the $3.6 million loss of 2014. In 2015, Barracuda had higher expenses in research and development and sales and marketing as well as a much bigger tax bill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $54 million in 2015 from $42 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The rapid evolution of Web technologies and the digital threats designed to undermine them require Barracuda to continually revamp and update its product line. The company started selling CudaDrive, a cloud file service which is delivered to desktops via virtual drive, as well as through mobile and Web applications. The product enables businesses to securely store, share, and get access to files stored in the Barracuda cloud from anywhere. The company charges by the amount of storage capacity with unlimited users rather than charging by seat or by user.
