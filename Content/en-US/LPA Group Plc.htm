   LPA is headquartered in the UK and has customer base around fifty countries. The UK contributes 80% of its net sales. Other major markets include the rest of Europe (11%) and the rest of the world (9%).

  <p>
   LPA's revenues decreased 3% from 2013 to 2014. This was due to the impact of a hiatus in rail franchising and its partial withdrawal from sub contract sheet metal fabrication. Its net income, however, skyrocketed by over 100% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in reorganization costs and the presence of a gain on property disposed.

  <p>
   Geographically, the company is focused on expanding its rail operations as a global market. Much of this growth has been focused on Chinese and Asian markets as LPA continues to support the train builders and refurbishers and Japanese train builders for their export products.
