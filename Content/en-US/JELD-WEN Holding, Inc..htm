   JELD-WEN's business strategy is open and shut. A leading maker of windows and doors, the company offers aluminum, vinyl, and wood windows; interior and exterior doors; garage doors; swinging and sliding patio doors; and door frames and moldings. Flagship brands include FiberLast exterior doors and Aurora patio doors. Tracing its roots to 1960, the company operates more than 115 manufacturing and distribution sites in some 20 countries, mainly in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Australia. In early 2017, the company launched an IPO.
  </p>

  <p>
   JELD-WEN went public in early 2017, raising $575 million in its IPO. It is using about $375 million of this total to pay down debt and the rest for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's door manufacturing locations reside in Australia, Asia, Canada, and Europe; window manufacturing plants are located in Australia, Canada, and the UK. It also has a distribution facility in France. North America represents its largest market, but other major markets include Europe and the Asia/Pacific. In total, the company operates through 115 locations.
  </p>

  <p>
   JELD-WEN's revenue decreased 4% from $3.51 billion in 2014 to $3.38 billion in 2015. The decrease for 2015 was primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 8%, partially offset by a 3% increase in core net revenues, primarily comprised of an increase in pricing. Additionally, acquisitions provided a 1% bump in net revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting a net loss of $84 million in 2014, the company posted positive net income of $91 million in 2015. The net income for 2015 was largely due to the absence of losses associated with debt that it incurred the previous year and a decrease in impairment and restructuring charges.

  <p>
   The company's blueprint for growth is centered around new product launches. While product specifications and certifications vary from country to country, the global nature of its operations also allows the company to share new product designs across its  markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has launched several new product lines and line extensions in North America in recent years, such as its Siteline window series, Epic Vue window, DF Hybrid window, and the Moda door collection. In Australia, it launched a new Deco contemporary door product line, a new pivot door series, a wood window line extension, and the Alumiere aluminum window series. In Europe, it has introduced new steel door product lines that provide enhanced levels of security, safety, and impact resistance.

  <p>
   The company grows its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions, and it has focused on international transactions recently.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, it purchased Arcpac Building Products Limited, which includes its primary operating subsidiary Breezway Australia Pty Limited. Headquartered in Brisbane, Australia, Breezway is a manufacturer of louvre window systems for the residential and commercial window markets. Breezway's primary sales market is Australia, and it also maintains a presence in Malaysia and Hawaii.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, JELD-WEN obtained Trend Windows &amp; Doors Pty. Ltd., headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Trend is a manufacturer of doors and windows in Australia and is now part of the company's Australasia segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, JELD-WEN increased its European presence in 2015 through the purchase of Dooria AS, headquartered in Oslo, Norway. Dooria offers a complete range of doors, including interior, exterior, and specialty rated doors, in a wide variety of styles. The acquisition expanded JELD-WEN's production capabilities and product offerings in the Scandinavian region.
  </p>
  <p>
   All in all, JELD-WEN paid a total of $172 million in cash for the six businesses it acquired in 2015 and 2016.

  <p>
   Former chairman Richard Wendt and his siblings founded JELD-WEN in 1960. The name JELD-WEN is an acronym created from the initials of the company's founder's parents and sister. The Wendt family and other JELD-WEN employees continue to own a stake in the company following its 2011 investment from Onex. In early 2017, JELD_WEN went public.
