   Known for its Edensoy organic soymilk, Eden Foods offers more than 300 organic food items. It's North America's oldest natural and organic food company and the largest independent manufacturer of dry grocery organic foods. Products include canned beans and tomatoes, condiments, dry pasta, dried fruit and seeds, juices, oils, vinegars, teas, and spices. They're made using ingredients from more than 300 certified-organic North American farms. Eden Foods also imports sea salts from Europe and traditional Japanese miso and rice vinegar from Asia. Subsidiaries include American Soy Products, Eden Organic Pasta, Meridian Foods, and Sobaya. Family-owned, Eden Foods began in 1968 as a natural foods cooperative.

   Originating in Ann Arbor and now based in Clinton, Michigan, on 26 acres, Eden Foods is a global business. It has operations in the US in Michigan, Indiana, and California and sources products from Canada and as far away as Japan, Spain, Egypt, and South America. All of the company's food items come from one of its warehouses in southeast Michigan or central California.

   Eden Foods prepares 70% of its products, such as fresh milled whole grain flours, popcorn, and gomasio sesame salts, at its Michigan headquarters. Also at its main location, Eden Foods houses customer service, sales, purchasing, accounting, administration, and information technology functions. It has a flour mill and roasting, bottling, and packaging lines in Clinton, as well as an employee store, maintenance/transportation department, and a quality assurance laboratory. Adjacent to this building, the company maintains cool storage, web order fulfillment, shipping and receiving, and a commercial-quality kitchen.

   The company's Edensoy organic soymilk is made by an affiliate company nearby. Eden Organic Pasta Co. is located in Detroit, while the Meridian Foods cannery is in east-central Indiana. The company's organic udon and soba noodles are made north of the border by Sobaya Co. in Montreal, Canada. The firm has warehouses in southeast Michigan and central California. Beyond North America, Eden Foods sources products from Japan (miso, tea, wasabi), Spain (sea salt, olive oil), and South America (quinoa).

   More than 95% of Eden's foods are sold in natural food stores, co-ops, and supermarkets throughout the US by means of traditional natural and grocery distribution channels. The company's website and wholesale sales account for the rest.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Eden Foods' strategy is to go to market as a principled natural foods company. Indeed, founder and CEO Michael Potter is an outspoken supporter and upholder of organic industry standards and supports full disclosure of ingredients and handling.
  </p>
        <p>
   About 75% of its food items are organically grown on more than 360 family farms across North America that span 80,000-plus acres of farmland.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's high standards extend beyond its food to packaging. Eden Foods is one of a very few food companies to use bisphenol A-free linings for its low-acid canned goods, including beans. With potential health problems linked to the use of BPA linings in food cans, Eden's BPA-free policy has garnered attention, and quite possibly consumer sales, for the company. The custom-cans cost about 14% more than industry-standard cans.
  </p>
        <p>
   Potter claims to have resisted regular buyout offers for Eden Foods from large food companies and venture capitalists. While other organic product makers, such as Cascadian Farm (now a subsidiary of
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   ) and Woodstock Farms (owned by distributor
   <company id="52266">
    United Natural Foods
   </company>
   ) have been gobbled up by bigger companies, Eden Foods to date has bucked the consolidation trend.
   <em>
    The New York Times
   </em>
   has called Potter "one of the last little big men left in organic food."
