   Zafgen targets the severe obesity epidemic with an alternative to bariatric surgery. The biopharmaceutical company's lead product candidate ZGN-1061, a preclinical drug it hopes will successfully treat general obesity. In mid-2016, Zafgen shut down development of its previous lead candidate, beloranib, which was designed to treat obesity related to Willi-Prader syndrome ( a complex genetic disorder including insatiable life-threatening hunger and hunger-related behaviors known an hyperphagia), after two patients died in trials. It now plans to focus on ZGN-1061. The company went public in 2014.

   The company raised $96 million through its June 2014 IPO. It used some $23 million to advance the clinical development of beloranib as a treatment for obesity and hyperphagia in Willi-Prader patients.

   In 2016, when Zafgen decided to switch lanes and focus on ZGN-1061, it also cut some 34% of its workforce. Those decisions came after the firm met with the FDA in regards to the clinical trial deaths that had occurred in late 2015.
