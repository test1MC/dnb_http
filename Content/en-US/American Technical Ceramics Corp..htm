   American Technical Ceramics (ATC) isn't into pottery. The company makes ceramic and porcelain single- and multilayer capacitors that store and discharge precise amounts of electrical current. The company's radio-frequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter-wave capacitors are key components in mobile phones, instruments, radar and navigation systems, and broadcast satellites. Its high-reliability products are used in critically sensitive military and aerospace applications. ATC also makes resistors, as well as custom thin-film substrates for microwave and fiber-optic telecommunications devices. In 2007 rival

    AVX
   </company>
   acquired ATC for about $231 million in cash.

   Victor Insetta and Frank Mezey founded Phase Industries in 1966. Through the mid-1980s the company supplied low-volume niche capacitors, with 85% of sales going to military equipment makers. Phase changed its name to American Technical Ceramics in 1984. During the late 1980s the company began increasing its sales to commercial markets. In 1993 ATC acquired the assets of thin-film capacitor specialist Miltech Corp. The next year the company established a small group of employees to develop new products by working with customers. The collaboration resulted in a ceramic capacitor for high-volume transistor manufacturers and a millimeter-wave surface-mount capacitor.
  </p>
  <p>
   With demand for its products increasing from commercial and communications markets, in 1995 ATC upgraded its production and process equipment, purchased a new capacitor production facility, and invested in a new thin-film facility at its Jacksonville plant. In 1997 ATC announced plans to develop lower-cost, higher-volume products for commercial applications. The company had a strong beginning in 1998, but later that year the Asian financial crisis stunted demand and price competition grew. In response the company cut its workforce by 10%. Also in 1998 ATC introduced a new broadband capacitor line targeting the wireless and satellite communications market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company introduced a line of high-power, passive resistive products. Two years later, ATC added manufacturing capacities for making thin-film resistors. Also since 2002, the company offered low-temperature co-fired ceramic components, based on high-performance dielectric ceramic materials, for applications in RF and microwave-frequency broadband access.

  <p>
   In 2003 ATC began manufacturing microelectronic ceramic circuits, adding this specialty to the low-temperature co-fired ceramic line in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   ATC began selling its products through its corporate Web site in 2000, and widened the product line available over the Internet in 2004. It made more products available online in 2006.

   In 2006 the company acquired the assets of the low-temperature co-fired ceramic products at

    CTS Corp.
   </company>
   Contracting out some assembly and finishing operations to a manufacturing firm in Costa Rica, ATC reduced its headcount by 86 jobs, or about 11% of its workforce, the following year.
