   ATMI's original name -- Advanced Technology Materials, Inc. -- is a pretty good summary of its business. The company provides ultrapure materials and related packaging and delivery systems used by semiconductor and flat-panel display manufacturers during copper integration, deposition, ion implantation, photolithography, and surface preparation production processes. It also offers single-use disposable storage systems, mixers, and bioreactors, along with flexible film and cleanroom packaging, to the biotechnology, cell therapy, laboratory, and pharmaceutical industries. (This life sciences segment was sold to
   <company id="12221">
    Pall Corporation
   </company>
   in 2014.) In April 2014 ATMI became a subsidiary of
   <company id="52084">
    Entegris
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Fellow semiconductor materials supplier Entegris acquired ATMI for some $1.15 billion in 2014. As demand for its products weakened in some sectors, ATMI in late 2013 enlisted
   <company id="122098">
    Barclays Capital
   </company>
   to explore strategic options for the firm. The two companies hope their combinations expands opportunity for larger orders.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ATMI has manufacturing plants in Belgium, South Korea, and the US (in Connecticut, Minnesota, and Texas). Sales and customer services offices are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers in the Asia/Pacific region account for about 70% of sales; the US makes up almost 20%, and Europe accounts for another 10%.

  <p>
   ATMI uses a direct sales force for its microelectronics business segment, which sells high-purity materials to integrated circuit manufacturers and chemical suppliers. Its products for the life sciences industry are sold directly and through distributors, mostly in Europe. Top customers include
   <company id="111702">
    Samsung
   </company>
   (14% of sales),
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation
   </company>
   (12%) and
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics Corporation
   </company>
   (11%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 sales were $407 million, up 4% over 2011. The growth was driven by single-digit customer demand across both segments of ATMI's business, microelectronics and life sciences. ATMI returned to profitability in 2012, recording $42 million in net income. (The company was in the red for 2011 after taking a hit for terminating a contract manufacturing agreement related to its Safe Delivery Source (SDS) product line.)

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As part of an ongoing effort to expand its market share and revenue base, and bring critical development and production in-house, in late 2011 ATMI terminated an agreement with
   <company id="112710">
    Matheson Tri-Gas
   </company>
   for the manufacture and distribution of its SDS line. ATMI assumed control of the manufacturing, distribution, logistics, and sales of the SDS products; only in Japan will it rely on Matheson's parent
   <company id="102458">
    Taiyo Nippon Sanso
   </company>
   for distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's life sciences products only accounted for 10% of sales, and in early 2014 ATMI sold the division to
   <company id="12221">
    Pall Corporation
   </company>
   for $185 million. The sale included two locations in Belgium (most of the life sciences segment catered to European customers) plus a shared facility in Minnesota.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another strategy is to form alliances, such as joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts, to sell its products in new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, ATMI holds minority stakes in several domestic and foreign companies, including Anji Microelectronics (China), Lake LED Materials (South Korea), Disposable-Lab (France), and Medical Instill Technologies (US), which allows it to enhance its core technology base and promote new products.
