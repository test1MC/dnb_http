   Victims of biological attacks and cow udders alike have reason to be grateful to Avon Rubber. The company custom-engineers polymers for a variety of applications, but primarily respirators and gas masks for defense applications and liners and tubes for milking dairy cows. Avon Rubber supplies much of the world's milking products. The company also makes skirting for hovercraft and fendering products for marine transportation. Its Avon Engineered Fabrications unit (formerly Bell Avon) makes products such as temporary fuel or water storage tanks. The

   In fiscal 2016 (September year end) Avon Rubber's revenue rose by 6% from £134.3 million to £142.9 million. Thanks to a new protective hood product, the effects of acquisitions, and improved operational performance, the company reported a 2% sales increase in the Protection &amp; Defence segment over fiscal 2015. Dairy sales were up by 18% due to the effects of an acquisition and the growth of the segment's proprietary Milkrite/InterPuls brand. Both segments benefited from favorable currency translations.
  </p>
        <p>
   Avon Rubber's adjusted net income increased in fiscal 2016 from £16.9 million to £22.5 million. Operating profit in Protection &amp; Defence increased by about 4% thanks to new products, the effects of an acquisition, and better pricing on a long term contract. The Dairy segment rose by 12%, reflecting the acquisition of InterPuls, which offset lower volumes caused by the impact of lower milk prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flows from operating activities rose from £17.1 million in fiscal 2015 to £30.3 million in fiscal 2016 due to higher net income, improved amortization and depreciation and a more favorable payables and provisions position.

        <p>
   Avon Rubber was founded in 1885 when E. G. Browne and J. C. Margetson acquired a the Avon Mill cloth mill, known as Avon Mill, on the banks of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke in Wiltshire. The owners of the mill had been timber merchants, but had later diversified into the production of rubber goods.
  </p>
        <p>
   By 1890 the business had transferred to premises in Melksham in Wiltshire and Avon established itself as a leader of rubber-based products.
