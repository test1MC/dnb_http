   Seoul-based LG Electronics (LGE) rings up nearly 15% of its sales at home in South Korea. North America accounts for nearly a quarter of its total sales. Other important markets for geographically-diversified LGE include Central and South America (15%), and Europe. About 15% of the company's sales come from emerging markets, including India, China, and Russia. The Middle East and Africa accounts for about 10%. The company controls 114 local subsidiaries across the globe.

  <p>
   The consumer electronics giant rang up $53.1 billion in sales and a net profit of $203.7 million in 2013, marking an improvement over 2012 results. LGE's operating profit increased modestly in 2013 to nearly $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2012. The company's mobile communications business posted a 29% jump in annual sales with help from stronger smartphone sales, including its G2 and Nexus 5 models. Smartphone shipments rose 54% year over year. LGE's air conditioning and home appliance businesses also posted annual sales gains of 8% and 5%, respectively. The laggard was home entertainment, which suffered a 5% decline in annual sales despite higher demand for LCD TVs in North America, Asia, and the CIS countries.

  <p>
   LGE is focusing on boosting its mobile communication handset business and enhancing its share of the LCD TV market. Indeed, the company is looking to sell about 20% more cell phones. To that end, LGE will enter the world's largest 4G mobile market --  China -- with the introduction of its LG-E985T smartphone through
   <company id="54846">
    China Mobile
   </company>
   (the world's largest mobile operator with nearly 750 million subscribers). The company is also going after the premium kitchen appliance market with the establishment in 2013 of a new division focused exclusively on high-end kitchen packages. The new division will initially focus on the US and Korean markets. The Korean company has formed a strategic relationship with
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   to share patents on kitchenware and refrigerators. LGE also has alliances with other companies including
   <company id="56418">
    Prada
   </company>
   (phones),
   <company id="43517">
    Siemens
   </company>
   (air conditioners), and
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   (optical storage).
  </p>
  <p>
   LGE is continuing to invest heavily in marketing to boost its position as one of the world's top consumer electronics brands, up there with rivals
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41463">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   . The company is also focused on boosting sales of its commercial air conditioners, drum washing machines, and side-by-side (aka French door) refrigerators. LGE and US rival
   <company id="11632">
    Whirlpool
   </company>
   have been trading patent infringement claims over refrigerator technology.

   In February 2013, LGE acquired the webOS operating system technology from
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   to support its next-generation Smart TV technology. LGE acquired the source code and other assets associated with webOS. The purchase will allow LGE to offer an intuitive user experience and Internet services across a range of consumer electronics devices.

  <p>
   To bolster production of large-scale air conditioning systems both in South Korea and abroad, LGE acquired the A/C business of industrial machinery manufacturer LS Mtron for $134 million in early 2011. The deal included a factory in Jeonju, South Korea, as well as a research and development team. LS Mtron operated as part of LG Group until 2003, when its operations were spun off.
