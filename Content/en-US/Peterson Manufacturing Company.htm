   Peterson uses its vast production facilities, warehousing space and well-trained staff to maintain a 97% fill-rate and order-turnaround of three-to-five days. It is seeking to expand its product line covering more than 2,200 different types of vehicle safety lights, reflectors, mirrors, antennas and other related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Peterson moved into the rapidly developing LED forward lighting market, launching a new 7-inch round LED headlight.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its worldwide presence in regions where it did not currently have an international sales partner, in 2012 Peterson formed a strategic alliance with Dorian Drake International, to represent the company in certain international markets.
