   Maybe you could sum up Ultralife's business model as PC, as in power and communications, that is. The company's main business is the design and manufacture of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. Accounting for about a quarter of sales, its Communications Systems Division provides such products as amplified speakers and cable assemblies. Ultralife sells its products around the world to OEMs, distributors, and retailers. The company also sells directly to the US and foreign defense departments. Military sales (both directly and indirectly) account for about 50% of Ultralife's revenues.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ultralife has operations in North America, Europe, and Asia (China and India). The company has offices, warehouses, and manufacturing locations in China, India, and the UK. Domestic offices reside in Florida, California, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, and Texas. The US accounts for nearly 60% of total sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Battery and Energy Products segment, nearly 70% of sales, makes lithium-manganese dioxide non-rechargeable batteries (to be discarded when discharged), including 9-volt, HIRate cylindrical, and Thin Cell, for such applications as smoke alarms, intensive care devices, radios, automotive telematics, night-vision devices, and thermal imaging equipment. The segment also makes lithium ion rechargeable batteries and charging systems for communications, medical, and portable electronic applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Supporting military communications, Communication Systems products are marketed under the McDowell Research and AMTI brands. To serve the demanding needs of both the US and approved foreign militaries, the Communication Systems' products are made to withstand severe environments.

  <p>
   Ultralife targets government, defense, and commercial customers across the globe. It sells its products worldwide through a variety of trade channels, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), industrial and defense supply distributors, and directly to US and international defense departments. The company also distributes some of its products through domestic and international distributors and retailers. Its sales are generated primarily from customer purchase orders.
  </p>

  <p>
   Ultralife's balance sheet has been moving in the wrong direction, with revenues falling sharply the last three years. Revenues dipped 22% from $102 million in 2012 to $79 million in 2013. Mainly due to high operating and research expenses, the company has suffered five straight years of net losses, although the losses have been shrinking.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2013 were due to lower government and defense sales resulting from budget and sequestration reductions. Battery and Energy Products declined due to the continued slowdown within the US government and defense order rate for rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries and charger systems. Ultralife was also affected by lower sales of 9-volt batteries, while its Communications Systems revenues decreased due to the government furloughs and shutdown.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company saw a huge drop in operating cash flow in 2012 followed by growth in 2013. The operating cash flow increased by $2 million in 2013 due to a decline in net loss and an increase in cash generated by accounts receivable.

  <p>
   Battery &amp; Energy Products' strategy includes alliances with the OEMs and government entities who buy its products. The segment's sales and technical staff seek out feedback from such customers for product development. More generally the company touts such advantages of its lithium batteries as lighter weight and a longer shelf life.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an operational initiative, the segment has been transferring a large part of its 9-volt battery making operations from its New York plant to a facility in Shenzhen, China. The Communication Systems segment's former RedBlack Communications unit, which marketed mobile, modular, and fixed-site communication and electronics systems, was sold off in 2013 after struggling with operating losses.

  <p>
   Ultralife Batteries was formed in 1990 and soon after bought the technology to make 9-volt lithium-manganese dioxide non-rechargeable batteries from
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   . It went public in 1992 and was able to set up shop in the UK two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began diversifying through a series of acquisitions. It began its shopping spree in 2006 when it bought ABLE New Energy Co., a Chinese manufacturer of lithium batteries. ABLE's line of products are used in a diverse range of portable devices, such as automotive electronics, medical equipment, and tracking systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 Ultralife acquired McDowell Research, a military communications accessories manufacturer that specializes in amplified speakers, battery chargers, power supplies, and radio-frequency amplifiers. The $20 million transaction enhanced Ultralife's presence in the military communications field and broadened its reach to global defense markets. Ultralife ultimately relocated McDowell's operations from Texas to New York.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand in 2007 when it bought engineering and technical services firm. RedBlack Communications (formerly Innovative Solutions Consulting). Its customers have included government agencies, such as the
   <company id="151025">
    National Security Agency
   </company>
   and the Office of Naval Research, and prime military contractors like
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   and Titan Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultralife quickly followed up that deal in 2007 with two more acquisitions that helped diversify the company's product line and geographic reach. The Florida-based Stationary Power Services and Reserve Power Systems (RPS) joined Ultralife that year. The companies provided infrastructure power management services and lead-acid batteries for standby power systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company bought certain assets of
   <company id="52791">
    US Energy Systems
   </company>
   and its US Power Services affiliate. US Energy Systems installed and maintained standby power systems, uninterruptible power supply systems, DC power systems, and switchgear/control systems for the telecommunications, utilities, technology, petrochemical, financial, and information services industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Ultralife bought the assets and assumed the liabilities of
   <company id="149843">
    Leidos
   </company>
   ' tactical communications products business for nearly $6 million in cash. The business makes amplifiers, man-portable systems, cables, power systems, and ancillary communications equipment that are sold by Ultralife under the products' brand name, AMTI.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 McDowell's operations were relocated yet again, to Ultralife's Virginia Beach, Virginia, facility.
