   Founded in 1888, Middleby makes a slew of commercial and institutional foodservice equipment for restaurants, retailers, and hotels worldwide. Middleby operates through three segments: Commercial Foodservice Equipment, Food Processing Equipment, and Residential Kitchen Equipment. The largest, Foodservice, makes machines for most types of cooking and warming activities. Products are sold under some two dozen blue chip brands --

    Blodgett

   , Southbend, and
   <company id="46639">

   , among them. Food Processing makes cooking, mixing, slicing, and packaging machines, and Residential Kitchen makes ovens, refrigerators, dishwashers, microwaves, and other related products.

  <p>
   The company's mainstay Commercial Foodservice Equipment segment offers ovens, ranges, broilers, fryers, toasters, coffee and tea brewers, and other cooking equipment; it generates around 62% of total sales each year. Its Food Processing Equipment group (16% of sales) offers a slate of labor-saving products, from batch ovens to mixing and slicing machines, packaging, and food safety equipment. Residential Kitchen (22%) makes everything from ovens and refrigerators to dishwashers and microwaves. The group's manufacturing facilities often neighbor major food processors.

  <p>
   Middleby has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last five years. Revenues rose by 12% from $1.6 billion in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $1.8 billion in 2015. Profits also peaked at $193 million in 2014 and remained consistent in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by sales increases across the two segments of Commercial Foodservice (8%) and Residential Kitchen (50%). Middleby also experienced a 43% surge in sales from Europe and the Middle East. The growth was primarily attributed to additional revenue from previous acquisitions.
