  <p>
   Founded in 1901, Butler Manufacturing started out building agricultural structures such as watering tanks and grain storage bins. The company soon diversified, creating a steel garage (its first metal product) in 1909 and even a biplane in the late 1920s. Butler's oil field equipment operations helped it survive the Depression, while its rigid-frame steel buildings catapulted the company's sales following WWII. With both agricultural and commercial construction operations, Butler fared well during the 1960s and 1970s, since the two markets never crashed at the same time during this period. After the agricultural market slumped in the early 1980s, the company started to divest its agricultural holdings and focus on commercial building operations. It acquired building product companies such as wall panel maker Inryco (1986).

   After restructuring in the early 1990s, Butler benefited from a growing business both in the US and overseas. In 1997 Butler completely exited its original business when it sold its Grain Systems division. Having divested itself of its agricultural roots, the company bolstered its architectural products line by acquiring Modu-Line Windows and Rebco West.

   The late 1990s brought further restructuring for Butler. In 1999 the company pulled out of Brazil in light of the economic crisis there, and it sold its Scotland-based subsidiary (spurred by the weak British pound) and moved its metal building operation to Hungary. Donald Pratt replaced the retiring Robert West as chairman that year. Company veteran John Holland assumed the president and CEO positions on the same date.

   In 2001 a sluggish economy and winter construction slowdowns forced the company to cut about 170 jobs. The company sold its profitless European assets in early 2002. Butler planned to sell its Lester Building Systems business (engineered wood-frame buildings) to a management team headed by Lester division president John Hill in 2003, but the deal was terminated due to lack of consent from senior lenders.

   The next year the company announced that it would merge with
