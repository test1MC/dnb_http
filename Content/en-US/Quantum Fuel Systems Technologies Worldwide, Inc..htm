    Fisker Automotive
   </company>
   , a joint venture between Quantum and Fisker Coachbuild, is developing the Karma, an environmentally friendly luxury sports sedan, using Quantum's plug-in-hybrid engine technology. Its customer base also includes aerospace and government entities.

  <p>
   Quantum is stationed in Lake Forest, California, and has operations in the US, Canada, and India. The US accounted for 95% of its revenue in 2013.

  <p>
   The company's customer base includes OEMs, aftermarket and OEM truck integrators, fleets, a material science company, and other governmental entities and agencies. Major customers include Agility Fuel Systems (45% of sales), Advanced Green Innovations (12%), Westport Fuel Systems (9%), and

   (8%).

  <p>
   Quantum's revenues jumped 40% from $23 million in 2012 to $32 million in 2013. However, the company has suffered 10 straight years with a net loss and more than five years with negative cash flow.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2013 was driven by a more than 100% surge in CNG fuel storage product revenue. Its higher overall contract services revenue was also mainly due to increased engineering services related to CNG fuel storage system integration and next generation storage technologies programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quantum's reoccurring net losses have primarily been attributed to write-offs of the carrying value of key investments and losses from discontinued operations. The company had an accumulated deficit of $476 million in 2013.

  <p>
   The company is getting a jump on its competition by leveraging its expertise in alternative fuels, battery systems, electronic controls, electric drive systems, fuel cells, and hydrogen handling and refueling. With its strategic business ventures and alliance partnerships, as well as its investment in research and development, Quantum has developed into a fully integrated energy company and is poised to benefit by the growing demand for renewable energy, alternative fuel, energy storage, and vehicle electrification.
