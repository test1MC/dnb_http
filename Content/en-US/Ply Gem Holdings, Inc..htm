Its products -- vinyl siding, aluminum windows and doors, stone veneer, and fencing -- are supplied to home-center retailers, distributors, construction companies, and contractors in North America. Subsidiaries include

   . The company went public in 2013.

  <p>
   Ply Gem Holdings plans to use the $331 million in proceeds from its May 2013 IPO to pay off debt. Prior to the filing, Frederick J. Iseman and Steven M. Lefkowitz indirectly held a majority stake in Ply Gem Holdings through their affiliation with private equity firm CI Capital Partners, which owned 86% of the company's stock through its subsidiaries and affiliates.

   North Carolina-based Ply Gem maintains manufacturing operations in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   In its first year as a public company Ply Gem Holdings reported revenue of $1.37 billion, an increase of 22% versus 2012. Driving the double-digit gain was an increase in siding, fencing, and stone sales as a result of the Mitten acquisition (2013), and improvement in new housing construction in the US, partially offset by lower sales of the company's metal accessory products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite a big gain in sales, Ply Gem reported a loss of $79.5 million, marking its third consecutive year in the red. The company blamed IPO and acquisition-related costs, and an increase in general expenses for the loss. Both net income and cash flow from operations have fluctuated wildly in recent years, with cash flow from operations swinging from $48.7 million in 2012 to a deficit of $14.7 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Going forward, the company hopes to grow by expanding its product offerings and bolstering its market presence in North America. Indeed, the company has completed several acquisitions in the US and Canada since its 2013 IPO.

   Following a pair of acquisitions in Canada in 2013, Ply Gem realigned production across two manufacturing facilities in Calgary to improve overall operating efficiency. The restructuring plan included shifting the majority of the vinyl window and door production to Gienow's manufacturing plant in Calgary, while maintaining wood window and door production at Ply Gem Canada's manufacturing facility, also in Calgary. Ply Gem's distribution centers in Western Canada were also part of the realignment.
