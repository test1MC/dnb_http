   Alessandro Gonnella made his dough like many Italian-Americans -- he baked it. Founded by Mr. Gonnella in 1886, Gonnella Baking makes fresh Italian- and French-style specialty breads for grocers and restaurants across the Midwest. It also makes frozen dough and fresh baked frozen bread for in-store bakeries and restaurants. Gonnella rolls out a variety of bread crumbs, rolls, and breadsticks for retail sale. From its frozen dough plants in Schaumburg, Illinois, and Hazle Township, Pennsylvania, Gonnella ships its in-store bakery and food service products across the US. The firm, which supplies hot dog buns to Wrigley Field, has six production facilities. The Gonnella and Marcucci families own the company.

  <p>
   When it was founded, Gonnella served the Chicago-area market and gradually expanded its distribution to surrounding states in the Midwest.  The company's reach was limited by its fresh-baked goods, however, as they only offer a one-day shelf life. Rolling out frozen dough in the 1980s allowed the company to extend its reach from coast to coast. Today, Gonnella delivers bread daily to retailers and restaurants from Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Pennsylvania. It now supplies frozen dough and baked frozen breads nationwide to food service and retail outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Gonnella opened a new cold storage and distribution center in Illinois to serve as the Chicagoland pick-up point for Gonnella's baked frozen line of products, which are delivered nationwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it opened a research center within its Schaumburg, Illinois facility to develop new products.

  <p>
   Gonnella introduced the Thaw 'N Sell line of breads and rolls for its retail customers in 2010. Thaw 'N Sell products are baked and then shipped out frozen; retailers can then thaw the products when they are ready to be displayed and sold. Launching Thaw 'N Sell helped Gonnella to expand its customer base to include convenience stores, warehouse clubs, and other retailers that do not have in-store bakeries.
