   Like homes, trains can use a makeover, too! Greenbrier Rail Services (GRS) operates one of North America's biggest freight car repair, refurbishment, and wheel service networks. The company offers wheel set assembly and refurbishment, and axle finishing. Its railcar services include routine maintenance and repair, and wreck work. GRS also manufactures parts, such as doors, roofs, couplers, and yokes. The company was formed in 2002 when

   The American Brake Shoe and Foundry Company was founded in 1902. It changed its name to Abex and was acquired by IC Industries (now Whitman Corp.), a conglomerate that included the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. In 1987 a group including current CFO Chisholm MacDonald bought Abex's rail products division. The company planned to use the name ABC Rail Products only temporarily, but it stuck. In 1991 investment bank Kohlberg &amp; Co. acquired control of the company, which was struggling under the weight of a 1989 recapitalization. Donald Grinter, former president of the Supermarket Group of Hussman Corp. (another IC Industries subsidiary), was named CEO. Moving into the market for European-style high-speed rail and light-rail technology, ABC Rail formed a joint venture in 1992 with track maker Cogifer (France). ABC Rail went public in 1993.

   ABC grew through acquisitions, including its 1995 deal for the wheel-mounting business of General Electric Railcar Wheel and Parts Service. The same year it formed a joint venture with Anchor Brake Shoe to make composite brake shoes. In 1996 it acquired Milwaukee's Deco Industries, a maker of railroad yard retarder control and automation systems, and Wisconsin's American Systems Technologies, a provider of turnkey systems to transit markets.
  </p>

   ABC entered a joint venture with Damy Cambios de Via in 1997 to supply Mexico's rail industry. The next year ABC's joint venture in China began making railcar wheels. ABC's 1999 purchase of NACO, a maker of freight car cast-steel equipment, for $143 million almost doubled the company's size. The merged enterprise, named ABC-NACO Inc., boosted production capabilities to include all the cast parts for freight car undercarriages.

   In 2000 ABC-NACO acquired railroad-component maker (manganese track castings) Donovan Demolition. Early in 2001 the company sold its signal group to the UK's Balfour Beatty. Also in 2001 it sold its flow and specialty products business to that division's management. Later in 2001, amid the increasing softness of the rail supply market, ABC-NACO entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 ABC-NACO's assets were sold to private equity firm Three Cities Funds III, L.P. Three Cities began operating the assets as Meridian Rail Corp.
