   Amtech Systems furnishes fabs with furnaces and more. The company operates through four subsidiaries: Tempress Systems makes diffusion furnaces for semiconductor and solar cell fabrication, as well as for precision thermal processing (annealing, brazing, silvering, sealing, and soldering) of electronic devices, including optical components and photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. P.R. Hoffman Machine Products makes equipment used to polish items such as silicon wafers, precision optics, ceramic components, and disk media. Bruce Technologies makes horizontal diffusion furnace systems, and R2D Automation makes wafer automation and handling equipment for the solar and semiconductor sectors and is based in France.

  <p>
   Amtech has operations in China, France, the Netherlands, and the US. Its most targeted market remains the Netherlands, which accounted for almost 60% of its total sales in 2012. The US represented almost 35%, while France accounted for the remainder of revenue.

   Amtech Systems operates through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries. Bruce Technologies makes and sells automation systems for semiconductor diffusion furnaces, while Tempress Systems B.V. (based in the Netherlands) makes solar and semiconductor diffusion and LPCVD furnace systems. P.R. Hoffman Machine Products manufactures, sells, and installs double-sided precision lapping and polishing machines and complementary products such as carriers, wafer polishing templates, and machine parts. Finally, R2D Automation (based in France) manufactures and sells wafer automation and handling equipment such as solar cell transfer systems, sorters, and ID readers for the solar and semiconductor industry.

  <p>
   Amtech was one of the first suppliers of semiconductor production equipment to provide equipment for making photovoltaic solar cells, which are made in a process similar to semiconductor manufacturing on silicon wafers. The company started supplying Tempress diffusion furnaces for solar cell manufacturing in the early 21st century, a move since emulated by

   and other big vendors of semiconductor equipment.

  <p>
   After several years of growth, Amtech experienced a painful fiscal 2012. Its revenues plummeted by 67% from 2011 to 2012, and it suffered a net loss of $23 million for 2012. Amtech was punished by a 79% decrease in net revenue from the solar market. Its total sales in the Netherlands, it largest market, also declined by 75% from 2011 to 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net loss was the result of the sizable decrease in total sales coupled with and increased investment in research and development related to the development of a solar ion implanter. Additional investments were made in the development of other technologies and processes for solar cell manufacturing to increase throughput and cell efficiency. The company also incurred an impairment of the goodwill in two of its reporting units that serve the solar equipment market, resulting in a $4.7 million impairment charge due to the current supply/demand imbalance in the solar equipment market.

  <p>
   Despite its poor fiscal 2012, the company continues to see future growth in the solar cell manufacturing sector, specifically in China, home to hundreds of manufacturers in the solar cell supply chain. In 2011 it bought a 55% stake in Kingstone Technology, the Hong Kong owner of Kingstone Semiconductor, a Shanghai-based company that makes ion implantation technology for the solar and semiconductor industries. Amtech paid $4 million for the Kingstone stake.
