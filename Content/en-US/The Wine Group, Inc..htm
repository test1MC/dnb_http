Its brand names include Corbett Canyon, Almaden, Foxhorn, and Fish Eye. It imports wine as well, including Mistrane from France and Austin Vale from Australia. TWG also operates Underdog Wine Merchants, which offers offbeat wines such as Pinot Evil, Big House, Herding Cats, and Tempra Tantrum, which are designed to appeal to younger consumers. Once part of
