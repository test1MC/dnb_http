   Broadcom Limited's products cover a broad range of semiconductors. The products include chips for wireless and wired communications as well as optoelectronics, radio-frequency and microwave components, power amplifiers, and application-specific integrated circuits (custom chips). The company's thousands of products are used in a wide range of applications, including mobile phones, data networking and telecommunications equipment, consumer appliances, displays, printers, servers and storage networking gear, and factory automation. Broadcom Limited was created with Avago Technologies acquired Broadcom Inc. The company took the Broadcom Limited name when the deal closed in early 2016.

  <p>
   Singapore-based Avago bought US-based Broadcom for $37 billion in 2015 with the transaction closing in February 2016. The deal has been one of the biggest in the wave of consolidation in the semiconductor business. Chip companies have sought strength in bulking up to offer a wider range of products. That was the logic of the Avago-Broadcom deal. It extends the market reach beyond what the individual companies had and it offers the opportunity to sell into each other's markets.

  <p>
   Broadcom designs makes and sell products for four basic market: wireless communications, enterprise storage, wired infrastructure, and industrial.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wireless communications generates 37% of Broadcom's revenue through the sale of radio frequency (RF) semiconductor devices and filters for the cell phone market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The enterprise storage business supplies 32% of the company's revenue. Those products enable secure transfer of data to and from host machines such as servers, personal computers and storage systems to the underlying storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Wired infrastructure such as transceivers that receive and transmit information along optical fibers makes up 22% of Broadcom's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The industrial segment supplies devices for automotive, military electronics, displays, and other uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the company's product are made by third-party manufacturers such as ASE Korea Inc., Inari Technology SDN BHD,
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="185882">
    WIN Semiconductors Corp
   </company>
   . Broadcom maintains manufacturing capability in Singapore and the US from some production and for developing new products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   China is the company's single largest market, accounting for about 54% of sales. The US accounts for about 11% and Taiwan, 3%. About a third of sales are to areas the company clusters under "other."

  <p>
   Broadcom sells through its own sales staff and through distributors. It staff focus on sales to and support of Broadcom's large OEM customers. The company main are Avnet Inc. and Arrow Electronics Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's biggest customer is Foxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry, which accounts for 24% of revenue. Its top five customers account for 46% of the company's sales. Broadcom's sales to Apple, directly and through Foxconn, make up more than a fifth of revenue.

  <p>
   Contributions from acquired companies helped boost Broadcom's 2015 (ended November) revenue a robust 60%. Sales reached $6.8 billion for the year, compared to $4.27 billion in 2014. Sales rose in all segments and geography, but were particularly strong in the enterprise business (150% higher) from the full year of results of products from LSI Corp., which was acquired in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadcom's net income also shot up in 2015, rising a whopping 419% to $1.36 billion, compared to $0.26 billion in 2014. The increase came from the jump in revenue and higher operating expenses including research and development costs did little to take the edge off the profit rise.

  <p>
   Avago and Broadcom made acquisitions a key part of their growth strategies but as they integrate their widespread operations they might not be in shopping mode.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadcom Limited invests in R&amp;D to maintain a pipeline of new products. Its R&amp;D spending has nearly doubled for each of the past three years. It reached $1 billion in 2015 and it expected to stay at that level or higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bolstered it manufacturing capacity by adding to its plant in Fort Collins, Colorado and buying a facility in Eugene, Oregon. The company will work on its proprietary products, particularly in its wireless communications operation. The Fort Collins plant will get the capacity to make 8-inch wafers, which contain more chips that the 6-inch wafers it has turned out.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadcom sells as well as buys. In October 2015, it sold Endace, a network visibility operation which was acquired with the Emulex deal.

  <p>
   In 2014 Avago acquired
   <company id="13932">
    LSI Corp
   </company>
   . in an all-cash deal valued at $6.6 billion. San Jose-based LSI designs semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking in data centers, mobile networks and client computing. The purchase positions Avago as a leader in enterprise storage. The company anticipates $200 million of annual operating synergies by the end of fiscal year 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Avago acquired Javelin Semiconductor, which will help in Avago's development of next-generation components for smartphones. Also that year the company agreed to purchase CyOptics, which serves the data communications and telecommunications markets with Indium Phosphide (InP) optical chips and components. In 2010 it bought Wuxi, expanding its presence in China as well as its motion control encoder product line. In 2008 the company supplemented its motion control product line with the acquisition of Nemicon.
