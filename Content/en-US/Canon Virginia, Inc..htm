   Canon Virginia served as an in-house contract manufacturing arm of Canon until 2005, when it began to serve outside customers, as well. The company has bucked the trend toward moving manufacturing jobs to overseas locations where labor costs are lower. The leadership of Canon Virginia recognized that the assembly jobs that were being moved offshore were not coming back to the US, and began to acquire businesses that would create long-term opportunity in the US. The jobs created through the company's change in focus require more skills and education and pay better; the jobs include maintaining and upgrading equipment at the plant.
