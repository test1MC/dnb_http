   Meggitt Training Systems (formerly Firearms Training Systems) provides digital technology and laser-emitting weapons for the realistic weapons training of law enforcement, military, and security personnel in the US and overseas. The training systems integrate video and digitized imagery with laser-emitting firearms that have the look and feel of the real thing -- they even recoil. Simulated arms range from semiautomatic pistols to anti-armor rocket launchers and cannons. Meggitt Training Systems (MTS) has locations in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US. The company is part of
   <company id="90276">
    Meggitt PLC

   's Equipment Group.

  <p>
   Retired Formula One driver Jody Scheckter founded Firearms Training Systems (FATS) as a subsidiary of THIN International NV (training systems, the Netherlands), in 1984. FATS delivered its first training system in 1985 to the US Postal Service. The company soon began selling its systems worldwide. By 1988 about 200 law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco police departments, used systems developed by FATS.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 FATS developed a desert scenario to train the US military during the Persian Gulf War. FATS was acquired by the Centre investment group and taken public in 1996. Raytheon executive Peter Marino became CEO and president that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced two new systems in 1997: Vessel Weapons Engagement Training System (naval mounted weapons training) and Indirect Fire Trainer (artillery). FATS expanded in 1998 by acquiring Simtran Technologies (air defense missile trainers and armored vehicle crew trainers) and Dart International (hunting and sports simulators).
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits slumped in fiscal 1999 when a contract with the US Marine Corps expired and sales to law enforcement agencies dipped. CEO Marino retired that year and EVP Robert Mecredy succeeded him. The next year sales and income continued to slump due to contract delays with the US military and the loss of a major UK contract (Caddet air defense trainer). High indebtedness also prevented FATS from adequately investing in product development, forcing the company to restructure its debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several top executives left the company in 2000, and president and CEO Mecredy resigned in 2001. Chairman Randy Sugarman stepped in as interim president and CEO until he was replaced by Ron Mohling in August 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   To maximize shareholder value, FATS announced in 2005 that it had hired an investment firm to evaluate alternatives, including a sale or merger of the company. In 2006 it announced a deal with Meggitt PLC, which agreed through its subsidiary Meggitt USA to purchase FATS. Meggitt combined FATS capabilities and integrated personnel and facilities with those of Meggitt Defense Systems Caswell to form Meggitt Training Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 MTS partnered with
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   to create the Reconfigurable Vehicle System (RVS), and it provided customized Banshee and Voodoo aerial target models for the UK Ministry of Defense's Combined Aerial Target Service (CATS).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2009 the company opened a high-tech facility in Ontario, Canada, for realistic computer-driven weapons training. The company also received a $2 million combat arms training systems contract through the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act.
