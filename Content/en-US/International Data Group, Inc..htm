   <company id="133717">

  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   IDG's products and services reach an audience of more than 280 million technology buyers in about 100 countries in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America. Part of the company's strategy is growing its presence in China, India, and Eastern Europe. IDG has expanded to include more than 40 publications in China, and each year it holds some 20 expositions and 60 conferences in that country.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 IDG expanded its footprint in South Asia by entering Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. IDG has partnerships in the US, Korea, and multiple locations throughout China, India, and Vietnam.

  <p>
   IDG's content is supported by the IDG News Service, a 24-hour news organization that reports on IT news to the company's online network from bureaus in Asia, Europe, and the US. The company also offers custom publishing services; its ContentWorks is a custom publishing division that creates white papers, catalogs, training materials, websites, and mobile media.

   While tech publishing is still the company's bread and butter, IDG has been adapting to a slowdown in the media industry by expanding its marketing capabilities. This includes the launch of the IDG TechNetwork, which aggregates blogs for tech advertisers, as well as its IDG Amplify online ad unit, which allows users to share ads via social networking sites such as
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="132274">
    LinkedIn
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="160756">
    Twitter
   </company>
   . In addition, IDG Connect provides lead generation for technology marketers and sales teams.
  </p>
  <p>
   Benefiting from its tech knowledge, the company learned early to deliver many of its titles exclusively online, saving on print and delivery costs, and getting information to readers more quickly. Going forward, IDG is turning its focus toward the mobile Internet user and the more than one billion 3G phone users in the world, optimizing brands for mobile access on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.

  <p>
   Patrick McGovern began his career in publishing as a paperboy for the
   <i>
    Philadelphia Bulletin.
   </i>
   As a teenager in the 1950s, McGovern was inspired by Edmund Berkeley's book
   <i>
    Giant Brains; or Machines That Think.
   </i>
   He later built a computer and won a scholarship to MIT. There he edited the first computer magazine,
   <i>
    Computers and Automation.
   </i>
   McGovern started market research firm International Data Corporation in 1964 after interviewing the president of computer pioneer UNIVAC. Three years later he launched
   <i>
    Computerworld,
   </i>
   and within a few weeks the eight-page tabloid had 20,000 subscribers. Combined under the name International Data Group, McGovern's company reached $1 million in sales by 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taking the "International" in its name to heart, IDG began publishing in Japan in 1971 and expanded to Germany in 1975. Following the collapse of communism, the company had 10 publications in Russia and Eastern Europe by 1990. That year two teenage hackers broke into the company's voice mail system and erased orders from customers and messages from writers. The prank cost IDG about $2.4 million. Also in 1990 IDG launched IDG Books Worldwide (renamed Hungry Minds in 2000), which hit it big the next year with
   <i>
    DOS for Dummies.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   With the technology boom of the 1990s, competition in tech publishing heated up. By 1993 several of IDG's magazines, including
   <i>
    InfoWorld, Macworld,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    PC World,
   </i>
   began losing ad pages to rivals Ziff-Davis and CMP Media. To help stem advertiser attrition, IDG started an incentive program tied to its new online service. In 1995 IDG bought a stake in software companies Architect Software (now Excite@Home) and Netscape (now owned by
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   ) as part of its move toward Internet-based services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 IDG launched
   <i>
    Netscape World: The Web,
   </i>
   a magazine covering the Internet, and introduced more than 30 industry newsletters delivered by e-mail. The company also bought
   <i>
    PC Advisor,
   </i>
   the UK's fastest-growing computer magazine. IDG kicked off its online ad placement service, Global Web Ad Network, in 1997. That year IDG merged
   <i>
    Macworld
   </i>
   with rival Ziff-Davis'
   <i>
    MacUser
   </i>
   in a joint venture called Mac Publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 IDG pledged $1 billion in venture capital for high-tech startups in China. It also introduced new publications in China, including a Chinese edition of
   <i>
    Cosmopolitan
   </i>
   (with Hearst Magazines) and
   <i>
    China Computer Reseller World.
   </i>
   Later that year the company launched
   <i>
    The Industry Standard
   </i>
   and spun off 25% of IDG Books to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 it sold a 20% stake in Industry Standard Communications (renamed Standard Media International) to private investors and began laying plans for a possible spinoff in 2000. However, a weakening economy and slowing ad sales in 2000 quieted those plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year both Standard Media and Hungry Minds announced staff cuts and restructuring. IDG eventually sold its majority interest in Hungry Minds to John Wiley &amp; Sons for about $90 million. Standard Media filed for bankruptcy and liquidated its assets, some of which were bought by IDG. The company also purchased Ziff Davis' 50% stake in their joint venture Mac Publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 IDG CEO Kelly Conlin left the business and was replaced by company executive Pat Kenealy, who had previously founded the now-defunct
   <em>
    Digital News
   </em>
   magazine. Kenealy stepped down in 2006 to become managing partner of IDG Ventures. He was replaced by Bob Carrigan in 2008.
