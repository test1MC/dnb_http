   Johnson Matthey's revenues decreased by 10% in 2015 due to a21% decline in Precious Metal Products impacted by the change in its contracts with
   <company id="107437">
    Anglo American Platinum
   </company>
   which reduced sales by 12% as a result of decline in commission income, and also due to lower average precious metal prices and weakness in some of its manufacturing businesses' markets such as China. All other segments reported growth in revenue except fine chemicals which had flat revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 26% due to profit on the sale of its precious metal products' gold and silver refining business to
   <company id="170591">
    Asahi Holdings
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash flow decreased by 74% as the result of an increase in cash used in inventories due to higher inventories.

  <p>
   The company's 3C Strategy stands for  Collaborate, Customer Focus and Create Value.Johnson Matthey is also focused on maintaining differentiation through technology by investing in R&amp;D and it aims to deliver superior growth in existing and new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developing a larger presence in oil and gas markets is a key part of its overall strategy. The company is targeting opportunities with sales potential of around £200 million per annum in ten years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alongside organic development Johnson Matthey also focuses on growth through acquisitions. In pursuit of its strategy to focus on value adding sustainable technologies, the company has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions this year, including two in our new business area of battery technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Active worldwide, the company has been concentrating on expanding its business in China and India. In the former, Johnson Matthey focuses on catalysts that will control nitrogen oxide emissions from China's massive coal industry. The company has set a long-term strategy of focusing on leading-edge catalysts, using technology as a differentiator, keeping platinum group metals (PGMs) as a major part of its operations, and concentrating on organic growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company sold its Precious Metal Products' Gold and Silver Refining business to Asahi Holdings, a collector, refiner and recycler of precious and rare metals from waste materials, for £124.3 million. This is in line with the group's long term strategy to focus on areas where it can use its expertise in chemistry and its applications to deliver high technology solutions or that provide a strategic service to the rest of the group.

  <p>
   Percival Johnson set up an assayer's shop in London in 1817. Using chemical and physical tests, he determined the amount of gold in a given bar and guaranteed his results by offering to buy the bars he assayed. Johnson then set up a gold refinery in the early 1830s and developed a method for extracting platinum group metals. As part of that process, he produced vitreous colors for pottery and glass, refined nickel, and silver nitrate for medical use and, later, for photographic uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   George Matthey joined the company in 1838 and championed the platinum business, securing a steady supply of platinum from Russia. The company thrived on business generated by gold rushes in California (1849) and Australia (1851). It built a silver refinery to melt down European coinage and extract component metals, and in 1870 it bought a company that produced magnesium, antimony, vanadium, and aluminum. In 1891 the company became Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co. Limited. Around the turn of the century, it bought rolling mills and began forming metals into sheet, tube, and wire to better serve jewelers.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co. provided platinum catalysts and magnesium powder for explosives, and in WWII the company was appointed the government's agent for controlling platinum stocks. Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co. expanded its international operations rapidly during the post-war boom, adding holdings in Australia, India, North America, and South Africa. It established subsidiaries in France and the Netherlands (1956), Italy (1959), Sweden (1960), Belgium (1961), and Austria (1962). The company also began conducting research on automotive catalytic converters to reduce pollution. It formed Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB) to carry out its banking and trading activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   A foray into the US jewelry business led to big losses in 1980, and the company pressed JMB to make higher-risk loans. JMB's contribution to profits went from less than 25% in 1981 (the year the company took its present name) to more than 60% in 1983. The bank ended up with so many bad loans that the Bank of England had to arrange a bailout in 1984. Gene Anderson, who became CEO in 1985, cut 3,000 jobs and reduced the number of divisions from 78 to 4. Profits rebounded, but Anderson resigned in 1989 after failing to persuade the board to diversify away from platinum.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s the company invested heavily in its electronics division, which had been doing well since the 1989 acquisition of Cominco Electronic Materials (ultra-pure metals for microchips). By 1995 the division was responsible for about a third of Johnson Matthey's profits. In 1998 it bought Cookson Group's 50% share of its ceramics joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Johnson Matthey shifted its focus to three core businesses: catalysts, colors and coatings, and precious metals. The next year it sold its electronic materials business, Johnson Matthey Electronics, to US-based AlliedSignal (now Honeywell International) and began looking for takeover opportunities in its core markets. In 2001 the company acquired pharmaceuticals manufacturers Meconic (now Macfarlan Smith; it's the UK's only maker of medical opiates -- cocaine and heroin) and Pharm-Eco, then used these acquisitions as the basis for a fourth division: Pharmaceutical Materials (now a part of its Fine Chemicals and Catalysts Division).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company acquired Cascade Biochem Limited to strengthen its Pharmaceutical Materials division, and metal catalyst company Synetix. CEO Chris Clark retired in 2003. He was succeeded by Neil Carson, former executive director of the precious metals and catalysts operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the sale of its Pigments &amp; Dispersions unit to Rockwood Pigments in 2004, Johnson Matthey restructured its Colours and Coatings division by closing several of its manufacturing sites and transferring some operations to its Precious Metal Products division. The moves created what became the Ceramics division, the 2007 sale of which was the last in the dismantling of the Colours and Coatings division.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the beginning of 2008, the company acquired the Argillon Group, which manufactured catalysts and advanced ceramic materials, from Ceramics Luxembourg (owned by
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   ). Later that year, Johnson Matthey sold the acquired ceramic insulators alumina business for about $40 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 a Johnson Matthey subsidiary formed a joint venture with Aoxing Pharmaceutical to manufacture ingredients for narcotics and neurological drugs for the Chinese market. That same year, Johnson Matthey acquired Intercat, a supplier of fluid catalytic cracking services for the petroleum refining industry, for $56 million. It became part of Johnson Matthey's Process Technologies division's Ammonia, Methanol, Oil and Gas unit.
