   Packaging small stuff is big business for Huhtamäki. The Finnish giant manufactures rigid, thin-walled plastic and paper packaging, as well as molded fiber to hold consumer goods. Originally a candy maker, it has repackaged itself into a group of packaging businesses. Huhtamäki caters to diverse range of restaurant, fresh food, retail, pet food, and non-food consumer packaging markets. Its lineup includes paper cups and molded plates for

   , and other foodservice outlets; trays for frozen food and deli items as well as eggs and fruit; disposable tableware; and flexible tubes, pouches, and films. Top brands are Bibo, Chinet, and Lily, and BioWare. Huhtamäki also supplies a variety of packaging systems.

   Huhtamäki and Van Leer both got started around the same time, but took different directions before 1999 (the year Huhtamäki acquired Royal Packaging Industries Van Leer for $1 billion). Heikki Huhtamäki founded his company in western Finland in 1920. A baker's son, he made sweets, biscuits, bread, cider, and jams. The company branched into pharmaceuticals from sweets through the manufacture of medical confectionery; its experience in packaging came from packaging its own products. A longtime philanthropist, he donated the majority of his company's shares to the Finnish Cultural Foundation in 1943.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Netherlands, Bernard van Leer founded the Van Leer company to produce small cans, cartons, and boxes in 1919. The company met its destiny in 1925 when Shell Oil ordered 10,000 steel drums. Soon steel drums and drum enclosures were the company's main business. However, the company diversified into other packaging areas, especially after WWII. A philanthropist like Huhtamäki, Bernard van Leer founded a foundation named after himself to which he left his fortune upon his death in 1958. (The Bernard van Leer Foundation still supports programs for disadvantaged children.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Back in Finland, Huhtamäki's fortunes in the 1960s were closely tied to those of the Soviet Union. During that time the company diversified into nearly everything from engineering and electronics to advertising. By the 1970s Huhtamäki was involved in more than a dozen businesses. It was in the early 1980s that the company decided to focus on three areas: chewing gum and candy, fast-food packaging, and pharmaceuticals. It also expanded its international operations; by 1992 almost 80% of its sales were international.
  </p>
  <p>
   Huhtamäki made three big confectionery acquisitions in 1983, picking up Beatrice's Beatrice Confections (Good &amp; Plenty, Jolly Rancher), General Mills' Donruss division (bubble gum and trading cards), and Leaf Confectionery (Whoppers). It gathered its treats around the Leaf banner and added Chuckles, Heath Bar, PayDay, Chewits, and Sportlife. Sweets accounted for 55% of sales by 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's packaging expansion, centered around its Polarcup brand of food packaging and disposable food service products, moved into Southeast Asia in the wake of major fast-food chains. Huhtamäki's pharmaceutical operations centered on reproductive health care products, most notably Norplant (implantable female contraceptive), which had been approved as part of Indonesia's national contraception program.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bottom fell out of the collectable sports card market in the early 1990s. The company closed about half of Leaf's North American plants and in 1996 sold its North American confectionery operations to Hershey. Huhtamäki sold its pharmaceuticals operations that year in a decision to focus on packaging and European confectionery. In 1998 it bought Sealright (paperboard ice cream containers).
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Van Leer (at that point known as Royal Packaging Industries Van Leer) had built an industrial packaging business around steel, fiber, and plastic drums and closures, intermediate bulk containers, and polycarbonate water bottles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Huhtamäki sold its other confection operations to focus solely on packaging. The company also boosted its South American presence by acquiring 86% of top Brazilian food packaging company Brasholanda. More importantly, that year Huhtamäki acquired Van Leer and became Huhtamäki Van Leer. The Van Leer acquisition doubled sales and also added Chinet (disposable tableware) to the company's holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Huhtamäki Van Leer acquired U.S.-based Packaging Resources Incorporated, a maker of plastic packaging products, for $185 million. The company also announced that it was selling its industrial packaging operations to US-based Greif Bros. The $555 million deal closed early in 2001, and the company decided at that time to drop Van Leer from its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the highly competitive American paper market struggled to recover from an economic downtown, in April 2002 Huhtamäki Americas closed its Waterford, Connecticut, plant and began consolidating operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its plan to streamline operations and consolidate facilities, in mid-2006 Huhtamäki sold its France- and Portugal-based expanded polystyrene (EPS) packaging operations to France-based Ono Packaging.
