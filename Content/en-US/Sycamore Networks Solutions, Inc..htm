   The routes of Sycamore Networks flourish in light soil. The company makes optical switching equipment and other products (cross-connects, access platforms) used by communications service providers to build fiber-optic networks. Its core network switches and related software enable phone companies, ISPs, cable companies, and other network service providers to deliver their voice and high-speed data services to subscribers. The company is also working to develop a platform (IQstream) for mobile broadband optimization. Sycamore makes about two-thirds of its sales in the US. In late 2012 it agreed to sell most of its operations to

    Marlin Equity Partners
   </company>
   and liquidate the rest of its holdings.

        <p>
   Sycamore markets its products through a direct sales force, as well as through resellers and distributors in certain markets. Major customers include the government systems unit of Sprint Nextel (21% of sales),

   (16%), and

   (12% of sales).

        <p>
   The global economic crisis and recession hit Sycamore's customers hard, and the networking equipment supplier has had difficulty driving its sales back up despite a recovery in IT and telecom spending. The company's sales fell below $50 million in 2011 for the first time in seven years. Sycamore did see a jump of more than 15% in fiscal 2012 (ended July) as the timing of customer deployments drove revenue up to $57 million, but its sales are highly concentrated in a small number of customers and the company believes the market it serves is in decline.

        <p>
   Sycamore, which hasn't been profitable since 2006, reported a loss of nearly $13 million in 2012.

        <p>
   Sycamore has attributed its fiscal performance to the decline of its core bandwidth management market, so the company slated future investments in its existing product line primarily for support and maintenance efforts, rather than the development of new features. Looking ahead, Sycamore began investing in new products, such as IQstream (introduced in 2011), that enhance mobile broadband services.

   In late 2012 -- in a move described by CEO Daniel Smith as in the best interests of shareholders, employees, and customers -- the company agreed to sell its primary assets to Marlin Equity Partners and liquidate the rest of its holdings.
