  <p>
   TT's biggest business, supplying 40% of revenue, is its Transportation Sensing and Control division. It develops sensors and controls for automotive OEMs and tier one suppliers, which include providers of powertrains for passenger cars and trucks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another 29% of revenue comes from the Integrated Manufacturing Services division. It provides complex electronic manufacturing to customers in the aerospace and defense, medical, and technology sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Advanced Components division makes specialized and highly engineered electronic components for circuit protection, power management, signal conditioning, and connectivity in harsh environments. It accounts for 19% of TT's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   TT's Industrial Sensing and Control division, 12% of revenue, makes sensors industrial automation, industrial process control, medical, and aerospace applications.

  <p>
   TT reported 14% revenue growth in Asia in 2015, but lost ground in most of its major markets such as Europe (down 8%) and the UK (off 4%).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   An 11% drop in revenue from Transportation Sensing and Control led to an overall 3% revenue drop in 2015 from 2014 for TT Electronics. The decrease came mainly from contractual price reductions and lower volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, however, popped up to more than £10 million in 2015, reversing a £10 million loss in 2014. The big change to profitability came from reductions in administrative expenses following a restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 cash from operations jumped 92% higher from2014 because of change in payables.

  <p>
   TT Electronics has moved to strengthen its products and operations through more financial discipline and targeting of new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Europe and North America, TT has shifted significant operations to lower cost areas. In Europe the company moved some manufacturing lines from Germany to Romania and in North America, it transferred some operations from California to Mexico. The changes cost the company less than it expected and it reported that savings should appear as early as 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   TT expanded in China with several new contracts. It's making accelerator pedals, an oil temperature sensor for a Chinese transmission manufacturer, and a crankshaft sensor. A recent project for a chassis height sensor launched in Europe and China.

  <p>
   In December 2015 TT Electronics acquired Aero Stanrew Group Limited for about £44 million. Aero Stanrew designs and produces electromagnetic components and electronic systems for harsh environments and safety critical applications. The acquisition extends TT's capabilities in the aerospace and defense.

   acquisitions manager John Newman and stockbroker Nicholas Shipp acquired architectural fittings group James Gibbons Format in 1977. The two continued buying manufacturing companies, focusing on well-established firms with good market shares but poor management. Unlike some takeover specialists, Newman and Shipp were fearless in taking on money losers and turning them around. In 1986 they merged into Tyzack Turner and became a public company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the renamed TT Group entered the electronics field by acquiring Crystalate Holdings, a UK-based maker of passive electronic components. It continued buying such companies, including Colvern, a UK maker of potentiometers, and US-based International Resistive Co., and by the early 1990s TT Group was one of the UK's fastest growing firms. In 1992 the group acquired Magnetic Materials, which was then losing money. Newman worked on improving efficiency and cutting costs, and by year's end it was again making money.
  </p>
  <p>
   TT Group almost doubled its sales in 1993 by buying AB Electronics, which was losing more than $1 million a month and had about $40 million in debt. Again, turning the company around involved cost and staff cuts and increased capital spending. TT Group issued stock to reduce debt and fund its increased capital spending, and growth resumed. Newman stated, "We will buy any manufacturing business, as long as we understand it and the deal stands up on its own financially."
