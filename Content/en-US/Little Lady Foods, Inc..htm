   This Little Lady serves up man-sized portions of frozen food. Little Lady Foods is a leading supplier of frozen food products for the foodservice and retail food industries. With facilities in the greater Chicago area, the company makes stone-fired and kid-sized pizzas and a line of sandwiches that includes breakfast sandwiches, paninis, and wrap-style sandwiches on tortillas and flatbreads. The company markets its sandwiches for restaurants, lunch stands, and retail operators worldwide. It also offers sweet goods, including an apple pancake, muffins, and turnovers. Little Lady Foods, founded in 1961, provides custom product design, creation, and marketing services for private-label customers.

  <p>
   Hopping on the health wagon and looking to cater further to private-label customers, Little Lady Foods has developed several items that help to serve health-conscious consumers. It has rolled out a line of organic pizzas that are topped with gourmet ingredients, such as fire-roasted peppers and diced artichoke hearts. The food company also launched a line of all-natural pizzas that are preservative-free. To serve retailers the likes of

    Starbucks
   </company>
   , which sell sandwiches and breakfast items to better compete with
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   , Little Lady Foods offers lean gourmet sandwiches and paninis that come in low-carb, low-fat, and wheat-alternative varieties.
  </p>
  <p>
   What sets Little Lady Foods apart from some food makers is that the specialty frozen food manufacturer creates custom products for its customers. To this end, it enlists the help of celebrity chefs such as Rick Bayless, who partnered with Little Lady Foods to roll out a premium line of gourmet Mexican pizzas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Little Lady Foods launched an upscale Thin &amp; Crispy Take and Bake Pizza for in-store deli programs, as restaurants and retailers also prefer carrying thin crust. The new variety features a thin crust with a crunchy panko breadcrumb on the bottom (via a stone-firing process) and bold sauces.
