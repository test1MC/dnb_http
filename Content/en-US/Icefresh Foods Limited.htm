It works with a number of mostly Belgium, French, German, Dutch, and Finnish food manufacturers, which it refers to as Principals, who produce its products. These manufacturers include Belgian Icecream, Glacio, Quality Pastries, and Poppies International. Icefresh's customers include retail grocery, foodservice, and food manufacturing companies in the UK. Icefresh Foods was founded in 1983 to import frozen vegetables from Spain and ice lollies from the Netherlands.
