   Antares Pharma understands antagonism towards needles. The company develops needle-free systems for administering injectable drugs. Its Medi-Jector Vision system, for instance, injects a thin, high-pressure stream of liquid, eliminating the need for a needle. The Vision system is used primarily for the delivery of insulin and of human growth hormones (hGH) and Vibex disposable pen injectors carry epinephrine and other products. The products are available in the US and overseas. In addition to its needle-free systems, the company develops other drug-delivery platforms, including topical gels, orally administered disintegrating tablets, and mini-needle injection systems.

  <p>
   Much of the company's revenue, particularly for its injection devices, comes via agreements with pharmaceutical partners, which sell its needle-free injectors along with their drugs. Antares' multi-product deal with manufacturer
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   includes hGH and epinephrine delivery systems. Dutch drug firm
   <company id="138873">
    Ferring
   </company>
   , which distributes Antares' needle-free device for use with its hGH hormone, is another key customer. Teva and Ferring each account for a third of Antares' sales.

   Its first topical gel product, the Elestrin treatment for menopausal symptoms, is marketed by
   <company id="161541">
    Meda Pharma
   </company>
   . Gelnique, another menopause-related treatment, is marketed by Actavis.

  <p>
   Antares has two facilities in the US; it markets its products in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia through partners. The US accounts for about three-quarters of revenue.

  <p>
   For 2012 revenue jumped nearly 40% on the strength of its agreements with Teva, milestone payments from undisclosed development projects, and other partner payouts. R&amp;D spending, however, lead to an $11 million net loss as the company works on a rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The company issued stock during the year and finished with positive cash flow. Though Antares has been experiencing revenue growth, continued R&amp;D and marketing expenses have it operating at an accumulated deficit of $152 million.

  <p>
   Going forward, Antares just has to keep developing products and finding marketing partners to help sell them. To cut the risk a bit, it usually partners with others for R&amp;D, which keeps the money flowing in the form of milestone payments.

  <p>
   Antares was formed in 2001 when Medi-Ject (the company's former name) completed a reverse acquisition of Permatec, a Swiss company with expertise in topical and oral drug delivery technologies. Director Jacques Gonella, the founder of Permatec, owns about 15% of Antares Pharma.
