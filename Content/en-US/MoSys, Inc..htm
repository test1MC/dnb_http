   MoSys (formerly Monolithic System Technology) works to keep its licensing mojo workin.' The company knows it can't match the Goliaths of the memory market, so rather than spend a lot of time and money on development, it focuses on licensing the designs of its embedded memory chips for the high-speed networking, communications, storage and computing markets. The fabless semiconductor company licenses its 1T-SRAM technology to manufacturers, which in turn make the chips and embed them in communications and consumer electronics devices. The 1T-SRAM products are sold under the Bandwidth Engine brand. Other products are in the company's LineSpeed line integrated circuits.

  <p>
   As a fabless company, MoSys uses contract manufacturers to make, package, assemble, and test its chips.
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
   </company>
   (TMSC) makes the chips, while Taiwan-based
   <company id="43476">
    ASE
   </company>
   and US-based Evans Analytical Group perform assembly, packaging, and production testing. It also uses
   <company id="105955">
    eSilicon Corporation
   </company>
   for additional manufacturing and testing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some 55% of the company's revenue comes from product sales with royalties supplying the other 45%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   MoSys has an engineering design center in India and sales and support offices in China and Japan. Customers in North America generate just more than half of sales. Taiwan and Japan account for 33% and 15%, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has a small direct sales team, with fewer than 10 employees. In addition, MoSys uses sales representatives and distributors such as
   <company id="179397">
    Macnica
   </company>
   in Asia and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   MoSys has a limited number of customers; its top three (
   <company id="43493">
    TSMC
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="161701">
    Renesas
   </company>
   ) account for about three-quarters of of sales. Other customers include
   <company id="59439">
    Brocade Communications Systems
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="159600">
    Fujitsu
   </company>
   .

   Revenue was lower, but MoSys reduced its loss and generated more cash in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue slid 10% in 2015 to $4.4 million from $5.4 million in 2014. Royalty revenue continued to drop, falling 36% in 2015 due to fewer shipments of products using the company's intellectual property. The company's ICs, however, shipped in bigger numbers, raising revenue. The company now makes more money from products than licensing.
  </p>
  <p>
   MoSys took a tiny chunk out its loss in 2015, cutting it to $31.5 million from $32.7 million largely through reduction of R&amp;D and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to $29.5 million in 2015 from $26.3 million in 2014.

  <p>
   As fewer consumer electronics (like Nintendo) use its 1T-SRAM technology, MoSys is shifting from licensing and royalty operations to predominately IC product sales. It is focused on combining its proprietary IP and design capabilities to address the needs of next-generation advanced networking equipment. Its initial strategy is to target the multi-billion dollar networking and telecommunications equipment market, which includes OEMs such as Cisco, Fujitsu, and
   <company id="140691">
    ZTE
   </company>
   . To date, it has secured 85 design wins.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has made its GigaChip Interface Protocol an open industry standard to encourage adoption by other vendors for serial communication on network line cards and encourage adoption of its Bandwidth Engine IC products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company introduced the MoSys Programmable Search Engine (PSE), a monolithic IC designed for packet processor offload using 32 search optimized processing engines, data access schedulers, and more than a terabit of internal access bandwidth.
