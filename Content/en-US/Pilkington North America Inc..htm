  <p>
   In line with its parent's strategy, a key focus for Pilkington North America's future is expanding its solar energy portfolio within its building products segment. The company anticipates an increase in volumes and that sales of solar energy glass will contribute a significant portion of those higher volumes. Although some of its float glass production lines were suspended during the economic crisis, some have since been converted into solar energy lines and are coming back on stream to support its expansion particularly in photovoltaics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product introductions are also a key part of Pilkington North America's growth strategy. In 2014 it introduced Pilkington MirroView 50/50, which enhances the standard MirroView's visual performance for a brightly lit environment, such as a store or showroom, and Pilkington OptiView Pro, a non-conductive anti-reflection coating especially designed for touch screen applications. In 2013 the company introduced Optiwhite which widens the color choice.
