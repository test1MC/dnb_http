   As the US pharmaceuticals unit of Swiss drug giant
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis AG
   </company>
   , Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) helps with the development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of its parent company's products in the US. Its product lines address a range of ailments including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, central nervous system disorders, cancers, bone and skin conditions, infectious diseases, and organ transplant complications. NPC's key products include tumor growth inhibitor Gleevec, high blood pressure drug Diovan, and attention deficit disorder therapies Focalin and Ritalin. NPC markets its products through an in-house sales team.

  <p>
   NPC represents the best of both worlds for parent Novartis AG: It is part of the global Novartis Pharmaceuticals division, which accounts for more than half of the parent company's annual revenues, and it is also a major player in the US market, which is Novartis' largest geographic segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its medicines for cancers, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and organ transplant complications, NPC offers treatments for endocrine disease, inflammatory diseases, and others.

  <p>
   Most of NPC's preclinical research efforts are conducted through US-based affiliate Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), while clinical-stage development programs are conducted at Novartis sites around the globe.

  <p>
   NPC markets its products through a dedicated force of sales representatives and specialists. Marketing initiatives are conducted online, through partnerships with external web firms, and an e-sales force.

  <p>
   NPC widens its offerings in the US market through a number of methods including internal research programs, licensing agreements, and acquisitions. In 2015, the company received approval from the US FDA for its Cosentyx product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults eligible for systemic therapy (drug absorbed through the bloodstream) or phototherapy (light therapy).

  <p>
   As part of its parent's efforts to focus on eye care, generics, and innovative pharmaceuticals, NPC remains a vital part of Novartis' growth strategy. One area of growing interest is oncology; in 2015 Novartis acquired certain cancer-fighting products and pipeline compounds from
