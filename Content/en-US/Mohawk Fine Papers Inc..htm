   Mohawk's business is about more than looking good on paper -- it's a North American privately held premium papermaker. Mohawk Fine Papers produces a plethora of papers for offset and digital printing, used for corporate brochures/reports, as well as photo books, packaging, and handwritten notes. Most of its papers and envelopes are made with recycled content and are sold under such brands as Mohawk, BriteHue, Loop, Opaque, Carnival, Kromekote, Skytone, Strathmore, and Beckett. Mohawk manages multiple mills, paper machines, converting centers, and warehouses, distributing to printing markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company is owned by the family of founder George O'Connor.

   Mohawk acknowledges that it has become a paper maker in an increasing digital world. In 2013 it created two new business divisions to ensure the growth of its emerging digital business, while also securing the future of its core paper business: Mohawk Fine Paper and Mohawk Digital. The company is focused on building and enhancing its digital capabilities by developing new product lines and growing its sales organization to support its expansion. In 2013 Mohawk expanded its line of digital synthetic products and upgraded its website to allow for digital printing.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots back to the 1860s as the Mohawk and Hudson Paper Company, producing sheets out of a former ax-handle factory. By 1878 the company -- then known as the Frank Gilbert Paper Company -- was churning out 900 tons of paper per year on three paper machines. Mohawk's capacity has grown to more than 175,000 tons. George O'Connor purchased the predecessor business in 1931.
