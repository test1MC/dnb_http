   When it comes to producing plastic products, Jablite is the prince of polystyrene. As part of Synbra Group bv (a holding company based in The Netherlands), Jablite is the UK's largest producer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation products. The company supplies EPS products to the construction, civil engineering, marine, and do-it-yourself industries. Its products are used to make adhesives and roofing, bridging, and floor components. The company also makes products used for flotation, interior decoration, and structural foundations. Jablite was established in 1973.

   In an environmentally friendly new world, Jablite is banking on an increased demand for its polystyrene insulation products as more companies and industries strive for energy efficiency and a reduction in carbon emissions. To help distribute its products, Jablite works in tandem with Styropack, another company owned by Synbra Group. Styropack makes and sells molded packaging to customers in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also is developing new products to meet market demands. It aims to launch at least 5 new products or product developments each year. In 2014 it launched a new tapered insulation for inverted roofs that meets best practice standards and also reduces maintenance costs.
