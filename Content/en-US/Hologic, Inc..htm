   Hologic markets a variety of women's health products focused on four areas: breast health, diagnostics, surgical health, and skeletal health. Lead products include the Selenia digital mammography system, the ThinPrep Pap test for cervical cancer screening, the NovaSure System to treat excessive bleeding, bone densitometry systems, and Fluoroscan Mini C-arm Imaging systems used to guide doctors during orthopedic surgery. Hologic sells its products to hospitals and clinical labs worldwide through distributors and a direct sales force.
  </p>

  <p>
   Nearly half of Hologic's sales comes from its range of diagnostic products, which are used to detect human diseases and screen donated blood and plasma. Breast health products (about 40% of sales) include digital mammography systems and breast biopsy site markers, devices, and guidance systems. GYN surgical products (more than 10%) include the NovaSure endometrial ablation system and the MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system. Finally, the smallest category of products, skeletal health products, include Discovery and Horizon X-ray bone densitomoters and mini C-arm imaging systems to assist in surgical procedures on extremities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to making big systems, Hologic manufactures some of the specialized materials and parts used in its big systems. However, third parties manufacture its molecular diagnostics instruments. KMC Systems makes the Tigris instrument, while
   <company id="162497">
    Stratec Biomedical

   makes the Panther line and
   <company id="46895">
    Flex International
   </company>
   makes its skeletal health products.

  <p>
   About 80% of Hologic's product sales are generated in the US. The rest of its sales are generated in Europe, the Asia/Pacific region, and other international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to manufacturing facilities in the US, the company has manufacturing operations abroad, including in Costa Rica and the UK.

  <p>
   Hologic sells and services its products through a direct sales team and service personnel, as well as through independent distributors and sales reps. Customers include clinical labs, health care providers, surgeons, and hospitals, as well as specialists such as obstetricians/gynecologists, radiologists, and breast surgeons.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company typically spends between $14 and $20 million on advertising each year.

   Revenue has been steadily rising over the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended September), revenue increased 5% to $2.8 billion, as the company's three primary segments (diagnostics, breast health, and GYN surgical) saw growth. The largest growth took place in the GYN surgical business, which rose 17% that year on higher MyoSure and NovaSure system sales. However, smaller sales led to a 6% decline in the skeletal health segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   After suffering a $1.2 billion loss in 2013 due to a sharp increase in operating expenses, the company has made a solid recovery. Net income rose 151% to $330.8 million in fiscal 2016. This gain occurred due to both higher product and service revenues, plus a reduction in restructuring charges and other operating expenses.

  <p>
   Hologic works to keep its product portfolio filled with a diverse range of products to help diagnose and treat an array of women's health problems. Acquisitions have helped it round out its product lines and stay current in its highly competitive industry. The company is also focused on international expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up in an industry in which technology is constantly evolving, Hologic conducts research and development to come up with the next-generation versions of its existing products, integrate acquired products into its existing systems, and design new products. It has recently launched 3D Dimensions product (for 3D and 2D breast imaging), as well as making improvements to next-generation laboratory automation and gynecological surgical products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To gain some financial flexibility and focus on core operations, Hologic sold its stake in a blood screening business to longtime partner
   <company id="154240">
    Grifols
   </company>
   for $1.9 billion in early 2017. It then agreed to buy
   <company id="139921">
    Cynosure
   </company>
   for $1.7 billion in a deal which will provide entry into the growing medical aesthetics market. Cynosure does business in the thriving non-invasive body contouring fat reduction arena; more than half of its business is derived from channels other than plastic surgery and dermatology, with a focus on the OB/GYN channel. Its operations will complement Hologic's existing activities in women's health.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has faced a number of challenges in recent years including industry competition, health care reform, and patent fights. Hologic is also feeling a bit squeezed by new recommended guidelines that women reduce the frequency of pap smears and move annual mammograms to age 50 instead of 40. These new guidelines have the long-term potential of reducing new orders for breast screening and pap smear products as more women delay the procedures. An additional pinch on its bottom line is looming as the
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
   </company>
   has reduced the rates at which it will reimburse for bone density screenings. With lower reimbursements for the procedures, providers are less inclined to spend to upgrade their systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2015, Hologic shuttered its Bedford, Massachusetts, manufacturing facility; it also outsourced the production of some skeletal health products to a third party and transferred certain breast health production to other domestic facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 1981 S. David Ellenbogen and Jay Stein founded Diagnostic Technology (DTI) and developed a digital angiography product. A Squibb subsidiary bought DTI in 1982, and three years later, Ellenbogen and Stein founded Hologic.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm shipped its first bone scanner in 1987 and went public in 1990. Increased global focus on women's health fueled Hologic's growth in 1994. That year it penetrated the Latin American and Japanese markets, and Medicare patients started receiving reimbursement for bone density examinations. Also in 1994 Hologic partnered with Serex to develop a test to monitor biochemical indicators of bone loss (Ostex International joined the effort in 1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   Targeting private practices requiring less-expensive equipment, Hologic bought Walker Magnetic Group's ultrasound bone analyzer business and that of European rival Sophia Medical Systems in 1995. That year it purchased FluoroScan Imaging Systems, a maker of X-ray equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company introduced its Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer in the US. In 1999 Hologic acquired Direct Radiography, another X-ray equipment maker. That year Fleet Business Credit, which had an agreement with Hologic through which it purchased bone densitometers and then leased them to physicians, pulled out of the partnership; sales sank, and Hologic filed a lawsuit against Fleet to recoup losses. Also in 1999 Hologic sold its Medical Data Management division to focus on core operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company bought the US operations of medical imaging company Trex Medical Corporation. This acquisition added the Lorad-brand line of mammography and breast biopsy systems, to Hologic's operations. The acquisition was costly, and, to recover, Hologic implemented a restructuring plan in 2001 that led to a reduction of the workforce, a reduction of operating expenses, and phasing out unprofitable units. The company closed its conventional X-ray equipment manufacturing facility in Littleton, Massachusetts, and relocated some of the product lines and personnel to Bedford, Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   With a renewed appetite for growth, in 2005 Hologic resumed its acquisition strategy, starting with the purchase of
   <company id="15347">
    Fischer Imaging
   </company>
   's SenoScan digital mammography and MammoTest stereotactic breast biopsy systems for $32 million. The following year it acquired
   <company id="104939">
    R2 Technology
   </company>
   for $220 million to gain that company's computer-aided detection (CAD) technology. Also in 2006 it acquired breast biopsy and tissue excision device producer Suros Surgical Systems for $240 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hologic's biggest jump in growth came when it paid more than $6 billion in 2007 to purchase its larger neighbor Cytyc. The two companies had discussed a tie-up off and on for a number of years; when they finally joined forces it created a women's health care behemoth with expected annual revenues of nearly $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with expanding its product lines, Hologic made the acquisition to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities that arose from combining the two companies' complementary product lines. Cytyc added products in the areas of cervical cancer screening, prenatal diagnostics, and breast cancer treatment to Hologic's existing portfolio of breast health and osteoporosis products.
