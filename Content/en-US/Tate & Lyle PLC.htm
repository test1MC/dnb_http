   Ingredients are the key to Tate &amp; Lyle's success. The company manufactures specialty food ingredients and bulk ingredients. Each of the two businesses run their own plants to transform raw materials into bulk or specialty food ingredients, used by global makers of food and beverages and, less so, animal-feed, pharmaceutical and personal care, and industrial products. Specialty Food Ingredients comprise sucralose, the no-calorie sweetener sold under the brand SPLENDA, starch-based specialty ingredients, and custom blends (food systems). Bulk Ingredients include sweeteners, industrial starches, acidulants and ethanol, and co-products.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tate &amp; Lyle's two business segments, Specialty Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients, have separate manufacturing and commercial operations, including ingredient production facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bulk Ingredients is the larger of the two, representing around 60% of global sales, and sells commodities such as high fructose corn syrup, industrial starches and acidulants in large quantities. Specialty Food, which brings in the remaining 40% or so of sales, sells food products that use technology or intellectual property in their creation, including sweetener Splenda, texturants such as starch and gums, and wellness ingredients like Promitor dietary fibres, PromOat Beta Glucan and Soda-Lo Salt Microspheres.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tate &amp; Lyle also operates two segment-spanning global units -- Innovation &amp; Commercial Development, and Global Operations. The former works to develop new products, while the latter operates Tate &amp; Lyle's manufacturing facilities, such as its corn wet mills, and is also responsible for supply and demand planning and materials sourcing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tate &amp; Lyle is a UK-listed, London-based company, but its home market only accounts for some 1% of revenue -- the vast majority is generated in the US, and the company maintains significant operations in the country. The company has a presence in over 30 countries worldwide.

  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended March), revenue was up 1% on prior year to £2.4 billion after a small increase in revenue in Specialty Ingredients marginally outweighed a slight decline in Bulk Ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased strongly in 2016, coming in at £163 million versus £30 million in 2015. The increase was mostly as a result of a decrease in exceptional items. Cash from operating activities increased 5% to £188 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tate &amp; Lyle stands to benefit from changes in consumer tastes towards convenience food and health and wellness products. Its non-sugar sweeteners in Specialty Ingredients can be used in place of sugar, which is undergoing a reputational crisis after a shift in scientific consensus towards sugar being the primary factor behind obesity. It introduced Dolcia Prima Low-Calorie Sugar in 2015 as a result.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company now fully owns its corn wet mill in Slovakia, which will help it meet growing demand for specialty ingredient products. It also restructured its Splenda sucralose business, leading to the closure of its Singapore facility, which was transferred to Alabama.
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of geographic strategy, Tate &amp; Lyle is focusing its Bulk Ingredients segment away from the unstable and unpredictable European market and towards the greater stability provided by the North American market.

  <p>
   In 2014, Tate &amp; Lyle acquired Winway Biotechnology Nantong, a Chinese producer of polydextrose specialty fibre. The acquisition will expand Tate &amp; Lyle's presence in the Asia-Pacific region, and strengthen its health and wellness offering globally.

  <p>
   Henry Tate founded Henry Tate &amp; Sons in 1869 and the next year began building a sugar refinery in Liverpool. Tate was noted for his philanthropy, and in 1896 he provided the money to found the Tate Gallery. When he died three years later, he left the business to his sons. In 1903 William Henry Tate took the company public, although only 17 investors, primarily family members, put up money for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Abram Lyle founded his sugar company in 1881 when he bought Odam's and Plaistow Wharves, on the River Thames, to build a sugar refinery. While Tate focused on sugar cubes, Lyle concentrated on a sugary concoction called Golden Syrup.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWI saw an interruption in raw beet sugar imports from Germany and Austria, and in 1918 the two companies began discussing a merger. Although they combined, creating Tate &amp; Lyle in 1921, they kept separate sales organizations into the 1940s. Seeking new sources of sugar, Tate &amp; Lyle began investing abroad. In 1937 it created the West Indies Sugar Company and built a processing plant in Jamaica.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although WWII brought sugar rationing (1940) and both of Tate &amp; Lyle's London factories were severely damaged by bombs, there was great demand for the company's inexpensive syrup. Following the war, a movement to nationalize Tate &amp; Lyle failed. In the 1950s Tate &amp; Lyle expanded, buying Rhodesian Sugar Refineries (1953, now ZSR) and Canada &amp; Dominion Sugar Company (1959, later Redpath Industries). It added United Molasses in 1965.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tate &amp; Lyle acquired the only other independent British cane refiner, Manbre and Garton, in 1976. That year it entered the US market when it bought Refined Sugars. The company added Portuguese sugar refiner Alcântara in 1983; US beet refiner Great Western Sugar Company in 1985; and Staley Continental (now A E Staley Manufacturing), a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, in 1988. It sold Staley's food service business to
   <company id="11423">
    SYSCO
   </company>
   that year and bought Amstar Sugar Corporation (which became Domino Sugar). Tate &amp; Lyle launched Splenda Sucralose, a low-calorie sweetener, in 1992 in cooperation with
   <company id="40403">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . The company began investing millions in emerging markets in 1990 through acquisitions and joint ventures, including Mexico's Occidente in 1995. Although operations in Ukraine and Bulgaria were abandoned the next year, Tate &amp; Lyle continued with new ventures in Vietnam and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Larry Pillard became CEO in 1996. Sucralose was approved for use in the US in 1998. The company reported disappointing profits that year due in part to low sugar prices in the US. Also in 1998 Tate &amp; Lyle purchased the food ingredients division of
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer Group
   </company>
   's Haarmann &amp; Reimer unit, renaming it Tate &amp; Lyle Citric Acid. The deal made Tate &amp; Lyle the only global producer of citric acid.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Tate &amp; Lyle sold its 61% share of Industrias de Maiz SA (Argentina). Sugar prices in the US remained low due to bumper harvests, which affected the company's 1999 bottom line. In 2000 it sold Bundaberg, its Australian sugar company, to Société Financière de Sucres and its US grain unit to
   <company id="107103">
    J. D. Heiskell &amp; Company
   </company>
   . Later that year it sold Rumenco, an animal-feed supplement maker, to an industry consultant, and UMT, its feed milling equipment business, to Andritz. Also in 2000 the company attained full ownership of Europe's Amylum (sweeteners and starches).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Tate &amp; Lyle sold off the Domino brand to a group of investors led by Flo-Sun, Inc., chairman Alfonso Fanjul and his brother, J. Pepe Fanjul. As US sugar prices remained weak, during 2002 the company sold its Western Sugar business to Rocky Mountain Sugar Growers Cooperative. During the same year, the company sold its 51% stake in Zambia Sugar to Illova Sugar and its 15% stake in East Asia Properties to East Asia Sugar Investment Ltd. It also exited the sugar business in China with the sale of Well Pure to a group of Chinese investors.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to jettison noncore or underperforming businesses, in 2002 Tate &amp; Lyle sold its French monosodium glutamate production unit, Orsan S.A., to
   <company id="55924">
    Ajinomoto.
   </company>
   That year it announced plans for ingredients based on xanthan gum and related biological products made from carbohydrate feedstock. The next year the company sold United Molasses Co. and UM Canada to Westway Holdings. That year Tate &amp; Lyle formed a joint venture with
   <company id="129945">
    Igene Biotechnology
   </company>
   to develop fermented astaxanthin, a pigment used in aquaculture (specifically, to make farmed fish more red in color).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Tate &amp; Lyle became the sole manufacturer of the SPLENDA brand of sucralose, when it renegotiated its alliance with
   <company id="10824">
    McNeil Nutritionals
   </company>
   regarding the product. Under the agreement, Tate produces SPLENDA and is responsible for its worldwide sales to food manufacturers; and McNeil is responsible for retail and foodservice sales. Due to customer demand, Tate &amp; Lyle expanded sucralose production to include a plant in Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that same year Tate &amp; Lyle formed a joint venture with
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   to make an ingredient made from renewable sources such as corn to replace petrochemicals in the manufacture of clothing, plastics, and textiles. Equally owned by both companies, the company is called
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   Tate &amp; Lyle Bio-Products Company LLC. Tate &amp; Lyle also bought South African food ingredients company Dolcré in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the largest food antitrust class-action suit in US history, parent Tate &amp; Lyle paid $100 million in 2004 to settle a lawsuit concerning sweeteners used by
   <company id="10359">
    Coke
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi
   </company>
   . The suit alleged that Tate &amp; Lyle conspired to fix prices of high-fructose corn syrup.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its growth strategy, in 2005 the company acquired Italian ingredients maker Cesalpinia Foods; in 2006 it acquired Netherlands-based, biodegradable-plastic company Hycail BV and US specialty-food-ingredient operation Custom Continental Ingredients.
   <company id="10124">
    Archer-Daniels-Midland
   </company>
   sold its 6% share of Tate &amp; Lyle in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company formed a new subsidiary, Tate &amp; Lyle ANZ Pty. Part of the company's Global Food Ingredients Group, the subsidiary serves the food and beverage industries in Australia and New Zealand. To reduce the impact of exposure to the volatile raw material and commodity markets, in 2007 Tate &amp; Lyle sold its 49% holding in Mexican cane sugar business, Occidente, to E D &amp; F Man Holdings for $93 million. Also that year it sold its Canadian sugar business (Redpath) to American Sugar Refining for £131 million (C$298 million or $269 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold its international sugar-trading and -marketing division to
   <company id="58878">
    Bunge Limited
   </company>
   . It disposed of its European starch business, selling operations in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and the UK to
   <company id="103723">
    Tereos
   </company>
   for approximately $440 million as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   To concentrate on its Specialty Food Ingredients business, Tate &amp; Lyle exited its sugar division in late 2010 by selling off its remaining European sugar operation to American Sugar Refining, Inc. for £211 million ($318 million). The sale included cane sugar refineries in the UK and Portugal, a syrup factory in London, and associated sugar and syrup brands. Also in 2010 the company sold its molasses business to Scottish international agricultural commodities trade W&amp;R Barnett for £67 million (about $104 million) in cash. Tate &amp; Lyle used the proceeds of the sale to pay down its debt.
