   Insight Equity A.P. X (dba Vision-Ease Lens) is quite comfortable creating spectacles. The company specializes in designing, making, and distributing the increasingly popular polycarbonate prescription lenses used in eyewear today. While the company focuses on polycarbonate lenses for their impact resistance, light weight, and ultraviolet-filtering properties, Vision-Ease also manufactures and markets other styles. It produces plastic and glass lenses, as well as lens treatments such as polarized, anti-reflective, scratch-resistant, and photochromic (allowing lenses to darken automatically according to light levels). The company was founded in 1930.

   To expand its products portfolio, Vision-Ease in 2013 launched its Novel and Novella conventional front-side progressive lenses, which are made using an iterative design process. Taking into account wearer comfort, the lenses are developed to be both smooth and soft.
