   Syngenta wants to plant the seeds of seed technology around the world. The company is at the top of its industry, along with
   <company id="106053">
    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   and
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   , as one of the world's largest agrochemical businesses. It is a global leader in crop protection products, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. It produces commercial seeds -- both traditional and genetically modified -- for field crop seeds (soybeans), vegetable seeds (corn, beans, tomatoes), and flowers. The company also offers lawn and garden and public health products. In 2016 China National Chemical Corp. agreed to buy Syngenta for $43 billion.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates more than in 90 countries and 141 research and development sites in Switzerland, the UK, the US, China, and India. Syngenta's largest market in 2014 was Europe, Africa and the Middle East (30% of sales), followed by Latin America (28%), North America (24%), and Asia Pacific (13%).

  <p>
   Syngenta operates in five reporting segments: Europe, Africa and Middle East, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific, comprising the integrated Crop Protection and Seeds business; and the global Lawn and Garden business. The integrated Crop Protection and Seeds business is structured into 18 territories.

  <p>
   The company's net revenue have been increasing over the last few years. In 2014 Syngenta's net revenues increased by 3% due to higher exchange rates, with a 2% growth in sales volumes and a 3% growth from higher local currency sales prices. These increases overcame the negative impact of deliberate reductions in sales volume of the low-margin solo glyphosate product TOUCHDOWN, which reduced sales by $150 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Syngenta's net income in 2014 decreased by 2% due to increased marketing and distribution expenses, research and development costs, and general and administrative expenses (including restructuring and other general and administrative costs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash inflow increased by 59% due to changes in working capital as a result of change in inventories (built up to support sales growth) and  lower final quarter fungicide sales in Latin America, a change in trade and other working capital assets and change in trade and other working capital liabilities partially due to lower accrued staff incentives at the end of 2013.

  <p>
   In 2014 Syngenta launched the two new products for sugar cane under the company's exclusive PLENE brand: Plene Evolve and Plene PB -- designed to help growers increase yields and plant quality by providing healthy young plants with an assurance of genetic purity, vigor and traceability.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also grows through partnerships. In 2014 the company signed an agreement with Cellulosic Ethanol Technologies, LLC to license its ACE (Adding Cellulosic Ethanol) technology, a new process for ethanol plants. ACE technology allows the fiber as well as the starch in a corn kernel to be converted into ethanol. The combination of ACE technology and Enogen corn is expected to generate major synergies when used together in dry grind ethanol plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Syngenta and DuPont signed technology licensing agreements to broaden each company's crop protection product portfolio and enable both to bring new products to market more efficiently. Syngenta receives exclusive rights for foliar and soil uses on all crops in North America and for lawn and garden uses globally. The agreement gives DuPont exclusive access to Syngenta's Solatenol for mixture with DuPont's picoxystrobin fungicide on soybean and other crops in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core businesses, in 2013 it signed an agreement to sell its Dulcinea Farms business to Pacific Trellis Fruit LLC, a US-based international grower and marketer of fresh produce.

  <p>
   To meet the increasing demand for pasta (a global market valued at $16 billion), in 2014 the company acquired Società Produttori Sementi, one of Italy's oldest seed companies and a leader in durum wheat breeding and production for pasta.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Syngenta acquired MRI Seed Zambia Ltd and MRI Agro Ltd, a leading developer, producer and distributor of white corn seed in Zambia. The white corn market has high growth potential in Africa.

   Drug giants
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   and
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   created Syngenta when they joined their seeds and agrochemical businesses as an independent company in 2000. The spinoff of Syngenta was the result of poor agribusiness sales that stemmed, in part, from the general controversy surrounding genetically modified seeds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Syngenta and
   <company id="44998">
    Myriad Genetics
   </company>
   have mapped the rice genome, which could make rice crops more resistant to disease and lead to the genetic mapping of other cereals like wheat and corn.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Syngenta acquired Maribo Seed sugar beet business from Nordic Sugar, a unit of
   <company id="159767">
    Nordzucker AG
   </company>
   , for $59 million. The deal boosts Syngenta's position in the European sugar beet market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Syngenta has been building up its
   <company id="113728">
    seeds segment
   </company>
   through more than a dozen acquisitions. Since Syngenta's first acquisition in 2004, it has made several smaller purchases in the US, including
   <company id="126243">
    Conrad Fafard
   </company>
   and has bought seed companies in Argentina and China as well. It also bought the sunflower seed business of
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   and acquired two US lettuce seeds companies in 2009. The company has spent in the neighborhood of $1 billion building up the seeds business, which now boasts of 200 product lines and more than 6,000 varieties. Syngenta produces both traditional and genetically modified seeds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Syngenta merged its two major divisions, Crop Protection and Seeds, into a single division to allows it to provide its customers a single integrated program for crop care. The program is marketed by a single sales force. The integration is expected to save the company some $150 million by the end of 2015. Other aspects of its growth strategy include expanding into new markets. In 2012 Syngenta partnered with Novozymes to commercialize Novozymes' technology JumpStart. The two companies want to develop a larger market for JumpStart, which is a seed-applied biological that enhances phosphate uptake (essential for growth in young plants) in plant roots.

   In 2012 the French government banned the company's CRUISER OSR seed treatment, a neonicotinoid insecticide, from use on oilseed rape in France, after two studies found that high doses of neonicotinoids contained chemicals that might disorient bees. Syngenta believes the studies subjected bees to much higher doses of neonicotinoid than the pesticide bears. The Crop Protection segment also contains the company's Professional Products unit, which includes golf and landscaping products used for pest management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Syngenta agreed to acquire US-based biotech company Pasteuria Bioscience. Syngenta and Pasteuria have partnered since 2011 on developing biological products to control plant-parasitic nematodes by using the naturally occurring soil bacteria Pasturia spp.  In addition, to extend its seed products technology, Syngenta agreed to buy Belgian biotech rival Devgen for $523 million (€403 million) in 2012. Devgen's technology is developing rice traits to provide resistance against disease, as well as other crop protection. The Belgian firm is still at the R&amp;D stage. Through its Business Development unit, Syngenta also owns an equity stake (just more than 10%) in  Verenium. That company is using enzyme discovery to develop ethanol products.
