   Natus Medical designs and manufactures audiological and neurological diagnostic and screening products. While the company's focus has historically been on infants (newborn hearing screening, neonatal monitoring), it has expanded its product line to include an array of screening and diagnostic systems for use with children and adults. Its systems detect such neurological conditions as epilepsy and balance and sleep disorders. Natus also manufactures newborn and infant care products to diagnose and treat brain injury and jaundice. The company sells its wares worldwide through a direct sales force and distributors.

  <p>
   Natus Medical technically operates in one reportable segment -- health care products for the screening, detection, treatment, and monitoring of medical ailments in newborn care, hearing impairment, neurological dysfunction, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and balance and mobility disorders. Within that segment, Natus sells devices, which generally generate non-recurring revenue, and supplies and services, which generally generate recurring revenue.

  <p>
   Natus Medical sells in the US primarily through a direct sales force, though certain products are sold under private-label and distribution arrangements. Internationally, the company sells some products through direct sales channels in Canada, French and German speaking parts of Europe, Denmark, and parts of Latin America. Other products are sold in those markets and other international markets through distributors, who purchase products from Natus and resell them to end users or sub-distributors. End users include hospitals, clinics, labs, physicians, nurses, audiologists, and government agencies.

  <p>
   Natus Medical has been an acquisitive company since 2003 and on average makes one to two strategic acquisitions per year. More recent acquisitions include the 2013 purchase of the Grass Technologies Product Group from
   <company id="12671">
    Astro-Med
   </company>
   for $18.6 million in cash, which builds upon Natus' 2011 acquisition of Denver-based Embla Systems for $16.6 million in cash; both deals broaden Natus' existing diagnostic sleep analysis (polysomnography or PSG) product portfolio.
