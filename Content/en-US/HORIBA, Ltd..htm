   HORIBA's work is purely instrumental. The company manufactures and sells an array of devices that measure, analyze, and diagnose. Among its products are instruments and systems that measure and analyze automotive emissions, air pollution, and water quality, as well as semiconductor contamination. It also makes scientific and medical diagnostic analyzers. This equipment is used in laboratories for R&amp;D, production, and other applications. Having made strides to become a global company over the years, HORIBA does business in Asia/Pacific, Europe, and the Americas.
