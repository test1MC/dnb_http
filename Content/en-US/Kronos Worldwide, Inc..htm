   Kronos Worldwide produces pigments that impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity to everything from plastics, paper, and coatings to inks, food, and cosmetics. Controlled by

   </company>
   , Kronos is a leading manufacturer of a commercially used, base white inorganic pigment known as titanium dioxide (TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   ). TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   is designed based on specific end-use applications. Kronos makes and sell some 40 different TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   grades; the company and its distributors and agents also provide technical services for its products in some 100 countries, mainly in Europe and North America.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Kronos Worldwide has produced and marketed TiO

   in Europe and North America, its primary markets, for more than 90 years.

        <p>
   At its six plants in Europe and North America, Kronos produced 469,000 metric tons of TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   in 2012, down from 550,000 metric tons of the pigment in 2011. Its plants are located in Germany, Belgium, Norway, Canada, and the US (through a joint venture plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana).

        <p>
   Kronos' core TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   business is complemented by three other businesses. It owns and operates two ilemite mines with long reserve lives in Norway. Ilemite is used as a feedstock by some TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   plants. The ilemite produced by Kronos is sold to third parties, some of whom are competitors. A second business focuses on manufacturing and selling iron-based chemicals used in the treatment of municipal wastewater and in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement, and agricultural products. A third complementary business manufactures and sells itanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, TiO
   <sub>

   byproducts that are used to formulate pearlescent pigments, among other applications.

   A majority of its core TiO
   <sub>

   </sub>
   pigment products are sold through Kronos' direct sales force, operating from six sales offices in Europe and one in North America. Sales agents and distributors are authorized to sell Kronos brand products in specific geographic regions. TiO

   products represented 90% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2012.

        <p>
   Kronos has a diverse customer base of paint, plastics, decorative laminate, and paper manufacturers worldwide. Only one customer,
   <company id="60396">
    BEHR Process

   , generates more than 10% of its sales.

        <p>
   Kronos' sales increased 2% in fiscal 2012, primarily due to a 10% increase in average TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   selling prices. Its slight 2012 sales increase builds upon a more dramatic 35% sales increase in 2011 over 2010. Meanwhile, net income was down 32% in 2012, following a 146% increase in 2011 over 2010. Recent global economic weakness is causing TiO
   <sub>
    2
   </sub>
   producers to pull back on inventory, as industrywide sales and production volumes decrease. Other factors that impacted 2012 results were higher costs for raw materials, such as feedstock ore and petroleum coke.

        <p>
   Overall industry demand is expected to be higher in 2013 than in 2012 as a result of improving economic conditions. Kronos is therefore operating its facilities to align production levels and inventories to current and anticipated near-term customer demand levels. Concurrently, the company is trying to keep its manufacturing costs as low as possible, while dealing with a significant amount of debt. One advantage Kronos has is that it competes in an industry that has high barrier to entry and is dominated by just a few, namely itself,
   <company id="10487">
    Dupont
   </company>
   , Millennium Inorganic Chemicals (also known as Cristal),
   <company id="136323">
    Huntsman
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="138596">
    Tronox
   </company>
   . It typically competes based on price, product quality, and service.

   Kronos and its predecessors have been producing TiO

   since 1916. In 2003 NL Industries spun off Kronos to its shareholders.
