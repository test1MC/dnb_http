   Everbrite has evolved to become one of the largest manufacturers of outdoor and indoor signage in the US. It is supported by a technology center (the only national signage company to maintain one) dedicated to LED lighting component and system R&amp;D. The company's R&amp;D capacity enables it to introduce a stream of products that serve an increasingly diverse range of commercial and specialty lighting markets. Everbrite also offers a slate of services, including interior and exterior site analysis to match the right lighting system with a customer's application, and upgrade and retrofit assistance.

   's Convergent Media Systems to provide a full suite of digital signage offerings to key markets, particularly quick service restaurants (QSR). This relationship leverages Convergent's expertise as an integrator of enterprise grade digital signage and Everbrite's presence in the sign and imagery industries.

   The QSR market will undergo a major change when Federal guidelines require restaurants to display nutritional information to consumers. Everbrite's digital menu board solution allows for the instantaneous change of calorie and nutritional information as well as for the display of dynamic creative content, delivered right at the point of purchase. The digital menu board solution also provides real time, instant updates.
