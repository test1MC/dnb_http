   Inphi wants to shift broadband networks into high gear. The fabless semiconductor company offers specialized logic devices, modulator drivers, and other components used in high-speed optical telecom networks. Key parts of Inphi's more than 170 products are made from indium phosphide (InP; hence the company name), which Inphi touts as running at much higher speeds, but with lower power consumption, than competing products made from other specialized materials, such as silicon germanium. Other elements of the company's designs are made from standard silicon to lower overall costs.

  <p>
   The company's largest market is Asia, which brings in more than three-quarters of revenue, with customers in China accounting for one-third of all sales.

   Inphi's revenue has been increasing year-over-year. Revenue leaped 60% higher in 2015 to $246 million from $156 million. The company not only sold more products during the year, it sold many of them at higher prices. The more valuable products included its dual linear TIA, quad linear driver products, and iPHY products as well as high-speed interconnect and optical transport products that Inphi obtained through its acquisition of

    Cortina
   </company>
   . The company reported big sales gains in all markets except for South Korea, where sales fell 6%,
  </p>
  <p>
   The added revenue helped Inphi reduce its loss to $13.5 million in 2015 from $22 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow slowed to $68 million in 2015, down from $156 million the previous year.

  <p>
   Inphi's strategy includes building up its sales, design, and technical support presence in Europe and Asia in order to extend its customer reach in those regions. The company's maneuvers also include partnerships with such industry leaders as
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   for computing and storage, and
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59788">
    Huawei

   for networking and communications.

   The company's acquisition of Cortina was a big step in expanding its product line.

   Inphi in 2014 spent $131 to buy Cortina Systems and its line of high speed optical transport and interconnect products, which includes 10G/15G/40G PHY interconnects. Overall the deal added more than 130 products to Inphi's catalog.
