   Portola Pharmaceuticals is putting blood, sweat, and tears into developing new medications for blood disorders. The company has three drug candidates in the works that, if approved, will treat thrombosis (blood clots). Its lead candidate, Betrixaban, is an oral medication that would prevent certain types of blood clots in seriously ill patients. Betrixaban is currently in Phase 3 study. Another medication in development, PRT4445, would help with uncontrolled bleeding episodes after surgery, and PRT2070 is being developed for hematologic, or blood, cancers and inflammatory disorders. Another version of PRT2070 is being developed with

    Biogen
   </company>
   . Founded in 2003, Portola Pharmaceuticals went public in 2013.

        <p>
   The company plans to use the proceeds from its $122 million IPO to fund ongoing clinical programs for Betrixaban and to continue to develop PRT4445 and PRT2070 in preparation for clinical studies.

        <p>
   Phase 3 studies of Betrixaban will continue through 2015, and if the drug receives FDA approval, it will be the first of its kind. Betrixaban works to prevent a type of blood clot called venous thromboembolism (VTE) for up to 35 days. Current medications only work for about two weeks and have to be administered in a hospital, while Betrixaban can be taken orally after a patient is discharged.

   The company believes there is a strong need for new medications to treat blood clots and other hematologic disorders. As such, other, more well-known drug developers have offered to help Portola Pharmaceuticals with clinical development. For example, the company has collaboration agreements with
   <company id="91276">
    Bayer
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   for Phase 2 studies of PRT4445. This allows the larger companies to share in development costs as well as profits if the drug becomes approved.
  </p>

   In addition, Portola Pharmaceuticals signed a collaboration agreement in early 2013 with Hong Kong-based Lee's Pharmaceutical (HK) Limited to jointly expand the Phase 3 study into China. If approved in China, Lee's would have the exclusive commercial rights to Betrixaban in China. The company had a $50 million commercialization agreement for Betrixaban with
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   in the US, but that was terminated in 2011.
