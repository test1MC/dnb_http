  <p>
   In 2015 the company achieved revenue growth of 14%, bringing in €3.7 billion for the year, due to the positive impact from acquired businesses.

   <company id="107998">
    Arrium
   </company>
   Australian ropes business and the step acquisition of BOSFA contributed positively to growth. Fluctuations in international currency markets also had a net positive effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue increased in all geographic regions. Revenue increased in the EMEA region due to strong cross-sectoral demand from European markets, with automotive demand for tire cord and other steel wire particularly high. The acquired Pirelli plants in Italy, Romania and Turkey accounted for a notable amount of growth and consolidated double-digit profits from the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America's top line growth of 7% reflected positive currency effects, but volumes fell by 9% due to a plant closure in Canada and fire damage in Georgia. Weaknesses in agricultural and industrial steel wire markets further hampered the division's performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions and favorable currency effects helped Latin American sales increase. An improve price mix counteracted low raw materials prices. Acquisitions included the Pirelli tire cord site in Brazil and

   wire business in Costa Rica.
  </p>
  <p>
   Favorable exchange rate movements and the net effect of acquisitions helped revenue from the Asia-Pacfic region grow. Lower raw material prices and a weak start to the year were mitigating factors to an extent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher sales helped net income increase 17% on prior year to €102.0 million, a continuation of an increasing trend seen in the past five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities likewise rose on prior year, by 17% to €583.6 million.

  <p>
   Bekaert strategy is based on acquisitions and the divestment of non-core businesses. In 2015, the company acquired Arrium's ropes business in Australia, building product distributor BOSFA, and the Pirelli tire cord plant in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, it divested its carding solutions activities to Groz-Beckert, a German company. The divestment included operations in Belgium, India, Turkey, China and the US, and brought with it a global sales and services network.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Bekaert acquired Arrium's ropes business in Australia, renaming it Beckaert Wire Ropes, and was incorporated into the Bekaert Rope Group, which is a 65:35 joint operation between Bekaert and Chilean partners Matco Cables. The acquisition will allow Bekaert to better supply mining, oil and gas, lifting equipment and infrastructure markets. The company bought out Arrium's 50% share in BOSFA, a building products distributor working mainly in Australia and New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bekaert bought Pirelli's cord plant in Yanzhou, China, further securing Bekaerts place as a key supplier in the tire cable industry.
