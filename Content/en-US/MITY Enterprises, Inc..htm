   Folks on the rubber chicken circuit, bingo buffs, and church supper aficionados are probably familiar with the MITY Enterprises name. The company, through its Mity-Lite unit, makes tables (rectangle, round, specialty), chairs (banquet, folding, stacking), lecterns, and portable panel products. Customers include government agencies, religious organizations, universities, and the hospitality market. MITY serves the health-care industry through its Broda Enterprises subsidiary, which makes wheelchairs and adjustable seating for patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted-living centers. In 2013 the company was acquired by

   Gregory Wilson spent much of his early career working for engineering and consulting firms. He then began focusing on manufacturing furniture. He founded Mity-Lite in 1987 to supply banquet tables to churches, but the company found a larger market in hotels, convention centers, schools and universities, and other public assembly facilities. Drawing on his engineering background, Wilson found a way to put high-impact plastic shells on wooden frames to create tables capable of supporting up to 1,600 pounds, but weighing 30% to 50% less than particleboard or pressboard tables and lasting five times as long.

  <p>
   The company went public in 1994. The next year Mity-Lite sold its European sales office to a former employee. It began selling stacking chairs and aluminum tables in 1996 and added a padded tabletop to its line of wooden tables in 1997. That year the company bought 49.9% of the DO Group.

   DO Group purchased the assets of seating companies Corel Corporate Seating and JG Auditorium in 1998. Also that year Mity-Lite made inroads in the health care industry; it bought Broda Enterprises, a maker of geriatric seating and seating accessories. In 1999 Mity-Lite continued its string of acquisitions by purchasing CenterCore, an office furniture maker specializing in call center, 911, and group workstation environments. The company combined CenterCore with subsidiary DO Group in 2000, and announced late in the year it planned to sell its CenterCore line. It later changed its name to MITY Enterprises.

  <p>
   In October 2001 the company sold its Domore specialty office seating division to Lux Steel, an office seating and intensive-use seating manufacturer; MITY also sold its JG line of auditorium seating to USSC Group, a seller of ergonomic seating. In June 2002 Brad Nielson (former CFO) was named CEO, replacing Wilson, who remained as chairman. In November of that year MITY sold the Centercore and DO Group businesses.

   The company was acquired by Sorenson Capital Partners and Peterson Partners in 2007.
