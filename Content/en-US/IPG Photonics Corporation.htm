   IPG Photonics has a laser focus on spreading the use of lasers. The company makes fiber lasers and amplifiers and diode lasers, which are primarily used in materials processing applications (nearly 90% of sales) such as welding, cutting, marking, and engraving. Its fiber lasers are used in 3D printing and telecommunications. IPG Photonics is moving into automotive manufacturing applications and the developing market for medical uses. The company's customers have included
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="52292">
    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41878">
    Nippon Steel
   </company>
   . Deriving about 85% of its sales outside North America, IPG Photonics operates sales offices in more than a dozen countries in Asia and Europe.

  <p>
   The vertically integrated manufacturer designs and makes most of the components used in its finished products (which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars), from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. It also manufactures other products used in its lasers, including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical heads and chillers. By not outsourcing its manufacturing to third-party companies, IPG Photonics is able to better control its proprietary processes and technologies as well as the supply of its materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's biggest market is in materials processing, which accounts for 94% of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company conducts R&amp;D in the same city as its headquarters, as well as in New Hampshire and overseas in the German city of Burbach (near Frankfurt), and in Fryazino, Russia (outside Moscow).
  </p>
  <p>
   It has four manufacturing facilities for lasers, amplifiers, and components, one in each of its R&amp;D cities, and the fourth one in Cerro Maggiore, Italy, outside Milan. Manufacturing facilities for optical components are in India and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of geographic markets, China is the company's biggest accounting for 35% of revenue. The next biggest single country is the US, generating 15%, followed by Germany with 10% and Japan with 8%.

  <p>
   IPG Photonics primarily uses a direct sales force. It has a diverse customer base - its five-largest customers only account for about 25% of sales. Its biggest customer is in China and accounts for 13% of sales. In 2015, the company shipped nearly 33,000 units to moire than 3,000 customers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has sales offices at each of its manufacturing facilities as well as in Michigan and California in the US. International sales offices are located in China, Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Singapore, Turkey, and the UK.

  <p>
   IPG Photonics is beaming after a 17% revenue increase in 2015. The company's sales reach $901 million for the year from $770 million in 2014. Materials processing, of course, provided most of the increase rising 16% with higher sales of quasi-continuous wave (QCW) pulsed lasers for welding and cutting. The company's smaller segments also grew in 2015 with the medical segment rising 100% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rising sales at IPG Photonics drove profit 21% higher in 2015 to $242 million. Cash from operating activities also rose in 2015 from 2014.

  <p>
   IPG remains focused on fiber lasers as an alternative to conventional lasers, such as gas or crystal. Its strategy is to exploit the advantages that fiber lasers offer, such as superiority in electrical efficiency, beam quality and control, maintenance costs, longevity, flexibility, and usability. Traditional laser technologies have advantages that make them more suitable for some applications, but fiber lasers continue to gain ground. Crystal lasers generate higher peak power pulses, fiber lasers don't achieve the deep ultraviolet light needed for some semiconductor applications, and carbon dioxide lasers are better for non-metallic applications, such has plastics. Fiber lasers, however, have made improvements in power output that has opened them up to new markets, and IPG believes the technology can reach additional nascent applications, such as natural resource extraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   IPG released a threebeam fiber laser system for brazing zinc-coated steel, a process used in the automobile industry. The company is positioning fiber laser products for the auto industry and the trend toward the lighter weight metals such as high strength steel and aluminum. We are also encouraged by the potential for increased volumes of our laser seam stepper that welds auto bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, some makers of consumer electronics adopted the company's QCW lasers for making their products and multi-hundred volume orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   IPG formed a separate company, IPG Medical, in 2015 to focus on medical applications. The company is developing its Thulium fiber laser to break up kidney stones faster and and more simply than current technologies.

  <p>
   Increasing demand has led IPG to pursue operational expansion in Russia, Germany, and the US. In 2012 the company paid $55.4 million to acquire the 22.5% of Russia-based subsidiary NTO IRE-Polus that it did not already own to extend its control over R&amp;D, sales, and manufacturing infrastructure in the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2012 IPG bought privately held J.P. Sercel Associates (JPSA), a New Hampshire-based supplier of UV excimer and diode-pumped, solid-state industrial laser micromachining systems used in high-volume biomedical, industrial automation, LED, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, thin-film solar panel, and semiconductor manufacturing applications. The purchase expands IPG's custom laser system offerings to include fine processing, precision cutting, drilling, and micromachining of ceramics, glass, and semiconductors. The company further enhanced its UV laser development with the purchase the following year of California-based Mobius Photonics.

  <p>
   IPG Photonics raised about $100 million in private equity funding, with its investors, including
   <company id="40358">
    Apax Partners
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10990">
    Merrill Lynch
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="52780">
    TA Associates
   </company>
   , and Winston Partners. The company filed for an IPO in 2000 and withdrew the registration statement six months later. It filed for another IPO in 2006 and completed the offering by the end of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company used proceeds of its public offering to repurchase warrants, pay off debts, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, expansion of manufacturing facilities, purchases of equipment, and expansion of applications development and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 IPG Photonics acquired its Chinese distributor, HM Laser, and established a subsidiary, IPG China, with an office in Beijing. China is one of IPG's principal markets, along with Germany, Japan, Russia, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company stepped forward with its purchase of laser material manufacturer Photonics Innovations (PII) in January 2010. The acquisition expanded IPG's products and services portfolio for optical and laser materials fabrication, tunable laser design, and optical and sensing systems. Transaction details were not divulged.
