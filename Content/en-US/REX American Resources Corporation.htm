   REX American Resources believes that a key American energy resource is renewables. REX American has stakes in six ethanol entities; its two majority owned facilities (NuGen Energy and One Earth Energy) each have a design capacity of 100 million gallons of ethanol. The company had operated through two segments: alternative energy and real estate (the legacy of its earlier retail appliances business), but REX American sold its remaining real estate assets in 2014 and 2015. REX American derives almost all of its revenues from ethanol and related byproducts.

  <p>
   REX American has interests in six ethanol production facilities, which ships a total of 661 million gallons of ethanol a year. The company's effective ownership of the trailing twelve-month gallons shipped by the ethanol production facilities in which it has ownership interests was about 248 million gallons in 2016. In addition to ethanol, the company sells bi-products of the ethanol production process: Dry distillers grains with solubles (sold as a protein used in animal feed) and Non-food grade corn oil (sold to the animal feed, biodiesel, and other chemical markets).

  <p>
   REX American's revenues decreased by about 24% in fiscal 2016 (January year end) to $436.5 million. The main culprit was a $0.56 decline in the price per gallon sold as the result of historically low crude oil prices in 2015, and an oversupply of ethanol. Dried distillers grains sales decreased from $96.3 million in the prior year to $81.1 million as the result of a $20.50 decline in the price per ton sold brought on by lower grain prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income declined by 64% to $31.4 million in fiscal 2016 as lower operating expenses and other costs were unable to keep pace with even steeper declines in revenues as the result of lower selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities decreased to $40.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $137.2 million a year earlier, primarily due to the poor market conditions suppressing the company's revenues and net income.

   REX American evaluates various investment opportunities including energy related, agricultural or other ventures that fit its investment criteria It seeks to identify quality ethanol plant opportunities located near adequate feedstock supply with good transportation capabilities or other economically beneficial attributes, and that use leading ethanol production technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, and focus on its core ethanol businesses, in fiscal 2015 the company sold its three remaining real estate properties. It also sold its minority interest in ethanol producer Patriot Holdings in 2015 for an after tax gain of approximately $6.6 million.

  <p>
   In 2013 REX American invested in four ethanol production entities, including One Earth Energy, LLC (for a 74% ownership), NuGen Energy, LLC (for an additional 50% ownership), Patriot Holdings, LLC (for a 27% ownership), and Big River Resources, LLC (for a 10% ownership).
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to diversify its operations, in 2013 the company invested $1 million in eSteam, a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. It continues to investigate investment opportunities in various companies and industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010, Rex American acquired a 48% stake in NuGen Energy for about $22 million. NuGen operates a 100 million gallon annual capacity ethanol plant in Marion, South Dakota.
  </p>
  <p>
   After fully divesting its retail holdings in 2009, the company focused on acquiring ethanol production facilities. By 2010, REX American had some $125 million invested in seven corn- or sorghum-based ethanol production plants, controlling about 190 million gallons of production capacity per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began investing in ethanol production facilities in 2006 while it was still selling televisions and washing machines in small and medium-size markets across the US. REX actually began phasing out its retail operations in 2000, closing more than 100 of its underperforming units during the early part of that decade. In 2007, the company began planning in earnest to fully exit the retail business in favor of alternative fuels. It completed that process in mid-2009, selling almost all of its company-owned retail properties and terminating leases on the rest of its stores.
