   Absolute power: Created in 1975 through the merger of former rivals Ricard and Pernod, this titan of French spirits lays claim to the top global brands of vodka and Scotch whisky. Pernod Ricard's vast portfolio of wine and spirits comprises iconic labels
   <company id="92083">
    ABSOLUT
   </company>
   vodka and Chivas Regal Scotch; premium spirits, such as Beefeater gin and Kahlúa liqueur; and prestige spirits and champagnes (e.g., Martell cognac and G.H. Mumm champagne). A Wine unit holds Jacob's Creek and other brands, and a local brands unit consists of 18 labels, including Seagram's gin (#1 in the US) and Wiser's whisky (#1 in Canada). The company generates most of its sales in countries within the European Union, followed by Asia.

  <p>
   Paris-based Pernod Ricard does business in more than 70 countries. Indeed, more than 90% of its sales are generated outside of France. Europe (including France) represents a third of sales. Asia is an important and growing market for the spirits maker. The Americas account for more than a quarter.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The wine and spirits maker boasts one of the largest marketing budgets in its industry. In fiscal 2013 (ended June) its ratio of advertising and promotional expenditures amounted to 19.2% of net sales. Pernod Ricard's advertising and promotion strategy spans the traditional and innovative: from outdoor billboards, to sponsorships, to digital ad campaigns.

  <p>
   Pernod Ricard operates as a holding conglomerate, consisting of two arms: Brand Companies (The Absolut Company, Chivas Brothers, Martell Mumm Perrier-Jouët, Irish Distillers, Premium Wine Brands, and Havana Club International); and Market Companies, based on geographic location (Asia, the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's House of Brands concept classifies the Group's 36 premium international brands into three segments. The Top 14, which consists of 14 strategic spirits and champagne brands -- and includes ABSOLUT Vodka and Chivas Regal -- generate more than 60% of total sales. Pernod Ricard's 18 key local spirits brands and priority premium wines, represent 18% and 5% of sales, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Pernod Ricard reported sales of $11.1 billion in fiscal 2013 (ended June), an increase of 8% versus the prior year. Net income rose 5% over the same period to $1.5 billion. Double-digit sales growth in emerging markets helped fuel results, while mature markets were stable. Indeed, strong growth in the US (up 8% year over year) offset declines in France and Spain in fiscal 2013. The company's Top 14, which consists of 14 spirits and champagne brands, continued to outperform, growing more quickly than the group's average.

  <p>
   The hard-won acquisition of The Absolut Company (formerly known as Vin&amp;Sprit) in 2008 was a transformative purchase for Pernod Ricard in that it enlarged its premium brand portfolio and geographic presence. The whopping $8-billion deal, under which $546 million in debt was assumed, secured Pernod Ricard's share of the vodka market in the US, where annually some 5 million cases of ABSOLUT are sold. More recently, in a bid to become a leader in the XO cognac category, the company's Martell &amp; Co. subsidiary purchased Le Maine au Bois SAS in mid-2013. Le Maine au Bois SAS is located in Saint-Eugene, in the Petite Champagne district in AOC Cognac.

  <p>
   Pernod Ricard has built its premium global brand portfolio through a series of rapid acquisitions. The company creates value through its policy of upscaling its brands, called "Premiumization." In fiscal 2013, Premium brands represented 75% of net sales, up from 71% two years ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pernod Ricard's growth strategy focuses on investing in the world's prestige brands coupled with adding premium labels through acquisitions and alliances that enhance its world-class presence and spur incremental growth. Indeed, the company is continuing its international expansion of ABSOLUT Vodka beyond the US, its traditional market, in Asia and Eastern Europe, where it grew by 36% and 15%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pernod Ricard has simultaneously shed non-strategic assets as part of its debt reduction initiative and to satisfy regulatory authorities. Among several, in 2012 the company divested certain Canadian activities. The disposals followed the company's sale of Danish aquavit brands Aalborg and Brondums, Gammel Dansk, a bitter, and German label Malteserkreuz Aquavit. Pernod Ricard axed its stake in Georgian Wine &amp; Spirits to JSC Marussia. Earlier, Pernod Ricard sold off wine brands Marqués de Arienzo and Viña Eguia.

  <p>
   Henri-Louis Pernod inherited Pernod Fils, an absinthe distillery, from his father-in-law in 1805 and immediately moved it to Pontarlier, France, to avoid stiff French import taxes. Demand for absinthe, a potent liqueur, spread quickly, and by the 1870s the liqueur was the toast of Paris. It was even featured in Impressionist paintings, and rumor has it that Vincent Van Gogh's psychosis might have been caused by it.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1800s serious competition for the absinthe market emerged from distiller Pernod Avignon, run by Jules Pernod (no relation to Henri-Louis). In 1906 Switzerland banned absinthe and France followed suit in 1915. In 1926 Henri-Louis joined with another anise distiller, Aristide Hemard, and formed Etablissements Hemard et Pernod Fils. Jules joined them in 1928. The resulting company was named Pernod.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four years later the ban on pastis was lifted by the French government, and Paul Ricard, who made pastis illegally beforehand, began selling it openly. The licorice-flavored drink became popular in France. His company, Ricard, became a successful spirits maker and went public in 1962. Ricard acquired the Biscuit cognac brand in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pernod and Ricard merged in 1975 to form Pernod Ricard. The company's operations included Campbell (scotch), SEGM (spirits exporter), and JFA Pampryl (fruit juice). In 1976 the group acquired CDC (Cinzano, Dubonnet). Two years later Patrick Ricard, son of Paul, became chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding through acquisitions in the 1980s, Pernod Ricard bought US-based Austin Nichols (Wild Turkey) from du Ligget Group in 1980 and acquired control of both Sias-MPA (fruit preparations) in 1982 and Compagnie Francaise des Produits Orangina (soft drinks) in 1984. The next year the firm added Ramazzotti (spirits, Italy) and IGM (distribution, Germany) to its mix, and in 1988 it bought Irish Distillers (whiskey), Yoo-Hoo Industries (US), and BWG (distribution, Ireland; sold in 2002). Australia's Orlando Wyndham Wines was added to the company's wine list in 1989 and merged with Pernod Ricard's Wyndham Estate winery the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group also acquired Spain's Larios gin, the Czech Republic's Becherovka liqueurs, and Italcanditi, a fruit preparations firm. Pernod Ricard added Mexican distillery Tequila Viuda de Romero (Real Hacienda tequila) to its liquor cabinet in January 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pernod Ricard later teamed up with liquor giant Diageo to bid on Seagram's spirits and wine business. Their collective bid of $8.2 billion (with Pernod Ricard paying $3.2 billion) was accepted in December 2000, with Pernod Ricard agreeing to acquire such brands as Chivas Regal, Glenlivet, and Glen Grant (which was sold to Campari in 2006).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 the company agreed to pay $71 million for 80% of Polmos Poznan, maker of one of Poland's top vodka brands, Wyborowa in a deal including export rights. In October the company sold its soft-drink business in Continental Europe, North America, and Australia to Cadbury Schweppes for about $640 million to help finance the Seagram's deal. (Cadbury later spun off its soft drink business and became
   <company id="103458">
    Dr Pepper Snapple Group
   </company>
   .) After months of delay, the company finalized its deal to buy a part of Seagram's drinks business from Vivendi Universal after finally gaining
   <company id="139112">
    FTC
   </company>
   approval in December 2001. Pernod Ricard and brand co-owner Diageo licensed Seagram's nonalcoholic mixers to
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   in 2002; it also sold sold Polish juice-making subsidiary Agros Fortuna that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2005 Pernod was back in a shopping mood. To help allay anti-competitive concerns, Pernod Ricard enlisted the help of Fortune Brands for its friendly bid for rival distiller Allied Domecq. As part of the deal, Fortune Brands ended up with Pernod Ricard's Larios gin, as well as several brands from Allied Domecq (including Canadian Club whisky, Clos du Bois wine, Courvoisier cognac, Maker's Mark bourbon, and Sauza tequila). Pernod Ricard paid about $14 billion for its former chief competitor Allied Domecq. Fortune Brands anted up about $5 billion for its part of the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pernod became the owner of
   <company id="109058">
    Dunkin' Donuts
   </company>
   and
   <company id="106007">
    Baskin-Robbins
   </company>
   ice cream operations as a result of the Allied Domecq buyout; in 2006 it sold both companies to a consortium of buyers that included

   ,

   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40463">
    Thomas H. Lee Partners
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the juggling that took place in the Allied Domecq acquisition, Pernod Ricard also sold its Bushmills Irish whisky to competitor Diageo, and its Braemar, Glen Grant, and Old Smuggler brands to
   <company id="61577">
    Campari
   </company>
   . The Allied Domecq purchase also prompted a round of reorganization at Pernod Ricard, which in early 2006 outlined a new structure that divided the company into four main brand units (Chivas Brothers, Martell Mumm Perrier-Jouët, Ricard, and Pernod) and its distribution operations into four geographic regions (Americas, Asia, Europe, and Pacific).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold off 14 labels, including wine brands Farmingham, Canei, La Ina and Rio Viejo, and Spanish brandy brands Carlos I, Carlos III, and Filipe II. The next year it sold the Tia Maria coffee liqueur to Illva Saronno for €125 million ($177 million) in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2011 Pernod Ricard addded "ultra-premium" tequila to its drinks portfolio through the formation of a joint venture with Tequila Avion.
