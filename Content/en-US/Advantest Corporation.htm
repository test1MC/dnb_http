   Chip makers and others in need of advanced test equipment often turn to Advantest. The company is a top maker of automated test equipment (ATE) used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Most of Advantest's operations center around its semiconductor production equipment, including its extensive line of specialized ATE gear, as well as electron-beam lithography equipment. The balance of sales come from a variety of measuring instruments used by manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecom equipment, and other high-tech goods to test their wares.

   Revenue ticked down 1% in 2016 (ended March) from 2015 with a 7% drop in the semiconductor and component test system business segment. It was affected by weakening sales of major end-products of non-memory devices, such as smartphones and PCs. In memory test systems, demand for DRAM also decreased due to the impact of the smartphone slowdown.

   Advantest's net income fell 48% in 2016 from 2015. The company had higher selling, general and administrative expenses and it invested more in research and development. It did benefit from the weakness of the Japanese currency in relation to the US dollar.
