   Once the cows come home, Robert Wiseman steps in. One of the UK's biggest milk processors, the company receives raw milk from a network of more than 1,000 dairy farmers and turns it into marketable fresh, flavored, and extended shelf-life milk. Its brand names include One, Black &amp; White, Shock, Puriti, and FRESH'N'LO. Robert Wiseman produces branded and private-label fresh milk from six major dairies and 14 depots. The dairy company sells its products to supermarkets in England, Scotland, and Wales. Robert Wiseman also offers home delivery.

   In order to gain headway in the liquid milk sector of the UK, the company plans to develop its own milk brand, as part of which it will launch a new milk brand in 2016.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company agreed to acquire the diaries operations of
   <company id="58580">
    Dairy Crest
   </company>
   for £80 million. Dairy Crest processes and delivers around 1.3 billion liters of British milk per annum to major retailers, mid-level customers including, smaller retailers, coffee shops and hospitals, and residential customers. The acquisition, scheduled to be completed in late 2015, would step up the company's capacity, as higher volumes will enable the company to leverage its scale through cost savings and supply negotiations with retail and industrial partners.
