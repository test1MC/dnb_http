   France-based Trigano is a leading maker of caravans (known as RVs in America). The company makes a line of motorized caravans (motor homes) under brands including Autostar, Challenger, and Chausson. Trigano also makes towable caravans and static caravans, or mobile homes. Besides its RV offerings, the company makes RV accessories, small utility trailers, camping equipment (tents), and garden equipment (above-ground pools, swing sets, barbecues, and storage sheds). Half of revenues come from outside France. The company traces its historical roots back to 1936.

  <p>
   Trigano has extended its footprint in the UK though the use of acquisitions. In early 2017 it acquired Auto-Sleepers Investments Ltd, a manufacturer and dealer of leisure vehicles in the UK. It also picked up Adria Group, a UK-based maker of motorhomes, caravans, and mobile homes during that same time period. The deals enhanced Trigano's position within the UK motorhome market and added external growth in the fields of leisure vehicles and accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers.

  <p>
   The company began in 1935 when the Trigano family sold textile goods. In 1936 the French were allowed to take paid holidays, and so began Trigano's business -- supplying the first tent canvases to camping vacationers.
