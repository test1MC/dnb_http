  <p>
   Fred Wagenhals, an inventor and former race car driver, founded motorsports marketer Action Products in 1986. In 1989, while still president of Action Products, he and three partners formed
   <company id="47081">
    Racing Champions
   </company>
   to make die-cast collectible cars. In 1991 Action Products went into receivership, and in 1992 Wagenhals founded Action Performance Companies. He took the company public a year later, was forced out, and then bought out his former partners. That year he sold his interest in Racing Champions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Action Performance got on track in 1994 and began diversifying into more motorsports areas, such as staging one-third-scale races and selling mini-vehicles. It sold its mini-vehicle interests in 1995, and the next year it moved into apparel by acquiring several motorsports marketers, including
   <company id="46898">
    NASCAR
   </company>
   legend Dale Earnhardt Sr.'s apparel and souvenir company. Also in 1996 Action Performance entered a licensing agreement with toy maker
   <company id="12007">
    Hasbro
   </company>
   , which produces die-cast cars for the mass-merchandise market. That year Action Performance began representing race car drivers in marketing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company paid $4.9 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Wagenhals' former partners in now-bankrupt Action Products; they claimed he diverted business from Action Products to his other enterprises. In 1998 Action Performance bought the operator of the goracing.com motor sports Web site and an interest in a driver-endorsed developer of nutritional products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 1999 the firm filed to take public its goracing.com subsidiary. Also in 1999 goracing.com bought Fantasy Sports Enterprises, the operator of the Fantasy Cup Auto Racing Web site (sold in 2000). In late 1999 Action Performance reported that it had lost money in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 due to lower sales of higher-margin, die-cast collectibles, as well as the postponement of its public offering of goracing.com. Several high-level executives also left the company, which further contributed to the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Action Performance acquired the Winner's Circle line of die-cast cars from Hasbro in May 2001 and 80% of Castaway Collectibles in July. It closed its UK Goodsport operations (apparel and souvenirs) in September and sold some of the assets. Action Performance moved from the Nasdaq, which it had been trading on since 1993, to the New York Stock Exchange in February 2002. In July the company purchased McArthur Towel and Sports, a distributor of terry products and golf accessories and in October bought Jeff Hamilton Industries, a manufacturer of sports-licensed leather jackets and other apparel. McArthur was sold in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2003 the company acquired Funline Merchandise Co., maker of die-cast collectible vehicles such as Jesse James West Coast Choppers and Muscle Machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The end of 2005 saw
   <company id="52629">
    International Speedway Corporation
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42865">
    Speedway Motorsports
   </company>
   agree to a joint purchase of the company, which was called Action Performance Companies at the time, for approximately $245 million. When the deal was finalized in December 2005, the speedway firms changed the company name to Motorsports Authentics LLC.
