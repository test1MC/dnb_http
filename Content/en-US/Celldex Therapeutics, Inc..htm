   Celldex Therapeutics develops cellular therapies to treat specific forms of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. The biopharmaceutical company's development technologies use cloned proteins, antibody-targeted vaccines, and other biologic substances to create disease-specific drugs. It has candidates in clinical development for the treatment of brain cancer, breast cancer, and other oncology-related ailments. Celldex takes candidates through earlier stages of development, then typically seeks partners to usher them through late stages. Its first commercial product, rotavirus vaccine Rotarix, was marketed worldwide by
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   but that agreement, and the company's rights to any profits, ended in 2013.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's lead development candidate, rindopepimut (also known as CDX-110), is an immunotherapy vaccine that targets a protein variant commonly present in an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme. Another late-stage candidate, CDX-011, is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets a protein expressed in breast cancer. Other drugs in Celldex's pipeline include antibodies targeting solid tumors and hematologic cancers (including lymphomas, melanomas and leukemias), as well as potential treatments for other types of cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It has development deals and partnerships with
   <company id="47125">
    Rockefeller University
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   It sold 70% of its rights to Rotarix to an investment fund before it was approved. The 30% it retained was owed to Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCH) Medical Center for licensing the rotavirus strain it used to develop the drug. When the marketing agreement with Glaxo ended in 2013, the company received its final payment, $2.3 million, and paid that to CCH. Celldex doesn't expect any more revenue from Rotarix.

  <p>
   As a development-stage drug company, Celldex has yet to turn a profit as it spends more on R&amp;D programs than it earns. In addition, the company experiences highly fluctuating revenues each year as its sources of income change. For instance in 2013 the company reported a 63% drop in revenue, from $11 million to $8.4 million, as its Rotarix payments came to an end. Its net loss increased 38%, from $59 million to $82 million, as costs related to pipeline R&amp;D, including personnel, climbed. Cash used in operations also continues to grow and Celldex doesn't see an end in sight.

  <p>
   To bring its operations towards profitability, the company's strategic efforts are focused on bringing rindopepimut to commercialization stages. Celldex plans to market the drug on its own in the US market, but is seeking partners to conduct international sales efforts. In addition, the company is exploring partnership options for its other clinical-stage drug candidates as a means of gaining additional funding for its R&amp;D programs.

  <p>
   In 2016 Celldex bought clinical-stage development firm Kolltan Pharmaceuticals, which is primarily focused on antibody-based drugs to treat cancer, for an upfront payment of $62.5 million plus up to $172.5 million in milestone payments. Through that deal, the company boosted its immuno-oncology portfolio with such candidates as KTN0158 and KTN3379.

   Formerly AVANT Immunotherapeutics, the company merged with
   <company id="132640">
    Celldex Therapeutics
   </company>
   in 2008 and took its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   AVANT Immunotherapeutics was formed in 1983 to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Its commercial product, Rotarix, was licensed to
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   early in the development process and got its first approval in Mexico in 2004; it later gained approval in Europe in 2006 and the US in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   AVANT merged with the former Celldex entity in a stock transaction worth some $48 million in early 2008. While AVANT brought its infectious disease vaccines, Celldex brought in programs using monoclonal antibodies and tumor-targeting technologies to develop therapeutic vaccines for cancers and inflammatory disorders. The predecessor Celldex entity was majority owned by
   <company id="15015">
    Medarex
   </company>
   (later acquired by
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ); it was originally incorporated as MabVac in 2003 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Medarex.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new Celldex licensed its CholeraGarde and ETEC E. coli vaccine programs to Vaccine Technologies in 2009 to focus on its cancer vaccines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008,
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   agreed to fund the research and development of the company's rindopepimut brain cancer candidate (also known as CDX-110), in exchange for worldwide marketing rights to the drug. In 2010, however, Pfizer terminated the agreement, saying that its development was no longer a strategic priority, and Celldex regained worldwide rights to the drug.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celldex acquired rights to its CDX-011 candidate for breast cancer when it bought biotech firm
   <company id="54844">
    CuraGen
   </company>
   for about $96 million in 2009.
