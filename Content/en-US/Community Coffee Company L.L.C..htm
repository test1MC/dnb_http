   Community Coffee is a cuppa Joe with a Cajun patois, cher. The largest family-owned retail coffee brand (Community Coffee) in the US, the company imports, roasts, and sells its coffee beans to grocery and convenience stores, restaurants, hotels, and offices throughout some 15 states, mostly in the Southeast. There's more brewing: some 25 CC's Community Coffee Houses have sprung up in Louisiana since the original coffee shop opened in New Orleans in 1995. The company also offers whole coffee beans, teas, chicory, and coffee-related gifts and accessories at its coffee houses as well as online. Started in 1919, Community Coffee is owned and led by descendants of founder Henry Norman "Cap" Saurage.

   The company imports green coffee beans through partnerships with plantations in Brazil, and elsewhere in South America, and Africa. A roasting plant processes and packages the coffee. The company claims that it was the first in the US to introduce a vacuum-sealed coffee package. In a nod to the popularity of single-cup brewing systems like

   , in early 2013 it introduced single-brew cups in its three most popular roasts (dark, medium dark, medium), coffee and chicory, and four flavored coffees.

   Community Coffee's flagship product is its coffee, however, it aims to stay on pace with changing consumer beverage preferences. In 2012 the company rolled out two new iced tea flavors, Skinny Sweet and Green Tea with Lemon, targeted to restaurant, hotel, office, and other customers. Since its first launch of Community brand iced teas in 1958, the company has won the business of an increasing number of large food service operators, including
