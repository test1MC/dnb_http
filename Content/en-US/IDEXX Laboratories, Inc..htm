   IDEXX can identify what's wrong with Fluffy, Fido, Flossie, or Flicka. A leading animal health care company, IDEXX makes diagnostic testing kits and machines for cats and dogs as well as cows and horses. Veterinarians use the company's VetTest analyzers for blood and urine chemistry and its SNAP in-office test kits to detect heartworms, feline leukemia, and other diseases. The company also provides lab testing services and practice management software. In addition, IDEXX makes diagnostic products to detect livestock and poultry diseases and to test for contaminants in water and milk. The company sells its products worldwide.

  <p>
   Products and services for companion animals (aka: pets) account for more than 80% of IDEXX's sales. Most of that revenue comes from diagnostic products and services, including chemistry analyzers, rapid test kits, and laboratory services. The company operates a network of laboratories, to which vets can send patient samples for analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   After companion animals, livestock and poultry (horses, cows, pigs, and chickens) are the company's second-largest market. IDEXX's Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics business includes products to test for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow" disease) as well as porcine illnesses and poultry diseases. Equine products make up a smaller portion of the company's  sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   IDEXX's water testing segment produces tests to detect E. coli, enterococci, and Cryptosporidia. Water utilities and government laboratories are the primary customers for these products -- half of sales are outside of the US. The company's dairy testing unit produces a SNAP test to measure antibiotic residues in milk, which are highly regulated in markets outside of the US. The company also sells OPTI Medical Systems which measure human electrolyte, blood gases, and glucose levels. The systems and consumables are sold to hospitals and clinics.

  <p>
   More than half of the company's sales are made in the US, but it also maintains sales offices in 15 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific. While many of its products and materials are manufactured by third parties, it also maintains manufacturing and assembly facilities in Georgia and Maine and in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France.

   IDEXX distributes its products through its own marketing and sales force and through independent distributors and resellers.

  <p>
   Although IDEXX's revenue growth had been slowed by the economic recession, the company reported modest revenue increases in the last two years. It also saw net income increases, by about 15% and 10%, respectively, in 2011 and 2012. While the Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics business grew more than 15% as a result of a jump in sales of bovine tests to government agencies in Germany in 2011, that same segment began to soften in 2012 as government testing changed.

  <p>
   IDEXX continues to grow by focusing on launching new products and consumables for its instruments and test kits. It has also expanded into software by introducing web-based practice management tools for veterinarians.

   In 2012 the company purchased the assets of Sneakers Software, which had been selling its practice management software.

  <p>
   David Shaw founded IDEXX in 1984 as AgriTech Systems. An MBA who had specialized in agribusiness consulting, Shaw wanted to cut the costs and time involved in lab testing for diseases by producing kits that could be used on-site; an initial line of poultry disease tests proved successful. The company changed its name to IDEXX in 1988 and went public in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 IDEXX acquired AMIS International, a leading Japanese test lab for veterinarians. The next year the company opened offices in Spain and the Netherlands and introduced the SNAP test, which detects allergies in dogs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 IDEXX acquired two software companies, Advanced Veterinary Systems and Professionals Software, and merged them to create IDEXX Informatics. That year the firm also bought Acumedia Manufacturers, a producer of more than 300 varieties of dehydrated culture media. Looking to expand into animal drug development, the company bought animal health firm Blue Ridge Pharmaceuticals in 1998. In 2000, IDEXX sold Acumedia, as well as its food microbiology operations. It also launched VetConnect.com, which provides veterinary information and support and product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold its veterinary pharmaceutical operations, which were miniscule, to focus on its core test kit and consumable business.
