   Viskase Companies forces hot dogs, sausages, and salami to shape up and ship out. The company is one of the world's leading producers of non-edible cellulosic, fibrous, and plastic casings used to prepare and package processed meat and poultry products. Viskase's casings are sold under brand names such as NOJAX (skinless hot dogs have "no jackets"), VISFLEX, and VISMAX. It also makes SEALFLEX SILVER heat-shrinkable plastic bags for the meat, poultry, and deli industries. In the nonfood arena, Viskase makes MEMBRA-CEL for use in dialysis. Viskase has production facilities in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, and the US. More than two-thirds of the company's sales originate outside the US.

  <p>
   Ongoing consolidation within the meat-processing industry (the main source of Viskase's customers) has resulted in increased purchasing power by meat-casing customers. Since customers have no contractual obligations with Viskase, the company is aware that newly-consolidated customers are able to exert more pressure on it with respect to pricing, quality, and new products. In addition, as its customer base continues to consolidate, Viskase faces increased competition from other casing manufacturers since there are fewer customers.
