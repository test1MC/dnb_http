   "All the News That's Fit to Print and Post Online" would be a more accurate motto for this media titan. The New York Times Company (The Times Co.) publishes
   <em>
    The New York Times.
   </em>
   The iconic newspaper, known to many as The Grey Lady, is one of the world's most respected sources of news. The paper boasts a weekday circulation of about 1.3 million. The Times Co. owns
   <em>
    The Boston Globe
   </em>
   among other big city newspapers and distributes news online through
   <company id="99811">
    NYTimes.com
   </company>
   and other sites. The company sold content portal
   <company id="53065">
    About Group
   </company>
   in late 2012. Chairman Arthur Sulzberger and his family control the firm through a trust.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Times Co.'s papers are distributed worldwide in print and digital form.

  <p>
   The company's main two divisions are the New York Times Media Group and the New England Media Group. The New York Times Media Group includes The New York Times, the International New York Times (formerly the International Herald Tribune), NYTimes.com, and related businesses. The New England Media Group includes The Boston Globe, BostonGlobe.com, Boston.com, the Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette (the 'T&amp;G'), Telegram.com, and related businesses.

  <p>
   Advertising struggles, both online in print, have affected the company's revenue in recent fiscal years. For fiscal 2014 The Times Co. reported a little more than $1.58 billion, up slightly from fiscal 2013's revenue of $1.57 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company's net income decreased by 49%, down to $33.3 million from net income of $65 million in fiscal 2013. The drop was mainly due to increases in operating cost. Selling, general, and administrative costs increased as a result of severance expense associated with workforce reductions.

  <p>
   The Times Co. is something of an anomaly in an industry led by diversified media conglomerates (
   <company id="11508">
    Tribune Media
   </company>
   ) and vast newspaper empires stretching coast-to-coast (
   <company id="10623">
    Gannett
   </company>
   ). The company's success hinges on its big city papers attracting readers and advertisers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Times Co. has raised cover prices and subscription rates for The New York Times in an effort to make up for declines in print advertising. It is also focused on efforts to reduce costs while investing in its digital media operations to diversify away from expensive print publishing. The company also began charging a subscription fee for access to certain NYTimes.com content early in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other activity concerning its digital operations, in 2012 The Times Co. sold About Group to
   <company id="52963">
    IAC/InterActive
   </company>
   for $300 million in cash. The divestiture is part of the company's plans to refocus on its core newspaper and website operations. The Times Co. is working to boost online readership by incorporating video and interactive features into its NYTimes.com website and through media applications for
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's iPhone and iPad.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2013 the company announced it would explore a sale of the New England Media Group and its 49% equity interest in Metro Boston, which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater Boston area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's primary focus going forward is its NYT brand, including expanding the brand's international reach. The International Herald Tribune is being rebranded as the International New York Times. The Times Co. also plans to introduce more digital products, introduce more mobile initiatives, and expand its events business.

  <p>
   In 1851 George Jones and Henry Raymond, former
   <i>
    New York Tribune
   </i>
   staffers, started
   <i>
    The New York Times.
   </i>
   The politically minded paper lost ground to the yellow journalism of Hearst and Pulitzer and was bought in 1896 by Tennessee newspaperman Adolph Ochs, who continued to encourage hard news and business coverage. Ochs coined the newspaper's now-famous slogan, "All the News That's Fit to Print."
  </p>
  <p>
   Ochs' son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who ran the paper from 1935 to 1961, diversified the company with the 1944 purchase of two New York City radio stations. In 1963 Ochs' grandson Arthur Ochs "Punch" Sulzberger took control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s declining ad revenues and a newspaper strike sent the company into the red. To regain strength, Punch built the largest news-gathering staff of any newspaper. The
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   ' coverage of the Vietnam War helped change public sentiment, and the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for publishing the Pentagon Papers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime Punch had taken the company public (1967), although the family retained solid control. In the late 1960s and 1970s the company began co-publishing the
   <i>
    International Herald Tribune
   </i>
   (1967, with The Washington Post) and bought magazines, publishing houses, TV stations, smaller newspapers, and cable TV systems. To contain costs, the company invested in three pulp and paper firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s the
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   added feature sections to compete with suburban papers. The company bought
   <i>
    Golf World
   </i>
   in 1988, and the next year sold its cable systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. succeeded his father as
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   publisher in 1992. The next year The New York Times bought Affiliated Publications, owner of
   <i>
    The Boston Globe,
   </i>
   for $1.1 billion. In 1995 it acquired a majority stake in Video News International, a news-gathering business, and invested in OVATION, a performance arts cable TV network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the
   <i>
    Times
   </i>
   launched a website. The following year chairman and CEO Punch Sulzberger retired from executive duties but remained on the board as chairman emeritus. He was replaced by his son as chairman and non-family member Russell Lewis as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998
   <i>
    The New York Times
   </i>
   won three Pulitzer Prizes, and also unveiled "Circuits," a weekly section that includes reviews, features, and columns covering digital technology. However, the company's celebration of the Pulitzers was short-lived. Journalistic integrity took a nosedive at
   <i>
    The Boston Globe
   </i>
   in mid-1998: Within a span of two months the newspaper demanded the resignations of reporter Patricia Smith after she admitted to making up people and quotes for several stories, and columnist Mike Barnicle after he included jokes from a book by George Carlin in his column without attribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year the company bought a minority stake in financial news Web company
   <company id="55323">
    TheStreet
   </company>
   (which it sold in 2000 at a heavy loss) and software company Abuzz Technologies. Also in 1999 the company established an online store to sell classic photos and other products. In 2000 The New York Times paid $295 million for the
   <i>
    Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette
   </i>
   , Massachusetts' third-largest daily. After forming a digital unit to oversee its online publishing operations, the company shelved plans to spin off the unit as a tracking stock. It also sold seven of its smaller newspapers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its magazine operations (four golf titles) to
   <company id="40006">
    Advance Publications
   </company>
   in 2001 for $435 million. Late in the year the company was part of a group of investors calling themselves New England Sports Ventures, which bought the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park, and cable network New England Sports Network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Punch Sulzberger retired from the company's board, but retained the titles of chairman emeritus of The Times Company and of co-chairman of the
   <i>
    International Herald Tribune
   </i>
   . His daughter, Cathy Sulzberger, replaced him on the board. That year the company formed a joint venture with
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications
   </company>
   to run the Discovery Times Channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company agreed to sell its headquarters for $175 million. (It remained in the building until 2007, when it moved to a new skyscraper several blocks away.) Lewis announced his retirement as president, CEO, and director at the end of that year. Former COO Janet Robinson was named his successor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched a free weekly in New York City with a classified ad focus called
   <em>
    MarketPlace Weekly
   </em>
   in 2005. Later it acquired online information portal About.com (later
   <company id="53065">
    About Group
   </company>
   ) from
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   for $410 million, and it purchased a 49% stake in free daily paper
   <em>
    Metro Boston
   </em>
   from
   <company id="103253">
    Metro International
   </company>
   . (The Swedish publisher sold its stake to Seabay Media in 2009.) About 200 employees were laid off to help contain costs in the face of declining newspaper ad revenue. A further 250 jobs were cut the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 The New York Times Company acquired entertainment industry information provider
   <company id="138239">
    Baseline StudioSystems
   </company>
   from
   <company id="45216">
    Hollywood Media Corp.
   </company>
   for $35 million. Later the company sold its stake in the Discovery Times Channel back to Discovery Communications for $100 million. The New York Times Company further trimmed its noncore assets the following year, selling nine TV stations to
   <company id="155680">
    Oak Hill Capital Partners
   </company>
   for $575 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company sold off the last of its stake in the
   <company id="46712">
    Boston Red Sox
   </company>
   . The Times Co. also divested itself of some regional newspapers, as well as online content portal About.
