  <p>
   Founded in 1934 in St. Paul, Minnesota, the company used to be known as Old Dutch Products. It changed names to Old Dutch Foods during WWII to identify itself as a food company since it was frequently mistaken for the manufacturer of the popular-at-the-time powdered-cleaning product Old Dutch Cleanser.
