   Capstone Turbine's products are here when the lights go out. The company makes the Capstone MicroTurbine, a power-generating system that produces environmentally friendly electricity and heat. The microturbines, which can operate on a stand-alone basis or be connected to the utility grid, run on a variety of liquid and gaseous fuels, such as natural gas, diesel, kerosene, propane, and flare gases from landfills and sewage plants. In the event of a power outage, customers can use microturbines to produce their own secure power for extended periods of time; microturbines can also be used as onboard battery chargers for hybrid electric vehicles.

  <p>
   Capstone has operations in China, Europe, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South America, the UK, and the US. The US generates almost 40% of its overall revenue; Mexico is second, representing 13%.

  <p>
   Capstone has traditionally marketed its microturbines for use in cogeneration (using both electricity and heat), resource recovery (burning oil and gas and waste by-products), backup power supply, and remote power applications. Capstone also does a small business in onboard power generation for hybrid electric buses and railcars.

  <p>
   Capstone sells through distributors and caters to a limited number of customers, including Horizon Power Systems (17% of revenue for 2015) and BPC Engineering (11%).

  <p>
   Capstone has never been profitable, and expects the trend to continue until unit sales volumes increase enough to cover manufacturing costs. Revenues were down 13% from $133 million in 2014 to $115 million in 2015, and it suffered another net loss ($32 million) in 2015. The company had an accumulated deficit of $802 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by declines in all its products across all geographies including North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The decrease in the European market was primarily the result of the continuing geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and the effects of a stronger US dollar, which made its products more expensive overseas compared to fiscal 2014. Capstone was also negatively affected by the major drops in the oil and gas market which affected the timing of customer demand for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Capstone's net loss grew by 94% from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to lower revenue from two chief customers and a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   Capstone has its sights set on growing in North America, Europe, and Asia. It has developed and strengthened its relationships with distributors throughout those markets and has increased its local sales and service support network. The company is focusing on vertical markets that have high short-term growth potential. The oil and natural gas market continues to be a major focus for the company, but Capstone is also targeting sales to biogas facilities, high-rise buildings, and hybrid electric vehicles for new opportunities.
