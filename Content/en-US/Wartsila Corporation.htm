   Wärtsilä makes everything from auto components to power plants. The company's ship power division designs and markets marine propulsion and maneuvering equipment. The power plant division designs, builds, and operates power plants. Wärtsilä's services division (responsible for some 40% of sales) offers all of the necessary equipment and personnel required to maintain and support the many products and services they offer through more then 200 locations in 70 countries worldwide. The company makes most of its sales in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

  <p>
   The company operates through three segments: Service (40% of net sales), Ship Power (36%), and Power Plants (24%).

   After experiencing two straight years of revenue growth, Wärtsilä saw its revenues decline 18% from $6.8 billion in 2013 to $5.6 billion in 2014. Profits also fell 22% from $538 million to $422 million over that same time period. (Note: the company restated its 2012 and 2013 annual numbers due to a restructuring of its operations.)

   Wärtsilä foresees growth opportunities in gas-fueled power plants for the marine market. It is also seeking growth in the environmental sphere, including exhaust gas cleaning systems and ballast water management systems.

  <p>
   The company also grows its operations through the use of acquisitions. In late 2014, it agreed to acquire L-3 Marine Systems International, a company that supplies automation, navigation, and electrical systems to the marine, naval and offshore markets. The transaction will enhance Wärtsilä's presence in the marine and oil and gas industries.
