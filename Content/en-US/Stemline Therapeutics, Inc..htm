   Stemline Therapeutics is working on ways to eradicate cancer stem cells (CSC) and tumors. The development-stage biopharmaceutical company's pipeline includes three lead clinical-stage candidates (SL-401, SL-701, and SL-801) for leukemia and brain cancer in children and adults. Its drugs work by targeting CSCs, which are believed to be the seeds of tumors that often survive traditional cancer treatment. Stemline is part of the biopharma race to be the first to successfully kill CSCs and usher in a new era of cancer drugs. Once its candidates are approved, the company intends to create an in-house sales and marketing team for North America and Europe.

  <p>
   SL-401 targets blood cancers and is in a trial for patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). Immunotherapy SL-701 is in a trial in combination with Avastin to treat adults with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Finally, SL-801 is a novel small molecule protein inhibitor which will be studied in patients with advanced cancers.

  <p>
   Stemline is developing treatments for rare diseases that are treated by a relatively low number of physicians. As such, it plans to establish a small, specialized sales force for those products if and when the time comes for commercialization. It might also form partnerships with distributors or external sales forces to help market its products.

  <p>
   As a clinical-stage firm, Stemline has yet to generate revenue from product sales. Its modest revenues have instead come from a grant from the
   <company id="119366">
    Leukemia and Lymphona Society
   </company>
   ; this funding totaled $0.3 million in 2014 and $0.6 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, net losses for the company have been growing. The company lost a net $37.2 million in 2015, an increase of $8.4 million over the prior year. This was due to increased research and development expenses (but partially offset by the higher revenue).
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow decreased by $0.1 million that year to $25.5 million due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

  <p>
   Stemline believes it is the most clinically advanced of the drug companies targeting CSCs, and it intends to be first to market. Other strategic plans include commercializing its lead candidates beyond the diseases they currently target and into other blood and brain cancers. It also will develop its sales and marketing team, while keeping an eye out for potential sales and marketing partnerships and in-licensing opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company received

   breakthrough therapy designation for SL-401, which will serve to accelerate its development. Breakthrough therapies are given priority review when they show promise in preliminary clinical trials.
