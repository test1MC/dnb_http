   TSO3 helps clean up the medical industry in its own way. Using novel technology to replicate Earth's ozone layer, TSO3 develops and manufactures ozone sterilization processes and products that replicate these processes. The great majority of the company's customers are in the health care industry, such as workers in hospitals, clinics, universities, the pharmaceutical industry, and research centers. Its sterilizers are used to clean surgical and other heat-sensitive medical instruments. TSO3 was founded in 1998 in Quebec City as Technologies of Sterilization with Ozone.

   The Quebec-based company operates in Canada and the US. It generates 72% of its revenue from the US; the remainder stems from Canada.

   TSO3 sells its products to hospitals and other health care providers. In early 2015, the company signed a distribution agreement with
   <company id="159476">
    Getinge Infection Control AB
   </company>
   , a provider of infection control solutions, which became a sales agent of the company's STERIZONE VP4 Sterilizer. (This product accounted for 71% of its total sales in 2015.)

   TSO3 is attempting to recover after suffering a massive drop in revenues from 2012 to 2013. The company hasn't posted a profitable year yet; its most recent loss was $5.9 million in 2015. After experiencing negative cash flow for years, TSO3 posted positive operating cash flow of $2.8 million for 2015, primarily due to deferred revenues related to license fees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues more than tripled from $372 thousand in 2014 to $1.18 million in 2015. The recovery for 2015 was attributed to the recent FDA approval of its STERIZONE VP4 Sterilizer to commercialize in the US. This led to growth in the US due to a commercializing agreement with
   <company id="130220">
    Getinge Infection Control
   </company>
   . Sales from Canada also grew due to the approval for its STERIZONE VP4 Sterilizer in Canada in October 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its most recent net loss was mainly due to additional incurred marketing expenses associated with the commercialization of its STERIZONE  VP4 Sterilizer, severance costs associated with a former executive, reduced R&amp;D tax credits, and non recurrent expenses related to the write-off of patents.

  <p>
   Throughout 2016, TSO3 plans to deliver in excess of 100 sterilizers. The company is investing in its STERIZONE VP4 Sterilizer to address local market adoption and expand its service in the US market. It plans to introduce new products within the sterile reprocessing market such as its Sterizone 80L Sterilizer.

  <p>
   The company's best-selling product, the 125L (so named because its holding capacity is 125 liters), was the first of its kind. It was cleared by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   and had its first US-based sales in 2005.
