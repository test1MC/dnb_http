   Japan Display puts some of Japan's best and brightest electronics giants together on display. A joint venture formed in 2012 from the LCD display businesses of
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   , Japan Display manufactures small- and medium-sized display screens for consumer products like smartphones and tablets, as well as for automotive electronics and industrial equipment. The company, which holds a 20% market share, produces its displays through 10 manufacturing plants in Japan, China, and Taiwan and operates sales offices in Asia, Europe, and the US. Japanese public-private partnership
   <company id="162761">
    INCJ
   </company>
   owns a 70% share the joint venture, while Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi each hold a 10% stake. The company plans to go public.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Japan Display plans to raise as much as 200 billion yen ($2 billion) in an initial public offering with a government fund maintaining control after the IPO. The offering may take place before the end of March 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The companies formed the joint venture to better compete against rival display makers like
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , which recently spun off its LCD display unit into a separate
   <company id="162767">
    Samsung business
   </company>
   . Japan Display and its competitors are vying for dominance in the highly competitive small- and medium-sized display market, which supplies the booming mobile devices industry.

   Looking ahead, Japan Display aims to sharpen its competitive edge when it begins manufacturing OEL panels for smartphones and tablets and expects to make them available sometime before March 2013. OEL, or organic electroluminescent, is a display technology that allows for wider viewing angles than more traditional technologies like LCD. The company will also pursue R&amp;D on other next-generation display technologies such as OLED (organic light-emitting diode), which are currently most prominent in the small- to medium-sized form factor.
