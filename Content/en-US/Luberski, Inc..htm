   How does Luberski (dba Hidden Villa Ranch) deliver eggs to its food service, manufacturing, and retail customers? Very carefully, of course. The distributor of shell, liquid, and frozen eggs, as well as cheeses and other specialty food items, delivers these perishable products to customers throughout the US and to Eastern Europe, Mexico, the Pacific Rim, and South America. They appear under such names as Gold Circle Farms,

   , Smart Balance,

   , and California Sunshine. Hidden Villa Ranch has production and processing locations in about 15 states. Founded in the 1940s as an "egg laying" chicken ranch, the family-owned firm run by Tim Luberski is one of the nation's largest egg distributors.

   Already holding the licensing rights to make branded products under several popular names, Luberski inked a deal in 2010 that offers huge growth potential for the company. The move gave Luberski the worldwide licensee rights to the Wild Oats brand. As part of the agreement, Luberski leverages the license to make natural and organic food, beverages, and other products for distribution in supermarkets, as well as license the label to existing manufacturers of Wild Oats products. The sale of the Wild Oats license by

   was ordered by the
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   as part of its antitrust agreement in conjunction with Whole Foods' purchase of Wild Oats. Anthony Zolezzi, former CEO of New Organics Co. and Pet Promise natural pet food, served as the natural products industry expert to help seal the deal.
