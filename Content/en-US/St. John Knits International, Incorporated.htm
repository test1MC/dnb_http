   The patron saint of tailored attire, St. John (formerly St. John Knits) has clothed some of the nation's most couture-worthy women, including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Diane Sawyer. The company designs colorful, classically styled sportswear, career separates, and evening wear under the St. John name, as well as jewelry, shoes, handbags, and belts. St. John Knits sells its apparel and accessories through more than 25 company-operated boutiques in the US and Canada and via its e-commerce site. The St. John brand is also sold in high-end department stores in more than 25 countries. Vestar/Gray Investors, a partnership between the founding Gray family and

   , owns a majority of the company.

   The Irvine, California-based company manufactures the majority of its garments at company-owned facilities in Southern California. The brand has boutiques in throughout the US, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. With nearly 20 boutiques in China, the company is looking to add more.

   In a bid to pump up slumping sales, St. John hired actress Kate Winslet as its new face in 2011. Winslet is the latest in a string of models recruited by the brand to extend its appeal beyond its loyal clientele -- affluent "women of a certain age" -- to a younger set. Previously, model (and wife of White Stripes' Jack White) Karen Elson, and Angelina Jolie represented St. John. Despite taking a younger tack, sales have failed to pick up and the company was reported to be in merger talks with rival

   in 2012, as well as other potential bidders.

   More recently, First Lady Michelle Obama has been spotted wearing St. John apparel.

   Marie St. John made her first knit dress in 1962 to stretch her limited wardrobe budget. Her then-fianc√©, salesman Bob Gray, agreed to pitch her designs to department stores and got an order for 84 dresses on his first try. After scrambling to fill the unexpected order, St. John Knits International took off, appealing mostly to a clientele of mature career women who prefer a classic look.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 the couple sold 80% of the company to the Munich-based luxury apparel company Escada. Escada took the company public in 1993. The next year St. John introduced its contemporary woven Griffith &amp; Gray line (designed by the Grays' daughter, Kelly, and Diane Griffith) to attract younger shoppers. Kelly (also the company's signature model) became company president in 1996. In 1997 St. John entered the home furnishings field in a joint venture with fashion retailer Amen Wardy and began marketing its clothing in Japan. The company discontinued its less-expensive SJK line for younger women in 1998, just one year after its launch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amen Wardy and his son sued St. John in 1998 for wrongful termination and mismanagement after the firm ousted Wardy Jr. as president of the home furnishing chain; the parties settled and went their separate ways in 1999. That year, weary of Wall Street pressure to grow quickly, St. John reorganized in a $520 million partial buyout by the Gray family and Vestar Capital Partners, which left only about 7% of the stock in the hands of former shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 St. John named former Neiman Marcus executive Hugh Mullins as CEO, replacing Bob Gray, who remained chairman. In 2001 Mullins resigned as CEO, citing disenchantment with the transition from the retail business to the wholesale business. As a result, Gray became CEO once again in addition to his title of chairman. He retired as CEO in November 2002, replaced by co-CEOs Kelly Gray (his daughter) and COO Bruce Fetter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2004 Richard Cohen, former chief executive of the North American branch of Italian menswear company Ermenegildo Zegna, replaced Kelly Gray and Fetter as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Kelly Gray, the brand's longtime signature model and daughter of founder Marie Gray, was replaced by the younger model Gisele Bundchen. By July Marie herself stepped down as chief designer, a post she has held since founding the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Angelina Jolie was signed to be the face of St. John Knits.

   In February 2006, after 18 months at the top, Cohen stepped down as CEO, and former

   chief executive Philip Miller took over in the interim. Following Miller's departure, COO Bruce Fetter added the interim CEO title to his job description in April 2007. In September 2007 Glenn McMahon, formerly head of Dolce &amp; Gabbana USA, joined the company as CEO. (Fetter resumed his duties as president and COO.) Creative director Tim Gardner also resigned in July 2006, leaving the company without a senior designer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2008 George Sharp was named St. John Knits' creative director. Previously a designer at Ellen Tracy, Sharp has also worked for a handful of other American and European luxury brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched the youth-oriented casual clothing collection SoCa in 2008 but retired the line the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jolie finished up her contract as St. John Knits' brand ambassador in 2009, and she was succeeded in 2010 by model (and wife of White Stripes' Jack White) Karen Elson.
