   Celestica may not be the mother of all board makers, but it definitely ranks among the leaders. One of the world's top electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies, Celestica's output is mainly complex printed circuit assemblies, such as PC motherboards and communication and networking cards. These assemblies end up in servers, workstations, PCs, peripherals, and communications devices. Celestica also offers supply chain management, as well as design, global distribution, and post-sales repair services. Major customers include
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54603">
    Juniper Networks
   </company>
   . The Asia/Pacific region provides about 70% of Celestica's sales. Canadian investment firm
   <company id="52539">
    Onex
   </company>
   controls 71% of the company's voting power.

   Celestica generates about 40% of revenue from the communications market. Another 29% comes from its diversified segment, which includes customers in aerospace and defense as well as solar energy operators. About 18% comes from storage with another 10% from servers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />

   About three-quarter of Celestica's revenue comes from customers in Asia with another fifth from North America, with Canada accounting for 9% of the total.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates 14 manufacturing facilities around the world. Those with the biggest sales are in China, Mexico, Romania, and Thailand.

   Revenue was flat from 2014 to 2015 at $5.6 billion from level sales in almost each segment from year-to-year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celestica's net income fell 38% to $67 million in 2015 from $108 million in 2015. The company paid more in income taxes and raised spending in research and development.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated from operations slowed to $196 million in 2015 from $241.5 million in 2014.

   Celestica conducted some restructuring in 2015 following an evaluation of its operations. It consolidated some sites and cut the number of employee, taking charges of about $24 million. The company also sold its Toronto headquarter property and its manufacturing plant in the city for about $137 million (Canadian). The company will lease back the properties.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Celestica traces its history to 1917, when computer giant
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   -- then only six years old -- created a Canadian subsidiary. The plant, part of
   <company id="56952">
    IBM Canada
   </company>
   , made the casings for IBM products. The Toronto factory just missed being closed during IBM's cost-cutting drive of the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eugene Polistuk, who had joined IBM in 1969, became head of the Toronto operation in 1986. Seeking to give it a higher profile, Polistuk expanded the unit's offerings to include circuit boards, memory devices, and power supplies, thus moving it into the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales reached nearly $1.5 billion in 1993, and the next year IBM made the operation a wholly owned subsidiary named Celestica. Celestica was spun off as an independent contract manufacturer in 1996, with Polistuk as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 IBM sold Celestica, which operated a single factory of 1 million sq. ft., to Toronto-based service conglomerate
   <company id="52539">
    Onex
   </company>
   for about $750 million. The company blossomed under Onex's growth-oriented tutelage. In 1997 Celestica bought Design to Distribution, Europe's largest EMS company. It also acquired two US facilities from
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , which became a major client.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celestica went public in 1998 with a $360.5 million IPO. That year it acquired printed circuit assembly operation of
   <company id="132632">
    Silicon Graphics International
   </company>
   . By 1998 the company operated nearly 20 factories in North America, the UK, and Ireland. It expanded into Asia by acquiring International Manufacturing Services, a California-based EMS concern with operations in China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. That year sales topped $5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Celestica reinforced its filial bond with IBM by acquiring IBM operations in Minnesota and Italy. The acquisition, Celestica's largest to date, added 1,800 employees and included lucrative IBM manufacturing contracts. Later that year the company acquired a Brazilian plant from
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   as part of a $1.2 billion, five-year deal to supply telecommunications equipment back to the Japanese electronics giant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celestica continued its string of factory acquisitions in 2001 when it agreed to purchase manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations from telecom equipment supplier
   <company id="101196">
    Avaya
   </company>
   for about $200 million. The deal included a supply agreement worth $4 billion over its five-year term. The company struck a similar deal with French cell phone maker Sagem (now
   <company id="90795">
    SAFRAN
   </company>
   ) later the same year, acquiring a factory and 850 employees in the Czech Republic as part of a supply agreement worth $500 million over three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2001, amid an industrywide slowdown, Celestica announced first one and then another round of layoffs that combined to reduce its workforce by about 20%. Also that year Celestica bought Singapore's
   <company id="159029">
    Omni Industries
   </company>
   for about $890 million in cash and stock. It also announced a long-term agreement with Lucent Technologies (now
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ) to buy two of the networking goliath's plants for between $550 and $650 million; Celestica provided manufacturing services for Lucent in a five-year, $10 billion deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Celestica entered into another major deal with NEC, under which it bought two telecommunications equipment plants in Japan from the electronics giant; it gained a contract to supply NEC with $2.5 billion of goods over five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, following the announcement of an anticipated fourth-quarter loss in the preceding year, chairman and CEO Eugene Polistuk unexpectedly retired. Director Robert Crandall was named chairman, and Stephen Delaney, who served as president of Celestica's Americas operations, was tapped as CEO. Celestica acquired fellow EMS provider
   <company id="54604">
    Manufacturers' Services Limited
   </company>
   (MSL) for about $275 million. Celestica also sold its power systems business to
   <company id="11819">
    C&amp;D Technologies
   </company>
   that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired flat-panel display repair specialist Displaytronix in 2005. In 2006 Celestica divested Omni Industries. Also that year the company sold its facility in Vimercate, Italy, to Bartolini Progetti. The plant employed about 850 people. Celestica agreed to provide EMS, aftermarket, new product introduction, and support services to Bartolini Progetti, a logistics firm, on a subcontract basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stephen Delaney resigned in 2006 and was succeeded as CEO by president Craig Muhlhauser, who joined Celestica in 2005 after serving as president and CEO of battery maker
   <company id="16278">
    Exide Technologies
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Celestica bought two companies in an effort to diversify beyond its traditional communications and computer customers. The company acquired Scotland-based Invec Solutions, a provider of parts repair and service to IT and consumer electronics companies, and integrated Invec's reverse logistics software into its aftermarket services. Celestica also bought Austria-based Allied Panels (now AlliedPanels), a medical engineering and contract manufacturing firm that specializes in diagnostic imaging equipment, expanding its business in the health care diagnostics and imaging market with expertise in 3-D ultrasound technology and a customer base that includes
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103808">
    Siemens Healthcare
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="56599">
    SonoSite
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Celestica bought the semiconductor equipment contract manufacturing operations of
   <company id="42833">
    Brooks Automation
   </company>
   for about $80 million. The acquisition, which expanded Celestica's industrial business, included facilities in Oregon and China that specialize in making front-end modules used in wafer handling and transportation equipment, vacuum transfer modules, and custom subsystems for OEM equipment. It also included systems integration services for large equipment makers.
