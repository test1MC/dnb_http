   The United Methodist Publishing House (UMPH) keeps Christian clergy from running out of reading material. Operated by a board of directors selected by the United Methodist Church's jurisdictional conferences and Council of Bishops, the company publishes and distributes content for Christian clergy and laity. It develops, produces, and sells official denominational church school curriculum materials, books, music, software, and multimedia resources for homes, churches, and church offices. Founded in 1789, UMPH is the oldest and largest general agency of the United Methodist Church, and it contributes a portion of its annual revenues to the church's clergy pension fund.

   UMPH operates through a variety of holdings. Its Abingdon Press publishing imprint develops the Dimensions for Living series of books about Christian faith, and its Kingswood Books academic imprint is for scholarly works on Methodist and Wesleyan studies. In addition, it publishes a bi-monthly professional magazine for Methodist pastors and a weekly newsletter for Methodist leaders. UMPH also includes a retail division, Cokesbury, which offers a chain of Christian-themed retail outlets, catalog sales, and a Web store.
