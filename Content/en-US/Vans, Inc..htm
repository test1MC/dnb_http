   Although the movie
   <em>
    Fast Times at Ridgemont High
   </em>
   put Vans sneakers on the map, the company owes its current popularity to the fashion sense of extreme-sports enthusiasts who weren't even born then. Vans designs and sells footwear and apparel for casual wear and for use in activities such as skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, bicycle motocross (BMX), and motocross. Vans merchandise is sold in the US by national chain stores and in skate, surf, and specialty shops in North America, Europe, and Asia. As part of its marketing strategy, Vans backs bands through music festivals. The company is owned by

    V.F. Corporation
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Vans operates about 350 V.F.-operated Vans stores located in Asia, Europe, and North America through 150 partnerships.

   The footwear firm is one of its parent's most popular brands worldwide. Indeed, sales for Vans rose 23% from 2011 to 2012, thanks to growth in domestic and international markets. The shoe maker attributes the boost to new store openings, comparable store sales growth, and an expanded e-commerce business.

   Internationally, Vans has begun to tap the huge market in China, where it boasts about half a dozen in-store shops in department stores in Beijing and Shanghai, and its own Vans store in Shanghai. Elsewhere, the retailer operates an outlet on Carnaby Street in London as its flagship retail store in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company is known for its footwear, it is working to grow the Vans apparel business and its market share among female customers. Launching a Hello Kitty line of Vans has helped to pique the interest of women. As a way to market itself nationwide, its parent company owns 70% of the Vans Warped Tour, a music festival that showcases some 40 punk rock bands that perform in more than 40 North American cities each summer.

  <p>
   Founded by Paul Van Doren, his son Jim, and two other partners, The Van Doren Rubber Company began shoe production and opened its first store in 1966. Dozens more stores opened that year. The company's shoes gained a foothold among skateboarders in the 1970s. In 1980 Jim took over the firm.

   When Sean Penn slapped himself in the head with checkered Vans in
   <i>
    Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
   </i>
   sales took off. However, the operation overexpanded, and in 1984 Van Doren Rubber entered Chapter 11. Paul took charge again the next year. McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co. acquired the company in 1988 and took it public in 1991, changing the name to Vans. Sales slowed in 1993, and inventory stockpiled as the company started to import shoes made in South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Vans closed its original factory in Orange, California. Also in 1995 Britannia jeans founder Walter Schoenfeld came out of retirement and, with his son Gary, took charge. The Schoenfelds got Vans more involved in sponsorship of sporting and music events. Vans began marketing its own clothing line in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales growth slowed in fiscal 1998 as Vans' Japanese distribution system fell apart, and the company closed its only US plant, cutting nearly 300 employees. Vans redefined vertical integration in 1998 by opening a 46,000-sq.-ft. skate park -- including an 80-ft. vent ramp -- in Orange, California. It also purchased Switch, a maker of snowboard boot-binding systems, and it opened its first European stores in Liverpool and Barcelona.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vans formed joint ventures with
   <company id="16239">
    Sunglass Hut International
   </company>
   (to make and sell Vans and Vans Triple Crown sunglasses) and teen apparel retailer
   <company id="16000">
    Pacific Sunwear of California
   </company>
   (to make and sell Vans apparel) in 1999. Vans also launched its Triple Crown store concept and opened two more skate parks in California that year. In 2000 Vans built skate parks in Texas and Virginia and by 2001 had expanded its number of skate parks to nine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company delved further into the music business in 2002 with the formation of its own music label, Vans Records. Also in 2002 Vans added protective gear to its product list when it bought Mosa Extreme Sports, maker of Pro-Tec helmets and pads.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Vans retooled its women's line and launched a new line called the Vault Collection that is based on styles popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Also in 2003 the company closed its joint ventures in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Vans was acquired by
   <company id="11572">
    VF Corporation
   </company>
   for about $400 million.
