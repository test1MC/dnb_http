  <p>
   Integration of LDI's various businesses is fostered through securing strategic routes to market. The company's 300,000-sq.-ft. distribution facility in Virginia for its office products unit, Safco gives the company cost-effective, timely access to customers on the East Coast, as well as to international markets through the Port of Virginia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike a venture capital company that buys companies to sell them, LDI acquires companies to run them. The company first set itself apart from other businesses by combining substrates like plastic, paper, aluminum, and wood to create sturdier packaging. Desiring to "spread the risk" across several industries, the company has since branched out into other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company seeks to invest in companies that share its values, have outstanding people, and display growth potential in their respective markets.

  <p>
   In 2016 Liberty Carton acquired the packaging business assets of Western Container Company. Both are Minneapolis-area companies, and Western Container Company will continue to operate its steel, fiber and plastic drum business from its existing facility in New Hope, Minnesota.

   In 2014 LDI acquired San Diego-based Harbor Packaging, a designer and manufacturer of corrugated packaging and point of purchase (POP) displays in Southern California and Mexico. The deal enabled it to tap growing packaging market opportunities in the region.

  <p>
   LDI's breadth of operations traces back to its early beginnings in 1918. As Liberty Carton, the company collected, refurbished, and then resold used burlap bags, crates, and wooden boxes. As wooden boxes went the way of the horse-drawn wagon (which is what founder Jack Fiterman originally used), the firm began expanding, making cardboard cartons and plastic containers, and has not stopped.
