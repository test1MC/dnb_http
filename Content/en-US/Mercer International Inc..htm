   Mercer International maintains its health with a high-fiber diet. The company operates primarily in the pulp business, producing virgin fiber (wood chips and pulpwood) and recycled fiber. It specializes in manufacturing northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp from its mills in Western Canada and Germany. Its three subsidiary mills, called Rosenthal, Stendal, and Celgar, have the collective capacity to churn out 1.5 million air-dried metric tons (ADMTs) annually. Pulp is sold mainly to tissue and paper manufacturers. Mercer also produces biochemicals and bio-energy, with three mills collectively producing more than 700,000 MWh of electric power and more than 20,000 tons of biochemicals.

  <p>
   Mercer reported sales of nearly $1.1 billion in 2013, a 1% decline versus 2012. Pulp revenues increased 2% in 2013 versus 2012, primarily due to higher average pulp sales, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Demand from China was stable throughout 2013, which resulted in higher prices. Sales of surplus energy and chemicals dipped by about 1% year over year, on lower sales volumes. The company's net loss widened in 2013 to $26.4 million from $15.7 million.
