   If you love ooey-gooey-good baked goods, H.C. Brill has found your thrill. The company, part of the CSM Bakery Supplies business of New York-based buyout firm Rhône Capital, makes a wide variety of commercial bakery products for the US market. H.C. Brill specializes in making and marketing frozen doughs and batters, icings and glazes, powdered and liquid fillings, whipped toppings, and frozen cakes. It's the world's largest wholesale manufacturer of icings and glazes. The firm also produces consumer products, such as prepared mixes for bread, brownies, cakes, and puddings, as well as fruit-based glazes and fillings. Rhône acquired the business from Dutch food products manufacturer Corbion (formerly CSM) in 2013.

   To transition to a bio-based ingredients company, Corbion divested its bakery supplies unit to affiliates of private equity firm Rhône Capital LLC in a deal valued at €1.05 billion ($1.43 billion). The deal also involved Rhône Capital acquiring the CSM brand name. Rhône has offices in London and New York and invests in several industries, such as consumer, chemical, energy, industrial, materials, mining, and shipping.
