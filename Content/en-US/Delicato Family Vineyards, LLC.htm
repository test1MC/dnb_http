   Delicato Family Vineyards owns and operates 10,000 acres of vineyards in Monterey, Lodi, and Manteca, California. The company, also known as DFV Wines, produces a variety of red and white wines, including chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, pinot grigio, shiraz, white zinfandel, and merlot, all under the Delicato label. Its boxed Delicato wine, called the Bota Box, is said to stay fresh for up to 45 days after opening. The company's wines are available in restaurants and at wine retailers throughout the US. In 2010 it acquired the Black Stallion Winery located in Napa Valley, adding to its holdings in California. The family-owned winery was founded in 1924 by Gasparé Indelicato.
