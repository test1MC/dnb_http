   Snackers who crave a taste for the South seek Golden Enterprises. Operating through subsidiary Golden Flake Snack Foods, the company makes and distributes a barbecue and other Southern flavored-varieties of potato chips, fried pork skins, corn chips, onion rings, and baked and fried cheese curls, among others. It also markets peanut butter, canned dips, dried meat snacks, pretzels, and nuts packed by other manufacturers under the Golden Flake brand.

   Golden Enterprises' operations comprise a main production plant located at its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama, and a smaller production plant in Ocala, Florida.

These fleets travel some 15 Southeastern states, including Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, and South Carolina. To a lesser extent, Golden Enterprises also serves parts of Florida, North Carolina, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana, and Texas.

   Golden Enterprises logged $135.9 million in revenue in fiscal 2014 (ended May), a 1% drop vs. 2013. Net income for the snacks maker has been trending downward in recent years, eking out a profit of $900,000 in 2014 after 2013's $1.1 million profit. Conspiring against a net income gain were overall sales declines and $1 million in restructuring charges. Decreased revenue and interest expenses have also affected Golden Enterprise's cash flow, which came in at $3.3 million in 2014, down from $4.6 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Mose Lischkoff and Frank Mosher founded Magic City Foods in the basement of a Birmingham, Alabama, grocery store in 1923. Named for the city's moniker, the company cranked out potato chips, peanut butter crackers, and horseradish. Employee Helen Friedman and her mother bought out Lischkoff, and in 1928 Helen married Mosher.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the couple divorced, Helen received the company in settlement and led it to nearly $1 million in sales by 1946. This captured the attention of the Bashinsky family, who bought the business that year and renamed it Magic City Food Products. Ten years later, Sloan Bashinsky bought the company from his father and uncle, and he changed its name to Golden Flake in 1957. Golden Flake acquired snack-food maker Don's Foods in 1963, and five years later it went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diversification came in 1971 with the acquisitions of Steel City Bolt &amp; Screw, Nall &amp; Associates, and a real estate and insurance subsidiary. The real estate and insurance unit was sold in 1977, the year Golden Enterprises was formed as a holding company with Golden Flake Snack Foods as its subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   President John Stein became CEO in 1991. Four years later Golden Enterprises sold all its nonfood companies to concentrate on snack foods. Bashinsky ceded the chairman title to Stein in 1996 but remained as chairman emeritus. Golden Enterprises' fiscal 1999 results were hurt by rival

   's steep discounting of its snacks. In 2000 the firm sold its Nashville, Tennessee, manufacturing plant. In 2001 Mark McCutcheon, president of Golden Flake, also was named president and CEO of Golden Enterprises, while Stein remained chairman. Bashinsky died in 2005.
