   Perhaps well-known for supplying "Wilson," the volleyball in the movie
   <em>
    Cast Away
   </em>
   , Wilson Sporting Goods has earned the title as the world's top maker of sports balls. The company makes and markets the gear used to tear it up on courts, courses, and athletic fields worldwide. Wilson produces and sells sports equipment and apparel for golf, racquet sports (badminton, racquetball, squash, tennis), and team sports (baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball). The company's branded balls are used by the

   , the

    NCAA

   , and various other professional and collegiate soccer and tennis teams. Wilson, which serves players in more than 100 countries, is owned by

   Wilson divides its business into three segments: Racquet Sports, Team Sports, and Golf. The Americas region generated some 40% of its parent's revenue in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   Under the ownership of Amer Sports, the sporting goods maker has become the world's top maker of sports balls, in terms of market share. Its largest revenue generator is the US, thanks to the company's strong brand reputation among consumers in baseball, basketball, and football. Its soccer products have even earned a foothold in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region (including Japan, South Korea, and Australia), as well as Latin America.

   Wilson's sales network serves customers in 100-plus countries. It sells its products to sporting goods chains, specialty retailers, mass merchants, fitness clubs, and distributors, as well as directly to consumers through factory outlets, brand stores, and online via the likes of Tennis Warehouse, Tennis Plaza, Midwest Sports, and Golf Warehouse, and

  <p>
   Wilson has taken steps to increase its visibility in racquet sports, tennis, and golf. Through a partnership with Championship Volleyball (CV) inked in 2012 Wilson became the exclusive volleyball supplier of Championship Volleyball. The alliance, which extends to kneepads, backpacks, and other volleyball related equipment, makes Wilson the only ball of choice at all CV clinics and events, which attract the best volleyball players nationwide and from the world.

   Once the top brand of golfers age 45 to 65, the company saw sales slip as rivals like
   <company id="15521">
    Callaway
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   began to aggressively promote their equipment. As the entire industry experienced well-documented declines, however, Wilson continued to report growth in golf club and ball sales. To keep the momentum going, the company in 2014 added six new territory managers for its US golf division; it took advantage of layoffs at other manufacturers to snag seasoned pros with golf sales experience.
