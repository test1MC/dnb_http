   A colossus of off-roads, Titan International makes off-highway steel wheels and tires for the agricultural, construction, mining, and consumer markets. It assembles wheel-tire systems for original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket distributors of tractors, cranes, combines, scrapers, all-terrain vehicles, golf carts, and utility trailers. Other operations include the manufacture and distribution of wheels, rims, and tires to the military for trucks, tanks, and personnel carriers, as well as boat and trailer wheels for the consumer. Titan sells its products directly to manufactures and through dealers, distributors, and at its own distribution centers.

   Titan's agricultural wheels and rims range in diameter from 1 ft. to 7 ft., the latter being the largest agricultural wheel manufactured in North America. Agricultural accounts for nearly 55% of sales. Its earthmoving/construction (also known as OTR or off-the-road) rims, wheels, and tires range in outside diameter from 3 to 13 ft., and can weigh as much as 12,500 lbs.

   After experiencing phenomenal growth the last four years, Titan saw its revenue drop 12% from $2.2 billion in 2013 to $1.9 billion in 2014. It also posted its first net loss ($80 million) in five years during 2014 due to mining asset impairment and inventory writedowns and noncash goodwill impairment charges incurred in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2014 were driven by a 14% drop in agriculture sales and a 18% decline in earthmoving/construction sales. Titan also experienced decreases in the US (22%) and Brazil (11%). Titan was especially hurt by decreased demand for high horsepower agricultural equipment and products used in the mining industry, including giant OTR tires.
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting a massive rise in operating cash flow from $4 million in 2011 to $130 million in 2012, the company's cash flow dropped to $117 million in 2013 and $114 million in 2014 due to the net loss and a spike in cash used in inventories and prepaid and other current assets.

   In 2013 Titan purchased Voltyre-Prom, a leading producer of agricultural and industrial tires in Volgograd, Russia. The deal allowed Titan to expand its global footprint and enhance its product offerings throughout Eastern Europe.
