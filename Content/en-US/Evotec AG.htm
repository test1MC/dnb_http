   Big pharmaceutical companies watching their pipelines dry up might want to give Evotec a call. The drug discovery and development firm partners with larger drug companies to discover new compounds and bring them into clinical trials. Its capabilities include assay development, screening, and medicinal chemistry. Evotec has broad collaborations with
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   and
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   to find therapies for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), its area of expertise. It also has a pipeline of preclinical and clinical CNS drugs of its own; it intends to find partners to take on development of the drugs in late-stage clinical trials.

  <p>
   The company has collaboration and R&amp;D agreements with a whole host of big name pharma companies including
   <company id="116564">
    Bayer
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech.
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   Traditionally, Evotec has provided its research services on a fee-for-service basis. However, the company has been moving toward broader, more integrated partnerships in which it receives results-based payments, such as milestone payments and royalties. For example, Evotec,
   <company id="40201">
    Harvard
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="40224">
    Howard Hughes Medical Institute
   </company>
   (HHMI) established an R&amp;D initiative called CureBeta to identify and develop disease-state modifying therapeutic targets. As a result of this collaboration, Evotec licensed a portfolio of small molecules and biologics (identified by Harvard scientists and analyzed in collaboration with Evotec scientists) designed to trigger the regeneration of insulin-producing beta cells to
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   in 2012. Under the agreement, an upfront payment of $8 million, milestone payments of up to $300 million per product, and royalty payments on future sales from the collaboration will be shared by Evotec and Harvard. Evotech will also receive additional research support in collaboration with Janssen.

   The company's headquarters are in Germany and it has key offices in the US, India, and the UK. Customers in the US account for about half of Evotec's revenues with another 40% coming from Europe.

   Revenue grew 6% in 2012 based partially on the full-year contributions of acquisitions made the prior year, which netted the company its Munich and San Francisco offices. On the other hand, net income dropped 63% partially due to the added expense of the additional offices. Currency conversions didn't help matters. But prudent investing yielded an increase in cash flow.

   Evotec stays vigilant for new ways to help pharma companies do what they do while discovering new drugs for itself. On the heels of its successful collaborations with Harvard (CureBeta) and
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   (CureNephron), the company has launched CureNeuron and CureHeart internally and is seeking partners. It also created CureMN (for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.

   In late 2016, Evotec acquired UK-based pre-clinical contract research organization (CRO)
   <company id="120627">
    Cyprotex
   </company>
   for Â£55.7 million. Cyprotex helps manufacturers identify potential toxins early in the drug discovery stage with a number of high content screening (HCS) platforms.
