  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A multi-channel marketer, LS&amp;CO. sells its products in more than 50,000 retail locations worldwide. Its brands lend themselves to a variety of retail formats, including chain retailers (JCPenney, Kohl's, Wal-Mart, and Target), department stores (Macy's, Nordstrom, and Barney's), and company-operated e-commerce sites and online stores of other retailers. Sales to its top 10 wholesale customers have accounted for approximately 30% of revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distributes its products through a wide variety of retail formats around the world, including chain and department stores, franchise stores and shop-in-shops, company-operated retail network, multi-brand specialty stores, mass channel retailers, and both company-operated and retailer ecommerce sites.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenue was $4.5 billion during fiscal 2016, up slightly compared to the prior fiscal year. The small increase was largely driven by an increase in revenue from Europe. LS&amp;CO. reported net income of about $291 million for fiscal 2016, which was a slight spike compared to the $209 million the company reported for net income in fiscal 2015. The high cost of producing the goods the company sells, along with its selling, general, administrative, and interest expenses resulted in LS&amp;CO.'s modest net income on $4.5 billion in revenue.

  <p>
   LS&amp;CO continued in 2016 to follow a handful of growth-oriented measures, including: driving profitable growth of its core men's pants brands (Dockers and Levi's); expanding its brand reach and diversifying into new or undertapped geographic markets, including China, India, Russia, and Brazil; becoming omni-channel through online stores, franchises, and company-operated stores; and improving its cost structure to ensure long-term profitable growth.

  <p>
   Levi Strauss arrived in New York City from Bavaria in 1847. In 1853 he joined his brother-in-law, David Stern, in San Francisco, selling dry goods to the gold rushers. Shortly after, a prospector told Strauss of miners' problems in finding sturdy pants. Strauss made a pair out of canvas for the prospector; word of the rugged pants spread quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strauss continued his dry-goods business in the 1860s. During this time he switched the pants' fabric to a durable French cloth called serge de Nimes, soon known as denim. He colored the fabric with indigo dye and adopted the idea from Nevada tailor Jacob Davis of reinforcing the pants with copper rivets. In 1873 Strauss and Davis produced their first pair of waist-high overalls (later known as jeans). The pants soon became
   <i>
    de rigueur
   </i>
   for lumberjacks, cowboys, railroad workers, oil drillers, and farmers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strauss continued to build his pants and wholesaling business until he died in 1902. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. passed to four Stern nephews who carried on their uncle's jeans business while maintaining the company's philanthropic reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Walter Haas and Peter Haas (a fourth-generation Strauss family member) assumed leadership of LS&amp;CO. In 1948 they ended the company's wholesaling business to concentrate on Levi's clothing. In the 1950s Levi's jeans ceased to be merely functional garments for workers; they became the uniform of American youth. In the 1960s LS&amp;CO. added women's attire and expanded overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1971. That year it added a women's career line and bought Koret sportswear (sold in 1984). By the mid-1980s profits declined. Peace Corps-veteran-turned-McKinsey-consultant Robert Haas (Walter's son) grabbed the reins of LS&amp;CO. in 1984 and took the company private the next year (he became chairman in 1989). He also instilled a touchy-feely corporate culture often at odds with the bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 LS&amp;CO. introduced Dockers casual pants. The company's sales began rising in 1991 as consumers forsook the designer duds of the 1980s for more practical clothes. LS&amp;CO. says seven out of every 10 American men own a pair of Dockers. However, LS&amp;CO. missed out on the birth of another trend: the split between the fashion sense of US adolescents and their Levi's-loving, baby boomer parents.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company introduced Slates dress slacks. That year LS&amp;CO. bought back nearly one-third of its stock from family and employees for $4.3 billion. Grappling with slipping sales and debt from the buyout, in 1997 LS&amp;CO. closed 11 of its 37 North American plants, laying off 6,400 workers and 1,000 salaried employees; it granted generous severance packages even to those earning minimum wage.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998, citing improved labor conditions in China, LS&amp;CO. announced it would step up its use of Chinese subcontractors. Further restructuring added a third of its European plants to the closures list that year. LS&amp;CO.'s sales fell 13% in fiscal 1998. Also that year Haas handed his CEO title to Pepsi executive Philip Marineau; Haas remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   LS&amp;CO. closed 11 of 22 remaining North American plants in 1999. It also unleashed several new jeans brands that eschewed the company's one-style-fits-all approach of old.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2002 LS&amp;CO. announced it would close six of its last eight US plants and cut 20% of its worldwide staff (3,300 workers). In September 2003 it cut another 5% of its global staff (650 workers). That month the company opened its first girls-only store, located in Paris. In December LS&amp;CO. replaced CFO Bill Chiasson with an outside turnaround specialist.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinpointing 2006 as the best time to step down as the company's chief executive, Philip Marineau retired at the end of 2006. John Anderson, president of LS&amp;CO.'s Asia/Pacific division and head of the firm's global supply chain unit, replaced Marineau as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Levi Strauss chairman Robert Haas retired in 2008 after 18 years in that role. His successor was

   </company>
   ice cream executive T. Gary Rogers, who became the first leader in the company's history who was not a  descendant of the founder. In August 2008 CFO Hans Ploos van Amstel left the company the and was replaced by Heidi Manes, its corporate controller and principal accounting officer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to gain a more active role in its store business, LS&amp;CO. in July 2009 bought the operating rights for more than 70 Levi's and Dockers Outlet locations from store operator Anchor Blue Retail Group, which had filed for bankruptcy, for $72 million. Anchor Blue said the US recession and drop in consumer spending, especially among teens, severely affected its financial performance. LS&amp;CO. said the acquisition will enable it to better manage its brands' positioning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rogers retired in late 2009, and Richard Kauffman became chairman.
