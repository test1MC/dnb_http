   FMC Technologies' name is a vestige of its early years as a food machinery maker, but today this company's bread and butter is oil and gas equipment. FMC Technologies offers subsea drilling and production systems for the exploration and production of oil and gas. It also offers similar equipment and services for onshore oil production. The company's energy infrastructure segment makes fluid control, measurement, marine loading, separation, material handling, blending systems, and other equipment. Its offerings are divided into three chief segments: subsea technologies, surface technologies, and energy infrastructure. In 2016 the company agreed to merge with
   <company id="92823">
    Technip
   </company>
   to form a $13 billion company, TechnipFMC.

  <p>
   FMC Technologies is the world's largest manufacturer of "Christmas Trees," an assembly of control valves, gauges, and chokes that control oil and gas flow in an underwater, or subsea, oil well. The trees are a crucial component of the company's subsea systems that direct the flow of oil and gas to processing stations on land or on the offshore production platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its operations are divided into three segments. Subsea technologies (products and systems used underwater for the exploration of crude oil and natural gas) accounted for 66% of total 2014 sale. Surface technologies (27%) makes equipment used on land and offshore exploration, while energy infrastructure (7%) makes liquid and gas measurement and transportation equipment and systems.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Subsea Technologies sells its products via its own technical sales organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 about 73% of total sales came from outside the US where it has targeted opportunities in West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region because of the offshore drilling potential in these regions.

  <p>
   In 2015 FMC Technologies' net revenues decreased by 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Subsea Technologies decreased $757.4 million, including $540.6 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily as a result of the Brazilian real and Norwegian krone. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Subsea Technologies' revenues decreased by $216.8 million. The decline in crude oil price had an unfavorable effect on the subsea market which led to decreased order activity for subsea systems and services. Additionally, revenues were hurt by lower sales volumes in Schilling Robotics and Multi Phase Meters businesses as a result of lower market activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Surface Technologies decreased as the result of lower market activity in North America which stymied demand for well service pumps and flowline products in its fluid control business and conventional wellheads in its surface integrated services business. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenue by $74.3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy Infrastructure revenues declined due to lower sales volumes primarily in measurement solutions business driven by the market downturn. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by $38.7 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 FMC Technologies' net income decreased by 44% due to lower net sales and an increase in restructuring and impairment expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 4% due to the changes in receivables driven by its portfolio of projects. In addition, changes in inventories also contributed towards higher cash inflow from operations.

  <p>
   The company develops close working relationships with its customers. The Subsea Technologies business results reflect their ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner.
  </p>
  <p>
   FMC Technologies' long-term strategy is to maintain its subsea market leadership, continuing to invest in the technologies required to develop its customers' challenging assets and further expand its capabilities focused on increasing reservoir production over the life of the field. It continues to focus on subsea processing and subsea services as key long-term growth platforms so that it can expand its role as life-of-field partners with customers by lowering their costs and improving their recovery. The company has targeted opportunities in West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea and the Asia-Pacific region because of the expected offshore drilling potential in those regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surface Technologies has prepared for decreased North American land activity in 2015, which will affect the company's surface wellhead, fluid control, and completion services businesses in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company forms joint ventures and uses acquisitions to add additional revenue streams to its impressive balance sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 FMC Technologies and
   <company id="92823">
    Technip
   </company>
   received all regulatory approvals to make their 50/50 joint venture Forsys Subsea legal and operational. The joint venture is part of a broader alliance between FMC Technologies and Technip that unites the skills and capabilities of two subsea leaders to redefine the way subsea fields are designed, delivered, and maintained.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company completed integration efforts in its Surface Technologies segment. These integration efforts, primarily in North America, brought together the services acquired from Pure Energy and surface wellhead business to create an integrated shale offering. These integration efforts of Surface Technologies products and services resulted in Surface Technologies now being organized and operated under the three businesses of surface integrated services, surface wellhead international, and fluid control.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 FMC Technologies signed an agreement with Anadarko, BP,
   <company id="105905">
    ConocoPhillips
   </company>
   , and Shell to jointly develop a new generation of standardized subsea production equipment and systems designed to meet the challenges of producing oil and gas from deepwater reservoirs with pressures of up to 20,000 psi and temperatures of 350Â°F at the mudline.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also signed a long term agreement with Wintershall Norge AS to supply subsea production systems for its developments offshore Norway.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 the company signed a four-year deal with
   <company id="41357">
    PETROBRAS
   </company>
   to provide subsea services for its fields offshore Brazil, and renewed a deal with Statoil to provide subsea operations services for its developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year FMC Technologies also signed a five-year agreement with Tullow Ghana Ltd. to provide subsea services for its developments in the Jubilee field, offshore Ghana.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 FMC Technologies formed a joint venture with Edison Chouest Offshore LLC to provide integrated vessel-based subsea services for offshore oil and gas companies globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its portfolio, FMC Technologies in 2012 acquired Calgary-based Pure Energy Services Ltd. for approximately $285 million. FMC acquired Pure Energy, which provides frac flowback and wireline services for oilfields in North America, to complement its Surface Technologies segment. The combination provides an integrated set of well site products and services, which should increase value for customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other key 2012 acquisitions include the purchase of Control Systems International, a major supplier of control and automation systems for the oil and gas industry, for an undisclosed price, and the purchase of Schilling Robotics, which produces remotely operated vehicles and other control systems for oil and gas subsea production.
  </p>
  <p>
   FMC Technologies was formed as subsidiary of
   <company id="10540">
    FMC Corporation
   </company>
   in 2000 and went public as an independent unit the next year. It spun off its industrial food equipment and airport systems unit into a separate company called
   <company id="159876">
    John Bean Technologies
   </company>
   in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   FMC Technologies traces its roots to 1884 when inventor John Bean developed a new type of spray pump to combat San Jose scale in California's orchards and formed the Bean Spray Pump Company to commercialize it.
