  <p>
   Curtis' technology isn't about replacing the lead-acid battery -- the company sees the commercial potential for lead-acid batteries in hybrid vehicles to achieve better gas mileage. While traditional batteries have a limit to their improvement based on the chemistry of lead acid, Curtis' hybrid technology can optimize the charge and discharge of regular batteries. The company has designed and created instrumentation that allows for a better understanding of the inner workings of a battery, especially internal temperature, which is crucial to slowing degradation and allowing an optimum charge. The firm holds more than 50 patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company invests more than 10% of its gross sales in research and development through four R&amp;D centers located in California, New York, China, and Switzerland.

  <p>
   In 2011 Curtis introduced a new electric power steering controller for use in material handling and other light industrial vehicles. It also launched enGage VII, a microprocessor based, programmable, CAN compatible instrument which can be used to display information in a wide variety of electric vehicle applications.

  <p>
   Curtis supplied elapsed-time indicators for the Lunar Modules that landed on the moon in the Apollo spacecraft missions and gages for the Lunar Roving Vehicles. Using expertise gained from going to the moon, the company developed a solid-state battery gage with circuitry to prevent deep discharge in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1960 by Curtis Beusman and the late Edward Marwell.
