   If a pharmacy needs it, Apothecary Products probably has it. The company provides a variety of pharmacy supplies (such as pill bottles and dosage systems), as well as home health care products, pet care products, and other retail drug store items. The company manufactures products such as dosing vials and medication dispensers and also sells private label and third-party items. Apothecary Products sells its pharmacy supplies in the US and abroad, both directly to retailers and through wholesaler distributors. The company was owned by founder Terry Noble until March 2014, when it was acquired by Norwest Equity Partners.

   Apothecary Products innovates, designs, markets, and distributes consumer healthcare products and pharmacy supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boasting more than 3,000 SKUs, Apothecary Products works to offer customers a one-stop-shop. Its markets include pharmacy supply, medication management, and home healthcare.

  <p>
   Key products include the Reconstitube medication mixing system, which allows pharmacists to mix antibiotics and other liquid medications by measuring out distilled water in a sterile system. Additional pharmacy items include gloves, labels, packaging, documentation, glassware, scales, thermometers, and compounding supplies. Other retail offerings include pill boxes and organizers, eye care supplies, first aid products, mobility aids, diabetic supplies, and travel accessories; some of which are sold under Apothecary Products' own brands, which include Ezy Dose, Flents, and Seaties.

  <p>
   The company expands its product lines through in-house development, as well as by forming distribution partnerships with other manufacturers. In 2012, for instance, Apothecary Products formed an alliance with Verde Environmental Technologies to produce Medsaway, a medication disposal system that lets customers dispose of old or unwanted drugs -- including narcotics, liquid medication, transdermal patches, and controlled substances. In 2010 it added lines of pre-moistened wipes and nasal rinse systems under its own Flents brand.

  <p>
   Terry Noble founded the company in 1975. Noble was a pharmacist who wanted to create more efficient methods of preparing liquid antibiotics; he started the business after inventing the Reconstitube.
