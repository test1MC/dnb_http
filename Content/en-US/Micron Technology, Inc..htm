   Micron Technology is one of the largest memory chip makers in the world. It makes DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), NAND Flash, and NOR Flash memory and other memory technologies. The company sells to customers in networking and storage, consumer electronics, solid-state drives, and mobile telecommunications, but its largest concentration (nearly a third of sales) is the computer market. Micron's products are offered under the Micron, Lexar, Crucial, SpecTek, and Elpida brands, as well as private labels. The company generates about 85% of sales outside the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Micron operates through four primary segments centered on its markets. Its largest, accounting for 41% of sales, is the Compute and Networking Business Unit, which sells products for the computing, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets. The Storage Business Unit contributes 26% of revenue with the Mobile Business Unit, memory for smartphone, tablet, and other mobile-device markets, generating 21% of sales. About 16% of revenue comes from the Embedded Business Unit, which makes memory products for the automotive, industrial, and consumer markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 58% of revenue comes from DRAM products and NAND Flash memory products supplying the rest. DRAM and flash are sold throughout each of Micron's segments.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Micron generates about 75% of its revenue in the Asia/Pacific region, including China (43%), Taiwan (15%), and Japan, (7%). The US and Europe contribute about 15% and 8%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has fabrication and assembly facilities in China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are marketed primarily to OEMs and retailers via a direct sales force, third-party sales representatives, and distributors. The company sells Lexar-branded NAND Flash memory products primarily through retail channels and its Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intel is Micron's biggest customer, generating 14% of sales with sales to
   <company id="41131">
    Kingston
   </company>
   , primarily DRAM, amounting to 7% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Micron's revenue slid 23% lower in 2016 (ended September) to $12.4 billion from $16.2 billion in 2015. Sales in all but one product, category, and region fell in 2016 from 2015. The only exception was an 8% increase in non-trade non-volatile memory. Those chips were bought by Intel in a venture between Micron and Intel to make the 3D XPoint memory product. Otherwise sales suffered from a glut of memory on the market and weakness in PC sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported a $276 million loss in 2016, a turnaround from a $2.9 billion profit in 2015. Micron had higher research and development expenses, higher payroll costs, and an increase in depreciation expense from R&amp;D capital expenditures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell to $3.2 billion in 2016 from $5.2 billion in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As revenue eroded in 2016, Micron initiated a restructuring in the 2016 (ended September) fourth quarter. The company reacted to the business environment and the need to accelerate focus on its key priorities. It expected to save $80 million per quarter in 2017 from a more focused set of projects and programs, workforce reductions, and closing out a number of job openings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Micron released its first 3D NAND memory technology optimized for mobile devices. Micron's mobile 3D NAND-based 32GB solution is aimed at high-end and mid-levels smartphones. The mobile 3D NAND allows high definition video streaming, higher bandwidth gameplay, faster boot up times, better camera performance, and quicker file loading.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company considers its vast manufacturing operation a valuable resource. It has fabrication plants in the US, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan. It builds much of its own capacity such as adding 255,000 square feet in Singapore where work is to commence in 2017. It also has gained manufacturing through acquisitions. While it can be expensive to keep factories humming, they allow Micron a large degree of flexibility. The company can ramp up production relatively quickly and shift production from one plant to another in order to retool production lines for advanced manufacturing methods.

   that it did not own. Micron is to pay $4 billion to
   <company id="132600">

   for the DRAM maker based in Taiwan in a deal to close at the end of the 2016 calendar year. The deal brings Inotera's DRAM production entirely in-house at Micron, which already buys 100% of Inotera's output. Most of Inotera's manufacturing operations run at Micron's 20 nanometer process with the rest to convert in 2016.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Micron Technology was founded in 1978 by twins Joe and Ward Parkinson and colleague Doug Pitman in the basement of a dentist's office. They started it as a semiconductor design firm but dreamed of manufacturing their own chips. In 1980 they persuaded several local businessmen, including J. R. Simplot and Allen Noble, to provide financial backing. They built their own production facility and in 1982 sold their first DRAM products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Micron went public in 1984. The following year Japanese chip makers began dumping chips on the US market to capture market share, causing huge losses for US DRAM makers. Micron filed an antidumping petition with the International Trade Commission, and in 1986 the US and Japan agreed to a semiconductor trade pact to curb dumping.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1988 a shortage of memory chips had developed, and Micron cashed in. The company began to diversify into SRAM (static random-access memory) chips and other add-in memory products for PCs. (The company wound down its SRAM product line in 2003 in the face of a dire industry slump.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Micron expanded into PC manufacturing, in part to soften the impact of the volatile cycles of the memory chip industry. It bought PC manufacturer ZEOS in 1995, merging it with two other Micron units to form Micron Electronics (later Interland and then
   <company id="43590">
    Web.com
   </company>
   , prior to its 2007 acquisition by
   <company id="102839">
    Website Pros
   </company>
   ), which it took public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1995 Micron CEO and co-founder Joe Parkinson left the company after a clash with Simplot. Steve Appleton, who had started as a production operator in 1983, became the new CEO. In early 1996 an internal power struggle triggered by longtime director Noble resulted in Appleton's ouster. But within a few days, as several executives loyal to Appleton threatened to revolt, Simplot wooed the CEO back. Noble resigned.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Micron bought the memory chip business of
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   (TI), including plants in Texas, Italy, and Singapore. The complex deal made TI Micron's largest shareholder -- it owned 15% of the company at the time -- until TI sold off its remaining shares in Micron late in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Micron sold its display division to flat-panel display maker PixTech; it received a 30% stake in PixTech (which folded in 2002). Later in 1999 Micron announced deals making it the primary supplier of memory chips for PC makers
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   and
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   . Also that year it acquired Rendition, a designer of graphics chips, as a part of its strategy to enter the logic chip business. The initial flagship project based on Rendition's technology was phased out in 2000, though Micron went ahead with development of other embedded chipsets -- designed for use with
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   's Athlon microprocessor -- using Rendition designs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company acquired full ownership of Japan-based DRAM maker KMT Semiconductor when it bought out joint venture partner
   <company id="52322">
    Kobe Steel
   </company>
   for about $350 million. (KMT was subsequently renamed Micron Japan, Ltd.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2001 subsidiary Micron Electronics underwent a major overhaul when it sold its MicronPC business (now
   <company id="103886">
    MPC Computers
   </company>
   ) to Gores Technology Group (now
   <company id="102459">
    The Gores Group
   </company>
   ), and its SpecTek DRAM reselling business to parent Micron Technology. Micron Electronics then acquired Web hosting company Interland and took its name. The deal reduced Micron Technology's stake in the company from 61% to about 40% -- a stake that Micron later gave to the not-for-profit Micron Technology Foundation. (Micron also gave up its two seats on Interland's board.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year the company acquired Photobit, a small developer of CMOS image sensors, an image-capturing chip that would become widely used in camera phones and digital still cameras, among other uses. The acquisition launched Micron into a new semiconductor business line that would help the company withstand the volatile cycles of the memory chip business.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2001 Micron struck a surprise deal with
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   to acquire the Japanese giant's Dominion Semiconductor unit in Virginia. (The deal was closed in 2002; Micron paid about $300 million in cash and stock for Dominion.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2001 and early 2002, Micron and rival
   <company id="57841">
    Hynix Semiconductor
   </company>
   engaged in round after round of negotiations about Micron's possible acquisition of some or all of Hynix's chip lines. In April 2002 the companies finally announced a complex provisional agreement for Micron to acquire Hynix's memory operations and invest in its other lines; a week later, though, Hynix's board of directors canceled the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company used a strong balance sheet to grow capacity during the steep industry swoon of the early 21st century, but also stumbled a bit with slow product introductions. Micron surprised the industry in 2002 by announcing an agreement to buy the DRAM operations of Toshiba. The Toshiba purchase, which cost Micron about $300 million in cash and stock, saddled Micron with too much production capacity in the midst of an especially soft DRAM market. Micron rose on improved industry conditions after the chip industry slump ended in 2003, and returned to black ink by 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   made a $450 million investment in Micron, giving the chip giant rights to a 5% ownership stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 Micron merged its mobile memory and systems memory business units into one memory products group, responsible for NAND flash memory, DRAM, and specialty memory devices. The company also paid nearly $5 million to acquire a wafer fabrication facility in Nampa, Idaho, from
   <company id="13211">
    ZiLOG
   </company>
   . Micron planned to use the fab to make image sensor chips for camera phones, digital still cameras, and machine vision equipment, among other applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006 Micron acquired flash memory maker
   <company id="100020">
    Lexar Media
   </company>
   for about $850 million. The Lexar acquisition bolstered Micron's position in NAND flash memory, the type of memory found in many MP3 players (such as the iPod nano and the iPod shuffle), digital still cameras, and other portable electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year
   <company id="14426">
    Photronics
   </company>
   formed a joint venture with Micron Technology called MP Mask Technology Center. The memory chip manufacturer took ownership of slightly more than half of MP Mask. The JV would operate Micron's mask shop in Boise, Idaho. The two companies built a facility called US NanoFab in Boise to conduct R&amp;D on advanced technology in photomasks, with Photronics contributing between $100 million and $150 million toward construction and equipping of the facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2006 Micron bolstered its product portfolio in CMOS image sensors, chips that are used in camera phones, digital still cameras, and other applications, by acquiring the imaging sensor business of
   <company id="144560">
    Broadcom Limited
   </company>
   . The company paid around $53 million and hired about 90 employees from Broadcom as part of the transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Micron moved into the market for solid-state drives based on NAND flash memory with the rollout of its RealSSD product line in late 2007. The line was aimed at data storage applications in notebook computers, enterprise computer servers, and data networks. Its embedded USB drives can store from 1GB to 8GB, while its 1.8-inch and 2.5-inch SSDs can hold from 8GB to 64GB. The introduction of RealSSD moved Micron into competition with manufacturers of hard-disk drives, such as
   <company id="107188">
    Hitachi Global Storage
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14678">
    Seagate Technology
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12460">
    Western Digital
   </company>
   . While HDDs were generally cheaper than SSDs, the continually falling price of NAND flash made SSDs more price-competitive.
  </p>
  <p>
   After months of speculation that the company would spin off its CMOS image sensor business, Micron in 2008 launched a separate identity for the business as a division called Aptina Imaging. Image sensors were used in camera phones, digital still cameras, and high-definition video cameras, among other applications. Micron was the leading supplier of CMOS image sensors in the world; the product line accounted for 11% of its sales (the rest was memory chips).
  </p>
  <p>
   The volatile semiconductor market hit a cyclical downturn in 2008, and a global economic downturn followed in 2009, making the year particularly painful for chip makers. Responding to rapidly falling prices for DRAMs and NAND flash memory devices, due to oversupply in the global market and declining customer demand, Micron reduced its workforce by about 20% and phased out production of 200mm wafers at its Boise plant. The company also cut executive salaries by 20% and suspended its performance-based bonus plan for officers. Micron CEO Steve Appleton, who is known to fly stunt jets for fun, has steered Micron through the wild cycles of the memory chip market with an intense focus on cost control. Appleton took an additional 10% reduction in his base salary for 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthering its non-memory ambitions, in 2009 Micron entered the microdisplay market through its acquisition of
   <company id="59742">
    Displaytech
   </company>
   , a designer of display panels and modules based on ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon technology, which is manufactured with a CMOS process on a single chip. The microdisplays marketed by Micron can be used in head-mounted display products or embedded in mobile phones to work as small projectors. The company has touted the integrated approach taken with the product, which doesn't require any companion devices, as digital micromirror devices do.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also ventured into the solar market, since photovoltaic production processes are similar to semiconductor production. In late 2009, Micron and Australia-based
   <company id="138063">
    Origin Energy
   </company>
   established a joint venture that develops and manufactures photovoltaic solar panels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 Micron sold a 65% interest in its
   <company id="161605">
    Aptina Imaging
   </company>
   (imaging sensors) business to Riverwood Capital and
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   for about $35 million; Micron retained a 35% equity stake in Aptina. The transaction allows Aptina and Micron to focus on their respective core businesses while retaining their ties in manufacturing, marketing, and product development. A portion of the buyers' 65% stake was in convertible preferred shares with a liquidation preference over common shares, which resulted in Micron's ownership in Aptina's common stock to climb to 64% in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Longtime CEO Steve Appleton died unexpectedly in February 2012. He was replaced by president and COO Mark Durcan, who was also named a director. Robert Switz, a director since 2006, was named chairman. Sales VP Mark Adams was appointed president of the company.
