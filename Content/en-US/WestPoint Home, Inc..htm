   The company is a top textiles manufacturer in the US and globally. It boasts both company-owned facilities and plants through joint venture agreements to achieve optimum profit margins for its products. Its domestic manufacturing plant in Chipley, Florida, (in operation since 1983) is supplemented by operations abroad. The company's global factories include one it owns in Bahrain, as well as a joint venture with Indus in Lahore, Pakistan.

   WestPoint Home is working to improve its earning power through new licensing deals and sales channels. To this end, it has launched new lines of bedding, bath, and kitchen textiles bearing the Caribbean Joe and
   <company id="11183">

   's IZOD labels. Its partnership with textiles maker Southern Tide, inked in 2012, has the pair designing, creating, and marketing high-quality sheets, bath towels, comforters, blankets, and related home textiles under the Southern Tide and TopSail collections. Southern Tide specializes in nautical patterns, plaids, solids, and stripes.  WestPoint Home has also rolled out kitchen textiles to supermarkets, drugstores, and college bookstores, and it increased sales to customers in Australia.

   It's also keeping a close eye on margins as the economy returns to its glory days. WestPoint Home reduced the size of its US manufacturing base in recent years. The US plants had been underutilized because of decreased demand, and when compared with the firm's facilities in lower-cost countries (such as Bahrain and Pakistan), WestPoint Home opted to shutter some plants. (It closed blanket production facilities in Biddeford and Saco, Maine; Elkin, North Carolina; and Chipley, Florida, and slashed about 10% of its total workforce.)
