   Genus plc is a breed apart; it ranks as the largest animal-genetics company in the world. It conducts research and development in the fields of genetics and biotechnology for breeding a better animal in terms of increased quality, production efficiency, and output. Genus is active in the production and distribution of semen and stud stock for beef, dairy, and pig farmers and food producer customers. The company operates in three units: Its dairy and beef cattle unit, Bovine Genetics (ABS), distributes bull semen, bred for tropical or temperate climates; Porcine Genetics (PIC) sells pig breeding males, females, and semen; Genus Asia, covers beef and pork in the Asia market. The company ships some 17 million doses of semen a year.

  <p>
   Pigs and cattle run nearly neck-and-neck in leading sales at Genus. In 2015 (ended June) pigs surged ahead and accounted for 45% of the company sales. Meanwhile cattle generated 42% of sales. Its Asia operations brought in 10% of the company's revenue and money from its research and development business was 3%.

  <p>
   Although based in the UK (its headquarters is in Basingstoke), Genus draws 46% of its revenue from North America. The European and associated markets produces 29% of sales, followed by Latin America, 15%, and Asia, 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Genus operate in 30 countries and works through distributors to reach 50 more. The company operates a research laboratory near Madison, Wisconsin.

  <p>
   Genus recorded a 7% sales gain in 2015 (ended June) on strong performance from its Genetiporc unit, which operates in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Overall, pig-related sales rose 15% for the year while beef was up 7%. The company's business in Asia slid 11% in 2015, dragged down by market-related conditions in Russia. Non-Russian sales in the Asia operations rose 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit rose 40% in 2015 from 2014. It was the third straight year of rising profit.

  <p>
   Genus hopes to help producers of beef and pork keep up with the growing demand for protein. Its 2013 acquisition of Genetiporc allowed it to introduce new genetic traits into its porcine products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's ventures in China, a joint venture with Besun and its wholly-owned porcine nucleus farm have become operational and enabled Genus to introduce new products and the latest genetics into China. The moves doubled its capacity in China. The pork market, however, has become challenging and Genus is working through commercial multiplication agreements to reduce its exposure. The company's agreement with Riverstone, a US-led group investing in China, lets Genus become a commercial multiplier and a royalty-based customer there.
