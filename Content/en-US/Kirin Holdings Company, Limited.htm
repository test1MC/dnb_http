   You might say this company makes good-luck beer. Named for a unicorn, which is a Japanese symbol of good fortune, Kirin Holdings is a top beer maker in Japan through its Kirin Brewery Co. In addition to its domestic Kirin-branded beers, the company owns brewers that serve overseas markets, such as Australia's
   <company id="58540">
    Lion
   </company>
   and Philippines-based
   <company id="161671">
    San Miguel Brewery
   </company>
   . The beer brewer also makes soft drinks (coffee, tea drinks, and mineral water), the alcoholic fruit drink chu-hi, and owns Japanese wine producer
   <company id="56834">
    Mercian Corporation
   </company>
   . Beyond beverages, Kirin also has operations in health and dairy foods, and pharmaceutical-manufacturing sectors.

  <p>
   Outside Japan, Kirin has established local operations in Australia, China, Germany, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, the US, and Vietnam. In the US it owns soft-drink bottler Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England and bourbon maker Four Roses Distillery in Kentucky.

  <p>
   Kirin is looking to expand outside Japan because of the country's unfavorable demographics (i.e., a declining birth rate). Indeed, Japan's beer market has shrunk by about 15% in terms of shipment volumes over the past decade. One focus of expansion for Kirin is the Asia-Oceania region, where it aims to build on recent acquisitions. Kirin took 100% control of Lion Nathan, paying A$3.5 billion (about $3.2 billion) to acquire the 54% of Australia's #2 brewer that it did not already own. Australia presents Kirin with a stable customer base and was one of the few countries that avoided the recessionary conditions that rocked the global economy in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   China is another attractive market for Kirin. The company has a joint venture with
   <company id="55206">
    China Resources Beer
   </company>
   -- producer of China's top-selling Snow beer brand -- that makes and distributes nonalcoholic beverages, including bottled water and soft drinks, in China. Kirin plans to invest about $400 million in the joint venture and will transfer ownership of four local subsidiaries in Shanghai and Beijing to the partnership.

  <p>
   American William Copeland went to Yokohama, Japan, in 1864 and five years later established the Spring Valley Brewery, the first in Japan, to provide beer for foreign nationals. Lacking funds to continue the brewery, Copeland closed it in 1884. The next year a group of foreign and Japanese businessmen reopened it as Japan Brewery. The business created the Kirin label in 1888 and was soon profitable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operation was run primarily by Americans and Europeans at first, but by 1907 Japanese workers had filled the ranks and adopted the Kirin Brewery Company name. Sales plummeted during WWII when the government limited brewing output. After the war, the US occupation forces inadvertently assisted Kirin when they split Dai Nippon Brewery (Kirin's main competitor) into two companies (
   <company id="46986">
    Asahi
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55929">
    Sapporo
   </company>
   Breweries) while leaving Kirin intact. The company became Japan's leading brewer during the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s Kirin introduced several soft drinks and in 1972 branched into hard liquor through a joint venture with Seagram (Kirin-Seagram).
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm bought several Coca-Cola bottling operations in New England and Japan in the 1980s. Kirin also entered the pharmaceuticals business, in part through a joint venture with US-based Amgen. In 1988 the brewer signed an agreement with
   <company id="42382">
    Molson
   </company>
   to produce Kirin beer for the North American market. In 1989 Kirin bought Napa Valley's Raymond Vineyards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Kirin formed a partnership to market
   <company id="57224">
    Tropicana
   </company>
   drinks in Japan. It also entered an alliance with
   <company id="56038">
    Sankyo
   </company>
   (Japan's #2 drug company) in 1991 to market Kirin's medication for anemia, which it had developed with Amgen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman Hideyo Motoyama resigned in 1993 after four company executives were arrested for allegedly paying a group of racketeers who had threatened to disrupt Kirin's annual meeting. Joint venture Kirin-Amgen won the rights to make thrombopoietin (TPO), a blood platelet growth stimulator, in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yasuhiro Satoh became president of Kirin in 1996. The brewer moved into China that year through an agreement with China Resources (Shenyang) Snowflake Brewery. To brew its beers in the US, the company formed
   <company id="43878">
    Kirin Brewery of America
   </company>
   , also in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to losing market share to Asahi, Kirin cut its workforce in 1998 and introduced Tanrei, a cheaper, low-malt beer that quickly captured half its market. Building on its presence in China, Kirin bought 46% of brewer
   <company id="58540">
    Lion Nathan
   </company>
   (based in Australia and New Zealand) for $742.5 million that year. It became a licensed brewer of
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like other Japanese brewers, Kirin struggled against dwindling demand for its most expensive brews in 2000. Koichiro Aramaki was named president of the company the following year and began to expand and diversify Kirin's operations to overcome slow growth domestically. In 2002 the company bought 15% of Philippine food and drink giant
   <company id="41836">
    San Miguel
   </company>
   for about $530 million. It also boosted ties with beverage giant
   <company id="46900">
    Pernod Ricard
   </company>
   by purchasing 32% of SIFA, a French food services firm, for an estimated $155 million. In 2002 Kirin also formed Flower Season Ltd., a joint venture with
   <company id="10303">
    Dole Food Company
   </company>
   , to sell flowers to Japanese retailers. Also in 2002 Kirin launched its new Pure Blue brand of "shochu" distilled liquor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Aramaki stepped down as president (he remained chairman) and turned the reins over to former managing director Kazuyasu Kato. The following year Kirin reorganized as a holding company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to its international dairy holdings with its 2007 acquisition of Australian milk and cheese producer
   <company id="103466">
    National Foods
   </company>
   . The following year National Foods acquired Australian dairy company
   <company id="159786">
    Australian Co-operative Foods Limited
   </company>
   (dba Dairy Farmers) for about $763 million. With some 2,000 members, Dairy Farmers is one of the biggest dairy product makers in Australia. These acquisitions made Kirin a top player in the Oceania dairy sector, which is part of the company's larger strategy to focus and grow in the Asian and Oceania markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Kirin acquired a 100% interest in San Miguel Brewery of the Philippines. Following Kirin's successful tender offer to acquire the remainder of Lion Nathan's shares, later that year Lion Nathan and National Foods were consolidated under Kirin's Australian holding company, which was renamed Lion Nathan National Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2010 company veteran Senji Miyake was named president and CEO of the Japanese brewer (among other top management changes). Miyake joined Kirin Brewery Company in 1970. In December Kirin made Mercian Corp. a wholly owned subsidiary following a scandal at Mercian's fish feedstuffs division.
