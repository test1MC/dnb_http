   Japan Tobacco (JT) has plenty to puff about. The company secures about 55% of the Japanese cigarette market -- the fourth largest worldwide. It holds eight of the country's top 10 brands, including Mild Seven, Seven Stars, and Caster. Globally, JT is the #3 tobacco maker, trailing

   Japan Tobacco operates six cigarette manufacturing plants and four factories that make tobacco related products across Japan. Outside its home country, it operates 28 factories that make cigarettes and other tobacco and tobacco-related products. Foreign subsidiaries of the company include UK-based Gallaher Ltd. (acquired in 2007) and Liggett-Ducat in Russia. Beyond tobacco, which accounts for more than 90% of the company's sales, the company is engaged in the production of processed foods and beverages through its JT Beverage and TableMark Co. subsidiaries. Japan Beverage makes canned coffee drinks (under the Roots brand), and operates beverage vending machines. TableMark, which makes and sells frozen and other processed foods, is exiting the processed fishery products business. The company is also active in the research and development of new drugs through a pharmaceutical arm, Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.

  <p>
   Japan accounts for more than 50% of the company's sales. International markets include Africa, Brazil, Europe, Malaysia, North America, and Russia. Japan Tobacco's total tobacco sales volume at home and abroad comes to about 534 billion cigarettes per year, representing nearly 9% of the global market.

  <p>
   Japan Tobacco saw its adjusted net fiscal 2012 (ends March) sales decline at home by more than 3% vs. the prior year, while international sales increased less than 1% over the same period. In Japan, sales volume declined as a result of the contracting adult population, stricter anti-smoking laws, higher taxes, and the impact of the massive earthquake that struck eastern Japan in March 2011. Still, profits increased at home due to price increases. Indeed, the company shipped 534 billion cigarettes in fiscal 2012 compared with 563 billion in 2011. The company's pharmaceutical business posted a nearly 8% gain in 2012 sales, while the food and beverage sales declined for the third consecutive year.

  <p>
   In late 2015 the company said it would pay
   <company id="55935">
    Reynolds American
   </company>
   $5 billion for the non-US rights to its Natural American Spirit tobacco brand. The brand is popular with younger smokers and should help Japan Tobacco as it looks for growth outside its stagnant home market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with a contracting market at home, Japan Tobacco is looking to Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia for growth. To that end in late-2011 it paid $450 million to acquire the Haggar Cigarette &amp; Tobacco Factory of Sudan and South Sudan. Haggar produces the Bringi brand of cigarettes and boasts more than 80% market share in Sudan. Its sales volume in 2010 was reportedly more than 4.5 billion cigarettes. Indeed, the international business is the profit growth engine for the group. Through additional acquisitions on ongoing investment in foreign markets Japan Tobacco hopes to grow its market share in many key markets. Among other threats to its tobacco business, JT faces volatile prices for various crops, which cause leaf tobacco costs to stay high. The company has moved to increase its control over both the price and quality of its tobacco leaf supply through a series of acquisitions and alliances. In 2009 the company acquired UK-based Tribac Leaf and two Brazilian firms in a deal valued at about $230 million. Tribac Leaf has growing operations in Malawi, Zambia, China, and India, and the Brazilian units operate in their home country. Separately, JT formed a new tobacco sourcing company -- called JTI Leaf Services --with US leaf suppliers Hail &amp; Cotton and J.E.B. International.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1898, roughly 325 years after tobacco was introduced in Japan, the nation's Ministry of Finance formed a bureau to monopolize its production to fund military and industrial expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Japan's tobacco leaf imports from North and South America grew scarce and led to cigarette rationing. In 1949 the government began operating the tobacco production bureau as a business: the Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation (in 1905 the bureau also became responsible for a salt monopoly).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched Hope, the first Japanese-made filter cigarette, in 1957, and it became the world's best seller a decade later. In 1972 it began printing mild packaging "warnings": "Be careful not to smoke excessively for your health."
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan Tobacco and Salt began selling Marlboro cigarettes licensed from Philip Morris in 1973. The Mild Seven brand (its current best-seller) went on sale in 1977; it became the world's #1 cigarette in 1981 but dropped to #2 (behind Marlboro) in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   When its tobacco monopoly ended in 1985, the government established the firm as Japan Tobacco (a government-owned joint stock company). As competition from foreign imports increased, the firm came up with new means of making yen. It formed Japan Tobacco International (cigarette exports mainly to the US and Southeast Asia), moved into agribusiness and real estate operations, and, in 1986, created JT Pharmaceutical. In 1987 cigarette import tariffs ended, and importers lowered prices to match the company's; its sales and market share subsequently declined. During the late 1980s it introduced HALF TIME beverages and its first low-tar cigarettes (Mild Seven Lights is now the world's #1 light cigarette).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Japan Tobacco bought its first overseas production facility, Manchester Tobacco (closed in 2001). Former Ministry of Finance official Masaru Mizuno became CEO that year -- and soon took up smoking. Also in 1992 the company and Agouron Pharmaceuticals agreed to jointly develop immune system drugs; in 1994 they added antiviral drugs. The government sold about 20% of the firm's stock to the public in 1994 and 13% in 1996. The firm began operating Burger King restaurants in Japan in 1996. Japan Tobacco bought Pillsbury Japan in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan Tobacco in 1999 paid nearly $8 billion for R.J. Reynolds International, the international tobacco unit of what was then RJR Nabisco. The company then renamed the unit, which has operations in 70 countries worldwide, JT International. It also bought the food products division of Asahi Chemical, Torii Pharmaceutical from Asahi Breweries, and the Unimat vending machine company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Slowing sales prompted Japan Tobacco to announce in 2000 that it would reduce its workforce by 6,100 by 2005. Company exec Katsuhiko Honda became CEO that year (Mizuno remained as chairman) and said he'd push the government to sell its stake. Honda retired in 2006. In February 2001 the company announced plans to sell parts of its OTC drugs and health care businesses to Nichiiko Pharmaceutical to concentrate on prescription drugs. It also intends to sell all 25 of its Burger King outlets. In May Mizuno stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Takashi Ogawa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2001 Japan's Ministry of Finance recommended that it cut its holdings in the company from 66% to 50%; it would also allow the company to sell additional shares, which could further dilute the government's stake to as little as 33%. In 2002 Japan Tobacco completed the sale of its 25 Burger King outlets and its OTC drug business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2004 the company unveiled six new brands: Mild Seven One Menthol Box, Bitter Valley, Fuji Renaissance, Fuji Renaissance 100's, Hi-Lite Menthol, and BB Slugger. An added brand, Hope Menthol, currently being tested in the marketplace, also will see expanded availability. Japan Tobacco's Canadian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2004 following a billion-dollar smuggling claim by the Canadian government. Canada said that the company owed $1.4 billion in Canadian back taxes for allegedly smuggling cigarettes in 1998 and 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan Tobacco in 2005 ended its agreement with
   <company id="55957">
    Philip Morris
   </company>
   to make and sell Marlboro cigarettes. The company closed 13 of its 25 manufacturing plants and six of its 30 sales branches by early 2006 as part of an effort to increase profits. These reductions slashed as many as 4,000 jobs from company payrolls as demand for cigarettes, partly depressed by higher taxes, continues to decline. Japan Tobacco is also using its own line of premium smokes to fill the gap left in the product line by the absence of Marlboro cigarettes. The company's deal with Philip Morris to sell Marlboro lapsed in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2007 JT acquired Britain's Gallaher Group for about $15 billion. The purchase, which added Silk Cut and Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette brands to its products portfolio, was the largest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2008 the company acquired a majority stake in Katokichi Co. for about $900 million. It then sold a 49% stake in the business to
   <company id="119911">
    Nissin Foods
   </company>
   , forming a joint venture. In April JT entered the seasonings business, acquiring a controlling stake in Fuji Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2008 Japan Tobacco placed Hans Group, its Australia-based chilled foods venture, and its subsidiaries into administration under the care of KordaMetha.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Japan Tobacco acquired the UK's Tribac Leaf and Brazil-based leaf suppliers Kannenberg &amp; Cia and Kannenberg, Barker, Hail &amp; Cotton Tabacos.
