   Chinese dairy products manufacturer Synutra International knows how to pack a nutritional punch -- and put it into a can. The company develops, manufactures, and sells enriched milk- and rice-powder products for infants and children under the Super, U-Smart, My Angel, and Dutch Cow brands. The company also makes powdered nutritional products, including chondroitin and glucosamine for joint health, for adults; however, most of the company's business comes from the sale of its infants' and children's powders. Synutra products are sold in some 24,000 retail outlets throughout mainland China. Chairman and CEO Liang Zhang owns the majority of the Synutra's shares.

   Synutra International is a holding company based in Delaware, that operates through subsidiaries in China. The company rings up about 95% of its sales in China. The US  accounts for the remainder. Synutra has processing and packaging facilities located throughout China, including Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Fengzhen, and Zhenglanqi.

   The Chinese firm reported sales of $370.5 million in fiscal 2014 (ended March), an increase of 39% versus the prior year. It swung from a $64 million loss in the prior fiscal year to a profit of $30.9 million in 2014. (The company's sales and profits have been on a roller coaster ride of sorts in recent years.) The double-digit increase in sales was driven by an increase in the powdered formula and nutritional ingredients segments, which posted year-over-year gains.

   Increasing sales of its powdered formula suggest that Synutra may have finally put safety concerns about its infant formulas behind it. The company's core formula business (85% of annual sales) was rocked first by the malamine-tainted baby formula scandal in 2008, and in 2010 it was accused of triggering sexual precocity among baby girls. (The Chinese Health Ministry found the allegations to be baseless.) While the melamine contamination scandal resulted in lawsuits, in late 2010 the company received an on-air apology from

   </company>
   for falsely reporting that Synutra's products contained growth hormones. Despite the broadcaster's public apology, consumers have remained wary, and many retailers have had a stockpile of inventory to turn over and have slashed their orders.

   In 2012 Synutra announced plans to invest about $130 million in a new milk-drying plant in France that will be operated by French dairy cooperative

   . The plant, which is slated to open in 2015, will produce about 100,000 tons of whey and milk powder a year exclusively for Synutra.

   Expanding its prepared foods business, in 2013 the company introduced prepared adult foods for patients with special nutritional needs after surgery.
