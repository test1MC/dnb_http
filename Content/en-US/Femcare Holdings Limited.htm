   In 2014, sales of Filshie Clips, applicators, and accessories represented nearly 40% of Utah Medical Products' total sales. The Gynecology/Electrosurgery/Urology segment, of which Femcare is a part, provided nearly 60% of the parent company's revenue. However, subsidiary Femcare-Nikomed's revenue fell 14% to $493,000 that year.
