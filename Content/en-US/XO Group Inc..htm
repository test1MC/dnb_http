   XO Group offers online and offline media and e-commerce services for the wedding, newlywed, and new parent markets. In 2012, it had more than 22,000 local vendors displaying more than 29,000 profiles, compared to nearly 21,000 vendors displaying more than 28,000 profiles in 2011.

   The company's revenues grew by 4% in 2012 due to higher revenues from online sponsorship and advertising and Publishing and other, offset by a decline in revenues from Registry services and Merchandise. Online sponsorship and advertising revenues were up by 9% thanks to an increase in local advertising program sales. Local online sponsorship and advertising revenues jumped by 15%, as the result of an increase in the number of local vendors advertising with it on its websites, as well as higher vendor spending.

   Revenues from national online sponsorship and advertising was generally flat year over year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Publishing and other revenues grew by 12%, primarily driven by an increase in advertising pages and higher revenues per advertising page sold in The Knot national and regional magazines. Another factor was higher sales and the addition of a second publication of The Bump magazine in two of cities

   Registry services revenues decreased by 3% was as the result of a decrease in sales (due to a significant shift of its traffic from desktop to mobile devices) and higher returns from Macy's Inc., partially offset by increased registry commissions from its new and historic registry retail partners.
  </p>
        <p>
   Merchandise revenues dropped by 16% due to lower revenues from the WeddingChannel Store as the result of a steady decline in traffic to that site. (In mid 2012, all WeddingChannel Store traffic was redirected to The Knot Shop). Reduced site traffic also contributed to lower revenues generated from an e-commerce site.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income increased by 44% in 2012 due to higher revenues and a decline in online sponsorship and advertising costs, merchandise costs, and lower depreciation and amortization.

   The company seeks to expand its services and markets through organic growth and acquisitions to complement its lifestage businesses, increase its leverage with advertisers and improve customer satisfaction. XO Group is focused on identifying opportunities in large international markets (especially China) where it can use its brand recognition and editorial authority on couples lifestyle, newlywed, and first-time pregnancy to drive further growth.

   In 2011 the company changed its name to XO Group; it also transferred its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from the Nasdaq Stock Market under a new ticker symbol, XOXO. It made the change in order to adopt a brand that better reflects the broad scope and range of its offerings. The company's roots are in wedding content, but over time it has been steadily beefing up its content for other, complementary audiences. While "the knot" implied wedding-related products and services, it did not accurately describe the company's various newlywed and baby lifestyle offerings.

   The company has expanded its registry business, which operates through relationships with major retail partners. In 2010 XO Group extended its agreement with
   <company id="14933">
    Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
   </company>
   and formed a new agreement with
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   . (Macy's accounted for about 6% of the company's revenues.) Also that year it launched its Gift Registry 360 universal gift registry platform at GiftRegistry360.com, and added
   <company id="10810">
    JCPenney
   </company>
   to that platform.
  </p>
        <p>
   On the international front, XO Group expanded to China in 2010 through its launch of Ai Jie (ijie.com), which means "love knot" in Mandarin. The website provides resources for Western-style weddings in China. The company is jumping on the opportunity as a means to grow exponentially, as the Chinese market for Western weddings is even larger than the entire US market (the country hosts approximately 10 million Western weddings each year, while the US is home to some 2.2 million weddings per year).
