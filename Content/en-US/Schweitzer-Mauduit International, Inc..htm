   Business is smokin' at Schweitzer-Mauduit International (SWM), one of the world's leading suppliers of fine papers to the tobacco industry. About 90% of its sales come from tobacco-related products, including cigarette wraps, plug wraps (used to wrap filters), and tipping paper (used to join the filter to the rest of the cigarette), low ignition propensity (fire-safe) cigarettes, as well as reconstituted tobacco leaf (RTL) -- virgin tobacco blended by cigarette manufacturers. Non-tobacco lines comprise a mix of products, from drinking-straw wrappers to lightweight printing paper and business forms. SWM markets its lineup in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, garnering about 60% of its sales outside the US.

  <p>
   SWM operates through almost 20 production facilities in more than 90 countries. The US, the UK, Canada, Russia, Luxembourg, Brazil, France, and Poland are home to the company's mills.

  <p>
   The company operates through two chief segments: Engineered Papers (EP; 76% of net sales) and Advanced Materials and Structures (AMS; 24%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SWM's revenues fell 4% from $794 million in 2014 to $764 million in 2015. Profits remained flat, hovering around the $90 million mark, for  both 2014 and 2015. In addition, its operating cash flow dipped by 13% from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fall in revenues for 2015 was fueled by a 12% drop in EP sales and declines across the key regions of Latin America (37%), Europe (14%), and other international countries (15%). EP segment sales decreased due to lower average selling prices from pricing concessions and unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts, mainly from a weaker euro and Brazilian real.
  </p>
  <p>
   The flat net income for 2015 was attributed to a spike in un-allocated expenses related to incremental costs from its Luxembourg office, higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, and general increases in compensation accruals and other expenses.

  <p>
   SWM is looking to add new revenue streams and widen its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In late 2015, it purchased Argotec LLC, a producer of highly engineered urethane films for demanding specialty applications in surface protection, glass lamination and medical products, for $280 million in cash. The deal enhanced SWM's non-tobacco business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, SWM acquired certain assets from Pronamic Industries, an air filtration media company, in an acquisition that enhanced its presence in the air filtration sector and expanded its customer base and growth.
