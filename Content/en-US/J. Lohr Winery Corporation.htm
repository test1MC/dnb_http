   J. Lohr Winery pours it on. It produces red, white, sparkling, and non-alcoholic wines. The family-owned winery's vintages are divided into tiers with the more expensive wines falling under the labels J. Lohr Cuvée Series, J. Lohr Vineyards Series, and J. Lohr Estates. The company's less expensive wines bear the Cypress Vineyards and Painter Bridge labels. The company also makes a line of non-alcoholic wines called ARIEL. J. Lohr Winery grows mainly red varietals of grapes on almost 3,700 acres that it owns and farms in three distinct wine growing regions in California. It sells its wines nationwide and in more than 25 other countries.
