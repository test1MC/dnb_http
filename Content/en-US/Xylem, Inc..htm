  <p>
   Xylem's revenues fell 7% from $3.92 billion in 2014 to $3.65 billion in 2015. Its profits remained static for 2014 and 2015, hovering around the $340 million mark for both years. In addition, its operating cash flow surged by 7% due to changes in inventory and improved collections of receivables.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline was fueled by a 9% drop in Water Infrastructure sales and a 4% decline in Applied Water sales. The industrial market in 2015 experienced a decline due to decreases in dewatering applications in the oil and gas market, which more than offset increases in the balance of the industrial market. Irrigation applications organic revenue also declined due to severe flooding conditions in the southeast and southwest regions of the US and the lacking of a strong fourth quarter in 2014.
