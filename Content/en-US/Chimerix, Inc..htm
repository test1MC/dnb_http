   All that shimmers isn't . . . enhanced by lipid conjugate technology. Chimerix has developed technology to make molecules with therapeutic potential into oral drugs. Its lipid conjugate technology can modify drug compounds to mimic a particular lipid metabolite that is absorbed by the small intestine, thus protecting the compounds from being broken down in the stomach. Chimerix is using its technology to develop lead drug candidate CMX001 (brincidofovir) to fight smallpox infections or bad reactions to smallpox vaccinations. The development-stage firm is also targeting drug-resistant HIV and hepatitis B with its clinical stage CMX157 nucleotide analog. The company went public in 2013.

  <p>
   The company plans to commercialize brincidofovir (if and when it is approved) in the US and possibly Canada and Europe. It will do so with the help of a contract sales force, through partnerships, and/or through an internal sales team.

   Chimerix has had fluctuating revenue for the past five years. In 2015, it more than doubled to $10.7 million thanks to increased contract revenue and collaboration and license revenue. However, the company is still operating in the red. In 2015 its net loss increased by $58 million to $117.3 million as R&amp;D and general expenses grew. Clinical trial activity has been ramping up, and Chimerix has also been paying more in compensation and drug manufacturing expenses.

  <p>
   Cash flow from operations more than doubled to $99.8 million due to changes in accounts receivable and other assets.

   Chimerix's strategy centers around the development, promotion, and commercialization of its prime drug candidate, brincidofovir. After passing through Phase 3 clinical development, the company envisions making it a commercial product in the US and Canada while seeking regulatory approval for its use in Europe as well. The company's primary focus is to use the antiviral to treat DNA viral infections in transplant recipients or patients with compromised immune systems. Working with the
