   While there's not quite two of everything in this ark, there sure is a lot of stuff gathered in the event of a flood. Arkema manages a dozen or so commodity and specialty chemicals units that operate worldwide. Those businesses reside within Arkema's industrial chemicals (acrylics, fluorochemicals, thiochemicals, and hydrogen peroxide), performance chemicals (specialty chemicals, technical polymers, and organic peroxides), and vinyl products (chlorochemicals and PVC resins and products) segments. Arkema operates some 90 manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America, and Asia.

  <p>
   Arkema operates 90 industrial facilities in 40 countries spanning Europe, North America, and Asia. Europe is its largest market, representing 40% of total sales. North America generates 34%, while Asia contributes 21%. Other countries account for the remainder.

  <p>
   Arkema is among the world leaders in many of its product lines, including chlorochemicals, PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), and thiochemicals (all of which businesses rank in the Top 3). It similarly ranks among the world leaders in hydrogen peroxide, acrylics, and engineering polymers. The company's intention is to focus on those products for which it can take leading global positions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its operations are divided across three primary business segments: Coating Solutions (34% of sales), High Performance Materials (33%), and Industrial Specialties (33%).

  <p>
   As part of a strategy to widen its footprint in Asia, Arkema has built a research center in China, at its Changshu site near Shanghai. By 2015 it expects to get a quarter of its global sales from the region (where it now receives around 15% to 20% of sales). Arkema has also constructed a latex plant in Changshu to make emulsion polymers for coatings and adhesives markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Arkema and Jurong Chemical, a China-based developer of acrylic acid, announced the creation of Sunke, a joint venture  consisting of Jurong's acrylic acid production site. The joint venture will enable Arkema to accelerate the development of its Coating Solutions segment in China and in Asia. It will will serve the fast-growing markets of superabsorbents, paints, adhesives, and water treatment.
