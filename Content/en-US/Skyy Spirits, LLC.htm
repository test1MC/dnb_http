   Don't fault Skyy Spirits (dba Campari America) if it's up bright and early to raise the American flag. The company touts its SKYY Vodka as the #1 domestically made US premium vodka. Founded in 1992 by an inventor tired of hangovers, Skyy claims that its distilling process eliminates toxins, which results in a cleaner vodka that makes the morning after less, er, shall we say, painful. Its other key brand, Wild Turkey Distillery, makes bourbon. The company, which is the exclusive US importer for Campari, Cutty Sark Scotch Whiskey, and other liqueurs and spirits, adopted the Campari America moniker in 2012. A subsidiary of

  <p>
   Campari America accounted for about 20% of Gruppo Campari's €1.5 billion ($2 billion) in 2013 sales. US sales increased 6% in 2013 versus 2012, to €312.6 ($417.7 million), mainly due to the performance of the Wild Turkey franchise (up 16%), while Skyy's sales were essentially flat. Good performance of Skyy's infused vodkas, offset the weaker performance of the core SKYY Vodka product.

   In 2012 Skyy Spirits changed its trade name to Campari America to identify more closely with its Milan-based parent company,
   <company id="61577">
    Davide Campari-Milano
   </company>
   , and its affiliates, collectively known as Gruppo Campari, and to reflect the full scale of the company's growing portfolio of vodkas, tequilas, whiskies, rums, and liqueurs. The company has grown through brand extensions and the purchase of marketing and distribution rights to other brands.
