   Black is always the color of choice for Cabot Corp. The specialty chemicals and performance materials company ranks among the world's top producers of carbon black, a reinforcing and pigmenting agent used in tires, inks, cables, and coatings. Cabot also holds its own as a maker of fumed metal oxides such as fumed silica and fumed alumina, used as anti-caking, thickening, and reinforcing agents in adhesives and coatings. Other products include inkjet colorants, aerogels (a synthetic material derived from a gel), and a specialty fluid (cesium formate) for oil and gas drilling. It also makes thermoplastic concentrates and compounds (masterbatch products) used by the plastics industry.
  </p>

  <p>
   Cabot is among a small group of carbon black producers with a global presence. (
   <company id="138358">
    Aditya Nuvo Birla
   </company>
   and
   <company id="91102">
    Evonik Degussa
   </company>
   also operate worldwide.) As a whole, the carbon black business accounts for more than half of the company's revenues. Much of its carbon black business is done with the top three automobile tire makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has realigned its global business segments to improve efficiency and resource prioritization, as well as to enable stronger customer focus. Its four business segments are: Reinforcement Materials; Purification Solutions; Performance Chemicals; and Specialty Fluids.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reinforcement Materials represents its Rubber Blacks Business (accounting for 46% of sales). Rubber blacks are used in tires as a reinforcing agent and a performance additive. They are also used to improve the performance of products such as rubber hoses, belts, and molded goods, primarily for the automotive industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Materials (36% of sales) is an aggregation of the Specialty Carbon and Compounds and Fumed Metal Oxides Businesses. Its specialty grades of carbon black provide performance characteristics such as color, conductivity, UV protection, and enhanced mechanical properties. The segment's products are used in inks, coatings, pipes, toners, and electronics. Fumed silica is a collection of very fine nonporous particles that increase the performance of products like adhesives, composites, coatings, and silicones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Purification Solutions (12%) produces activated carbon, which is used to remove contaminants from liquids and gases using a process called adsorption, whereby the interconnected pores of activated carbon trap contaminants. Activated carbon products are typically used for the purification of water, air, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and other liquids and gases, as either a colorant or a decolorizing agent in the production of products for food and beverage applications and as a chemical carrier in slow release applications. In gas and air applications, one of the uses of activated carbon is for the removal of mercury in flue gas streams.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Specialty Fluids segment (2%) produces and sells cesium formate, a drilling and completion fluid used as a drilling and completion fluid for high-pressure and high-temperature oil and gas well construction.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cabot has manufacturing (44 factories) and other operations across the US and in 21 other countries. It owns or has a controlling interest in rubber blacks plants in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the US. It also has affiliates that operate carbon black plants in Mexico and Venezuela. The company has focused on increasing its Chinese business. The US accounts for 25% of the company's sales and customers in China account for 20% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products through employees, distributors, and sales representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers include coal-fired utilities, food and beverage processors, water treatment plants, pharmaceutical companies and catalyst producers, and oil and gas companies.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cabot reported a 16% decrease in net sales (to $2.4 billion) from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 (September year end) due primarily to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $398 million) and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($63 million). The less favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to lower selling prices in fiscal 2016 from price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw materials costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gross profit decreased by $7 million in fiscal 2016 to $578 million driven by lower unit margins in Reinforcement Materials and Purification Solutions partially offset by fixed cost savings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash provided by operating activities decreased from $499 million to $392 million, driven by net income of $164 million and $161 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. There was also a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories due to lower raw material costs and associated price reductions. These sources of cash were partially offset by a decline in accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy for long-term growth includes a focus on pricing and continued investments in new products and technologies. It also seeks key acquisitions that complement its core operations. To deliver growth, Cabot concentrates on improving margins, expanding capacity, and expanding its presence in emerging markets, as well as developing new products. It will reduce its inventory levels as needed to give it a better position economically. It also performs such housekeeping tasks as providing higher than normal maintenance when plants are idled to reduce production.
  </p>
  <p>
   While some industrial companies might push back against regulations, Cabot seems to have few qualms about it. It makes products that help manufacturers comply with more stringent environmental regulations. It introduced new carbon black products that are low in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are used in rubber and plastics products such as sporting equipment, clothing, footwear, toys and childcare items. The new products will help manufacturers of those products comply with new regulations while maintaining performance. Such products should help Cabot as more governments increase environmental regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company signed a joint venture agreement with Inner Mongolia Hengyecheng Silicone Co., Ltd (HYC), to form a joint venture to make fumed silica in China (a key growth market for Cabot). Cabot will hold 80% of the joint venture; HYC,20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Cabot embarked on a restructuring program that cut costs by about $50 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company developed three new products for use as additives in electrophotographic toner applications. Cabot's new REGAL® T-30R and REGAL® T-40R carbon black pigments are specifically designed to deliver improved tribocharge and excellent image density performance for polyester toners. Cabot's new CAB-O-SIL® TG-3155F fumed silica additive enables improved toner durability, and provides superior humidity resistance, tribocharge and free flow.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2014 the company sold its non-core Security Materials business to SICPA for $20 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A descendant of two old-line Boston merchant families, Godfrey Lowell Cabot graduated from Harvard in 1882. His brother had a paint business in Pennsylvania that used coal tars to make black pigment, and the two decided that carbon black -- an abundant waste product of the oil fields -- would be their business. The brothers built a carbon black plant in Pennsylvania in 1882; five years later Godfrey bought his brother's share in the company. A carbon black glut and the increasing use of natural gas led Godfrey to drill his first gas well in 1888. He took advantage of the glut by buying distressed carbon black factories.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the Pennsylvania oil fields dried up near the turn of the century, Godfrey moved operations to West Virginia, where he added to his gas holdings and, in 1914, built a natural gas extraction plant. Meanwhile, products such as high-speed printing presses increased the demand for carbon black. The reinforcing and stabilizing properties of the compound became widely known after its use in tires during WWI. The company was incorporated in 1922 as Godfrey L. Cabot, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The production of carbon black soon moved west, and by 1930 Cabot had eight plants in Texas and one in Oklahoma. Early that decade the company developed dustless carbon black pellets, which, along with gas profits, got Cabot through the Depression. In 1935 Cabot began drilling for oil and gas and processing natural gas in Texas. Soon natural gas accounted for more than half of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII led to rubber shortages and temporary government control over the industry. It also led to the construction and improvement (with government assistance) of Cabot plants in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. The company was the #1 producer of carbon black in 1950 and began its fumed silica operations in 1952. The postwar economic boom allowed Cabot to open carbon black plants in Canada, France, Italy, and the UK by the end of the decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 the company's businesses were united under the Cabot Corporation name. Expansion continued into Argentina, Colombia, Germany, and Spain for the next decade. Godfrey Cabot died in 1962. The next year the company started producing titanium, sold a 12% stake in a public offering, and began experimenting with plastic polymers.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Robert Sharpie used the cash derived from Cabot's chemical businesses during the 1970s for acquisitions -- including Kawecki Berylco Industries (tantalum, 1978) and TUCO, Inc. (gas processing and pipeline, 1979) -- while its chemical plants deteriorated. The oil crisis early in the decade resulted in the rapid growth of Cabot's energy business. However, when gas prices fell in the 1980s, Cabot's revenue base shrank and its liabilities didn't.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cabot family, which owned 30% of the company, replaced Sharpie with Samuel Bodman as CEO in 1987. Bodman invested in the plants and divested many of Cabot's noncore assets, including ceramics, metal manufacturing, and semiconductors. He also exited the energy production and exploration businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Cabot formed divisions to make pigment-based inks (inkjet colorants) and drilling fluids (Cabot Specialty Fluids) and sold TUCO. Two years later the company began field testing a drilling fluid (cesium formate) that would halve the drilling time in high-temperature, high-pressure wells. Cabot opened a slurry plant (for semiconductor manufacturing) in Japan in 1999 and completed the second phase of its carbon black plant in China, a joint venture with a Chinese firm. It also spun off 15% of its microelectronics materials business and sold Cabot LNG to Tractebel for around $680 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cabot spun off its remaining stake (about 80%) in
   <company id="99788">
    Cabot Microelectronics
   </company>
   in 2000. The next year Kennett Burnes was named CEO and chairman after Bodman stepped down to become US deputy treasury secretary. (President Bush nominated Bodman to become secretary of energy for his second term, and Bodman was confirmed in early 2005.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Cabot purchased the remainder of Showa Cabot Supermetals (tantalum) from its joint venture partner,
   <company id="55594">
    Showa Denko
   </company>
   , for about $100 million and another $100 million in debt. However, the company experienced lower sales volumes of tantalum because of contract disagreements with some of its customers, including
   <company id="13671">
    KEMET
   </company>
   and
   <company id="44083">
    AVX
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Cabot continued to develop and expand its newer businesses, including its growing ink jet colorants unit. In late 2002 it launched a new aerogels business (Nanogel), which produces materials for thermal and sound insulating purposes. Cabot sold its 40% stake in
   <company id="51384">
    Aearo Corporation
   </company>
   (maker of safety products like eyewear; formerly called Cabot Safety Holding Corporation) in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Cabot purchased Showa Denko's interest in another joint venture, Showa Cabot K.K., which marketed carbon black products in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2008 BASF executive Patrick Prevost took over the CEO post from Burnes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cabot moved to expand its portfolio of security technologies in 2010 by acquiring Oxonica Materials, a manufacturer of products used in anti-counterfeiting applications, including covert tags and other markings for security applications added to inks, paper, and films.
  </p>
  <p>
   Extending its presence further in Asia, Cabot and joint venture partner China National Bluestar Group completed expansion of a fumed silica project in Jiangxi Province in China in 2012. The plant produces a range of pure, electronics-grade fumed silica for automotive and industrial applications, including auto panels, boat hulls, solar panel adhesives, and windmill blades.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of Cabot's strategy to focus on its core business of specialty chemicals and rubber and carbon black, the company sold its supermetals business, including its tantalum business, to Australian company Global Advanced Metals for about $400 million in 2012. The sale allows the company to invest in new growth initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly afterward, Cabot purchased Dutch company
   <company id="92294">
    Norit N.V.
   </company>
   , a global leader in activated carbon, from Doughty Hanson &amp; Co. Managers and Euroland Investments for $1.1 billion. The move follows Cabot's strategy of acquiring higher margin, less cyclical companies for its specialty chemicals line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired the 60% that it did not already own of Nhumo, S.A.P.I. de C.V., a carbon black manufacturing operation in Altamira, Mexico. The Nhumo business was integrated into the company's Reinforcement Materials segment to help Cabot meet the growing demand for carbon black throughout North America.
