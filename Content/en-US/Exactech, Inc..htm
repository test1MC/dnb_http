   Exactech has joint replacement technologies down to an exact science. Health professionals worldwide use the company's orthopedic devices to replace joints weakened by injury or disease. Its Optetrak knee implants, Equinoxe shoulder systems, and Novation hip implants either partially or totally replace patients' damaged joints. It also markets Opteform and Optefil, bone allograft materials used to correct bone defects and damage. Exactech markets its products through direct sales representatives and independent dealers in the US, as well as through affiliated and independent distributors in about 35 other countries. Customers include hospitals, clinics, surgeons, and physicians.

  <p>
   Exactech's largest business segment is its knee replacement systems, which account for about 40% of annual revenues, followed by shoulder and knee implants (each accounting for about 20% of sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company manufactures most of its joint replacement systems at its own facilities, some of the components are made by third parties. In addition, several of Exactech's biologic bone matrix and bone graft products are licensed from
   <company id="100824">
    RTI Surgical
   </company>
   . The company also has a licensing agreement with Italian manufacturer Tecres, through which it distributes Cemex, a bone cement product used during joint procedures, in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   The company sells its products in North and South America, the Asia Pacific region, and Europe. Sales in the US market account for about two-thirds of revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exactech manufactures some of its devices at its Gainesville, Florida plant. It has subsidiaries in China, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Taiwan, and the UK and a branch office in Canada.

  <p>
   In the US, the company conducts sales and distribution through a subsidiary, which engages independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives. International are conducted through independent distributors coordinated out of Exactech's Swiss office.

  <p>
   Revenue saw a slight bump, 9%, for 2012 as all sectors saw an increase in sales except international surgical instrument sales. Net income rose 44% as the company had lower legal fees after settling some legal matters. Exactech continues to spend heavily on sales and marketing as well as R&amp;D, like most others in its industry.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Exactech's strategy involves reducing R&amp;D costs while continuing to roll out new products. To that end, it has brought more manufacturing in-house in the last few years and works to keep those costs down through automation. It also takes some of the pressure off manufacturing by distributing products and services for third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   For new and improved products, the company has added functionality to its knee replacement system for international markets, developed the Gibralt cervical thoracic spine system, and worked with
   <company id="12850">
    CONMED
   </company>
   to develop medical education materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on core operations, the company sold its spine and biologics business segment to ChoiceSpine in early 2017; terms of the deal were not disclosed.
