   Boast, build, and sell: Honda of America Mfg. (HAM) makes vehicles said to be as unconventional as their plants. Its three Ohio plants produce Honda automobiles and engines. The company's Marysville Auto Plant assembles the Acura TL and the Accord coupe and sedan. Its eco-designed East Liberty plant produces the Honda CR-V and Accord Crosstour. Together, HAM's two assembly plants have annual capacity of 680,000 vehicles, which are sold primarily in North America. In addition the company's Anna engine plant (AEP) produces four- and six-cylinder engines and related parts. Marysville is Honda's first plant in the US while AEP is its largest engine plant worldwide. HAM is building an Accura plant in Raymond, Ohio.

   auto plants in the North American region, including four in the US, have the capacity to produce 1.63 million automobiles each year. In 2012, 90% of all Honda and Acura automobiles sold in the US were produced in North America.

  <p>
   Honda operates 14 major manufacturing facilities in North America, producing a range of Honda and Acura automobiles, automobile engines and transmissions, Honda all-terrain vehicles, and power equipment products such as lawn mowers, mini-tillers, and general purpose engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's engines, transmissions, and other components are distributed to Honda plants throughout North America, including assembly facilities in Ohio, Indiana, and Canada. Other Honda of America operations include a research and development center, as well as an engineering facility. It is building the $70 million, 184,000 square-foot Performance Manufacturing Center in Raymond, Ohio to begin mass production of the Accura NSX sportscar by 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Russells Point facility produces automatic transmissions, continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), and four-wheel drive systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Marysville Plant boasts production of more than 10 million vehicles. It is the first plant outside of Japan to reach this milestone. Honda's plants continue to evolve, increasing their manufacturing efficiency and flexibility, as well as reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the past 30 years, HAM has built more than 14 million automobiles; 17 million engines; 1 million motorcycles, and 2 million ATVs.

  <p>
   In North America Honda's revenues increased by 30.8% due to higher auto sales and positive foreign currency translation effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating income decreased by 6.4% due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to higher net sales, model mix, and continuing cost reduction.

   Parent company Honda has been investing heavily in North American manufacturing. It has spent nearly $700 million in recent years upgrading and expanding its US production base. It spent $500 million at Anna in 2013 upgrading the plant to produce Honda's Earth Dreams Technology powertrains, engines, transmissions, and other parts. Earth Dreams Technology is Honda's term for next generation high efficiency, low emission vehicles. Honda spent $150 million expanding production at East Liberty and $23 million in Marysville to increase overall hybrid production by adding the Accura Hybrid Sedan to the line.
  </p>
  <p>
   These investments, along with the new $70 million Accura NSX plant being built in Raymond, are all part of Honda's plant to have HAM take on more global manufacturing duties and become an exporter of cars by the end of 2014. It also expects a 70% increase in HAM's export of auto parts in 2014 to Honda plants in South America, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its cost savings measures, in 2014 as part of its effort to reduce its global CO2 emissions and minimize the environmental impact of its operations HAM announced plans to install a compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station on its Marysville Auto Plant property in Marysville, Ohio. That year it also began operation of two power-producing wind turbines at its plant in Russells Point, Ohio, through an agreement with a subsidiary of
