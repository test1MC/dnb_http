  <p>
   Legrand's beginnings go back to 1860 when Barjaud de Lafont founded a small shop to make porcelain tableware in Limoges, France. By 1904 Frederic Legrand bought the company and gave it his name. During the next 40 years, the company became a popular name in porcelain tableware. After WWI it started a new business, opening a small factory to produce electrical fittings that used the company's porcelain as an insulating material.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the close of WWII, the company was sold to Pierre Vespieren. In 1945 Vespieren handed the reins to his son Jean and son-in-law Edouard Decoster. Fire destroyed the Legrand factory in 1949. It was rebuilt on the same site, and the company shifted emphasis to electrical fittings. In 1950 the company exited the porcelain business, which turned out to be a prudent decision: In postwar Europe not many people could afford fine porcelain, but the reconstruction of French infrastructure and the modernization of its industry created a huge market for Legrand's electrical fittings and accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1953 Legrand opened two plants in Limoges, and two years later it made its first acquisition when it purchased Electro Securit. The company first expanded outside France when it established a Belgian subsidiary in 1966. The move marked Legrand's foray into growth through acquisitions as it concentrated on expanding in Europe. To finance its growth, in 1970 the company went public on the Paris stock exchange. By the mid-1970s international sales represented 19% of Legrand's business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Americas offered new growth opportunities for Legrand, and in 1974 it entered the South American market with the acquisition of Brazil's Pial. Jean Verspieren died in 1983 and his brother-in-law, Edouard Decoster, took over as chairman. Decoster appointed François Grappotte general manager the same year. In 1984 Legrand penetrated the North American market when it bought rivals Pass &amp; Seymour and Slater Electric, creating the subsidiary Pass &amp; Seymour Legrand. When Decoster retired in 1988, he named Grappotte chairman and chief executive. Grappotte proceeded to accelerate Legrand's expansion. By the end of the decade, Legrand expanded into Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite Legrand's aggressive growth strategy, it was not immune to the worldwide recession of the early 1990s. Business in France, along with the rest of Europe, dropped off, and its Brazilian subsidiary began to lose money. Legrand's US operations also suffered from aging facilities. But the recession didn't stop new acquisitions. In 1992 Legrand picked up Molveno (Italy), Bufer (Turkey), and Pieron and Baco, both of France. The purchases of Power Centre (UK) and RTGama (Italy) followed in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the last half of the 1990s, Legrand stepped up the acquisition pace, adding 98% of Tehalit (Germany, 1995); 80% of Watt Stopper (US), Nimstone (UK), and 75% of Fael (Poland, 1996);
   <company id="61385">
    Ortronics
   </company>
   (US, 1997); and CEB (Italy, 1998). The company established a presence in China in 1998 with Legrand (Shanghai) Trading Co. The next year Legrand picked up

   's industrial light switch and light socket business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legrand acquired privately held, US-based Wiremold Company (wiring and cable systems) in a $770 million deal in 2000. In 2001 the company agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="42920">
    Schneider Electric
   </company>
   for an estimated $6.4 billion, but the deal was rejected on antitrust grounds by EU regulators. In 2002 GE announced that it was considering acquiring Legrand, but the US-based giant later withdrew its bid. Later that same year it was announced that
   <company id="92042">
    Wendel Investissement
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40268">
    Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
   </company>
   would buy Legrand in a deal worth a reported $3.69 billion. The investors completed the deal by the end of 2002, acquiring 98% of Legrand for €3.7 billion and assuming €1.4 billion in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 an offer was made to buy out all remaining minority shareholders, and the minority buyout was completed six months later, leading to the delisting of Legrand from the
   <company id="100729">
    Euronext
   </company>
   exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Legrand acquired Van Geel, a manufacturer of metal cable management products based in the Netherlands. The deal excluded the firm's German subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company returned to its acquisitive ways in 2005, buying a controlling stake in Zucchini, an Italian manufacturer of prefabricated busbar systems, and purchasing OnQ, a US-based supplier of structured wiring for residential applications. Later in the year it bought the ICM Group, filling out its portfolio of cable management products with the manufacturer of such brands as Cablofil and Krieg &amp; Zivy. The Legrand Group then acquired the TCL Building Technology and TCL International Electrical divisions of China's
   <company id="132340">
    TCL Corporation
   </company>
   . TCL Building Technology supplied data communications products and installation services, while TCL International Electrical made wiring devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legrand went public again in 2006, listing shares on the Eurolist of
   <company id="100453">
    Euronext Paris
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2006, Legrand acquired 51% of Shidean, a Chinese manufacturer of audio and video door entry systems; Cemar, a manufacturer of consumer units and industrial enclosures in Brazil; RM Kabelbaner, a Danish supplier of cable management products; and Vantage Controls, an American supplier of home automation systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007, the company acquired HPM, a supplier of wiring devices in Australia and New Zealand. HPM had annual sales of about €100 million, mostly in Australia, and employed 875 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legrand next bought UStec, an American company specializing in VDI products for residential buildings. UStec had annual sales of approximately $12 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2007, the company moved on to acquire control of Kontaktor, a Russian manufacturer of high-current circuit breakers. Kontaktor employed more than 2,400 people and posted 2006 sales of €35 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legrand then bought 80% of TCL Low-Voltage Electric (Wuxi) Co., Ltd., a unit of China's
   <company id="132340">
    TCL Corporation
   </company>
   , for 500 million yuan (nearly $68 million). It was the company's second transaction in two years with the TCL Group. In 2008 Legrand bought Estap, a Turkish manufacturer of VDI cabinets and enclosures.
