   Roularta Media Group (RMG) is Belgium's media king. It is one of the tiny country's largest print publishing and media concerns, operating in newspaper and magazine publishing; radio and TV broadcasting; Internet content production; and CD and DVD duplication. Major holdings include newspapers Krant van West-Vlaanderen (covering West Flanders) and De Streekkrant (free neighborhood weekly); magazines Trends (business news) and Knack (general news); Flemish TV station VTM (50%); Belgian TV news channel Kanaal Z; and Web portals Knack.be and Levif.be. RMG was founded in 1954 by Willy De Nolf and is now led by his son Rik. RMG is looking to grow beyond Belgium through foreign acquisitions. It's active in France.

   uRoularta Media Group (RMG) was founded by Willy De Nolf in 1954; he built the company's first publishing factory behind his home in Roeselare. RMG started out publishing provincial newspaper
   <i>
    De Krant van West-Vlaanderen.
   </i>
   Gradually over the next two decades, it established a network of free newspapers -- grouped under the
   <i>
    De Streekkrant
   </i>
   name -- as well as free magazines made up of a week's worth of advertisements featured in all the editions of
   <i>
    Streekkrant.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1971 the company expanded into news and general-interest magazines, launching such titles as
   <i>
    Knack, Trends, TelePro,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    FOOT
   </i>
   in subsequent years. Rik De Nolf, Willy's son and now CEO, joined the company in 1972. By the time RMG went public in 1998, it had branched into commercial printing, book and electronic publishing, CD and DVD duplication, and event hosting. In addition, it had acquired a minority stake (eventually raised to 50%) in Flemish TV network VTM, which also operates radio stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company launched the English-language
   <i>
    Trends International
   </i>
   and new business magazine
   <i>
    Bizz.
   </i>
   Also that year RMG acquired West Flemish newspaper
   <em>
    Wekelijks Nieuws
   </em>
   and joined with Financieel Economische Tijd to create Kanaal 2, a business news TV network. In 2000 Roularta combined its commercial printing unit with those of Concentra Grafische Groep and Mercator Press to form Mercator Printing Group. (The venture was broken up by the three companies two years later.)

   In 2006 the company transformed its Kanaal Z/Canal Z TV station into a full news channel, Z:News.
