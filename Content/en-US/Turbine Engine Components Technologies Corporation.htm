   TECT leverages the pockets of its parent company Stony Point Group to help it fund acquisitions to fuel its growth strategy. It also opens new offices in what he sees as key regions that can act as a springboard for growth. In 2012 it opened a new sales office in Munich, Germany. The company hopes to sell its products further into Europe and Asia as a result of the office opening.
