   National Beverage works to quench America's thirst. The company makes and distributes the Shasta and Faygo brands of flavored soft drinks, both of which were launched more than a century ago and come in multiple flavors to appeal to diverse consumer tastes. It also offers spring and flavored waters under the LaCroix and ClearFruit brands, Everfresh and Mr. Pure juice and juice-added drinks, Rip It energy drinks, and Ohana lemonades and teas. Customers include national and regional grocers, convenience stores, and foodservice distributors. National Beverage operates a dozen facilities located across the US. Company chairman and CEO Nick Caporella owns 74% of the business.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   National Beverage develops, manufactures, markets, and sells its flavored beverages nationwide. It is taking steps to expand distribution directly and through exporters to customers in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Pacific Rim, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   National Beverage's operations consist of various subsidiaries that purchase raw materials (aluminum cans and plastic bottles, corn syrup, and juice concentrates), produce the concentrates, and manufacture the finished products. In addition to its own brands, National Beverage produces soft drinks under private label for certain retailers (who also market some National Beverage brands).
  </p>
  <p>
   Its dozen bottling plants are situated near major US metropolitan areas, enabling timely availability of products. The company also uses customers' warehouse facilities and its own delivery fleet to distribute the National Beverage lineup, along with the delivery systems of independent distributors and wholesalers.
  </p>

  <p>
   National Beverage sells its products through an internal sales force, as well as via specialized broker networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm distributes its products to convenience stores through its own direct-store delivery fleet and with help from independent distributors. The company's foodservice division distributes items to independent, specialized distributors that serve hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels, and foodservice wholesalers. National Beverage's take-home, convenience, and foodservice operations also leverage vending machines and glass-door coolers to market and promote their brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   National Beverage spent $50.2 million on advertising in fiscal 2014, compared to $44.6 million in 2013 and $45.8 million 2012. Within the grocery store market, National Beverage competes head-to-head with national cola giants, but through regionally-focused marketing efforts, which tend to be less costly than national campaigns.

  <p>
   Revenue for National Beverage dropped 3% in fiscal 2014 to $641 million from 2013's $662 million. The company attributes the decline to a more than 7% volume decrease in sales of carbonated soft drinks, thanks to unfavorable weather conditions and a drop in consumption of the drinks across the industry. Net income dropped 7% during the reporting period to more than $43 million from about $47 million. The 2014 revenue decrease combined with an increase in expenses, such as advertising, spurred the drop. Cash from operations rose $12 million to $52 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Amid a nation where cola-flavored soft drinks account for about 50% of the soft drink sector's grocery market, National Beverage colas account for less than 20% of the company's volume. Rather than concentrate on cola-consuming customers, National Beverage has adopted a "fantasy of flavors" product strategy that caters to regional and ethnic (Hispanic) tastes. Indeed, a number of brands, such as Faygo's RedPop, Moon Mist, and Rock'n'Rye, are positioned as local heroes. The strategy includes adding products in the rapidly growing functional drink category, which targets consumers who are willing to pay more for beverages perceived to promote health and wellness. To this end, its Power+ Brands target consumers who seek healthier and functional beverage alternatives. This collection of brands includes LaCroix, LaCroix Curate, Rip It, Everfresh, and Everfresh Premier Varietals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concurrently, the company focuses on the convenience store market, where flavors generate 56% of soft drink sales. Convenience stores, including dollar stores, gas stations, and other, smaller, "up and down the street" businesses (the company's term), also provide top shelf visibility for its beverages at a higher selling price.

  <p>
   Nick Caporella was CEO of Burnup &amp; Sims (B&amp;S), a telecommunications firm in which corporate raider Victor Posner had accumulated a 43% stake by late 1985. To prevent a Posner takeover, Caporella created National Beverage; B&amp;S bought a large stake in the new company, which it paid for in part with newly created shares of its own stock, diluting Posner's B&amp;S stake to 23%. (Posner gave up on trying to take over B&amp;S in 1988.) Meanwhile, in late 1985 National Beverage bought

   </company>
   's Shasta Beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shasta had been founded in California in 1889 as a bottler of naturally carbonated spring water. In 1954 it became the first company to put soft drinks in cans. Sara Lee, whose predecessor bought Shasta in 1961, mainly promoted Shasta cola, but under Caporella's direction, Shasta's wide array of flavors was re-emphasized.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 National Beverage bought Faygo Beverages, which was founded in 1907 and whose products are distributed mainly in the eastern US. National Beverage went public in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caporella exited B&amp;S in 1994 when it merged with another company to form MasTec. National Beverage introduced seasonal soft drinks St. Nick's and Creepy Coolers in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Its first non-carbonated beverage, Ohana, debuted the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   National Beverage launched herbally enhanced VooDoo Rain beverages in 1998. After Shasta's new Exotic Flavors line (including flavors developed for the Hispanic market) became popular in Southern California, it expanded distribution into Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   National Beverage added about $40 million in sales in 1999 when it bought Chicago-based Home Juice Co. (Mr. Pure- and Home Juice-brand juice products). In 2000 the company added the carbonated beverage operations of Beverage Canners International, including the Ritz and Crystal Bay brands and a manufacturing facility in Miami. Its line of diet Shasta drinks shifted to using
