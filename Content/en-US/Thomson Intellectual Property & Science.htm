  <p>
   In 2011 it launched Thomson Reuters Cortellis, a solution for the life sciences industry that specifically targets pharma and biotech professionals. Thomson Reuters Cortellis combines the company's drug research and development data with information management technology in order to provide advanced searching features, customization, and integration with systems.

   The Thomson Reuters division was formerly called Thomson Healthcare &amp; Science. However, in 2011 the parent company put the healthcare business up for sale, and began classifying it among "other" businesses in its financial results. It did so after deciding the unit lacked the scale of its competitors, and because it wanted to focus on its core businesses serving the legal and financial industries.
