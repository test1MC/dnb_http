   Network Equipment Technologies (NET) supplies networking hardware and software for unified communications, session-initiation protocol trunking, enterprise mobility, and IP-based multi-service networking. The company's primary products include multi-service networking platforms (Promina and NX Series), voice interoperability gateways and switches (Tenor and VX Series), and a high-performance mediation platform for unified communications (UX Series). NET also provides design, installation, and maintenance services. The company, which generates most of its sales in the US, serves the US government, communication service providers, and large enterprises. It is owned by
   <company id="100309">
    Sonus Networks
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sonus Networks acquired NET in late 2012 for about $42 million. The deal helps Sonus make inroads in the enterprise market, expands its network of channel partners, and makes the US federal government a customer.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates from about 15 offices in Australia, China, France, Japan, Latin America, the Middle East, the UK, and the US. It generates more than 60% of sales in the US; Europe accounts for about 20%.

  <p>
   NET markets its products through a direct sales force, as well as through an international network of distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and government defense contractors. Government customers account for about half of sales, down from nearly 80% in fiscal 2010.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company reported fiscal 2012 (ended March) revenue of about $50, which is down 17% from 2011 (itself down about 20% from the previous year). Sales to government customers declined by nearly $20 million that year as the market for the Promina product (sold primarily to government accounts) continues to shrink due to the transition in networking technology to packet-based broadband technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rarely profitable, the company has made money on an annual basis only once since 1998. Its 2012 net loss of $34 million is down from a loss of $26 million in 2011. In early 2012, in an effort to reduce expenses, NET embarked on a restructuring plan that included reductions in headcount, facilities, capital expenditures, and marketing.

  <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   As the markets for its legacy products shrink, NET is focused on products that address emerging technologies and trends, including packet-switching, VoIP, and unified communications. As part of that vision, in 2010 it purchased the SmartSIP and SmartVoIP product lines from Evangelyze Communications, and it bought Quintum Technologies, a developer of enterprise VoIP equipment, a few years before.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also partners with
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   on unified communications products, and it signed a global reseller agreement with
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   in 2010 that allows HP to sell NET networking products that support Microsoft unified communications applications. It launched its newest major product, the UX Series, in fiscal 2011; UX products are designed for the unified communications and enterprise session border controller markets.

  <p>
   Network Equipment Technologies (NET) was founded in 1983 by Bruce Smith (who left the company in 1990) and Walter Gill, and shipped its first networking products two years later. NET went public in 1987 and formed an agreement with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   to market certain NET products. In 1989 the company established a licensing deal with
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   and a distribution and development agreement with
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   NET introduced the industry's first synchronous optical network (SONET, now the standard for optical transmissions) in 1991 and debuted anÂ ATM switch for corporate computer networks the next year. Former Amdahl EVP Joseph Francesconi became president and CEO of NET in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company scored networking equipment contracts in 1996 with Lufthansa Airlines, among others. Francesconi resigned in 1999 and Hubert Whyte, a veteran of
   <company id="42501">
    Newbridge Networks
   </company>
   , replaced him as CEO. Slumping sales prompted NET to cut 10% of its workforce that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting a loss for fiscal 1999, NET announced another round of layoffs (30%) in 2000. That year the company also sold its Federal Services Business to
   <company id="12828">
    CACI International
   </company>
   , and unveiled a new strategy targeted at broadband service creation. As part of the new strategy, the company began doing business as net.com. In 2001 and 2002 the company announced new products for the communications carrier market and an expanded range of Internet protocol-based equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whyte resigned in 2005 and was replaced by longtime board member Nicholas Keating.
