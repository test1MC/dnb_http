   Paladin Labs licenses drug compounds for promotion in the Canadian market. The company's slate of prescription offerings includes drugs for urology, endocrinology, cancer, dermatology, neurology, and women's health. Among Paladin's key products are prostate cancer treatment Trelstar, testosterone deficiency drug Testim, and osteoarthritis therapy Pennsaid. The company also offers some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in Canada, including emergency contraceptive Plan B. The company focuses on serving markets that are overlooked by larger pharmaceutical firms, typically by forming developing and marketing partnerships with other drugmakers.

   Over the years, Paladin has expanded its portfolio by acquiring or gaining licensing rights to new compounds, as well as development-stage pharmaceuticals and drug delivery technologies. It has also worked to grow its operations in countries outside of Canada.

   Paladin has grown through a number of purchases and licensing deals over the years. Collaborative partnerships included relationships with drug firm

    Isotechnika Pharma
   </company>
   for kidney transplant drugs and Belgian firm Sylphar to develop and market an OTC tooth-whitening product in Europe and other regions using Paladin's BioEnvelop technology.In 2012, however, Paladin launched into its most significant long-term strategic initiative to date -- to expand and build critical mass in the more than $3 billion South African pharmaceutical market. The company formed a strategic partnership with Johannesburg, South Africa-based Litha Healthcare Group and became its largest shareholder (with roughly 45% of the company), gaining a strong, diversified commercial platform from which it can expand.
