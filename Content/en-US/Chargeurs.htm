   Chargeurs is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The acquisitive company is a wool processor and maker of pure and blended wool products. Its global operations produce wool blends, wool-based fabrics, and woven and nonwoven garment interlinings. Chargeurs also makes other non-wool fabrics, as well as self-adhesive protective linings used for temporary protection of surfaces for the appliance, building, and transportation industries. The company is cutting back its spinning, weaving, and finishing operations. Chargeurs operates in more than 35 countries. Current CEO and Chairman Eduardo Malone and former CEO Jérôme Seydoux jointly control about a third of Chargeurs.

  <p>
   Chargeurs began as French shipping company Chargeurs Réunis in 1872. The company diversified into air transportation in 1929, when the industry was just developing. The company expanded its commercial airline interests with the post-WWII creation of Union Aeromaritime de Transport (UAT). Chargeurs was organized into a holding company with financial and real-estate concerns that provided services for it. It also had cruise-line concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Chargeurs was acquired by textile group Pricel (founded 1925). Pricel had owned stock in Chargeurs since 1974; it increased its stake in Chargeurs in 1980, which led to full acquisition the next year. Pricel adopted the Chargeurs name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former Pricel chairman Jérôme Seydoux became CEO of Chargeurs and attempted to revitalize the company's shipping concerns by overhauling vessels so that they could better compete. The company, however, attempted to dispose of its shipping concerns in 1986, but was not successful until two years later. Chargeurs diversified into the television and movie industry when it obtained a 31% share in French television station La Cinq (1986) and a 50% share in Renn Productions (1987). The company's interest in La Cinq was reduced to 10% when the government sold the station to another company. Other television and movie industry stakes included a 10% interest in the British Satellite Company (now
   <company id="42747">
    Sky plc
   </company>
   ), a UK-based satellite television company, and Pathe Cinema, one of Europe's oldest film companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime Chargeurs' textile and commercial airline divisions were enjoying success. Its textile business was continuously growing and had added interlinings to its product line. In 1987 the company acquired Tiberghien Brothers (wool-weaving) and Roudère (natural fabrics); it also acquired a minority stake in textile conglomerate Prouvost that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988, however, a pilot strike addressing wages halted the company's commercial airline success. The strike was settled the following year, but the possibility of future uprisings and limited expansion opportunities prompted the company to sell about 70% of its ownership in its UTA commercial airline business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sky boasted 1.8 million subscribers in 1991 and Chargeurs increased its stake in the television company to 17%, but hard times for the company were lurking. In 1993 a global recession forced Chargeurs to cut 1,700 jobs. To better control its diversified holdings and strengthen its financial position, the company split into two entities in 1996: the Chargeurs International Group (all industrial operations) and Pathe (communications holdings).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Chargeurs International shortened its name to Chargeurs and disposed of its Walon automobile transportation business and its Costa Crocière cruise line (50% to
   <company id="11803">
    Carnival Cruises
   </company>
   and 50% to Airtours). In 1998 it purchased the non-woven interlinings business of UK-based IPT.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's focus turned to its wool-based garment operations. In 2000 Chargeurs purchased Ternynck Frères (women's-wear fabrics). In 2001 the company acquired the protective film business of US-based Ivex Packaging. The following year Chargeurs acquired Roussel Desrousseaux, a dyer and finisher specializing in wool, cotton, and synthetic fibers. Also in 2002, Chargeurs closed its Italian wool-combing operation and pulled out of its wool-scouring business in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like other textile manufacturers around the world, Chargeurs was affected by Chinese manufacturers being freed from export restrictions in early 2005, and the company finished the year with sales down 10% from 2004, with declining sales especially apparent in the Chargeurs Wool and Chargeurs Fashion units.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 the company agreed to acquire equity stakes in two garment interlining subsidiaries of Ningbo Yak Technology.
