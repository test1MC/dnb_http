   Modine Manufacturing runs hot and cold but not when it comes to the products it makes for vehicles. Founded in 1916, the company designs and makes highly engineered heating and cooling systems and components for a range of customers worldwide: automotive OEMs, agricultural and construction OEMs, heating and cooling equipment OEMs, construction contractors, wholesalers of plumbing and heating equipment, and fuel cell manufacturers. Products include heat transfer modules, oil coolers, radiators, and vehicular air conditioning systems. With operations in some 14 countries and technical centers in the US and Germany, more than half of Modine's revenues are generated outside of the US.

  <p>
   Modine has experienced revenues increases the last two years, with revenues rising 1% from $1.48 billion in 2014 to $1.5 billion in 2015. Its profits, however, nosedived by 83% from $130 million in 2014 to $22 million in 2015 largely due to the absence of income tax benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2015 was fueled by a 25% spike in HVAC equipment sales and an 8% increase from both oil coolers and condensers. In addition, Asia net sales increased in 2015 primarily due to new automotive program launches in China and higher sales across all markets in India.

  <p>
   Modine's strategy for improved profitability includes diversifying its markets and customer base, as well as partnering with customers in the development of new products and technologies. It is also focusing on emerging markets in China and India. The company plans to launch new automotive and commercial vehicle programs in 2016, which will complete the transition of its light assembly facility in Shanghai into an engine products-focused manufacturing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company completed the acquisition of Barkell, a custom air handling company located in the UK for roughly $8 million. The acquisition expanded both its product line and sales channel within the country.
