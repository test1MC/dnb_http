   DUSA Pharmaceuticals has seen the light. The company develops photodynamic therapy (PDT) devices and drugs for treating and diagnosing dermatological conditions using a combination of drugs and light. DUSA markets its Levulan Kerastick topical solution and applicator, which are used in combination with the BLU-U light to treat actinic keratoses, or pre-cancerous skin lesions caused by sun exposure. When used together, Levulan Kerastick and BLU-U are known as the Levulan PDT process; on its own, BLU-U is also

   approved to treat moderate acne. While DUSA packages Levulan into its Kerastick applicator products, third parties manufacture its drugs and light systems. DUSA is owned by India's

        <p>
   DUSA Pharmaceuticals markets and distributes its BLU-U and Levulan Kerastick products directly in the US market. Elsewhere in the world, the company relies on other companies to market and distribute its products. Clarion Medical Technologies distributes the products in Canada.

        <p>
   Under Sun Pharma's ownership, DUSA's sales have gradually begun to rise, driven by increasing penetration with dermatologists and gradual price increases.

   Sun is ramping-up DUSA's operations. DUSA's drug-device combination for treating actinic keratosis (AK) has potential to increase its market shares in the US AK market. The company is focusing on improving its penetration with dermatologists and the usage of its products in AK treatment.
