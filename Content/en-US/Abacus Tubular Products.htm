   Abacus Tubular Products probably can't count the number of times it has put someone in the driver seat or supplied a backseat driver. The company is one of the UK's leading manufacturers of motor-vehicle seating systems. Abacus Tubular seats can be found in buses, minbuses, and vans, and bear luxury nameplates such as Emerald Bodyguard, Jade, Onyx, Ruby, Idea II, and Voyager. Other products include arm rests, ashtrays, and foot rests. Upholstery on the company's seats is hand-finished and given a whopping four separate checks for quality before being sent off for delivery.
