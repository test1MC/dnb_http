   As part of its business, Bob's Red Mill operates a visitor's center, store, and bakery and cafe beside its headquarters in the Oregon city of Milwaukie, roughly 15 minutes from Portland.

   In 2013 Bob's Red Mill consolidated its warehouse and distribution operations by leasing a 175,000-sq.-ft. warehouse in Clackamas, about two miles from Milwaukie. The move gives the company 70,000 sq. ft. of additional space for new production and packaging functions.

   Bob's Red Mill has expanded its portfolio of products in recent years to cater to those who suffer from Celiac Disease. To this end, the company has rolled out several new gluten-free products and today sells about 80 items for consumers who follow gluten-free diets.

   Based on customer feedback and industry shifts, Bob's Red Mill is focused on five new trends in baking. Product introductions in recent years have addressed many of these trends. Almond Meal is used in low-carbohydrate diets. Xanthan Gum is used in gluten-free baking. Its popular Whole Wheat Pearl Couscous spawned newer versions such as its Whole Wheat Pearl Couscous with Pesto and Vegetables. Coconut Flour is a health alternative to wheat and other grain flours. And, lastly, chia seeds are an ancient South American super food that packs dietary fiber, protein, nutrients, and Omega-3.
