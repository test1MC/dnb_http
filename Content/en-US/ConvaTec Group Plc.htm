   ConvaTec winds its way around wicked wounds. The company makes wound cleansers, dressings, bandages, wound hydration products, and a negative pressure wound therapy system. Its products are designed to foster the management and healing of wounds and address such issues as wound dryness and severity. ConvaTec's additional products include ostomy pouching systems, which allow patients with artificial openings (or stomas) to dispose of bodily waste into attachable pouches. It also makes lines of continence, critical care, and infusion products. ConvaTec, which manufactures its products in Europe and the US and distributes worldwide, went public in late 2016.
