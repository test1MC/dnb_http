  <p>
   Roxane depends on a continual flow of new drug approvals to refresh its product lineup. Its research and development operations aim to file a steady stream of abbreviated new drug applications with the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   as the company creates functionally equivalent versions of existing drugs. R&amp;D efforts focus on bulk and unit-dose packages of liquid and solid drugs, tablets in coated, controlled-release, and sustained-release tablets; nasal and topical solutions; and cytotoxics (cancer drugs) and class II narcotics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company submitted 11 new drug applications and gained approval for products including irbesartan (generic diabetes drug Avapro/Avalide), cevimeline (generic Evoxac for dry mouth associated with certain immune conditions), nevirapine (generic of viral medicine Viramune), and montelukast (generic Singulair for asthma). The previous year, the Roxane organization expanded its manufacturing and laboratory facilities in Columbus to ensure ample development and production capacity for future years.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots to the 1885 formation of Columbus Pharmacal in 1885 in Columbus, Ohio. The Columbus Pharmacal entity was purchased by Netherlands-based Philips (later Philips Roxane) in 1959. In 1978 Philips Roxane was purchased by Boehringer Ingelheim, and the US lab was renamed as Roxane Laboratories.
