   When it comes to digital images, Epson America snaps, scans, prints, and projects. A subsidiary of Japanese giant

   , the company manufactures digital cameras, document cameras, home theater systems, flatbed scanners, printers, fitness devices, smart glasses, and projectors. Its printer line includes personal ink jet and high-volume impact printers, as well as point-of-sale devices. It also offers printing and photography software and such supplies as print cartridges and paper. Epson America, which represents Seiko Epson in North America and South America, was founded in 1975.

  <p>
   Epson's strategy includes efforts to expand the markets for its printing and imaging devices. Though perhaps best known for its ink jet printers for the consumer market, Epson is also a leader in point-of-sale (POS) printers and transaction terminals used in retail and banking.

   The company makes and sells smart glasses, an outgrowth of its projector technology and business. For uses in applications for entertainment, manufacturing, and medical science, each lens  of the BT-200 has its own display, a front-facing camera. In another newer area, Epson American makes devices to help users track their fitness. The Pulsense PS-500 watch and PS-100 band track continuous heart rate, sleep quality, and exercise intensity. M-Tracer is a golf swing analyzer that can help golfers improve their swings.

   Like many of its fellow projector makers, the company has also found opportunity in the growing market for home theater products. It offers a number of projectors designed for home use, a line of projectors with 3D capabilities. The BrightLink line of interactive printers can quickly switch between sources. And wireless devices have brought more opportunities. Epson America offers the iPrint printing application for the
