   The company oversees its divisions, which include Off-Highway, NITE, and Kysor Parts (HVAC parts). These divisions are developing and offering products that extend the company's market share for new and niche HVAC applications. The off-highway division offers climate control systems for the world's toughest environments. Bergstrom's NITE (no-idle thermal environment) division makes a lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery for its NITE systems, which allow truckers to keep their sleeping cabins cool at night without having to idle their engines. The NITE Phoenix batteries weigh 60% less than traditional batteries, last longer, provide 16% more power, and take up less room. While the Li-Ion battery saves in fuel costs, it also adheres to regulations cropping up around the country that ban overnight idling due to emissions.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company teamed up with clean technology company eNow Inc. to offer new solar power energy solutions as part of the  NITE system, enabling drivers to conserve fuel.

   Bergstrom entered into a partnership in 2013 with Fontaine Modification, a post-production truck modification company that serves OEMs, dealers and fleets throughout North America.

  <p>
   Bergstrom uses acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2013 it acquired Innovative Product Development Corporation (IPDC), an engineering firm based in Troy, Michigan, in a deal that expanded its design engineering capabilities and gave Bergstrom a strategic location for the recruitment of key experienced engineering resources available in the Detroit area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2013, Bergstrom purchased Dirna S.A., based in Madrid. Dirna makes air conditioning systems to the European commercial vehicle truck market and for off-highway construction and agricultural machinery. The deal fortified Bergstrom's Kysor division, which also sells HVAC parts to these industries, and it gave the company a springboard for growth in Europe.
