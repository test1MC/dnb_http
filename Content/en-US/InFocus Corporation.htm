   InFocus helps put the big picture in meeting rooms and classrooms. The company makes projectors that can present output from PCs, computer networks, and DVD players. Products include portable projectors, projectors for conference rooms and auditoriums, and home theater models. Larger models are used to make business presentations and can double as big-screen televisions when connected to a video player. It also offers accessories such as cables, lenses, and mounts and stands, as well as the Mondopad 55-inch touchscreen tablet computer. InFocus, which is owned by Image Holdings Corporation, markets its products worldwide.

   The company sells its products through distributors such as Ingram Micro, resellers that brand the projectors under their own labels, and directly to retailers and corporations.

   In early 2016, the company released its ConX platform of hardware, software, and cloud services. The system is run from a control server that allows use to quickly configure and change each input image to any number of displays. Participants can focus on the content of their choosing when they want to.

   InFocus has been on something of an acquisition tear in 2015 and 2016, adding capabilities to its product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, InFocus acquired
   <company id="101130">
    Avistar
   </company>
   , a video conferencing software provider specializing in technology for video calling from a variety of devices from mobile phones to large-format video walls. This acquisition helps InFocus establish lower price points for video conferencing. It hopes making video conferencing more affordable will make it accessible to all sizes of businesses, schools, and facilities.

   InFocus acquired Jupiter Systems, a developer of video wall and enterprise collaboration products, in 2015. The acquisition rounds out InFocus' lineup to include display wall processor technology, bringing a 360-degree view of operations to any control room, conference room, and mobile device. InFocus believes the Jupiter technology allows it to provide end-to-end collaboration tools to customers.

   Paul Gulick and two partners founded In Focus Systems in 1986 to make information display systems. A year later the company shipped its first product, PC Viewer, an overhead LCD projection panel that transmitted images to the panel using a PC. In 1989 In Focus released the first color version of the product. The company went public the next year.

   In 1992 In Focus formed Motif, a joint venture with Motorola, to make low-cost LCDs. That year GENICOM executive John Harker joined In Focus as president and CEO. The company introduced the portable PanelBook series, projection devices the size of notebook computers, in 1993. The next year it bought Genigraphics (a provider of imaging services for presentations) and formed an R&amp;D alliance with office furniture giant

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Motif changed its mandate to licensing In Focus' LCD technology to manufacturers of display screens for handheld games, PCs, and wireless communications devices. That year Gulick left In Focus.
