   Still publishing its flagship
   <i>
    National Geographic
   </i>
   magazine, the National Geographic Society (NGS) has expanded into an array of venues to enhance our knowledge of the big blue marble. The NGS has staked claims in the worlds of television and the Web, as well as in book publishing and map-making. With
   <company id="41816">
    News Corp.
   </company>
   , it operates the National Geographic Channel US, a cable channel that reaches about 600 million households worldwide. The NGS was founded in 1888, the year the first issue of
   <em>
    National Geographic
   </em>
   magazine was published. A partnership controlled by News Corp.'s
   <company id="41816">
    Twenty First Century Fox
   </company>
   bought majority control of the organization's media assets in 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   National Geographic sold control of its media assets to the partnership controlled Twenty First Century Fox as part of a $725 million deal.

  <p>
   As might be expected, the NGS's publishing operations are geographically diverse.
   <em>
    National Geographic
   </em>
   magazine is published in more than 30 local-language editions and has subscribers worldwide.

  <p>
   In addition to publishing its famous magazine, the organization also supports geographic expeditions (it has funded more than 11,000 scientific research projects), and sponsors exhibits, lectures, and education programs.

   The National Geographic Society sold off majority control of its media assets because it was struggling to survive as a non-profit amid steady advertising declines. The new partnership, based in Washington, will include a portfolio of National Geographic-branded cable TV channels, digital properties, and publishing operations including the flagship magazine.

  <p>
   In 1888 a group of scientists and explorers gathered in Washington, DC, to form the National Geographic Society. Gardiner Greene Hubbard was its first president. The organization mailed the first edition of its magazine, dated October 1888, to 165 members. The magazine was clothed in a brown cover and contained a few esoteric articles, such as "The Classification of Geographic Forms by Genesis." The organization's tradition of funding expeditions began in 1890 when it sent geologist Israel Russell to explore Alaska. It began issuing regular monthly editions of
   <i>
    National Geographic
   </i>
   in 1896.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Hubbard's death in 1897, his son-in-law, inventor Alexander Graham Bell, became president. Aiming to boost the magazine's popularity, he hired Gilbert Grosvenor (who later married Bell's daughter) as editor. Grosvenor turned the magazine from a dry, technical publication to one of more general interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Grosvenor the magazine pioneered the use of photography, including rare photographs of remote Tibet (1904), the first hand-tinted colored photos (1910), the first underwater color photos (1920s), and the first color aerial photographs (1930).
  </p>
  <p>
   The organization sponsored Robert Peary's trek to the North Pole in 1909 and Hiram Bingham's 1912 exploration of Machu Picchu in Peru. National Geographic expanded into cartography with the creation of a maps division in 1915. Grosvenor became president in 1920.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1930 circulation was 1.2 million (up from 2,200 in 1900). Grosvenor's policy of printing only "what is of a kindly nature ... about any country or people" resulted in two articles that were criticized for their kindly portrayal of prewar Nazi Germany (however, National Geographic maps and photographs were used by the US government for WWII intelligence). That policy eased over the years, and in 1961 a
   <i>
    National Geographic
   </i>
   article described the growing US involvement in Vietnam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grosvenor retired in 1954. His son Melville Bell Grosvenor, who became president and editor in 1957, accelerated book publishing with the first edition of
   <em>
    National Geographic Atlas of the World
   </em>
   . In addition, he created a film unit that aired its first TV documentary in 1965. Melville retired in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   Melville's son Gilbert Melville Grosvenor took over as president in 1970. The organization debuted its
   <i>
    National Geographic Explorer
   </i>
   television series in 1985. National Geographic branched into commercial ventures in 1995 when it created subsidiary National Geographic Ventures to expand its presence on television, the Internet, maps, and retail. That same year the
   <em>
    National Geographic
   </em>
   magazine began international circulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grosvenor became chairman in 1996, and Reg Murphy took over as president. Murphy shook up the organization by laying off nearly a quarter of its staff and stepping up its profit-making activities. In 1997 National Geographic branched into cable television when it partnered with Fox, NBC, and Sky to launch outside the US the National Geographic Channels International (NGCI).
  </p>
  <p>
   John Fahey replaced Murphy as president in 1998. That same year National Geographic released
   <em>
    Mysteries of Egypt
   </em>
   , its first IMAX-style film. The following year National Geographic unveiled its
   <i>
    Adventure
   </i>
   magazine. The organization began offering
   <i>
    National Geographic
   </i>
   on newsstands for the first time in 1999. In 2000 National Geographic Ventures acquired recreational topographic map company Wildflower Productions. As part of an agreement to buy 30% of travel portal iExplore, National Geographic also agreed to license the use of its name. In 2001 National Geographic Channel US, a cable channel, was launched as a joint venture with Fox parent News Corp.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 National Geographic began using IBM software and hardware to digitize thousands of its culture and nature images to sell online. That year
   <em>
    National Geographic World,
   </em>
   a magazine for young people, became
   <em>
    National Geographic Kids.
   </em>
   The organization also began a literacy campaign that included
   <em>
    National Geographic Explorer
   </em>
   magazine and curriculum materials for classrooms. In 2003 it launched Hungarian-, Romanian-, Czech-, Croatian-, and Russian-language editions of
   <em>
    National Geographic
   </em>
   magazine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 National Geographic sold majority control of its media assets to
   <company id="41816">
    Twenty First Century Fox
   </company>
   as part of a $725 million deal.
