   Echo's former parent Kioritz and Oregon-based Shindaiwa merged to form a new holding company, Yamabiko Corporation, which triggered the Echo and Shindaiwa business combination. The union of Echo and Shindaiwa creates a more efficient organization with lower costs and to boost competitiveness in the North and South American markets.

   For more than 15 years, Echo has been a supplier to
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   . The Echo and Home Depot partnership has been a boon for both of the companies as they target the professional and residential markets. To retain its relationship with the Ã¼ber home-improvement retailer, Echo continues to pump out new products, especially focusing on its 2-stroke engine expertise. Tapping its Tornado technology, Echo launched its Echo Power Boost Tornado engine, which features fuel-usage efficiencies. In 2013, Echo expanded its chain saw lineup and released the ECHO PB-760LN, a powerful, low-noise backpack blower.

   To gain ground in the commercial turf and consumer lawn and garden markets and boost sales, Echo in 2014 formed a US dealer alliance partnership with
   <company id="139592">
    Kubota Tractor Corporation
   </company>
   . As part of the alliance, the Echo and Shindaiwa names will become the preferred brands of hand-held outdoor power equipment within the Kubota dealer network.

Operating as a subsidiary of Echo under the name Crary Industries, TerraMarc makes Bear Cat chippers, Lockwood potato planting and harvesting implements, and Crary agricultural equipment.
