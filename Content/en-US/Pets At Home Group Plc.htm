   Barks, mews, and caws are music to the ears of Pets at Home. The retailer operates more than 350 pet-oriented stores throughout the UK and a retail website through which it sells products under its own name brand. Pets at Home offers veterinary services -- called Companion Care -- at the majority of its stores and provides 24-hour emergency services, as well as ordinary care. For some animals, pet behavior training is available at many Pets at Home stores. Founded by Anthony Preston in 1991, the company had been grooming itself for an initial public offering, but the move was upstaged by a $1.5 billion buyout by US-based private-equity firm

   in 2010. It did eventually go public in 2014.
