   Skip the spoonful of sugar, Banner Pharmacaps uses gelatin to help the medicine go down. The company develops and makes a range of softgels for convenient oral dosage and delivery of prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), and nutritional medicines and supplements. Its soft gelatin technologies are used in both branded and private-label OTC products, such as pain and cold medicines. Banner also works with prescription drugmakers to enhance solubility and delivery methods for existing products, as well as for compounds in clinical trial stages. Former parent company

   Using gelatin and polymer-based technologies, Banner Pharmacaps specializes in producing softgels that control release rate and enhance performance of certain compounds. In addition to the main North Carolina facility, which produces a variety of prescription, OTC, and nutritional medicines, Banner's European plant manufactures softgels and Soflet Gelcaps. Meanwhile, its facility in Mexico sells finished packaged products directly to consumers under the Pharmacaps and Gelcaps brands.

  <p>
   Banner Pharmacaps' scientists are experienced in the field of oral drug delivery and work to develop softgel variations often in conjunction with major pharmaceutical companies. For instance, in 2011 the company formed an alliance with Impax Laboratories to develop softgel capsule products. Its acquisition by the larger Patheon organization will give Banner backing to pursue further expansion efforts.
