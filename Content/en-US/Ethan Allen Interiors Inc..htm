   Furniture maker Ethan Allen Interiors (the holding company for Ethan Allen Inc.) has some revolutionary ideas for your home's living room and other areas. Named after the American patriot, the vertically integrated firm boasts about half a dozen US furniture factories, including a couple of saw mills. The company's products include casegoods (wood furniture, such as beds, dressers, and tables), upholstery items (sofas, recliners), and accessories (wall decor, lighting). They're sold through nearly 300 Ethan Allen stores located primarily in the US. About half of its stores are operated by independent dealers who are required to deal exclusively in Ethan Allen products and follow company guidelines.

  <p>
   Ethan Allen owns and operates five manufacturing plants and a sawmill in the US, and two plants in Mexico and Honduras. On the retail side of the business, the quintessentially American company is opening locations in Europe. In June 2013 it opened a store in Antwerp, Belgium.

   Ethan Allen runs one of the largest US-based home-furnishing manufacturing operations. Some 70% of its products are made in America. The company operates retail shops in the Middle East and Asia, as well as a handful of stores in Canada. The furniture maker is slowly rebounding from several difficult selling seasons. To cut costs and ride out the recession, Ethan Allen had been closing plants in the US, consolidating its US manufacturing operations, and moving its sourcing overseas. As part of this effort, the company consolidated the operations of its casegoods facilities in Andover, Maine, and Beecher Falls, Vermont.

  <p>
   Ethan Allen also is looking to shutter some design center stores and service centers. The company said it had been increasing its focus on in-home design services so that it did not need as many retail design locations. To secure its foothold internationally, Ethan Allen has been expanding its European business.

  <p>
   To support its manufacturing operations in Vermont, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Mexico, the furniture maker in late 2011 acquired its former casegoods manufacturing plant in Honduras, which spans some 164,000-sq.-ft.

  <p>
   To its benefit, Ethan Allen's revenue rose in fiscal 2014 (ended June) to $746.7 million from 2013's $729.1 million, driven by sales increases among its wholesale segment. The furniture firm points to a boost in both international shipments and retail segment shipments for the gains. Net income increased some 32%, as well, during the reporting period -- from $32.5 million to $42.9 million.

   Despite the economic downturn and stalled home building of late, the furniture maker and retailer has continued to focus on rolling out new product lines and boosting its TV presence to pique the interest of existing and new customers. As a result, the company's marketing efforts have spurred an increase in incoming retail orders. By introducing the American Artisan collection and investing in a timely manner in TV ads, Ethan Allen has been able to head off bigger woes. Indeed, Ethan Allen spent $29.4 million on advertising in fiscal 2014, down slightly from its $29.8 million ad spend in 2013. Specifically, prepaid advertising costs were $600,000 in 2014 as compared to $1.6 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Theodore Baumritter and his brother-in-law, Nathan Ancell, founded the Baumritter Corp. in 1932 to sell housewares. It moved into manufacturing in 1936 when the partners bought a furniture factory. Focusing on Early American furniture, the company created its own market by franchising stores. By the mid-1960s Baumritter had about 700 furniture stores in North America, Europe, and Australia. Baumritter retired in 1970, and the firm changed its name to Ethan Allen Industries in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ethan Allen was acquired by Interco in 1979, and sales nearly tripled in the next eight years. Farooq Kathwari, a political refugee from the Kashmir region of India, became CEO in 1988. The next year a management group headed by Kathwari bought Ethan Allen from Interco and created Ethan Allen Interiors as its holding company. Kathwari reorganized the company, closing seven factories and many underperforming stores, launching a major makeover to appeal to younger buyers, and transforming it into a source for a variety of home furnishings and accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going public in 1993 helped free the company of its LBO debt. In 1996 Ethan Allen focused on its overseas markets, opening five stores in Asia. The company's sales were strong in 1997 as a result of its new products, including its modular home office EA Organizer unit. Ethan Allen unveiled E.A. Kids, a line of children's furniture, in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ethan Allen's Web site started selling home accessories in 2000 and expanded its offerings to furniture shortly thereafter. That year the company introduced EA Elements and Horizons, two lines of furniture designed to reflect the casual lifestyle at more affordable prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Swedish Home, a blend of American and European designs, hit the retail network. Later in the year Ethan Allen formed agreements with Markor Furniture International and MFI Furniture Group to develop chains of retail stores in China and the UK, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2002 the first (of five intended to debut in Europe) Ethan Allen store opened in Surrey, England. In December 2002 the second European store opened in the suburb of Bromley, England. That month Ethan Allen opened its first store in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ethan Allen restructured its operations in 2005 into Ethan Allen Global (marketing and financial), Ethan Allen Operations (sourcing and logistics), and Ethan Allen Retail (retail stores).
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2007 the company acquired a 40,000-square-foot cut and sew leather manufacturing plant in Silao, Mexico to add to its upholstery making division.
