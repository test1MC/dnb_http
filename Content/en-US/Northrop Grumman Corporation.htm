   Northrop Grumman defends its high place in the defense sector. As one of the world's top military contractors (behind
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   ), the company operates through four business sectors:
   <company id="138618">
    Aerospace Systems
   </company>
   (aircraft, spacecraft, laser systems, electronic subsystems);
   <company id="111537">
    Electronic Systems
   </company>
   (radar, sensors, chemical detection, countermeasure systems);
   <company id="138315">
    Information Systems
   </company>
   (C4ISR, or command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance); and Technical Services (systems support, training and simulation). The US government represents most of Northrop Grumman's sales.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Northrop Grumman owns or leases about 35 million sq. ft. of floor space at some 500 separate locations, primarily in the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Northrop Grumman operates through four segments. Aerospace Systems contributes about 39% of its sales, while Electronic Systems and Information Systems segment accounted for about 27% and 23%, respectively, in 2015. The remainder of revenue comes from its Technical Services segment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves domestic and international defense, civil and commercial customers. The US government accounted for 83% of its 2015 revenues. Outside the US, the company follows direct commercial sales with governments and markets its products through television advertisements.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Northrop Grumman's revenues have been slumping since 2011. In 2015 revenue decreased by 2% fueled by a 5% decline in the Information Systems segment. This segment experienced declines as the result of lower volumes of Command and Control (C2) programs caused by in-theater force reductions and civil programs primarily due to the restructuring of an Emergency Communications Transformation Program Stage II contract.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electronic Systems declined by 2% in 2015 due to lower sales on Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance &amp; Targeting (AISR&amp;T) Systems and Land &amp; Self Protection Systems (L&amp;SPS). The decline in L&amp;SPS was attributed to in-theater force reductions and ramp-downs on an international program.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company's net income fell 4% due to a rise in general, selling, and administrative expenses. That year, Northrop Grumman's operating cash flows also decreased by 17%.

  <p>
   The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and resulting military spending, buoyed results for Northrop Grumman and other military contractors, but as the US draws down its overseas defense presence and reduces its military budget more generally, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to serve the defense department's new focuses. The company's outlook anticipates increased military emphasis in such areas as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, cyber warfare, long-range strike, directed-energy applications, missile defense, and satellite communications systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a strategic reorganization, in 2015 Northrop Grumman realigned its Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting Systems division (ISR&amp;TSD) to expand its focus on its growing airborne and space ISR business. The former ISR&amp;TSD is being reorganized into two separate divisions: Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance Reconnaissance and Targeting Systems; and Space Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance Systems. The realignment will position the company for a portfolio of future growth opportunities in both the airborne and space markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company broke ground on a new $20 million Maryland Space Assembly and Test facility at its engineering and manufacturing complex in Linthicum, which will allow for expanded space payload production to meet growth in Northrop Grumman's space business. That year it also expanded its Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence, in Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company entered into an agreement with
   <company id="105872">
    Bell Helicopter
   </company>
   , to supply its LCR-100 Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) for the Bell 412 helicopter through 2017. It also received a $306 million contract to continue logistics and sustainment services on the high altitude, long endurance (HALE) RQ-4 Global Hawk remotely piloted autonomous unmanned aircraft intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company established a new company, the Northrop Grumman Australia, to develop a regional hub for the Indo-Pacific region in Australia.

   Jack Northrop co-founded Lockheed Aircraft in 1927 and designed its record-setting Vega monoplane. He founded two more companies -- Avion Corporation (formed in 1928 and bought by United Aircraft and Transportation) and Northrop Corporation (formed in 1932 with Douglas Aircraft, which absorbed it in 1938) -- before founding Northrop Aircraft in California in 1939.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Northrop produced the P-61 fighter and the famous Flying Wing bomber, which failed to win a production contract. In the 1950s Northrop depended heavily on F-89 fighter and Snark missile sales. When Thomas Jones succeeded Jack Northrop as president (1959), he moved the company away from risky prime contracts in favor of numerous subcontracts and bought Page Communications Engineers (telecommunications, 1959) and Hallicrafters (electronics, 1966) to reduce its dependence on government contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1970s Northrop was hit with a bribery scandal and the disclosure of illegal payments to Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign fund; Jones was eventually fined for an illegal contribution. As a result, a shareholder lawsuit forced Jones to resign as president (he was allowed to remain as chairman). In 1981 the company won the B-2 bomber contract. Jones retired as chairman in late 1990, and under the leadership of Kent Kresa (who became CEO in early 1990 and chairman when Jones retired), Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts related to fudging test results on some government projects; it was fined $17 million. In a related shareholders' suit, Northrop paid $18 million in damages in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Northrop and
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   bought LTV's Vought Aircraft Industries (now named
   <company id="103867">
    Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division
   </company>
   ) in 1992. In 1994 it paid $2.1 billion for
   <company id="54393">
    Grumman Corporation
   </company>
   , a premier electronic systems firm and manufacturer of fighter aircraft for the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   , and changed its name to Northrop Grumman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1929 Roy Grumman, Jake Swirbul, and Bill Schwendler founded Grumman; within three months it had a contract to design a Navy fighter. Grumman completed its first commercial aircraft (the Grumman Goose) in 1937 and went public in 1938. It soared during WWII on the wings of its Wildcat and Hellcat fighter planes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grumman built its first corporate jet (Gulfstream) in 1958, and began work on the Lunar Module for the Apollo space program in 1963. It was near bankruptcy during the 1970s due to costs related to its F-14 Tomcat fighter. Grumman rebuilt its military business in the 1980s and achieved its greatest success in electronic systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The UK Ministry of Defence awarded a $279 million contract to Northrop Grumman in 1995 to develop and produce a system to counter infrared missiles. In 1997 Northrop Grumman bought Logicon (information and battle-management systems). It then agreed to an $11.6 billion purchase by Lockheed Martin, but the US government, citing concerns about increased lack of competition in the defense industry, blocked the deal in 1998. As a result, Northrop Grumman began a restructuring that cut 10,500 defense and aircraft jobs and added 2,500 positions to its Logicon subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Northrop Grumman bought the information systems division of California Microwave for $93 million and Allegheny Teledyne's Ryan Aeronautical (aerial drones) for $140 million. The next year Northrop Grumman sold its underperforming commercial aerostructures business to The Carlyle Group in a $1.2 billion transaction in order to focus on its growing defense electronics and information technology segments. Later in 2000 Northrop Grumman acquired
   <company id="11836">
    Comptek Research
   </company>
   and bought Federal Data (information systems for the US government) from Carlyle in a transaction valued at $302 million. Pension income that year accounted for more than $500 million (about 55%) of the company's pretax profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company completed the deal to acquire
   <company id="10902">
    Litton Industries
   </company>
   for $3.8 billion, plus $1.3 billion in debt. In the fall Northrop Grumman acquired the electronics and information unit of Aerojet-General Corp., a subsidiary of GenCorp (later renamed
   <company id="10626">
    Aerojet Rocketdyne
   </company>
   ) for about $300 million (it became Grumman's Space Systems Division). While its wallet was open, the company agreed to match the $2.6 billion that General Dynamics had agreed to pay for submarine and aircraft carrier builder
   <company id="52848">
    Newport News
   </company>
   -- a move that the
   <company id="105717">
    US Defense Department
   </company>
   endorsed. In December Honeywell agreed to pay Northrop Grumman $440 million to settle an antitrust and patent infringement lawsuit that Litton had filed against Honeywell in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal to buy Newport News was completed in early 2002. Northrop Grumman then made a hostile $6 billion bid for conglomerate
   <company id="11434">
    TRW
   </company>
   when TRW's stock plunged following the sudden departure of its CEO David Cote to
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   . In the wake of Northrop Grumman's spurned initial bid,
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40681">
    BAE SYSTEMS
   </company>
   made offers for TRW's aerospace and defense assets. Finally, though, TRW accepted a sweetened $7.8 billion offer from Northrop Grumman in July 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition fortified Northrop Grumman's position in military satellites, missile systems, and systems integration. In fact, Northrop signed a consent decree with the
   <company id="150279">
    US Justice Department
   </company>
   in which the company agreed (under pain of fines) that it wouldn't take unfair advantage of its exclusive position when selling certain components -- such as satellite sensors -- to competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   TRW's Systems unit became Northrop Grumman Mission Systems; TRW's Space and Electronics unit was later known as Northrop Grumman Space Technology. As for TRW's car parts business, Northrop sold all but 19.6% of the unit to
   <company id="43093">
    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   for about $4.7 billion to pay down debt; by early 2005 Northrop reduced its stake to 9.9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2003, Kresa stepped down as president and CEO, and Ronald Sugar took over those roles; Sugar added the chairmanship to his title when Kresa retired in October.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among Northrop's 2004 contracts were $1.04 billion for X-47B Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems, $1.2 billion (preferred bidder) for E-3D AWACS contract support, and $1.4 billion for the CVN 21 generation aircraft carrier. The company also split an $8.4 billion submarine contract with
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2005 Northrop sold 7.2 million shares of its
   <company id="106099">
    TRW Automotive
   </company>
   stake, raising more than $142 million and reducing its stake to 9.9%. It also acquired
   <company id="109244">
    Integic Corporation
   </company>
   , an IT company that specialized in business process management and enterprise health applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Northrop Grumman established Northrop Grumman Technical Services (NGTS) as a separate sector; it was tasked with consolidating Northrop's logistics operations across its various sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late that same year Northrop Grumman agreed to buy Essex Corporation -- a provider of signal, image, and information processing for defense and intelligence customers in the US. The deal was valued at about $580 million, including the assumption of debt. The deal was completed early in 2007, and Essex became a part of Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (now
   <company id="138315">
    Northrop Grumman Information Systems
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company shed its Electro-Optical Systems business (night vision and applied optics products) to
   <company id="89493">
    L-3 Communications
   </company>
   for $175 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Northrop Grumman sold its Advisory Services Division comprising subsidiary TASC (engineering and consulting services to the US military and state governments) to private equities
   <company id="104982">
    General Atlantic LLC
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   for $1.65 billion. The sale brings Northrop Grumman into compliance with a new federal law that strengthens conflict of interest rules for defense contractors that both sell to, and provide consulting for, the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its aerospace and information capabilities, the company purchased Sonoma Photonics and assets from Swift Engineering's Killer Bee Unmanned Air Systems lineup for its Aerospace Systems sector (2009). The deal followed its acquisition of 3001 International for $92 million (a nearly three times larger investment) in 2008. The Virginia-based geospatial data collection and analysis provider not only bolstered Northrop Grumman's military offerings, but it also reeled in a host of new civilian customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 Northrop Grumman settled two decade-old lawsuits with the US government. It agreed to pay $325 million to resolve allegations that it provided defective military satellite parts to the
   <company id="150706">
    National Reconnaissance Office
   </company>
   . The second lawsuit was filed by Northrop Grumman against the US government for uncompensated costs incurred as a result of the cancellation of the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile program.
  </p>
  <p>
   To concentrate more on its core areas, Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding business under former subsidiary
   <company id="52848">
    Huntington Ingalls Industries
   </company>
   in 2011. Despite modest increases in year-over-year revenues, the shipbuilding sector had struggled to regain profitability after suffering a loss in 2008, attributable to absorbing most of the company's goodwill impairment charge. Also in 2011 the company reduced operations in other segments. It sold its Viper Strike laser-guided bomb operations in Alabama to European consortium MBDA for an undisclosed amount. And it lowered its participation in the National Security Technologies joint venture that manages and operates the Nevada National Security Site.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on increasing its presence in the Asia/Pacific, in 2012 Northrop Grumman purchased M5 Network Security, a provider of cyber security and secure mobile communications technology, based in Australia.
