   A good diagnosis for disease detection, integrated care, and wellness is key to the business model of MGC Diagnostics Corporation, formerly Angeion. Through subsidiary Medical Graphics Corporation, the company designs and sells cardiorespiratory diagnostic systems that analyze lung function and diagnose disease using a patient's breath. It sells systems under the MedGraphics brand to health care providers. The non-invasive MedGraphics devices analyze a patient's inhaled and exhaled breath to help detect emphysema, asthma, and heart disease, among other things. Researchers also use MedGraphics' products in clinical trial studies.

  <p>
   MedGraphics-branded products are sold primarily to hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices. They include a personal computer, full color monitor, printer, and other peripherals needed to operate the systems. Just like with its consumer-oriented New Leaf products, MGC Diagnostics has tailored its MedGraphics offerings to meet increasing demand for portability from its end-users by including internet-based technologies that provide for remote processing and communications. Such remote-based applications, known as telemedicine, are widely becoming standard practice among health care providers who want to expand access to care without having to build new practices or hire additional physicians.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also offers electronic health record (EHR) interfaces that allow its products to be used with EHRs in hospitals and clinics. By offering the interfaces, MGC Diagnostics gains a foothold in a market that is guaranteed to expand, thanks to the federal government's requirement that health care providers implement EHRs by 2015 in order to receive reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid.
  </p>
  <p>
   MGC Diagnostics' products include fitness applications designed to be used with iPads, iPhones, or the iPod touch to monitor fitness levels based on users' personal metabolic assessment results.

  <p>
   Though MGC Diagnostics sells its products in about 60 countries around the world, the bulk of its sales are made in the US (about 80%). Its products are sold through a direct sales force at home and through a network of distributors abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company works with some of the largest group purchasing organizations (GPO) in the country, including the Government Services Administration, the procurement agency for the US government. GPO business accounts for about half of MGC's revenue.

  <p>
   MGC Diagnostics reported a 17% revenue increase in 2013 primarily stemming from growth in its product and services businesses. Domestically, GPOs increased their purchases while international growth was driven by higher sales in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of net losses, in 2013 MGC reported a net income of $1.4 million after a previous loss of about that amount. The change was due to higher revenue combined with lower R&amp;D and amortization expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations spiked to $2.5 million in 2013 from less than $1 million the prior year as the company did a better job of collecting accounts quicker and it collected $2.7 million in deferred revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's intention is to grow revenues at a rate that outpaces the market as a whole. To that end, it has been focusing on stealing accounts from the competition, which lead to increased sales in 2013. It has also been pushing longer service agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company (as Angeion) launched a rebranding initiative that culminated in changing its name to MGC Diagnostics Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash and refocus on its core products, in 2012 the company sold its New Leaf line of products (used by fitness professionals to create and monitor weight management programs, as well as measure calorie consumption, general fitness, and athletic performance) to

    Life Time Fitness
   </company>
   for $1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company launched MGC Diagnostics Australia to enable the company to better communicate to its Australian customers. It also introduced Ascencia Pty. Limited as its Service and Support Partner for the region.

  <p>
   In 2014 MGC acquired Belgian diagnostics maker Medisoft SA. The purchase makes MGC a leader in the global cardio-respiratory diagnostics market.

  <p>
   The company was formed as Angeion, a contract manufacturer, in 1986. Two years later it merged with Verde Ventures and became a public company.
