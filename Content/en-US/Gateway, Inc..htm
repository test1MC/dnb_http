   While Acer doesn't break out Gateway's financial performance, the company in 2012 slashed the book worth of its PC brands (including Gateway, Packard Bell, eMachines, and e-Ten) by some $120 million, wiping out its profit for the year. Apparently, Acer's purchase of Gateway (in 2007) for $710 million is foundering amid intense competition and the dramatic downturn in PC sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Gateway and rival PC makers are struggling with the downturn in PC sales, as consumer preference has migrated to notebooks, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Falling demand from China, a big market for PCs, is also impacting Gateway's and parent Acer's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep pace with advancing technology, Gateway in 2013 launched a new back-to-school line of notebooks, desktops and displays designed to deliver performance at an affordable price. In 2011 the company restyled its desktop and laptop, as it did the previous year, while adding improved CPU's and graphics processors.

  <p>
   Apparently college and billion-dollar PC businesses don't mix. Like his main competitor, Michael Dell, Ted Waitt dropped out of college to get into the computer business. Waitt had gone to Des Moines, Iowa, to see his roommates' band one weekend. He met a friend who was working for a computer retailer, liked the sound of the job, and left school to go to work. After nine months, he quit to start his own company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using his grandmother's certificate of deposit as collateral, Waitt borrowed $10,000 and in 1985 set up shop in the South Dakota barn of his father, a fourth-generation cattleman. There, with his brother Norm and friend Mike Hammond, he founded the TIPC Network, which sold add-on parts by phone for
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   ' PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Waitt's goal was to sell PCs himself, and in 1987 the three men jumped into the fray. Waitt and Hammond put together a fully configured computer system at a price that was near what other companies were charging for a bare-bones system. Sales took off. The next year they changed the enterprise's name to Gateway 2000 to express the belief that their computers were the gateway to the 21st century.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's customers were savvy buyers willing to dig through catalogs to find the best price for the exact system they wanted, and much of Gateway's success was rooted in Waitt's ability to predict which standard features would sell.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway distinguished itself from competitors with eye-catching ads. Some featured cows and another depicted Waitt dressed as Robin Hood. He wanted to convince potential customers that Gateway would be around in the future to service the computers it sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Gateway moved to North Sioux City, South Dakota. Two years later it introduced a line of notebook computers and created a division to handle component add-ons. Gateway went public in 1993 and opened a manufacturing facility in Ireland. In 1994 it added retail showrooms in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway expanded into Australia in 1995 when it purchased 80% of the country's largest computer maker. Gateway introduced a cross between a PC and a big-screen television (called a PCTV) in 1996 and opened two US retail showrooms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Waitt, balking at the thought of his staff becoming subordinate to
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   's management, rejected a $7 billion takeover bid from the PC giant. Also in 1997 Gateway acquired server maker Advanced Logic Research (ALR) and the patent rights to the venerated Amiga, one of the industry's most resilient, graphics-fueled PCs. (Gateway sold off the Amiga PC assets in 1999.) Inventory excesses and a charge for the ALR buy caused earnings to decline in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway dropped the "2000" from its name in 1998 to avoid appearing behind the times as the millennium approached, and moved its headquarters to San Diego. In a bolder move that year,
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   agreed to let Gateway customize Windows 98 to promote its own Internet service (Gateway.net) over the services of Microsoft-connected providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway in 1999 expanded its Web presence by investing in Internet sales specialist NECX to create an online peripheral and software store. Later in 1999 America Online (now
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   ) made an $800 million investment in Gateway that stipulated a deal for the online services giant to run Gateway.net. As 1999 ended, so did Waitt's reign as CEO -- but not as chairman. He turned over the CEO duties to company president and
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   veteran Jeff Weitzen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000
   <company id="10222">
    OfficeMax
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   agreed to sell Gateway products. At the beginning of 2001 Gateway reduced its workforce by 10% and moved its headquarters to Poway, California, when an industry-wide sales slowdown led to heavy losses. Gateway also overhauled its management team, a move that included the departure of Weitzen. Waitt returned to the helm as CEO of a greatly reduced staff. Gateway then began closing many of its Gateway Country stores in North America. It also phased out its Internet service, Gateway.net. In a second round of restructuring that year, Gateway  cut its workforce by about a quarter worldwide and shut down its international operations. Despite its increased focus on domestic operations, Gateway also closed or consolidated stores, reduced its US call centers, and closed its Salt Lake City manufacturing plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway acquired competitor
   <company id="58942">
    eMachines
   </company>
   in a 2004 cash-and-stock deal valued at approximately $235 million. Following the acquisition Gateway overhauled its management team. The merger expanded Gateway's distribution channels, providing access to large electronics retailers such as
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56992">
    Circuit City
   </company>
   , where eMachines was entrenched. eMachines CEO Wayne Inouye took over as CEO of Gateway when the deal closed; Waitt retained his chairmanship. Following the eMachines acquisition, Gateway closed all of the remaining locations, cutting about 2,500 jobs. A number of other former eMachines executives joined the Gateway management team after the acquisition, and Gateway moved its headquarters to Orange County, California, where eMachines was based. By the end of 2004, Gateway had a workforce of about 1,900 -- or 75% fewer than the year before.
  </p>
  <p>
   Waitt stepped down as chairman in 2005. The next year Inouye resigned and chairman Richard Snyder was named interim CEO. Later in 2006 Edward Coleman, a veteran of
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   , was named CEO; Snyder retained his chairmanship.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gateway sold its corporate-focused Professional unit to
   <company id="132766">
    MPC
   </company>
   for $90 million in 2007. That year Gateway was acquired by Taiwan-based
   <company id="42451">
    Acer
   </company>
   for $710 million. An executive from Acer, Rudi Schmidleithner, was tapped to take over Coleman's responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the acquisition by Acer came a shift in Gateway's business model. The company once specialized in direct sales over the phone and through its Web site. In 2008 it abandoned its direct sales model and began offering its products through channels including electronics stores, wholesale clubs, discount stores, office supply chains, e-tailers, and home shopping networks, bringing it more in line with Acer's sales model.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Gateway acquired European PC maker Packard Bell in a deal financed by Acer.
