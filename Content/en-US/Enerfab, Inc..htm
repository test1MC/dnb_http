   A major component in the company's growth has been the production of pollution control equipment that Enerfab markets to utility companies across the midwestern US. It was helped in 2011 by new rules finalized by the
   <company id="130205">
    US Environmental Protection Agency
   </company>
   calling for new pollution control investments by 2015. As a result of the new rules, Enerfab expects to generate up to $1 billion in revenue between 2013 and 2016. Its pollution control systems division generates about a third of Enerfab's revenue, and the company expects that amount to grow to over 50% over the next four years as utilities adhere to government standards and demand more of its products.

   Enerfab was founded in 1901 as The Bishopric Products Company to serve the brewing industry. Following Prohibition, the company began to make resinous, food-grade coatings and tank linings.
