   As a rule, Mars likes to stay out of the press and maintains a virtually debt-free business, using its profits for expansion. The company operates through six segments: Chocolate, Drinks, Food, Petcare, Wrigley, and Symbioscience.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars Chocolate, based in Mount Olive, New Jersey, operates across more than 20 countries and counts five billion-dollar global brands: M&amp;M's, Snickers, Dove/Galaxy, Mars/Milky Way, and Twix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars Drinks operates throughout North America, Europe, and Asia with a portfolio of five brands: Klix, Flavia, Alterra, The Bright Tea Co., and Dove/Galaxy hot chocolate. It boasts a US headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and a UK office in Basingstoke.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars Food, based in Brussels, Belgium, consists of about a dozen brands that are available in more than 28 countries. The unit's billion-dollar brand -- Uncle Ben's (rice) -- is more than 50 years old. The segment also has several other brands: Dolmio, Masterfoods, Seeds of Change, Ebly, Royco, Kan Tong, Suzi Wan, and Raris. The business includes Mars Foodservices, which is focused on making brands available through foodservice channels the likes of restaurants, schools, hotels, hospitals, and other out-of-home outlets. The food business boasts 11 manufacturing sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars Petcare, based in Brussels, Belgium, spans 50 countries and includes more than 40 brands, with billion-dollar brands such as Pedigree, Whiskas, and Royal Canin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chicago-based Wrigley is a top global gum and confections maker, operating in 50 countries with a portfolio of more than 40 brands and two billion-dollar brands: Extra and Orbit. Other brands include Doublemint, Life Savers, Skittles, 5, and Starburst. Altoids, Juicy Fruit, and Wrigley's Spearmint are each more than 100-year-old brand names. It distributes products in more than 180 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars Symbioscience, with brands CocoaVia, Wisdom Panel, and Seramis, operates in three countries from its headquarters in Germantown, Maryland. The health and life sciences operation consists of Mars Botanical, Mars Veterinary, and Mars Plantcare.
  </p>
  <p>
   Five principles provide a foundation for Mars. Defining its culture and the way the company conducts business is quality, responsibility, mutuality, efficiency, and freedom. These principles, the company says, unite its geographies, languages, cultures, and generations.

  <p>
   Mars opened its first new chocolate plant in 35 years in 2014 near Topeka, Kansas. The new $270-million facility will help to meet growing US demand for Snickers candy bars and M&amp;M's. As part of its ongoing strategy, the company leverages the strength of existing brands to launch products that are extensions of popular core products. Indeed, Mars has been lured by the trend of sweet-and-savory foods by launching a M&amp;M's with salted pretzel centers called M&amp;M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies. The company has further expanded its M&amp;M's brand with limited varieties, such as its coconut M&amp;M's and flavors that tie into big-screen movies. The candy brand, first launched in the 1940s, boasts a service for consumers to create their own custom M&amp;M's with phrases and photos. Building on this service, Mars in 2011 rolled out a similar product named MyExtra for its Wrigley gum that allows consumers to customize wrappers on Extra gum packs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mars has held its own in the confectionery sector against international rivals the likes of
   <company id="41815">
    Nestle
   </company>
   by inking its fair share of sweet deals. The candy company's savvy takeover of chewing gum giant Wrigley (valued at some $23 billion) in 2008 brought together a pair of iconic US companies, both of which already had a substantial worldwide presence. Indeed, Mars has greatly expanded its product lineup with such well-known brands as Altoids, Life Savers, and Creme Savers, along with the best-selling chewing gum names Spearmint, Juicy Fruit, Doublemint, and a host of others. Together, the companies also flex increased global marketing and distribution muscle, as well as cost-savings in manufacturing and raw materials, given its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the candy company counts on consumers who need sugar fixes, Mars also caters to canines. The company has taken a large bite of the pet food market with its
   <company id="99428">
    Royal Canin
   </company>
   , Pedigree, and Whiskas brands. As a strategic add-on business, the company's Pedigree brand peddles a product called Wisdom Panel, which is a DNA test kit for dogs that determines the pet's breed mix.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In early 2017 Mars agreed to acquire veterinary care chain
   <company id="15422">
    VCA Inc.
   </company>
   for $9.1 billion, including $1.4 billion in debt. Upon approval of the deal, VCA will become part of Mars Petcare, which operates veterinary companies Banfield Pet Hospital and Bluepearl and manufactures pet food brands
   <company id="99428">
    Royal Canin
   </company>
   , Pedigree, and Whiskas. The acquisition serves to strengthen Mars' dominant market presence in the thriving pet care industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The previous year, Mars Chocolate bought Turin, a manufacturer of high-quality chocolates in Mexico. Turin owns iconic brands including CONEJOS, EXOTICAS, HUEVITOS, CEREZAS, and TURIN Specialty Chocolates. The deal is aimed at creating growth in the Mexican chocolate category.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a bid to grow its pet food business, Mars in August 2014 acquired the IAMS, Eukanuba, and Natura brands in North America and Latin America (and other select countries) from
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   for $2.9 billion. The company plans to exercise its option to purchase P&amp;G's pet food business in parts of Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Frank Mars invented the Milky Way candy bar in 1923 after his previous three efforts at the candy business left him bankrupt. After his estranged son, Forrest, graduated from Yale, Mars hired him to work at his candy operation. When Forrest demanded one-third control of the company and Frank refused, Forrest moved to England with the foreign rights to Milky Way and started his own company (Food Manufacturers) in the 1930s. He made a sweeter version of Milky Way for the UK, calling it a Mars bar. Forrest also ventured into pet food with the 1934 purchase of Chappel Brothers (renamed Pedigree). At one point he controlled 55% of the British pet food market.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Forrest returned to the US and introduced Uncle Ben's rice (the world's first brand-name raw commodity) and M&amp;M's (a joint venture between Forrest and Bruce Murrie, son of
   <company id="10722">
    Hershey
   </company>
   's then-president). The idea for M&amp;M's was borrowed from British Smarties, for which Forrest obtained rights (from Rowntree Mackintosh) by relinquishing similar rights to the Snickers bar in some foreign markets. The ad slogan "Melts in your mouth, not in your hand" (and the candy's success in non-air-conditioned stores and war zones) made the company an industry leader. Mars introduced M&amp;M's Peanut in 1954. It was one of the first candy companies to sponsor a television show --
   <i>
    Howdy Doody
   </i>
   in the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Forrest merged his firm with his deceased father's company in 1964, after buying his dying half-sister's controlling interest. (He renamed the business Mars at her request.) The merger was the end of an alliance with Hershey, who had supplied Frank with chocolate since his Milky Way inception.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1968 Mars bought Kal Kan. In 1973 Forrest, then 69 years old, delegated his company responsibilities to sons Forrest Jr. and John. Five years later the brothers, looking for snacks to offset the dwindling candy sales market resulting from a more diet-conscious America, bought the Twix chocolate-covered cookie brand. During the late 1980s they bought ice-cream bar maker Dove Bar International and Ethel-M Chocolates, producer of liqueur-flavored chocolates, a business their father had begun in his retirement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hershey in 1988 surpassed Mars as the largest candy maker in the US when it acquired Mounds, Almond Joy, and other US brands from Cadbury (now part of
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   ). In response to the success of Hershey's Symphony Bar, Mars introduced its dark-chocolate Dove bar in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Hershey chose to stick close to home, Mars ventured abroad. The company entered the huge confectionery market of India in 1989 by building a $10 million factory there. In 1996 the company opened a confectionery processing plant in Brazil. Back home, the company expanded its Starburst candy line in 1996 and in 1997 launched new ad campaigns, including M&amp;M's spots featuring a trio of animated M&amp;M candies. Mars introduced Uncle Ben's Rice Bowl meals in the late 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Forrest Sr. died in 1999, spurring rumors that Mars would go public or be sold. Instead, the company dismantled most of its sales force, opting to use less-costly food brokers. Forrest Jr. retired the same year, leaving brother John Franklyn as president and CEO. Still far behind its rival, Mars received a modest boost in US market share when Hershey experienced computer troubles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company established a subsidiary, Effem India, to market Mars products in India. That year the company began making an energy bar, Snickers Marathon. Mars acquired French pet-food producer Royal Canin in 2003. Its Mexican subsidiary, Effem México SA de CV, merged that year with Mexican confectioner Grupo Matre to form a partnership to produce candy for Hispanic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquired Japanese vending machine parts manufacturer Nippon Conlux in 2003. The deal was Mars' first takeover venture in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving into the drink sector, in 2004 Mars licensed its Milky Way, Starburst, and 3 Musketeers brands to
   <company id="104562">
    Bravo!
   </company>
   , which uses the brand names to market vitamin-enhanced milk drinks using the brand names. That year the company appointed co-presidents, Peter Cheney and Paul Michaels, leaving John Franklyn Mars as chairman. Cheney retired in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to public concerns about healthy eating, Mars started phasing out its "king size" candy bars in 2005. Mars also jumped on the "chocolate as health food" bandwagon that year, introducing CocoaVia, a line of confections containing flavanols, which are said to have antioxidant qualities, and plant sterols, which the company claims is good for hearts and arteries. Unlike Mars' other products, the CocoaVia line is shelved in the health-food section at food retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold off its payment-processing subsidiary, MEI Conlux (which has headquarters in Pennsylvania and Japan) in 2006 to investment firms
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   and Advantage Partners for more than $500 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding to its fast-growing pet-products sector, in 2006 Mars purchased dog-treat manufacturer S&amp;M Nu Tec, maker of Greenies, a bone-shaped treat with a toothbrush on one end that is a hot item in the pet-product market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still barking up the pet-product tree, Mars acquired private-label dry pet food manufacturer
   <company id="57340">
    Doane Pet Care Company
   </company>
   that year as well. Doane's products are sold in the US and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company discontinued brands in 2006, including Pop'ables and Aquadrops Mints, for an estimated $300 million savings, which it invested in advertising. The company introduced new Dove varieties and a dark chocolate version of M&amp;M's that year as well.
