   BAE Systems helped win the Battle of Britain in 1940 with its Spitfire and Mosquito fighters; today it is a leading military contractor and major foreign player in the US defense market. BAE's main operating groups -- cyber security, financial crime, communications intelligence, and digital transformation -- provide products and services that include electro-optical sensors, flight controls, commercial and financial security, ship repair and modernization, and aircraft. BAE's fighter aircraft include the Hawk, Tornado, and the next-generation Eurofighter Typhoon. North America is BAE's biggest market (maintained by

   ), with the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   (DoD) its largest single customer.

  <p>
   The company is based in the UK and has 40 offices serving clients across the UK and Europe, the Americas, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. The US contributed 39% of its net sales in 2014.

  <p>
   BAE's largest customers are governments, but it also sells to large prime contractors and commercial businesses. About 45% of its sales are services-related contracts that are typically longer term.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BAE's revenues decreased from 2013 to 2014 due to volume reductions within its land and armaments business. The company was also affected by unfavorable foreign exchange translations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits increased by Â£576 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a decrease in taxation expenses and a decline in the impairment of intangible assets due to performance issues in the US commercial shipbuilding market.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Amid sharp reductions in defense spending in both of the company's biggest markets, the US and UK, BAE Systems has launched a strategy that, besides focusing on electronics and cyber and intelligence, includes developing more export business to support its platforms segments and expanding its operations internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   In regards to the US market, in late 2014 BAE for $233 million acquired Perimeter Internetworking Corp., which trades as SilverSky, a commercial cyber service provider. SilverSky is a commercial cyber services and compliance provider, headquartered in New York, with operations in the US and the Philippines.

  <p>
   Post-Wright brothers and pre-WWII, a host of aviation companies sprang up to serve the British Empire -- too many to survive after the war, when the empire contracted. Parliament took steps in 1960 to save the industry by merging companies to form larger, stronger entities -- Hawker-Siddeley Aviation and British Aircraft Corporation (BAC).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hawker-Siddeley, made up of aircraft and missiles divisions, was created by combining A.V. Roe, Gloster Aircraft, Hawker Aircraft, Armstrong Whitworth, and Folland Aircraft. It attained fame in the 1960s for developing the Harrier "jump jet."
  </p>
  <p>
   BAC was formed from the merger of Bristol Aeroplane, English Electric, and Vicker-Armstrong. In 1962 it joined France's Aerospatiale to build the supersonic Concorde and became a partner in ventures to develop the Tornado and Jaguar fighters. The cost of these ventures, plus the commercial failure of the Concorde, was more than the company could bear. Realizing British aviation was again in trouble, the British government nationalized BAC and Hawker-Siddeley in 1976 and merged them in 1977 with Scottish Aviation to form British Aerospace (BAe).
