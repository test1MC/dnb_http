   Clariant Corp.'s operations represent eight of the parent company's 10 global business units. Its additives business distributes both additives and pigments. Additives are used in several plastic and paint products to help resist heat, light, and weather elements. The unit provides flame retardants, waxes, and polymer additives for use in plastics, coatings, and other applications.

   Detergents and intermediates are used as raw materials to produce detergents, household cleaners, and chemical intermediates. Industrial and consumer specialties provide chemicals for consumer care and industrial markets. The company's Mount Holly plant west of Charlotte, North Carolina, manufactures chemicals for both business units.

   Clariant's masterbatches unit produces dye and additive concentrates and composites for the plastics industry. Masterbatches facilities in North America make products for use in a wide range of markets, including automotive, packaging for the personal care and cosmetic industries, and electrical connectors. It is one of the few companies in the US that offers master plaques, or plastic sheets made in precise colors, for major auto manufacturers.

   Clariant AG's strategy for growth focuses on broader expansion into the emerging markets of Brazil, China, and India.

It plans to increase investments in technology and make targeted acquisitions to strengthen its existing product pipeline.

   In 2015 the parent company invested $170 million in North America, primarily in its two biggest growth areas - Oil &amp; Mining Services and Catalysts.

   As part of Clariant AG's growth strategy for North America, it acquired Canadian oil services company Prairie Petro-Chem in 2011. The addition enhanced Clariant's presence in the Bakken Shale, which is one of the largest oil and gas producing regions in North America. Prairie Petro-Chem serves more than 7,000 oilfield sites. The Canadian company is part of the oil and mining services unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the parent company expanded its North American operations in the de-icing market by acquiring New York-based Octagon Process. Clariant, already a leading supplier of de-icers for aircraft and runways in Europe, added Octagon for its infrastructure and logistics network. The company will supply aircraft de-icing and anti-icing fluids to the North American market. It also will supply Clariant's de-icing products for runways.
