   Bleach is the cornerstone of Clorox. The company's namesake household cleaning products are world leaders, but the Clorox business reaches far beyond bleach. While it makes laundry and cleaning items (Formula 409, Pine-Sol, Green Works), its vast products portfolio extends into dressings/sauces (Hidden Valley, KC Masterpiece), plastic wrap and containers (Glad), cat litters (Fresh Step, Scoop Away), and infection control items (HealthLink, Aplicare, Soy Vay). Other items include filtration systems (Brita, in the Americas), charcoal briquettes (Kingsford, Match Light), and natural personal care items (

   ). Clorox makes and sells its products worldwide.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company makes its products in more than two dozen countries, primarily in the Americas, and markets them in more than 100 countries. Clorox generates 17% of its revenue from non-US operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates two dozen manufacturing facilities in North America and another 15 manufacturing facilities abroad. Clorox also leases six regional distribution centers in North America and operates several warehouse facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   It owns a research and development facility located at its plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and also conducts R&amp;D activities and engineering research in leased facilities in Meriden, Connecticut; Kennesaw, Georgia.; Willowbrook, Illinois; Midland, Michigan; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Durham, North Carolina.

   The bleach maker organizes its company into four strategic business units: cleaning (33% of fiscal 2016 sales, ending June), household (33%), international (17%), and lifestyle (17%). Cleaning consists of laundry, home care, and professional products that are marketed and sold in the US. Household comprises charcoal, cat litter, plastic bags, wraps, container products marketed and sold in the US. Clorox's lifestyle segment markets and sells food products, water-filtration systems and filters, and natural personal care products. The company's international segment consists of all products sold outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox's liquid bleach products represented 13% of sales in fiscal 2016 (about a quarter each of the cleaning and international segments), while trash bags represented another 13% of sales that year. The company's third-largest product line, charcoal, represented some 11% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's consumer brand names, includes Clorox bleach and cleaning products Pine-Sol cleaners; Liquid Plumr clog removers; Poett home care products; Fresh Step cat litter; Glad bags, wraps and containers; Kingsford charcoal; Hidden Valley and KC Masterpiece dressings and sauces; Brita water-filtration products and

   natural personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox also markets brands for professional services, including Clorox Healthcare, HealthLink, Aplicare. and Dispatch infection control products for the healthcare industry.

  <p>
   Most of Clorox's products are marketed through national advertising. Its largest customer,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and its affiliates, generated 27% of Clorox's fiscal 2016 sales. Altogether, the company's five largest customers accounted for 46% of total revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox aims to increase consumer loyalty through the 3Ds: Desire, Decide, and Delight. 3D capabilities include targeted marketing communications to drive consumer desire, stand-out product packaging and in-store promotions to compel purchase decisions at the point of decide, and superior-quality products to delight consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Primarily through a direct sales force, Clorox sells its products to mass merchandisers, retail outlets, medical supply providers, e-commerce channels, warehouse clubs, and dollar, military, and other types of retail stores. Clorox uses a combination of direct sales teams and a broker network to sell its products to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers. It sells its institutional, janitorial, and foodservice products through distributors. The company's health care products are marketed through a direct sales force and medical supply providers. For its business outside the US, Clorox sells products to retailers through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors, and joint-venture agreements with local partners. Additionally, the consumer products company peddles its products via online retailers, selling its Burt's Bees and g√ºd natural care products directly to consumers online.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's advertising spend was $597 million in 2016 and $523 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Clorox's numbers have been relatively stable for the past few years. Revenues grew by nearly 2% in fiscal 2016, driven by a volume increase of 4% reflecting higher shipments in all reportable segments and most significantly in Cleaning, Household and Lifestyle. Higher shipments in the Cleaning segment were driven by Home Care and Professional Products, partially offset by Laundry; higher shipments in the Household segment were primarily due to the acquisition of the Renew Life business, Charcoal, and Bags and Wraps, partially offset by Cat Litter; and higher shipments in the Lifestyle segment primarily were due to Natural Personal Care and Dressing and Sauces. Volume outpaced net sales primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotion spending, partially offset by the benefit of price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both volume and net sales growth in the Cleaning segment were driven primarily by higher shipments across several Home Care brands, including Clorox disinfecting wipes resulting from increased merchandising support and expanded warehouse club distribution, and in Professional Products mainly in cleaning products. These increases were partially offset by lower shipments in Laundry, primarily due to the impact of price increase on Clorox liquid bleach. Volume outpaced net sales due to unfavorable product mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the Household segment increased due to volume growth and net sales growth, driven by the acquisition of the Renew Life business; higher shipments of charcoal resulting from increased merchandising support; and increased shipments across several Glad products (including continued strength in premium trash bags). These increases were partially offset by lower shipments of Cat Litter, largely due to continuing competitive activity. Net sales growth outpaced volume growth, primarily due to favorable product mix and the benefit of price increases, partially offset by higher trade promotion spending, mainly in bags and wraps.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the Lifestyle segment increased due to both volume growth and net sales growth, driven by higher shipments of Burt's Bees Natural Personal Care (largely due to innovation in lip and face care) and higher shipments of Hidden Valley bottled salad dressings (due to innovation). Volume growth outpaced net sales growth primarily due to increased trade promotion spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the International segment decreased due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates across multiple countries, including the impact of the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, partially offset by the benefit of price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox has recorded an increasing trend in net income over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net income increased by 12% due to higher net sales, a decrease in cost of products sold, and a decline in interest expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities decreased by 11% due to the changes in receivables, inventories, and income taxes payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014, Clorox introduced its 2020 Strategy growth plan through the year 2020. As part of this, it has set a two-part strategic goal that it hopes will generate between 3% and 5% in annual sales growth before acquisitions. The company plans to boost its market share for its most successful brands and pump out higher profits across its categories, sales channels, and countries. To achieve this, Clorox is looking to invest in new and existing categories and products, as well, with particular emphasis on those with a worldwide focus, such as catering to health and wellness, sustainability, consumer fragmentation, and affordability. The cleaning company's strategy is to reach into similar product categories, enter new sales channels, boost its distribution in existing countries, and pursue new businesses in growing markets. In fiscal 2014 it spent $125 million on direct research activities, both to develop new products and to improve existing ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox is also dedicated to creating stockholder value. Part of reaching that goal includes investing in new and existing sales channels and entering nations which carry potential for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 the company launched a new line of Clorox Pool&amp;Spa products through a partnership with KIK Custom Products that enables it to extend its reach into a new lifestyle category for consumers. Clorox continues to drive its product innovation efforts, with an annual target of 3% points of incremental sales growth from new products. The company focused on driving sales growth in its U.S. business, leveraging incremental demand building investments and innovation, to drive category growth and market share improvements. In 2016, the company launched new products in many categories, including the Brita Infinity pitcher, Burt's Bees lipsticks, Clorox Healthcare nasal antiseptic swabs, Clorox Healthcare Optimum-UV Enlight, Fresh Step with Febreze, Glad DualDefense trash bags, Hidden Valley Greek yogurt dressing.

  <p>
   That year Clorox and Google Expand Strategic Relationship with Google to advance Clorox's marketing innovation, enhance consumer insights and develop more robust digital measurement. This step supports the central aspect of Clorox's 2020 Strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its namesake bleach being one of its biggest revenue-generators, Clorox is looking to the future of its primary product to safeguard its sales. It's garnering accolades from environmental groups, such as
   <company id="59232">
    Greenpeace
   </company>
   , for implementing changes to its supply chain for bleach-making.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company stopped transporting chlorine in the US in 2010. While the transition stands to be a potentially costly one, Clorox changed its manufacturing process, having begun with its Fairfield, California, factory outside San Francisco and rolling out the changes to its handful of bleach manufacturing facilities nationwide. Rather than buy chlorine and make bleach onsite at its factories, Clorox now makes a stronger bleach with a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite, with no changes to quality, color, or smell.
  </p>
  <p>
   To continue making more sustainable ingredient choices, Clorox adopted the Clorox Preferred Ingredient Calculator in 2014; it also expanded its Ingredients Inside platform to now include specific fragrance components.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2016 the company acquired digestive health company Renew Life for $290 million. The purchase of the Renew Life business aligns with the Clorox's acquisition strategy to target leading brands with attractive margins in high-growth categories, particularly in health and wellness. The Renew Life acquisition is consistent with its strategy to accelerate growth through bolt-on acquisitions of leading brands into fast-growing categories with attractive margins.

  <p>
   Known first as the Electro-Alkaline Company, The Clorox Company was founded in 1913 by five Oakland, California, investors who put up $100 apiece to make bleach using water from salt ponds around San Francisco Bay. The next year the company registered the brand name Clorox (the name combines the bleach's two main ingredients, chlorine and sodium hydroxide). At first the company sold only industrial-strength bleach, but in 1916 it formulated a household solution.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the establishment of a Philadelphia distributor in 1921, Clorox began national expansion. The company went public in 1928 and built plants in Illinois and New Jersey in the 1930s; it opened nine more US plants in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1957
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   (P&amp;G) bought Clorox. The Federal Trade Commission raised antitrust questions, and litigation ensued over the next decade. P&amp;G was ordered to divest Clorox, and in 1969 Clorox again became an independent company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following its split with P&amp;G, the firm added household consumer goods and foods, acquiring the brands Liquid-Plumr (drain opener, 1969), Formula 409 (spray cleaner, 1970), Litter Green (cat litter, 1971), and Hidden Valley (salad dressings, 1972). Clorox entered the specialty food products business by purchasing Grocery Store Products (Kitchen Bouquet, 1971) and Kingsford (charcoal briquettes, 1973).
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   , a large West German maker of cleansers and detergents, purchased 15% of Clorox's stock in 1974 as part of an agreement to share research. Beginning in 1977, Clorox sold off subsidiaries and brands, such as Country Kitchen Foods (1979), to focus on household goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s Clorox launched a variety of new products, including Match Light (instant-lighting charcoal, 1980), Tilex (mildew remover, 1981), and Fresh Step (cat litter, 1984). Clorox began marketing Brita water filtration systems in the US in 1988 (adding Canada in 1995). In 1990 it paid $465 million for American Cyanamid's household products group, including Pine-Sol cleaner and Combat insecticide. (It sold Combat and Soft Scrub to Henkel in 2004.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox left the laundry detergent business in 1991 (begun in 1988) after it was battered by heavyweights P&amp;G and Unilever. Household products VP Craig Sullivan became CEO the next year (stepping down in December 2003). In 1993 Clorox dumped its frozen food and bottled water operations. It began marketing its liquid bleach in Hungary through a Henkel subsidiary in 1994 and also bought S.O.S soap pads from Miles Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   A string of acquisitions brought the company into new markets as it built on existing brands. Clorox bought Black Flag and Lestoil in 1996 and car care product manufacturer
   <l1>
    Armor All
   </l1>
   in 1997. With its 1999 purchase of First Brands -- for about $2 billion in stock and debt -- Clorox added four more brands of cat litter and diversified into plastic products (Glad).
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite adding 115 new products in 2000, the company said it would put more emphasis on core brands going forward; it pushed its struggling Glad brand with more trade promotions and coupons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clorox in January 2001 announced a joint venture with Bombril, Brazil's leading name in steel wool, to form Detergentes Bombril; however, Clorox canceled the agreement in April 2001, claiming that various conditions of the deal had not been met. A year later, Clorox further distanced itself from the Brazilian market, selling its SBP insecticides business to
   <company id="42008">
    Reckitt Benckiser
   </company>
   . In 2002 Clorox announced that due to the difficult economic environment in the region, it was selling its Brazil business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 it jumpstarted a joint venture with
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   to take advantage of P&amp;G's manufacturing acumen to improve its Glad products. P&amp;G received a 10% stake in Glad. Clorox also sold its Jonny Cat Litter business to
   <company id="14314">
    Oil-Dri Corporation of America
   </company>
   and Black Flag operations in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2004 Robert Matschullat, the company's nonexecutive chairman, replaced Sullivan upon his retirement. Matschullat stepped down as chairman and became a director in January 2005; he passed the title to Jerry Johnston. Matschullat reclaimed the titles of chairman and CEO on an interim basis when Johnston suffered a heart attack and retired in 2006. Former Coca-Cola executive Donald Knauss was named chairman and CEO in late 2006; Matschullat remained a director.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemical giant Henkel once owned nearly 30% of Clorox, but Clorox bought it back in 2004 through an asset swap valued at $2.8 billion. The transaction involved Henkel's purchase of Clorox's 20% stake in Henkel Iberica, a joint venture between the two firms operating in Portugal and Spain. Henkel also bought Clorox's stake in a pesticide company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004, though, P&amp;G boosted its share in the joint venture (with $133 million) from 10% to 20%, which is the maximum it can invest according to the agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Clorox began to explore strategic alternatives for its $300-million-in-sales car-care brands (Armor All, STP), culminating in their sale to private equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $780 million.
