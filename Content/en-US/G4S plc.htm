   Much of the company's revenue (around 85%) is fueled by its Secure Solutions segment, which provides a full slate of services, such as personal protection, venue security, prisons, mine detection, alarm systems, fire detection, CCTV, video analytics, key holding, response services, integrated facilities services, and employment assistance services. Cash Solutions, which carries out secure cash handling, accounts for the remaining 15%.

   G4S restated its 2014 financials to correct accounting of alarm sales and related leases in Denmark, and errors in accounting for acquisitions and disposals and related tax balances in North America; the adjustment saw 2014 reported revenue of £6,848 million restated as £6,889 million, which does not include a £350 million gain from a divestment in the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, revenue fell 5% on prior year (including the gain on the divestment) to £6.9 billion, with falls in both Secure Solutions and Cash Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell £137 million to £8 million due to loss from continued operations. G4S incurred a £66 million charge for goodwill impairment, relating to businesses expected to be sold or closed, and an Estonian operation. Cash from operating activities increased 7% on prior year to £283 million due to changes in working capital.

   A portfolio review program, begun in 2013 and which has so far resulted in the sale of 23 businesses and netted proceeds of £281 million, is still ongoing. G4S expects to sell or exit a further 40 businesses.

  <p>
   In 2016, G4S sold G4S Honduras to Security Services Honduras, a subsidiary of GSI of Mexico, and G4S Finland to Sector Alarm of Norway for €17.5 million.
