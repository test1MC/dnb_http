   Don't look for dirt on The Dial Corporation. The company has built a business keeping itself and its customers squeaky clean and smelling as fresh as a daisy. The manufacturer boasts one of the top-selling soaps in the US and counts several leading brands in each of its two core product segments: laundry and home care (with product names Purex, Zout, 20 Mule Team, Combat, Soft Scrub, and Renuzit) and beauty and personal care (with its Dial soaps, bodywashes, and hand sanitizers; Tone, Coast, Dry Idea, Soft &amp; Dri, and Right Guard). Dial, a subsidiary of
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel KGaA
   </company>
   since 2004, is known for its "Aren't You Glad You Use Dial?" slogan, which was first used in 1953.

   Dial has helped its parent Henkel maintain its worldwide growth through product rollouts and global expansion. The company has been busy rolling out new products in North America. The company successfully launched and expanded its Dial NutriSkin body care, as well as brand extension Right Guard Total Defense 5. It has spent years helping its Right Guard brand get a foothold in Germany and Eastern Europe and was able to quickly positioning itself among worthy rivals. In 2011 it introduced Right Guard Xtreme Dry and Xtreme Sports high-performance deodorants. Also, an increase in sales from Dial's laundry sector helped to bolster Henkel's bottom line. Henkel points to emerging regions, such as Eastern Europe and Africa/Middle East, for noteworthy sales gains in the laundry sector.

  <p>
   In the mid-1940s meatpacker Armour &amp; Company developed a deodorant soap by adding the germicidal agent AT-7 to soap; this limited body odor by reducing bacteria on the skin. The new soap was named Dial because of its 24-hour protection against the odor-causing bacteria. Armour introduced the soap in 1948 in a full-page advertisement (on paper with scented ink) in the
   <i>
    Chicago Tribune.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s Dial was the best-selling deodorant soap in the US. The company adopted the slogan "Aren't you glad you use Dial? Don't you wish everybody did?" in 1953. In the 1960s Armour expanded the Dial line with deodorants and shaving creams.
  </p>
  <p>
   Canadian bus company Greyhound bought Armour and its Dial brand in 1970. Greyhound kept the company's meatpacking (Armour Foods) and consumer products operations (Armour-Dial) and sold the rest of its assets. Armour-Dial moved its headquarters to Phoenix in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greyhound's rapid diversification and frequent unit restructurings led to erratic profitability. In 1981 John Teets was appointed chairman of Greyhound and began selling unprofitable subsidiaries. After meatpackers struck at Armour plants in the mid-1980s, Teets shut 29 plants and sold its meatpacking operation to ConAgra, but kept its canned meat business. (A similar labor feud at Greyhound led to the sale of the bus operations in 1987.) Armour-Dial acquired laundry soap maker Purex Industries in 1985. Two years later it introduced Liquid Dial soap. In 1990 the company acquired the Breck hair products line.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reflect its changing focus, the company changed its name to The Dial Corporation in 1991. When it sold Motor Coach Industries to the public in 1993, it exited the US bus industry altogether. Also that year Dial bought Renuzit air fresheners from S.C. Johnson. The company introduced the Nature's Accents line of skin care products in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dial chose in 1996 to divide into two companies. Its services units became Viad, while its consumer products businesses continued to operate as Dial. Outsider Malcolm Jozoff -- a veteran of Lenox and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) -- was brought in to head Dial. (Teets was named to head Viad but subsequently announced his retirement.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The new Dial eliminated about 20% of its management and administrative jobs and trimmed more than half of its 2,300 products. Housecleaning continued when it sold its line of Brillo cleaning products to Church &amp; Dwight (1997). To expand its international sales, in 1997 Dial purchased Argentina's Nuevo Federal (soap, detergent) and then five more Argentine soap brands from P&amp;G.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dial retired its "Aren't you glad you use Dial ..." slogan in 1998, hoping to lure younger consumers. To complement its Nature's Accents line, that year the company bought specialty bath-care companies Freeman Cosmetic (natural skin care and hair care) and Sarah Michaels (bath and body products). In 1999 Dial formed a joint venture with Germany's Henkel (Dial/Henkel LLC) to develop a new line of Purex detergent products for the North American market. The joint venture later purchased the Custom Cleaner home dry-cleaning business from Creative Products Resource.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Herbert Baum (former COO of Hasbro) was named chairman, president, and CEO, replacing Jozoff, who resigned after the company announced it would not meet earnings expectations. In 2001 Dial sold its part of the joint venture it had with Henkel to Henkel. That year Dial also announced it was seeking a buyer. Dial also sold its specialty personal-care businesses (the Sarah Michaels and Freeman Cosmetics brands). In 2002 Dial acquired the Coast bar soap and Zout stain remover businesses in the US. Dial was acquired by Henkel in 2004 and Baum announced his retirement the next year. Brad Casper, from

   as president of personal care, became the company's president and CEO in early 2005.
