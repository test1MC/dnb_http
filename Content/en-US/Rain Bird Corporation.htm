   Among its slew of patented products, the company has launched a Rain Curtain irrigation technology for efficient water distribution. Its pressure regulating stem (PRS) rotor sprinkler prevents water loss caused by uneven water pressure. Highlighting convenience, the company offers user-friendly, water-saving automatic sprinkler controllers that work off a battery to irrigate areas that lack a main power supply. Its wireless remote control systems operate irrigation areas from a personal computer. Rain Bird also offers an online calculator that provides customized watering schedules for homeowners.

   In order to grow its business, the company continues to introduce more convenient, eco-friendly products that respond to every aspect of irrigation and installation. To this end, Rain Bird maintains an indoor irrigation testing center to test product reliability and durability under a range of conditions.

  <p>
   It also makes strategic acquisitions to improve its technology. In 2015 the company partnered with software integration of crop production data provider OnFarm, to integrate its ClimateMinder irrigation management system with the OnFarm crop production decision support software. The integration will allow large agro-growers with multiple sources of information to make the right decisions faster and more accurately.

   With a focus on product introduction and innovation, the company launched a range products and products upgrades in 2014 and 2015, including Rain Bird Sub-Surface Emitter Tubing, (drip irrigation); The Rain Bird In-Ground Automatic Sprinkler System; and the new GBS25 Golf Black Solenoid for Rain Bird valve-in-head golf rotors and case assemblies.

   In 2014 the company assigned two new golf distributors (Atlantic Irrigation; and Northeast Golf and Turf), covering New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
