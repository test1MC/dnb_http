   Jayco aims at the compact end of the motor home market with its Class C models, which are built on van- or pickup-type chassis rather than heavy-truck chassis like larger Class A models. Amenities include water purification systems, satellite kits, central air conditioning, electric patio awning, and microwaves, among other frills.

   Jayco offers tours of the renovated 1880s farmhouse which houses Jayco photos and memorabilia, along with Jayco apparel and merchandise. The company gives tours of its sewing shop and fifth wheel line when the factory is operating.

   Wilbur's father, the late Lloyd Bontrager, founded the company in 1968 in two chicken houses and a barn.

   Jayco bumped up its production in late 2009 as the economy started showing signs of recovery. The "higher than anticipated" orders caused the company to recall and hire more than 200 production workers. Its Starcraft RV division in Indiana resumed production in spring 2010, after it had been closed a year earlier. Enjoying a one-year reprieve, Jayco again hit rough road in late 2010 when dealers were found not to be replenishing their inventories, a reaction most likely stemming from the continued tight credit market. Once again, Jayco cut 10% of its workforce at its Twin Falls plant, and instituted a two-week shutdown to bring its inventory in line with demand.

        <p>
   The first decade of the 2000s was a lonesome highway for Jayco and its RV peers, since the industry was slammed by low demand, high gas prices, and almost non-existent credit for luxury items. Northeastern Indiana, the Mecca of the recreational vehicle business, saw factory layoffs of up to half a plant's workforce. In response, Jayco consolidated its facilities in mid-2008 and reduced its employee numbers by approximately 350, representing around 25% of total employees. Additionally the company closed its Starcraft RV subsidiary in Topeka, Indiana, in 2009 (later reopened in 2010), as well as its Entegra Coach subsidiary, which it had purchased just a year prior.
