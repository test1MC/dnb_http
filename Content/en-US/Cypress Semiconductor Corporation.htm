   Founded in 1982, Cypress Semiconductor has become embedded in Silicon Valley and the semiconductor industry. The company makes an array of embedded processors for automotive, industrial, and consumer machines and devices. Its products are embedded in autos from
   <company id="91128">
    Audi

   to
   <company id="178547">
    Subaru
   </company>

   </company>
   and
   <company id="106607">
    Under Armour
   </company>
   . Cypress products include NOR flash memories, SRAM and F-RAM, Traveo microcontrollers, programmable system-on-chip devices, and capacitive touch-sensing controllers. Memory products generate most of the company's revenue. It makes significant sales through distributors including

  <p>
   Cypress runs its own manufacturing operating in plants in the US (sited in Minnesota and Texas), which handle half the production load. The other half of production is done at contract manufacturers, which helps Cypress match output with the cycles of the semiconductor industry. The company also has test-and-assembly operations in Southeast Asia (the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's memory products account for 54% of its revenue, followed by the programmable systems division (38%), the data communications business (5%), and emerging technologies (3%). The memory business grew with the addition of Spansion products such as the Traveo, which regulates battery power in autos, and NOR and NAND flash memories.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Japan in the biggest geographic market for Cypress with customers there accounting for 29% of its revenue. China is close behind with 26% of Cypress revenue with customers in the US and Europe generating 12% and 11%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides its manufacturing related facilities in the US and Asia, Cypress operates research and development labs in those locations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are sold directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as through a network of distributors. In 2015 distributors Fujitsu Electronics, Avnet, and Arrow electronics, accounted for 25%, 10% and 7% of sales, respectively. No OEM accounted for more than 10% of sales in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cypress Semiconductor serves several markets, including consumer, mobile handsets, computation, data communications, automotive, industrial, and military.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 overall sales reached $1.6 billion, the company's first billion-plus year since 2007. The 2015 sales were more than double thos of 2014 on the influence of the Spansion acquisition. Revenue produced by Spansion's memory products accounted for 64% of the Cypress memory product group's revenue. The addition of Spansion products also boosted programmable systems sales 117% in 2015 from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the Spansion deal added to the top line, the associated costs sliced a chunk off the bottom line. Cypress posted a $378 million loss in 2015, compared to an $18 million profit in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also slowed in 2015 to $8.8 million from $103 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Cypress paid $550 million in 2016 to buy
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   's Internet of Things business. The acquisition brought Broadcom's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee wireless technologies on board at Cypress. The IoT unit had about $189 million in revenue and a 17% annual growth rate. The Broadcom deal adds significant wireless capability to Cypress's deepening IoT business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Cypress significantly grew through the purchase of
   <company id="132604">
    Spansion
   </company>
   , a maker of flash memory devices used in a wide variety of electronic devices, including wireless phones, networking equipment, and automotive subsystems. Cypress paid $5 billion in the deal, which is expected to achieve more than $135 million in savings, which have included headcount reductions and facility consolidations.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cypress' strategy includes continuing to drive demand for its proprietary programmable technology, expanding its customer base for programmable products, collaborating with customers on system-level product development, and getting out of legacy product lines that are nonstrategic or underperforming.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Spansion and its products on board as well as those from Broadcom, Cypress is targeting the vast number of machines and devices -- from washers and dryers to autos to fitness monitors to industrial equipment -- that will communicate with the Internet of Things. The company has developed -- and continues to work on -- lower power technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy devices that communicate but use very little power.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also is investing in the USB cable market with the Type C standard, which should be a truly universal connector for devices of all kinds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Cypress sold its TrueTouch mobile touchscreen business to Parade Technologies for just less than $100 million. Cypress sold the unit because the company did not think it would meet operating expectations.
