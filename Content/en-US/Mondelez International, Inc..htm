   Mondelez International (formerly Kraft Foods Inc.) makes what it takes to survive a global snack attack. The company's pantry of billion-dollar brands includes: Cadbury and Milka chocolates; LU, Nabisco, and Oreo biscuits; Trident gum; Tang powdered beverages; and Jacobs coffees. Mondelez International comprises the global snacking and food brands of the former Kraft Foods, whose North American operations were spun off to form
   <company id="55825">
    Kraft Foods Group
   </company>
   in 2012. Mondelez, with about $35 billion in annual sales, operations in more than 80 countries, and sale in about 165 countries, is the larger of the two businesses.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mondelez operates five operating segments organized by geography: Latin America, Asia Pacific, EEMEA, Europe and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its portfolio of nearly 60 food and snack brands are organized into five product categories: biscuits (which counts cookies, crackers and salted snacks); chocolate; gum &amp; candy; beverages (which counts coffee and powdered drinks) and cheese &amp; grocery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, its biscuit brands brought in nearly 35% of sales, while its chocolate brands made up more than 25%. Mondelez's Power Brands accounted for 60% of total net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As its name suggests, Mondelez International has a global focus. Indeed, North America accounts for just 20% of sales. Europe is the company's single largest market, contributing 40%, while fast-growing international markets, including Latin America, the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) region, and the Asia-Pacific region, contribute the remainder. The company maintains 170 manufacturing and processing plants in 58 countries (including eight in China in Beijing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Jiangmen), and boasts more than 215 distribution centers and depots globally.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mondelez sells its candy, snacks, and beverages through supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, convenience stores, drug stores, and other retail food outlets. The company also sells through independent sales offices and agents in some of its international locations. Mondelez' 10 largest customers accounted for nearly 25% of sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $1.55 billion on advertising expenses in 2014, about 10% less than it spent in 2013, and 14% less than in 2012. Mondelez was able to save on costs by consolidating its media providers, reducing its non-working media costs, and shifting its spending into low-cost digital media outlets. It did increase its advertising spend on its global Power Brands and kept its spending steady on effective media channels.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Since its divestiture of Kraft Food Group, Mondelez' revenue has been mostly flat in recent years. Revenue in 2014 dipped by 3% to $34.2 billion, with sales dropping in all regions (save for the US) and across all product lines, mostly because of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a poor volume/mix in the Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. The company's sales declined the most in the Chocolate and Gum &amp; Candy product lines. Higher net pricing, however, helped to offset some of the sales decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit has also been declining over the past few years (with the exception of 2013). Net income dove by 44% to $2.18 billion in 2014, mostly because of an absence of income from discontinued operations that it enjoyed the year before. In 2013, the company had increased revenue by 1% thanks to higher biscuit and chocolate sales, partially offset by a decrease in sales in the company's gum and candy, and cheese and grocery segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations also fell by 44% to $3.5 billion in 2014, mostly from a combination of lower earnings, more income tax payments, and because in 2013 the company had enjoyed a non-recurring $2.6 billion cash receipt from the resolution of its Starbucks arbitration.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After years of declining sales and profits, Mondelez has been undergoing big changes to right the ship in recent years. In mid-2014, it initiated a $3.5 billion restructuring program designed to cut supply chain and overhead costs and save at least $1.5 billion annually by the time the program ends at the end of 2018. In 2014, the first year of the program, the company spent $381 million toward implementing this ambitious savings program.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better utilize it's resources, Mondelez has been selectively cutting some operations to be relocate its other operations in more strategic regions. In 2015, the company sold its 50% stake in the Ajinomoto General Foods, which sells coffee products and other beverages in Japan, to its joint venture partner
   <company id="55924">
    Ajinomoto Co. Inc
   </company>
   . In 2014, it invested $24 million to boost the production capacity of its plant in Gebze, Turkey to support its growing confectionery business. In 2013, it shuttered some of its former Kraft plants in the US to make more investments in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the EMEA, and Russia. Amid US and Russia tensions over Ukraine, Mondelez began building a $110-million factory in the Novosibirsk region of Russia with the capacity to produce 50,000 tons of snacks annually. It also began building a $90 million biscuit plant in Bahrain to satisfy increasing demand for its snacks in the Middle East and Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The separation of the global snacking business from the North American grocery operations paved the way for each business to adopt its own strategy. Mondelez is looking to its 15 global power brands (including Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, Milka, Cadbury, Chiclets and Trident) to drive 70% of its growth (up from 60% in 2014). The company holds the number one position globally in biscuits (or as we say in America, cookies), chocolate, candy and powdered beverages. It's number two in gum and coffee.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's hard-won battle for UK candy maker Cadbury in 2010 gave the snack business the heft to stand alone. The purchase, valued at about $18.5 million, created a "global powerhouse in snacks, confections, and quick meals, with a large portfolio of leading brands around the world." Cadbury's top brands include Dairy Milk bars, Roses chocolates, Trident gum, Halls cough drops, and the ever-popular Creme Eggs. In 2014, Mondelez's chocolate division, which includes Cadbury, generated more than 25% of the company's total sales.

  <p>
   The Kraft tale began in 1903 when James L. Kraft began delivering cheese to Chicago grocers. His four brothers joined in, forming the J.L. Kraft &amp; Bros. Company, in 1909. By 1914 the company had opened a cheese factory and was selling cheese across the US. Kraft developed its first blended, pasteurized cheese the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft went public in 1924; four years later it merged with Philadelphia cream-cheese maker, Phoenix, and also created Velveeta cheese spread. In 1930 Kraft was bought by National Dairy, but its operations were kept separate. New and notable products included Miracle Whip salad dressing (1933), macaroni and cheese dinners (1937), and Parkay margarine (1940). In the decades that followed, Kraft expanded into foreign markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   National Dairy became Kraftco in 1969 and Kraft in 1976, hoping to benefit from its internationally known trademark. To diversify, Kraft merged with
   <company id="111474">
    Dart Industries
   </company>
   in 1980; Dart's subsidiaries (including
   <company id="14674">
    Duracell
   </company>
   batteries) and Kraft kept separate operations. With non-food sales sagging, Dart &amp; Kraft split up in 1986. Kraft kept its original lines and added Duracell (sold 1988); the rest became
   <company id="11204">
    Premark International
   </company>
   . Tobacco giant Philip Morris Companies bought Kraft in 1988 for $12.9 billion. The next year Philip Morris joined Kraft with another unit, General Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Foods began when Charles Post, who marketed a wheat/bran health beverage, established the Postum Cereal Co. in 1896; he expanded the firm with such cereals as Grape-Nuts and Post Toasties. The company went public in 1922. Postum bought the makers of Jell-O (1925), Baker's chocolate (1927), Log Cabin syrup (1927), and Maxwell House coffee (1928), and in 1929 it acquired control of General Foods (owned by frozen vegetable pioneer Clarence
   <company id="106836">
    Birdseye
   </company>
   ) and changed its own name to General Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its later purchases included Perkins Products (Kool-Aid, 1953) and Kohner Brothers (toys, 1970). Most of its non-food lines proved unsuccessful and were sold throughout the years. General Foods bought
   <company id="134767">
    Oscar Mayer
   </company>
   , the US's #1 hot dog maker, in 1981. Philip Morris bought General Foods for $5.6 billion in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1989 combination of Kraft and General Foods (the units still ran independently) created the largest US food maker, Kraft General Foods. In the 1990s Kraft General Foods lost market share in areas such as frozen vegetables and processed meat. It introduced "light" meat products and stopped making nearly 300 food items. In 1993 it bought RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business (Shredded Wheat) and sold its Breyers ice-cream business to
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To streamline management, Philip Morris integrated Kraft and General Foods in 1995. Newly named Kraft Foods sold off lower-margin businesses, including its bakery unit and its North American table spreads business. Kraft bought
   <company id="40118">
    Del Monte
   </company>
   's shelf-stable pudding business (1995) and
   <company id="89523">
    Taco Bell
   </company>
   's grocery line (1996). It also sold its Lender's bagels (1996) and Log Cabin (1997) lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deciding to eat healthy in early 2000, Kraft bought
   <company id="116363">
    Boca Burger
   </company>
   (soy products) for about $100 million and Balance Bar (meal-replacement snack bars, drink mixes, and beverages) for $268 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 parent Philip Morris (which renamed itself the
   <company id="11179">
    Altria Group
   </company>
   in 2003) outbid Danone and Cadbury Schweppes (later
   <company id="41767">
    Cadbury
   </company>
   ) and agreed to buy Nabisco Holdings. It completed the deal that December for $18.9 billion (including $4 billion in debt) and began integrating those operations into Kraft Foods and Kraft Foods International. Then Philip Morris created a holding company for the newly combined food operations under the Kraft Foods Inc. name in 2001. The original Kraft Foods was renamed Kraft Foods North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft Foods International CEO Roger Deromedi was appointed co-CEO of the new holding company, along with Betsy Holden. Kraft Foods Inc. was spun off by Altria in 2001 in what was the US's second-largest IPO ever at the time (behind
   <company id="56163">
    AT&amp;T Wireless
   </company>
   , now
   <company id="102492">
    AT&amp;T Mobility
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft cut 7,500 jobs in 2002 as a result of the integration of Nabisco operations, paying out $373 million in cash for severance and related costs. That year Kraft was also part of a $9 million settlement of a federal lawsuit regarding the use of genetically modified corn in its taco shells.
  </p>
  <p>
   A strategy to shed brands that do not fit with the rest of the company's portfolio led Kraft to sell Farley's and Sathers in 2002 to FS Partners, which renamed the company
   <company id="117773">
    Farley's &amp; Sathers Candy Company
   </company>
   . Later that year Kraft sold some of its candy brands (Now and Later, Intense Fruit Chews, and Mity Bite) to FS Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to combat the population's growing obesity problem, Kraft said in 2003 that it intended to reduce the fat and sugar content and cut the portion sizes of its food products, as well as cease marketing in schools.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deromedi shared the CEO slot with co-CEO Betsy Holden until 2003, at which time Deromedi was named sole CEO. (Holden was demoted to a marketing slot in the company and eventually left Kraft in 2005.) During his tenure as CEO, Deromide was dogged by Kraft's looming spinoff from Altria and struggled to improve company profits by selling off underperforming and non-core brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2004 formed an alliance with Dr. Arthur Agatston, of low-carb South Beach Diet fame, to use the South Beach Diet trademark on some of its products, including cereal, meal replacements, cereal bars, refrigerated sandwich wraps, and frozen entrees and pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of Deromedi's plan to refashion Kraft's product lineup, in 2005 the company sold its Altoids breath mints, LifeSavers, and CremeSavers candies brands, whose combined sales were, at the time, estimated to be about $660 million a year.
   <company id="11648">
    Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company
   </company>
   paid about $1.4 billion for the popular brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite his best efforts to improve the bottom line, Deromedi was shown the door in 2006. He was replaced by
   <company id="48009">
    Frito-Lay
   </company>
   's CEO Irene Rosenfeld (a former top Kraft executive who was instrumental in the company's acquisition and integration of Nabisco). She returned to Kraft after being head of
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsico
   </company>
   's Frito-Lay from 2004 to 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft extricated itself from the haze of second-hand tobacco smoke when it was spun off from
   <company id="11179">
    Altria
   </company>
   in 2007. Having edged toward splitting from its former parent for years, the separation relieved the food maker of many headaches. It freed Kraft from any tobacco-related liability that Altria may be found guilty of post-spinoff. It also eliminated a significant layer of management, which made it easier for Kraft to improve its sluggish sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on sharpening its brand portfolio, Kraft sold off its hot cereals business in 2007. The $200 million sale to
   <company id="60245">
    B&amp;G Foods
   </company>
   included two old favorites, Cream of Wheat and Cream of Rice. It also sold its Fruit2O and Veryfine juice brands and operations to
   <company id="143201">
    Sunny Delight Beverages
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its plan to offer new product categories, Kraft entered the lucrative and popular premade salad market in 2007 with the introduction of South Beach Living brand chicken-salad kits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding more on the expansion front, Kraft bought the Spanish and Portuguese operations of
   <company id="90455">
    United Biscuits
   </company>
   that year; the deal returned to Kraft the rights to Nabisco trademarks such as Oreo, Ritz, and Chips Ahoy! in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft further expanded its foreign operations with its 2007 purchase of the cookie/biscuit business of
   <company id="41774">
    Groupe Danone
   </company>
   for some $7.6 billion. The purchase gave the company brands such as LU, Petit Ecolier, and Crème Roulée, and made biscuits (cookies to us Yanks) the company's largest global business. It also added the Tiger and Prince brands to its Egyptian portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Billionaire Warren Buffett acquired a small percentage of Kraft in 2007 (less than 5% at the time), joining the also famously rich and famous-on-Wall Street corporate raiders Nelson Peltz (whose estimated Kraft holdings are 3%) and Carl Icahn (who owns about 3%) in ownership of the Velveeta vendor. Peltz and Ichan are typically activist investors, making suggestions regarding company operations. Peltz has suggested that Kraft concentrate on its core brands, as well as undertake divestitures to fund overseas expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft acquiesced to Peltz on one front, agreeing with his investment operations, collectively known as Trian Partners, by adding two directors (selected by the company and supported by Trian) to its board in 2007. Kraft also signed a "standstill" agreement with Trian, agreeing to support the board's full list of nominees at Kraft's next two annual meetings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2007 Kraft announced the re-rebranding of its South Beach products from South Beach Diet to South Beach Living, saying that it wanted to capture a more positive image for the products. That year the company also sold its Veryfine juice and Fruit2O water brands and operations to the
   <company id="143201">
    Sunny Delight
   </company>
   company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraft's 2008 sale of its slow-growing Post (Shredded Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honeycomb, Grape-Nuts, Pebbles, and others) to
   <company id="41956">
    Ralcorp
   </company>
   , a maker of private-label cereals and other foods, is part of Kraft's strategy to pare down its brand offerings and concentrate on high-yield products. Ralcorp paid some $1.6 billion in stock for the acquisition. Post is the #3 US cereal maker by sales, after
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg
   </company>
   . Post brought in more than $1 billion for Kraft in both 2006 and 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2010 Kraft acquired Cadbury for about $19 billion, of which 60% was cash and 40% was stock. A majority of Cadbury's shareholders (almost 72% according to Kraft) accepted the offer, effectively making Cadbury part of Kraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2012 Kraft Foods split into two companies: a global snacks business, Mondelez International, and Kraft Foods Group (formerly Kraft Foods North America).
