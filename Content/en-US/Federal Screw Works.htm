   Federal Screw Works (FSW) doesn't mind if you think of your car as a bucket of bolts. The Detroit native makes fasteners and related items, primarily for the automotive industry. The company produces high-volume lots to the specifications of manufacturers. Nonautomotive sales are mainly to makers of durable goods. FSW's products include locknuts, bolts, piston pins, studs, bushings, shafts, and other machined, cold-formed, hardened, and ground-metal parts. It maintains five manufacturing facilities, all of which are located in Michigan.

   Federal Screw Works was founded in 1917 and went public two years later. The company acquired Chelsea Screw in 1928 and Michigan Screw, Superior Screw, and Bolt Manufacturing the next year. The Great Depression forced the firm to close plants in Lansing, Michigan, and in Cleveland, and to consolidate operations in Detroit. Union strikes shut down the company for part of 1937 and 1938, forcing it to reorganize its management and financial structure. During WWII the company made components (tank rims) for the military. After the war Federal Screw Works moved into bolt and locknut manufacturing and focused on the automobile industry.

   W. T. ZurSchmiede, a director since 1959, became CEO in 1970 and chairman in 1978. Son Robert joined Federal Screw Works as a sales representative in 1981, and son Thomas joined in 1983 as a division manager. In 1984 Robert became a division VP, and in 1994 Thomas became president of the company.

   Two strikes hurt earnings in 1996, but the company bounced back the next fiscal year. In 1998 the company broke ground for its seventh manufacturing facility; the 35,000-sq.-ft. special automotive assembly plant was completed the following year. Margins remained under pressure in 1999 as the competitive market forced Federal Screw Works to continue giving price concessions to its main customers. Federal Screw Works sold its steel processing division in early 2000.
