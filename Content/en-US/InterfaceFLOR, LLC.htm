   Based on the fact that almost 5 billion lbs. of old carpet end up in landfills every year, and that virgin nylon, a preferred carpet material, has a major negative impact on the environment, the company is taking the path to "Mission Zero" to achieve a zero environmental footprint by 2020. Modular carpeting amounts to less waste ending up in landfills.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company no longer uses wool in its carpets based on the environmental impact associated with grazing animals. It instead uses nylon 6.6 which is longer lasting and can be recycled at the end of its first life. InterfaceFLOR has also developed a partial nylon replacement using polylactic acid which is derived from cornstarch.
