   Sypris divides its operations into the Industrial and Electronics Groups. The Industrial Group, which accounts for nearly 85% of sales, makes heavy-duty truck components, axle shafts, gear sets, differential cases, trailer axle beams, and other components under sole-source contracts with

  </p>
        <p>
   The Electronics Group (15% of sales) operates though two business lines: Information Security Solutions (ISS) and Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS). ISS provides cyber security, secure communications, and electronic key management products to departments of the US goivernment.  EMS makes circuit care and integrated design and engineering services for large aerospace and defense clients like

   Sypris sells and grows its business though the expansion of existing relationships, referrals and direct sales through senior management, direct sales personnel, domestic and international sales representatives, distributors, and market specialists. Its supplements these selling efforts with a variety of sales literature, advertising in numerous trade media, and participating in trade shows.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Sypris saw its revenues jump 2% from $226 million in 2011 to $332 million in 2012. However, its profits decreased by 61% from nearly $8 million in 2011 to $3 million in 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   The revenue growth for 2012 was driven by a 5% surge in sales from its Industrial Group, which was helped by increased steel prices and higher sales of specialty closure products. The group was also helped by higher volumes for light, medium, and heavy duty commercial truck components.
  </p>
        <p>
   The drop in profits for 2012 was the result of higher selling, general, and administrative expenses due to write-offs of pre-contract costs and a $7.2 million loss from discontinued operations.

        <p>
   Sypris' strategy for growth is relatively straightforward: it aims to strengthen its position within each of its core markets by increasing the number of multi-year customer contracts and investing in highly automated production capacity to remain competitive on a global scale. It targets its core commercial vehicle, off-highway vehicle, and light truck and energy markets within North America and is also pursuing acquisitions as a means to fortify its position within these markets.

        <p>
   Sypris Solutions began as a Honeywell unit that designed secure communications systems for the US military and other federal agencies. In 1988, as part of Honeywell's restructuring, the unit was spun off to Group Financial Partners as Group Technologies.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the early 1990s Group Technologies shifted its focus from military customers to PC manufacturers and acquired the electronics contract manufacturing operations of
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   . The company went public in 1994 and expanded into Latin America. Huge debt from the company's spinoff, plus rapid expansion and new work startups, led to losses in 1995 and 1996. That year the company cut a third of its workforce and sold its Badger line of pen-based computers. In 1997 it sold its Latin American operations to rival SCI (now
   <company id="16106">
    Sanmina-SCI
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   Thomas Lovelock, who became CEO in 1997, refocused Group Technologies on its military roots and on niche markets such as industrial controls. The company reorganized through a complicated three-way merger in 1998 and changed its name to Sypris Solutions. Robert Gill and his son Jeffrey, who had held positions at the merged companies, became Sypris' chairman and president, respectively.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Sypris bought
   <company id="46656">
    Lucent Technologies
   </company>
   ' calibration and repair service business. The company won contracts in 1999 and 2000 from, among others, Boeing, Honeywell, Raytheon, and the US Navy. The company consolidated some of its manufacturing operations due to a decline in demand for heavy-duty trucks and increasing electronic component costs in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   Late in 2003 Sypris acquired a manufacturing plant from Dana Corp. as part of an eight-year agreement for Sypris to supply drive-train and axle components to Dana. Sypris acquired certain of the drive-train and axle components manufacturing assets of Dana as part of a long-term outsourcing agreement between the companies worth about $65 million a year.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004 Sypris acquired a trailer axle beam manufacturing plant from ArvinMeritor as part of a multi-year supply agreement.
  </p>
        <p>
   Dana, the company's largest customer, filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in early 2006. An arbitrator ruled in late 2006 that Dana had breached certain agreements with Sypris and awarded $1.8 million to Sypris. The company received a partial payment of $900,000 in early 2007.
  </p>
        <p>
   Faced with a challenging economic environment that began in 2008 and continued throughout 2009, Sypris Solutions restructured operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Late in 2008 the company consolidated three of its manufacturing facilities into other Sypris facilities, closed a plant in Ohio, and reduced its workforce by about 12%. It also integrated its Electronics Group subsidiaries, merging Sypris Data Systems into Sypris Electronics, and phased out several non-core product lines.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition, late in 2009 Sypris sold its Test &amp; Measurement division to
   <company id="11444">
    Tektronix
   </company>
   for about $39 million. The sale of the division, which provided on-site and mobile calibration and product sourcing services, allows the company to focus on growth in its aerospace and defense operations. It also enabled Sypris to retire a good portion of its debt.
