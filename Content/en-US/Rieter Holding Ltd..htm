   Through its tight-knit group of companies, Rieter Holding operates along two business threads. Spun Yard Systems makes machinery and systems for processing natural and man-made fibers and their blends into yarns. Its Premium Textile Components business offers automotive parts such as engine and luggage compartments and technology components and services to spinning mills. Rieter Holdings' automotive customers include all major global automobile manufacturers. Boasting about 18 manufacturing locations across 10 countries, the company provides textile-making machinery globally to textile mills, which use its machines to produce yarn from fibers and to convert plastics into yarn.

  <p>
   Johann Jacob Rieter established a foreign spices and cotton trading concern in Winterthur, Switzerland in 1795. Johann's son Heinrich Rieter joined the firm in 1809, and for the next several years the company invested in spinning mills.
  </p>
  <p>
   A third-generation member of the Rieter family, named Heinrich after his father, took over the company in 1851. By 1852 Rieter had become the first Swiss industrial company to offer housing to its workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the years between 1835 and the first quarter of the 20th century, Rieter diversified into businesses that included the production of transmissions, turbines, machine tools, generators, motors, railways, trams, and rifles. Other activities during that time included bridge construction and textile operations such as the manufacture of looms, embroidery machines, and doubling and winding machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rieter became a public limited company in 1891. Benno Rieter became general manager of the company in 1899 and was the last Rieter family member to participate in the management of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1915 Rieter had decided to concentrate on the production of spinning machinery, and by 1931 the company began delivering machinery for the production of man-made fibers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reiter opened its first American subsidiary in 1951. After about a decade, the company opened a plant in Coimbatore, India. These moves marked the beginning of a 40-year trend of external growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired UK textile manufacturing equipment maker Ernest Scragg &amp; Sons in 1982. Two years later Rieter picked up Unikeller AG, a Swiss maker of automotive noise-control products and thermal insulation. In 1985 the company changed its name to Rieter Holding Ltd. and was listed on the Zurich stock exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Rieter bought rotor-spinning machine maker Schubert &amp; Salzer GmbH (Germany), and in 1992 it picked up another German company -- synthetic fiber and pelletizing machinery maker Automatik-Apparate-Maschinenbau GmbH. Firth Furnishings (car carpets) of the UK was added in 1994, the same year Czech rotor-spinning machine maker Elitex was acquired.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rieter bought automotive component makers Globe Industries (US) and Fimit SpA (Italy) in 1995, and two years later it formed two joint ventures in its automotive sector: Rieter teamed with Magee in the US to make car carpets, and it partnered with Ello in Brazil for the production of automotive components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Switzerland's BZ Gruppe bought a 7% stake in Rieter. In 2000 Rieter bought ICBT Groupe, France's leading maker of textile machinery, and a 60% stake in Italian automotive engineering firm Idea Institute. The next year Rieter agreed to acquire Germany based Suessen Group, a Germany-based maker of textile spinning equipment. In early 2002 the company's board of directors named former group controller, Hartmut Reuter, CEO. Kurt Feller, the former CEO, remained as chairman of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking a bit of shelter from the challenges of the textile machinery business, in 2005 the company acquired Hogra Holding, the parent company of textile combing machinery maker Graf Group.
