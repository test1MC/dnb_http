   NantKwest (formerly Conkwest Delaware) is a clinical stage biotech company focused on using the body's own immune system to conquer cancer, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases. With no products yet to its name, the company is in phase I clinical trials using the body's own natural killer (NK) cells to target cancer or cells that have been infected with viruses. NantKwest has developed a unique NK cell which lacks inhibitory receptors to enable selective targeting and killing of diseased cells. In contrast to the body's adaptive immune cells such as T-cells, its proprietary aNK cells require no exposure to pathogens, antigens, or stimulatory molecules to begin their attack. NantKwest went public in mid-2015.

  <p>
   The company raised $207.5 million in its initial public offering, significantly more than the $137 million it anticipated raising. It plans to use the funds raised to carry on further clinical studies, to hire personnel, to build a planned manufacturing facility, to pursue R&amp;D efforts, and for general corporate purposes.

  <p>
   NantKwest's immunotherapy platform is expected to be easy to administer, with patients receiving treatments in outpatient facilities and no patient-donor matching required.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to testing its aNK cells in the fight against cancer, NantKwest is exploring the cells' capacity to fight infectious and inflammatory diseases; it has conducted preclinical studies in which the cells have been pitted against the Ebola virus. Other targets include HIV, tuberculosis, and influenza.

  <p>
   The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical has incurred significant losses since it was formed in 2002, and it expects to continue losing money for the foreseeable future. At the end of 2014, the company had an accumulated deficit of some $17.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its current revenues are primarily derived from other pharmaceuticals utilizing its aNK cells to test their own antibodies. In fiscal 2014, revenue increased 7% to $641,000. Operating cash outflow totaled $5,354.

  <p>
   The company plans to enter phase II and phase III trials in which it will study the effectiveness of aNK cells in combination with marketed drugs and late-stage product candidates. It is also exploring using its cells to combat infectious and inflammatory diseases. In collaboration with Sorrento, NantKwest is developing taNK product candidates, which are genetically modified aNK cells designed to target specific antigens. The company is also open to other collaborations and alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   NantKwest is building a cell-based manufacturing facility to support its large-scale clinical trials and possible commercialization.
