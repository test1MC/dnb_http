   With Texas as its biggest market, Acme Brick holds a 10% share in the US brick market. The company's brick plants operate within a 500-mile radius of high population centers. It keeps a handle on costs by owning its own distribution companies, including Edmond Materials in Tennessee, and Angelo Brick in Texas.

   Two retail locations in North Texas sell a selection of ceramic tile, natural stone, carpet, and wood flooring directly to consumers. By reaching out to homeowners seeking to improve their current homes, the company hopes to offset some of the losses from the earlier downturn in the home construction industry.

  <p>
   Acme Bricks' bricks are made from clays and shales and are hard-fired in kilns exceeding 1,800 degrees. This traditional method of producing bricks gives the company a decided edge over competitors making concrete bricks and pavers that require artificial colors; concrete doesn't stand up to environmental conditions as well as brick, and has a tendency to shrink.

   Tapping the growing interest in green building products, Acme Brick has also developed a lighter, more earth-friendly brick. The new product features larger core holes, resulting in energy savings both to produce and transport the bricks.

   Acme Brick traces its roots back to 1891, when founder George Bennett's brick manufacturing facility went into operation. The company's former parent, Justin Industries, was acquired by Berkshire in 2000. Berkshire subsequently separated Justin Industries, which included
