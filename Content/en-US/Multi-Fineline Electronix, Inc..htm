  <p>
   With the acquisition, MFLEX operates as an independent company within Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing (DSBJ) with the same management. MFLEX expects that being part of the large manufacturing concern will present opportunities to expand its products into automotive, industrial, and display markets.

  <p>
   In 2014, MFLEX changed its fiscal year end from September to December. Some comparisons of year-to-year figures show all of 2015 in relation to the gap quarter (October-December) of 2015. This analysis compares 12 months of 2014 with 12 months of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   MFLEX reported about $637 million in revenue for 2015, a $5 million improvement from about $632 million in 2014. The company posted increases in its smartphone and consumer electronics segments while its tablet unit saw a sales decline. In smartphones, MFLEX's sales to Apple rose about $110 million to $480 million while orders from customers based in China and South Korea fell. Most of the $38 million increase in consumer electronics came from a customer for technology used in wearables. Sales for tablets fell due to decreased orders from a major customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   After several years of losses, MFLEX made a profit of $93 million in 2015, compared to a loss of $84 million in 2014. The company's costs of sales was significantly lower in 2015 than in 2014. Also, in 2014 the company spent some $34 million in restructuring to align costs with sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations jumped to $93 million in 2015 from $31 million in 2014. Lower accounts receivables, improve collections, and reduced inventory combined to boost cash flow.

  <p>
   MFLEX's 2014 restructuring consolidated manufacturing facilities and closed a research and development center as well as reduced its workforce. The cuts helped the company report net income for 2015. The company, however, remains dependent on a small number of customers in a few markets. Granted, the biggest customer is Apple, one of the biggest companies, and the market is smartphones, one of the biggest electronics markets. But Apple's smartphone sales have stumbled in recent quarters and there is intense competition in the smartphone market. MFLEX is moving to diversify its customer base beyond Apple and expand beyond phones, wearables, and tablets into other mobility markets such as automotive. Parent company Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing could be instrumental in providing MFLEX access to such markets.
