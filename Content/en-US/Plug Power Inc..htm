   Plug Power wants to give alternative power sources a lift. The company develops on-site power generation systems used in forklifts and material handling equipment, and in remote power applications. Plug Power uses proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells to generate electricity from hydrogen gas without combustion. The company's GenDrive product is sold to large distribution centers as a replacement for lead-acid batteries in lift trucks, including pallet trucks and narrow-aisle reach trucks. Plug Power caters primarily to the US market; customers have included big names like

   Plug Power generates its revenue through four different business segments. Sales of fuel cell systems is its most lucrative, representing 76% of its total sales. Other segments include services performed on fuel cell systems (14%), power purchase agreements (6%), and fuel delivered to customers (4%).

  <p>
   Plug Power has never turned a profit and has suffered 10 straight years of net losses. It posted a net loss of $56 million in 2015 compared to a $88 million loss for 2014. Net sales, however, skyrocketed 61% to peak at a record-smashing $103 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue growth for 2015 was fueled by explosive growth in power purchase agreements (168%) and fueled delivered to customers (159%). In addition, sales of fuel cell systems climbed by 61% and services performed on fuel cell systems jumped 41% during 2015. The majority of the growth within these segments was attributed to the introduction in 2014 of its GenKey product, which transitions customers' material handling equipment into vehicles capable of handling fuel cell power.
  </p>
  <p>
   The consistent erosion in profits has mostly been due to the overhead costs involved in accruing revenue for its product and services segments.

  <p>
   Plug Power achieved explosive revenue growth in 2015 mainly due to the introduction of its GenKey product. Introduced in 2014, GenKey, transitions customers' material handling equipment into vehicles capable of handling fuel cell power. The company continues to penetrate the material handling market, supported through the deployment of over 10,300 GenDrive units into commercial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   To grow even further, Plug Power is evaluating adjacent markets such as transport refrigeration units (TRU), ground support equipment (GSE), and range extenders to introduce new GenDrive products. In 2015 the company launched the GenDrive 3340 fuel cell unit, which is designed around Plug Power's air-cooled fuel cell stack which enables a simplified unit design and features better fuel efficiency.
