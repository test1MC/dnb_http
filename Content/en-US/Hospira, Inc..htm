   Hospira helps hospitals heal the hurting. The firm makes specialty injectable pharmaceuticals (primarily generics) including cardiovascular, anesthesia, oncology, and anti-infective therapies, as well as related drug delivery systems such as prefilled syringes. Its more complicated medication delivery systems include electronic drug pumps and related medication management software. In addition, Hospira makes IV nutritional solutions and provides contract manufacturing services. Key customers include hospitals, alternate site facilities (such as nursing and outpatient surgical care facilities), wholesalers, and other drug manufacturers.
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   acquired Hospira for some $17 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   Pfizer was particularly interested in adding Hospira's offerings to its existing portfolio of generic injectable drugs and biosimilars (generic biotech drugs). Combined, the group is one of the industry's leading biosimilars producers. Hospira now operates as a subsidiary of Pfizer.

  <p>
   Hospira is a global firm with operations divided into three segments: Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), and APAC (Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's specialty injectables business accounts for more than 60% of sales. Its offerings include generic drugs for cancer treatment and acute care applications, as well as proprietary drugs (such as sedation drug Precedex), biosimilars (generic biotech drugs Retacrit and Nivestim), and proprietary delivery systems (including the prefilled iSecure syringe).
  </p>
  <p>
   The smaller medication management system business, which accounts for a quarter of sales, provides drug delivery devices. It also offers software and technology tools for medication safety and clinical decision support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hospira also provides third-party contract manufacturing services to other drugmakers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US market accounts for most of Hospira's annual revenues but the company's reach covers more than 70 countries on five continents. The company markets its products in other portions of the Americas, the Asia/Pacific region, and the EMEA region. It also runs 15 manufacturing facilities globally, with its North Carolina, Texas, Kansas, Costa Rica, India, and Australia (Victoria) locations accounting for the majority of output. The firm also outsources some production to third-party suppliers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hospira performs its product development efforts at a handful of research facilities in the US, as well as overseas in Australia, Italy, and India.

  <p>
   In addition to a direct sales force, the company operates marketing and distribution centers across the US; it also uses third-party distributors in the US and other countries. Many of the firm's hospital customers are members of the major US group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) with whom Hospira has pricing arrangements. Such customers are served through wholesaler distributors. Major GPO customers include Amerinet,

  <p>
   Hospira works to grow its product offerings and keep its development pipeline flowing through a number of growth strategies including acquisitions, licensing deals, and partnered and independent R&amp;D efforts. Hospira's internal research programs are largely focused on the areas of generic specialty injectable pharmaceuticals. The company introduces a number of new generic injectables each year, and it is working to move existing products into new countries. In addition, Hospira is looking to develop new generic injectable biosimilars, non-generic specialty injectables, and medication management systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Hospira launched its LifeCare PCA 7.0 Infusion System, which provides for auto-programming of devices and streamlines documentation of infusion data. In 2015 the company extended its partnership with
   <company id="12940">
    Cerner
   </company>
   to enhance the interoperability between its smart IV infusion devices and Cerner's CareAware technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hospira has been shifting its manufacturing resources to meet customer demands; it is also expanding its capacity at its facility in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further reduce expenses, the company plans to close its Clayton, North Carolina, manufacturing facility; and sell its Buffalo, New York, manufacturing facility. Hospira sold its clinical surveillance software business TheraDoc for $117 million in 2014. It also sold its surgical suction product line, bringing in $21.5 million on that sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Hospira was acquired by pharmaceutical giant
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   . By purchasing Hospira, Pfizer grew its Global Established Pharmaceutical segment, which specializes in sterile injectable products and biosimilars. Combined, the company will work to build a leading position in the two markets, the value of which are expected to grow to some $70 billion and $20 billion, respectively, by the year 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost immediately after the acquisition, Pfizer began selling off Hospira assets, partly to meet antitrust regulations and partly to divest some of Hospira's struggling operations. In February 2017, Pfizer sold Hospira Infusion Systems to
   <company id="10672">
    ICU Medical
   </company>
   for $1 billion. Other moves include the pending closures of Hospira's logistics centers in Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, as well as a manufacturing center in Boulder, Colorado.

   Though its purchase activities have slowed, Hospira in 2014 acquired a Brazil-based oncology distributor, Evolabis Produtos FarmacÃªuticos, adding more than a dozen oncology products to Hospira's portfolio in Brazil.
