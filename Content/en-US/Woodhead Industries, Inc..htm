  <p>
   Woodhead Industries got its start in 1922 when lighting salesman Daniel Woodhead designed a rubber-handled lamp that railroad workers favored over wood-handled lamps. The company grew by offering innovative products and custom manufacturing services and by acquiring businesses, such as electrical connections maker Brad Harrison (1969).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1980s Woodhead focused on international expansion, selling off its non-core businesses, including its telecommunications unit. It acquired the Nordic Group (hose reels, Canada) in 1985 and Akapp Electro Industrie (electrical systems for power transmission, the Netherlands) in 1993. Also in the early 1990s, Woodhead introduced a line of ergonomic workbenches (a new market niche for the company) in response to the rise in repetitive-stress injury claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   Woodhead continued its global push in 1995 with the purchase of France-based Elitec (industrial connectors and sensors), and in 1996 it began manufacturing in Japan. In 1997 CEO Mark DeWinter became chairman. Also the company expanded its UK subsidiary's automotive component manufacturing plant in Wales. That year Woodhead began shifting its focus from electrical safety products to the higher-growth market of providing industrial connectivity products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its international automation and controls businesses in 1998 by purchasing mPm S.r.l. (connectors for output devices, Italy) and SST (automated factory control devices, Canada). A year later it invested in Web-based automation software company Symphony Systems, a provider for the semiconductor industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark DeWinter retired as chairman and CEO at the end of 2000. President/COO Philippe Lemaitre succeeded him as CEO, while director Charles Denny became chairman. Lemaitre added the post of chairman in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Woodhead acquired Applicom International, a France-based software, interface cards, and communication connections manufacturer in 2001. In late 2002 Woodhead sold its AKAPP Electro Industries subsidiary to Fandstan Electric Group for $4.9 million. The following year the company sold part of its Aero-Motive unit (government hose reel business) to Cleveland Gear Company (a subsidiary of Vesper Corporation).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched a global electronic catalog, or e-catalog, in early 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Woodhead Industries was itself acquired in mid-2006 by Molex, the giant manufacturer of electronic and electrical connectors.
