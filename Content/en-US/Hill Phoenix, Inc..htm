   In 2015 Hill Phoenix's engineered systems segment acquired Barker Company and its sister company, Barker Sales and Service (collectively the Barker Company). The Barker Company, with estimated full-year revenue of $70 million, is based in Keosauqua, Iowa, and specializes in manufacturing refrigerated, non-refrigerated, and hot display cases. The Barker Company will become part of the Hill Phoenix Specialty Products Division and will enable the company to meet increasing demand for more specialized and highly customized products in the fast-growing specialty merchandiser segment.
