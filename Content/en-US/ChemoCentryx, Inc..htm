   The nucleus of ChemoCentryx's research is molecular cell secretions. The drug developer focuses on orally administered drugs targeting the body's chemokine system, a molecular network that regulates inflammatory and immune responses. Its lead candidate in clinical development is Vercirnon (formerly Traficet-EN), a potential treatment for Crohn's disease. ChemoCentryx's other pipeline candidates include possible treatments for type 2 diabetes, several kidney diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Early stage candidates target immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. ChemoCentryx was founded in 1997 and went public in 2012.

  <p>
   The company first filed paperwork to go public in 2007 but withdrew the registration in 2008 citing poor market conditions. In late 2011 ChemoCentryx felt conditions were sufficiently improved and it filed anew; the IPO was completed in early 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   ChemoCentryx is using the proceeds of the $45 million offering, along with $12 million in private share placements, to further develop their line of drug candidates, for working capital, and general corporate expenditures.

  <p>
   The company's candidates, which target specific receptors in the chemokine system, include CCX140 and CCX872 for diabetic kidney disease, CCX168 for a group of auto-immune diseases that destroy blood vessels in the kidneys with inflammation, Vercirnon for Crohn's, and CCX507 for IBD. It also has early stage candidates looking at auto-immune and oncology diseases including brain tumors called glioblastomas.

  <p>
   With no approved products, ChemoCentryx has yet to generate any product revenue. As of December 2013 it had an accumulated deficit of $173 million as it spends heavily on R&amp;D, something it plans to continue.

  <p>
   Like other drug development companies, ChemoCentryx must either produce, license, or purchase an approved treatment in order to reach profitability. The company plans to continue developing its pipeline while seeking commercialization partners for advanced products (including CCX140 in Europe). It has said it will retain all rights to specialty products while seeking partners for primary care treatments.

   Previously, the company was developing Traficet-EN (now Vercirnon) with

    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   . But the larger company returned all rights to ChemoCentryx in 2013.
