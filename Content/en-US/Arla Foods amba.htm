   Arla Foods has given Scandinavian dairy farmers a firm grip on Europe's milk business. The 13,500-member cooperative's consumer products include fluid milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, and cream. Its major milk brands are Lactofree and Cravendale; its butter and spreads include Anchor and Lurpak brands; and Apetina, BUKO, and Costello are among its cheese brands. Arla offers dairy ingredients and bacterial cultures for food manufacturers and agricultural use and supplies powdered milk and cheese products to markets across Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Arla Foods is also one of the world's largest manufacturers of organic products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Arla Foods operates through eight business divisions, most of which are tied to their geographic markets, and include: Global Categories &amp; Operations (GCO), Consumer United Kingdom (CUK), Consumer Sweden, Consumer Denmark (CDK), Consumer Finland (CFI), Consumer Central Europe, Consumer International (CIN) and Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI) .
  </p>
        <p>
   Global Categories &amp; Operations (GCO) carries the group's three global brands, which include Arla, Castello and Lurpak. While the Consumer United Kingdom (CUK) group is the largest revenue driver, Consumer Denmark (CDK) focuses on driving the company's milk volume (its core business) and making the company's operations lean and effective. Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI) develops and supplies nutritional and functional milk-based ingredients to food companies around the world.
  </p>
        <p>
   More than 40% of the group's total revenue comes from fresh dairy products (which includes milk, cream, cooking ingredients, and yogurt), while another 25% comes from cheese. The company's butter and spreads, and milk powder product categories each generate around 10% of sales.

        <p>
   Denmark-based Arla Foods sells its products worldwide. Nearly 30% of the group's total sales come from consumers in the UK region, while Sweden consumers generate another nearly 15% of sales for the company. Other major markets include countries from Central Europe, Denmark, Russia, Finland, and China. The 13,500 farmers that make up the cooperative are based out of seven countries including: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.

        <p>
   Arla Food's revenue jumped by 8% to €10.6 billion ($12.88 billion) in 2014, thanks mostly to sales increases in the company's CUK, Consumer Central Europe, and Consumer Denmark divisions. The company enjoyed organic growth of nearly 6% in its core markets thanks to price increases, and organic growth of nearly 15% in its growth markets (including Arla Foods). Higher revenue also pushed the company's net income up by nearly 7% to €320 million ($388.95 million).
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash from operations grew by 37% to €467 million ($567.63 million) in 2014, thanks to higher collections on trade receivables.

        <p>
   As part of its "2017 Strategy", Arla Foods wants to develop its top three global brands (Arla, Castello and Lurpak), increase its global dairy output, create growth outside of its core EU market, and streamline its operations to cut costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   The coop has been strategically increasing global awareness of its top brands in recent years through partnerships and marketing efforts. In early 2015, Arla Foods entered the Australian market though a joint-venture partnership with F. Mayer (creating Arla Foods Mayer Australia Pty Ltd.), with the goal of marketing, selling, and distributing its Castello cheese, Lurpak butter, and other Arla dairy products to Australian consumers.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014, the company relaunched the Arla brand in several markets worldwide, with plans to complete the integration of the new Arla brand platform by early 2015. Additionally in 2014, the coop merged with fellow dairy cooperative EGM Walhorn to boost its raw milk production, and add farmers from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands -- growing its member base to 13,500 dairy farmers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The group has also been aggressively investing more in growth markets to expand its revenue beyond its core EU markets. As of early 2015, the company's top investment targets included Russia, China, the Middle East, and Africa; Arla Foods aims to double its revenue from these areas from 10% to 20% of the group's total revenue by the end of 2017.
  </p>
        <p>
   Arla Food's cost-cutting and efficiency programs are designed to streamline production and optimizing processes, and lead to total savings of €330 million ($361.89 million) before the end of 2015.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In early 2015, Arla purchased Falbygdens Ost from the food company
   <company id="139740">
    Atria
   </company>
   , to expand its premium cheese product line in Sweden, and globally.
  </p>
        <p>
   In mid-2014, the company merged with the Netherlands-based dairy cooperative EGM Walhorn to expand its member-base, boost its raw milk production, and expand its export capabilities to markets outside of the European Union.

        <p>
   Formed by the 2000 merger of Arla (Sweden) and MD Foods (Denmark), the cooperative is strong in its home countries, but is looking for global growth. Already large in the UK, Arla Foods merged its UK operations with Express Dairies, another leading dairy processor in 2003, forming

   . Arla Foods UK has sold its Express Foodservice Business to

  </p>
        <p>
   A merger with Dutch milk supplier
   <company id="138050">
    Campina
   </company>
   (now
   <company id="92167">
    Koninklijke FrieslandCampina
   </company>
   ) was announced in 2004. Arla felt its strengths in Scandinavian countries and the UK would complement Campina's presence in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Russia. Dropping milk prices were the impetus for the companies' decision to combine forces. Arla's decision to drop its merger plans with Campina caused managing director Åke Modig to resign the next year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Arla Foods Canada made the jump from distribution to production with the 2004 purchase of National Cheese Company. In 2005 the group decided to close the imported cheese distribution business of Arla Foods UK because of small financial returns. However, after its decision to abandon the merger with Campina, the company focused on specialty cheeses for export markets and promoting its Lurpak brand.
  </p>
        <p>
   Choosing to trim chocolate from its diet in 2005, Arla Foods sold its AM Foods (foodservice chocolate and cappuccino mixes) to
   <company id="107166">
    Barry Callebaut
   </company>
   . It sold packaging subsidiary Danapak, which has plants in Denmark and Germany to focus on its core dairy operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company had considered the Middle East an emerging dairy market, but Arla Foods and other Danish companies were boycotted in the region following publication of cartoons of Muslim prophet Muhammad by a Danish newspaper in 2005. The boycott ended Arla's good trading relations across the region. Its Lurpak brand of butter had been a market leader in the region and had even held a 70% market share in the United Arab Emirates.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company made efforts to facilitate a resolution of the conflict and to re-establish its business in the region, but later stopped production for key Middle Eastern markets. As a result of the boycott, Arla was selling surplus milk at a loss. However, the boycott was lifted and its Lurpak butter and cheeses are back on the shelves in Dubai. Arla announced that the boycott of Danish products in the Middle East cost the company some DKK400 million (almost $71 million) during 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   Offsetting some of Arla's losses in the Middle East was its 2006 deal with discount retailer
   <company id="55154">
    Lidl
   </company>
   , wherein Arla supplies private-label organic milk and butter to about 3,500 Lidl retail stores in Germany. Arla sold its Swedish dessert subsidiary, Froedinge Mejeri, to Rieber &amp; Soen that year for an undisclosed amount. It acquired US specialty cheese producer (feta and havarti) White Clover Dairy and Danish cheesemaker Tholstrup that year as well.
  </p>
        <p>
   In order to strengthen Arla Food's market position in the Nordic area and internationally, in 2006 the company reorganized into four main business areas: Consumer Nordic, Consumer International, Consumer UK, and Global Ingredients. The reorganization was meant to strengthen Arla Food's market position in the Nordic area and internationally.
  </p>
        <p>
   As part of the reorganization, Arla sold UK home-delivery milk business Express Dairies to  Dairy Crest for some $61 million in 2006. Express had been part of
   <company id="57771">
    Arla Foods UK
   </company>
   . Due to greater-than-expected sales of feta and mozzarella, Arla invested some $74 million to expand two of its specialty-cheese plants. It acquired 30% of Finnish milk producer Ingman Foods.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2007 Arla sold its fresh pasta business, Pastella, to Danish food company, Beauvais, and also sold Crispy Foods to Kohberg Bread. It also sold subsidiary Delimo (a cheese importer) to one of Europe's largest dairy companies, France's
   <company id="54346">
    Groupe Lactalis
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   The company, which had owned 51% of Arla Foods UK since its 2003 merger with Express Dairies, acquired the remaining percentage of the UK operation in 2007.
