   This company's chickens have roads in three states to cross. Mountaire Farms operates poultry hatcheries and processing plants in several states, including Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina. Each week, the vertically integrated poultry processor produces more than 2 million pounds of fresh, frozen, and value-added chicken products for wholesale, foodservice, and private-label food customers. Mountaire Farms sells its chicken products throughout the US and overseas. The company owns feed mills across its operations for its own use and operates full-service grain elevators in Maryland and Delaware that handle corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley from local farmers.

   To keep up with demand, the company has had to expand capacity at its feed mills. In 2011 Mountaire Farms added 2,700 feet of track to its feed mill operation in Candor, North Carolina, allowing the poultry products company to unload some 90 trains within 15 hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also purchased Gavilon Grain in Townsend, Delaware, in 2012 to expand its business.

   Mountaire hoped to purchase the assets of competitor

    Allen Family Foods

   , which filed for bankruptcy in mid-2011; however, it lost the auction to South Korea-based Harim Holdings. Harim's bid of $48 million for Allen Family Foods beat out Mountaire's $30 million offer.
