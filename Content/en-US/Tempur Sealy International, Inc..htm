   Formerly Tempur-Pedic, Tempur Sealy International manufactures premium, pressure-relieving, temperature-sensitive mattresses, pillows, and other sleep products made from viscoelastic foam technology developed by
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   during the 1970s to help cushion astronauts during liftoff. Its TEMPUR, Sealy, Optimum, and Stearns &amp; Foster brands are sold in 100-plus countries through three distribution channels: retail (furniture and department stores), direct (online and company-owned stores), and other means (third-party distributors, hospitals and medical retailers). Amid declining sales in 2013, Tempur-Pedic bought
   <company id="40420">
    Sealy
   </company>
   to become Tempur Sealy.

  <p>
   Since its reorganization in 2015, Tempur Sealy now operates two segments based on geographic market. The company's North American segment generated more than 80% of the company's net sales during 2015, and consists of its Tempur and Sealy businesses in the US and Canada. The division comprises its US manufacturing facilities in Virginia and New Mexico, which cater to its US distribution unit and certain third-party distributors in the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tempur Sealy's International segment (20% of sales) counts all of the company's distribution subsidiaries and third-party distributors outside of North America. It has manufacturing facilities in Denmark, Argentina, and Mexico, as well as warehouses in Germany, the UK, and France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product-wise, bedding products generated more than 90% of net sales in 2015, and include mattresses, foundations and adjustable bases. Its other products make up the remainder of sales, and include pillows, sheet sets, mattress toppers, and other bed-related accessories.

  <p>
   Based in Lexington, Kentucky, Tempur Sealy International sells its products in 100-plus countries. More than 75% of its sales were generated in the US in 2015, while another more than 5% of sales came from Canada.

  <p>
   The company sells through two main distribution channels: Retail and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the Retail channel, which brought in more than 90% of net sales in 2015, the company sells its products to furniture and bedding retailers, department stores, and warehouse clubs, among other retailers. Tempur Sealy's top two customers --
   <company id="124361">
    Mattress Firm
   </company>
   , and Sleepy's -- accounted for 25% of net sales combined in 2015. Its top five customers contributed roughly 39% of net sales, combined. (Tempur Sealy and Mattress Firm severed their relationship in 2017.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Tempur Sealy's Other channel, which contributed nearly 10% to net sales in 2015, sells directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms, company-owned stores, and call centers, as well as indirectly to third-party, healthcare, and hospitality companies and contributed to the remainder of net sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been spending more on advertising in recent years. Tempur Sealy spent $360 million on advertising in 2015, up from $327 million and $274.2 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tempur Sealy International net sales have more than doubled since 2011 thanks to the company's acquisition of Sealy, a strengthening US economy, and a growing retail presence. The company has struggled to grow its profits, however, due to high interest expenses from long-term debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mattress maker's sales climbed 5% to $3.15 billion during 2015 mostly thanks as its North American segment grew 7% with higher Tempur and Sealy brand sales in the US that stemmed from new product introductions and pricing actions. Sales declined in the mid single digits in the International segment due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite revenue growth in 2015, Tempur Sealy's net income tumbled 33% to $74 million, primarily because it paid $60.5 million more in income taxes as in 2014 it had received tax breaks related to earnings repatriation. The company's operating cash levels rose 4% to $234.2 million for the year despite the earnings decline thanks to favorable changes in working capital.

  <p>
   Tempur Sealy International believes it has plenty of room to steal market share away from spring mattress makers, given that non-innerspring mattresses made up just 30% of the US mattress market as recently as 2014 according to ISPA. Indeed, with new product introductions helping to boost sales for the company's North American division by double digits in 2014 and 7% in 2015, the company pledged to drive more growth in 2016 through more investments in new products, marketing, and other initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   That's why the mattress maker isn't one to rest when it comes to new product developments, and regularly rolls out new models of mattresses, products, or updates for use around the world. In 2016, for example, Tempur Sealy launched its Stearns &amp; Foster Reserve Collection equipped with its Hybrid Pillow Top featuring its Nano Comfort Quilt Layer. In 2015, the company introduced its TEMPUR-Flex mattress collection, which combines TEMPUR material with a precision coil support layer, removable cover, and a cooling SmartClimate system. Also in recent years, it's introduced mattresses featuring its TEMPUR-Breeze technology, designed to produce a cooling effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tempur Sealy is also expanding globally and looking to increase global awareness of its premium brands around the world. In 2014, Tempur Sealy made its move to expand into Europe, as its International segment acquired the Sealy brand rights in the region and announced plans to source production of select Sealy products to an Eastern European manufacturer and sell them to certain European markets in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mattress maker has been moving away from spring-based mattresses in recent years. In 2014, the company doubled down on its non-innerspring bed push by ending its production of innerspring components in the US, selling three innerspring component production facilities to

   .

  <p>
   Following the merger of Tempur-Pedic with former-rival Sealy in March 2013, the company changed its name to Tempur Sealy International. Together, Tempur-Pedic and Sealy created a $2.7 billion bedding company and give their iconic brands more traction globally.
