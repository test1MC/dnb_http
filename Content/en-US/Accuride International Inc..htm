   Business at Accuride International is on a finely crafted roll. The company is the world's largest manufacturer of ball bearing slides. Its lineup makes it easier to open and close drawers in residential and office furniture, or the doors of appliances and electronic enclosures, or rack mounts. The company's slides are also made for automotive accessories, including storage units and arm rests, and industrial equipment, such as cash registers and assembly lines. Accuride builds and maintains its own tools and machinery for manufacturing its products. Founded in 1962 by Fred Jordan, the company remains family owned.
