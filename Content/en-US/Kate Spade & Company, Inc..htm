   new york and Jack Spade banners. The company operates about 220 specialty shops and outlet stores in the US and abroad, and also sells apparel and accessories online and to department stores. It also owns the Adelington Design Group and supplies
   <company id="10810">

   stores with the Liz Claiborne and Monet jewelry lines. To reflect its mono-brand focus, the company (formerly Fifth &amp; Pacific) changed its name in 2014 and discontinued its once-premium brands of Liz Claiborne, Juicy Couture, and Lucky Brand.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   New York-based Kate Spade &amp; Company rings up about 80% of its sales in the US. The retailer operates about 168 specialty and outlet stores in the US and another 35 overseas, including about 50 locations in Japan.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Kate Spade works through three main segments. Kate Spade North America (83% of net sales) consists of the kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brands in North America. Kate Spade International (15%) consists of kate spade new york and JACK SPADE brands in international markets (principally in Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), Europe and Latin America). Finally, its Adelington Design Group segment (2%) offers exclusive arrangements to supply jewelry for its Liz Claiborne and Monet brands and license the Lizwear and Liz Claiborne New York brands.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net revenue spiked by 9% from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to a rise in Kate Spade North America revenue. This growth was driven by increased direct-to-consumer and wholesale net sales from its Kate Spade New York brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   After surging the last few years, Kate Spade saw its net income nosedive by 89% in 2015 mainly due to a massive spike in deferred tax liabilities for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The real story on Kate Spade's balance sheet for 2015, however, was its cash flow from operations, which absolutely skyrocketed by by 635%, mainly due to favorable changes in working capital as a result of increases in accounts receivable.

   The company has narrowed its focus considerably, having sold in 2014 its Lucky Brand Jeans business to an affiliate of
   <company id="55199">
    Leonard Green &amp; Partners
   </company>
   for $225 million. Earlier in the year it sold
   <company id="113995">

   to Authentic Brands Group for $195 million. Following the sale of Lucky, the company is left with
   <company id="109387">

   , for which it has big plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company discontinued its Kate Space Saturday as a standalone business and also announced a new business model for Jack Spade to leverage the distribution network of its retail partners and expand its e-commerce platform. All of Kate Space Saturday's company-owned and three-partnered store locations were closed in addition to Jack Spade's company-owned stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Kate Spade and Reliance Brands Limited, a renowned retail partner-of-choice in India, signed an agreement to bring the Kate Spade New York brand to India through a long-term distribution and retail license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reliance Brands Limited will have the exclusive distribution rights to the Kate Spade New York brand brand in the country. The deal was part of company's strategy to expand geographically and build global brand engagement.

  <p>
   In 1975 Liz Claiborne, a dress designer in Jonathan Logan's Youth Guild division, had a vision of stylish, sporty, affordable clothes for working women. Unable to sell the concept to her employer, Claiborne quit and, with husband Arthur Ortenberg and partners Jerome Chazen and Leonard Boxer, founded Liz Claiborne in 1976 with $250,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Born just as women were beginning to flood the workforce, Liz Claiborne became an immediate success by rescuing them from drab business suits. Making money its first year, Liz Claiborne remained the fastest-growing, most profitable US apparel maker in the 1980s. In 1981 it went public and by 1986 had made the
   <i>
    FORTUNE
   </i>
   500, with sales topping $800 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded into men's clothing (Claiborne, 1985), cosmetics (Liz Claiborne, a 1986 joint venture with Avon; in 1988 it acquired full rights to the line), women's plus sizes (Elisabeth, 1989), and knit sportswear (Liz &amp; Co., 1989). Higher-priced sportswear by in-house designer Dana Buchman was introduced in 1987. Liz Claiborne moved into retailing the following year, opening First Issue boutiques.
  </p>
  <p>
   Claiborne and Ortenberg began withdrawing from the business side in 1989 and left the board the next year. About this time the retail business began to slow down as a recession loomed. In addition, baby boomers' clothing tastes began to shift toward comfort and versatility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Liz Claiborne acquired the Crazy Horse, Russ Togs, Villager, and Red Horse brand names in 1992 and took over 16 outlet stores from bankrupt Russ Togs. The new fashion realities and a lack of differentiation between its lines caught up with the company in 1993, when earnings plunged.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response, Liz Claiborne brought in VF veteran Paul Charron as COO. Named CEO in 1995, Charron closed the First Issue stores and moved production from US union plants to foreign factories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996, as sales picked up, the company began selling its repositioned First Issue line through Sears. It launched Emma James (moderately priced career separates) in 1997. Also that year Liz Claiborne signed its first agreement to produce apparel under another company's brand name: jeans and activewear under Donna Karan International's DKNY label.
  </p>
  <p>
   Retailer JUSCO (now AEON) of Japan and Liz Claiborne created a joint venture in 1998 to open stores in Japan, and it signed an agreement with Candie's to make a line of Candie's fragrances and cosmetics. In response to sagging sales, the company took a $27 million charge that year to close 30 retail stores and cut 400 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charron set out to give Liz Claiborne a broader appeal. In 1999 the company bought trendy Laundry (women's sportswear and dresses), an 85% stake in women's sportswear firm Segrets (Sigrid Olsen), teen-targeted Lucky Brand Dungarees, and a minority stake in Kenneth Cole Productions.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2000 about 20% of Liz Claiborne's sales came from non-Liz lines. Increasing that percentage even further, the company bought fashion jeweler Monet Group for about $40 million. Also that year Liz Claiborne licensed a children's line called Liz Claiborne Kids to Baby Togs. The company acquired Dutch fashion and accessories designer and retailer Mexx Group in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Liz Claiborne bought Mexx Canada and Ellen Tracy in 2002. (It sold Ellen Tracy in early 2008.) The next year the company bought Travis Jeans (now named
   <company id="113995">
    Juicy Couture
   </company>
   ), maker of Juicy Couture upscale casualwear and jeans. In an effort to expand its young men's clothing lines, Liz Claiborne also purchased
   <company id="108268">
    Sport Brands International
   </company>
   's Enyce brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Liz Claiborne stepped up production of home furnishings in response to the news that
   <company id="53053">
    Martha Stewart
   </company>
   had become a convicted felon and in the hopes of taking up some of that company's dropped market share. At around the same time, the company made a foray into the high-end luggage arena with a licensing agreement with luggage maker Bandanco Enterprises for the design and production of luggage under the Liz Claiborne and Claiborne names. Also in 2004 Liz Claiborne bought the 30-year-old Tapemeasure label to morph it into a value-conscious contemporary brand. Liz Claiborne ended 2004 with a round of 165 holiday pink slips.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 and 2006 the firm extended its reach across North America. It acquired California-inspired men's and women's apparel maker C&amp;C California. It also inked a deal with Bardwil Industries, which designs and makes table linens and kitchen textiles for the Liz Claiborne Home Collection. It expanded the Liz Claiborne Home collection in late 2005 through a licensing deal with C.R. Gibson, which will design and manufacture stationery, photo albums, recipe boxes, gift cards, and more. Also in 2005 Liz Claiborne was brand-focused. It rolled out six mid-level brands at retailers such as
   <company id="137766">
    Sears
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10810">
    JCPenney
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11339">
    Kohl's
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 a deal with Nourison brought Liz Claiborne area and accent rugs that coordinate with the company's home and furniture collections. That year Liz Claiborne picked up Vancouver, Canada-based Westcoast Contempo Fashions Limited and Mac and Jac Holdings Limited. The deal was inked at a purchase price of $23.6 million with additional payments based on earnings for fiscal years 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Company namesake Liz Claiborne died at the age of 78 in mid-2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2012 the Liz Claiborne changed its name to Fifth &amp; Pacific Companies and began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "FNP." In February 2014 it changed its name again, this time to Kate Spade &amp; Company, to reflect its mono-brand focus.
