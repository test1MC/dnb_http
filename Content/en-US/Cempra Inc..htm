   Cempra isn't afraid of a little staph, or pneumonia for that matter. The company is in the clinical stages of developing antibiotics that treat bacterial infectious diseases, especially ones that affect the skin and respiratory tract. One of its lead candidates, Taksta, is an oral treatment that is being tested against linezolid (sold by
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   as Zyvox), the only oral antibiotic currently
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved for the treatment of a drug-resistant form of staph known as MRSA. Its other main candidate, Solithera (solithromycin), is being developed for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. It is licensed to Toyama Chemical for marketing in Japan.

  <p>
   Cempra has an agreement with
   <company id="150448">
    US Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   ' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to evaluate and develop solithromycin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children as well as infections caused by anthrax, tularemia, and other bioterror threat pathogens.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also has a licensing agreement with
   <company id="109634">
    The Scripps Research Institute
   </company>
   , which holds the right to make, use, sell, and import certain Cempra antibiotics as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

  <p>
   The company does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities but rather relies on third-party contract manufacturers such as
   <company id="159609">
    Wockhardt
   </company>
   to make all of its raw materials, APIs, and finished products.

   Cempra plans to sell solithromcyin in the US through its own sales and marketing teams. Toyama is licensed to make, use, and sell solithromcyin products in Japan. Taksta and solithromycin will be marketed to both hospitals and primary care physicians.

   As a clinical-stage firm, Cempra has yet to generate revenue from product sales. Its revenues have come from government contracts and its licensing agreement with Toyama Chemical. In 2015, revenue rose 79% to $27 million from these two sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, net loss increased 48% to $91 million that year as research and development activities ramped up and general and administrative costs increased. As of the end of 2015, Cempra had an accumulated deficit of some $319 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash outflow from operations rose 79% to $88 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Cempra's development of both Taksta and solithromycin is its attempt to cash in on unmet medical needs in the areas of staph and pneumonia. As each disease grows more resistant to existing drugs, "superbug" forms start to emerge, thereby reigniting demand for stronger treatments. Respiratory tract infections are commonly treated with prescribed azithromycin (also sold by Pfizer under the brand name Zithromax and available as a generic). However, it is estimated that in the US 30% of pneumococci, the primary pathogen involved in respiratory tract infections, are resistant to azithromycin and earlier-generation macrolide drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The same is true of staph. Hospitals are seeing rising rates of drug-resistant MRSA infections in US emergency rooms. In addition to oral antibiotic linezolid, the most common treatments for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), including MRSA, are daptomycin (sold under the brand Cubicin by
   <company id="51620">
    Cubist Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ) and a generic called vancomycin. Cempra believes there is clear and potentially lucrative opportunity to tap into the US market with Taksta, a novel and proprietary oral dosing regimen of fusidic acid. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that has already been approved and sold in Europe and other countries outside of the US for several decades.
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of pre-clinical work, Cempra's goal is to develop Taksta and solithromycin for other indications, such as bacterial urethritis, chronic bronchitis, gastritis, sinusitis, and middle ear infection, as well as possibly malaria and tuberculosis. To date, the company has no revenues to speak of.
