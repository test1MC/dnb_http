   Swedish Match continues to light up the tobacco industry one swipe at a time. The firm is one of the world's largest makers of matches and one of the top manufacturers of disposable lighters (Cricket brand), behind

   subsidiary Tokai. Swedish Match is big in smokeless tobacco, too. Its Red Man chewing tobacco is the #1 product in the US market, where it generates about a quarter of its sales. The company's other tobacco offerings include pipe tobacco, snuff, and a variety of cigars, including well-known brands Garcia y Vega, La Paz, Willem II, Hajenius, Macanudo, and White Owl. The company owns top US premium cigar seller

  <p>
   Swedish match king Ivar Kreuger built an empire from his family's match factory, which he took over in the early 1900s. His shady dealings helped create a fortune. (Kreuger was known to send secret agents to make lowball offers on companies he wanted to buy to make his bids look better.) His reign ended when he killed himself in 1932 after his deceptive practices were uncovered. His rivals, the Wallenberg family, bought the company and guided it through the next six decades. In 1988 the Wallenbergs sold Swedish Match to Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags, a forestry company. In 1992 Swedish Match was taken over by Procordia, a company jointly owned by Sweden and AB Volvo; Volvo later took full control.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company reorganized its business along product lines instead of by geography and history. That year Swedish Match was spun off from Volvo and became a publicly traded company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was hit hard in 1997 by a more than 50% tax hike levied on cigarettes by the Swedish government. (Sweden later lowered the tax after encountering smuggling problems.) The company was then forced by the government to give up sales and marketing of Prince cigarettes (#2 in Sweden) to ensure fair competition. Also that year Swedish Match bought R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's cigar manufacturer in Finland.
  </p>

   Lennart Sunden became president and CEO in November 1998. Swedish Match was jolted by its first legal case similar to the US tobacco wars when a smoker filed suit in 1998 claiming that the company's cigarettes gave her cancer. The company sold its cigarette business -- which, led by the Blend brand, controlled 35% of the Swedish market -- to Austria Tabak in 1999 for $557 million. Later that year Swedish Match bought El Credito Cigars and 80% of South African tobacco firm Leonard Dingler.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2000 Swedish Match paid $200 million for a 64% stake in mass-market cigar maker General Cigar, maker of the Garcia y Vega and Tiparillo brands. The next month the US Federal Trade Commission blocked the company's $165 million purchase of National Tobacco's chewing tobacco brands (Beech-nut, Durango, Trophy, and Havana Blossom) for violating antitrust laws. In mid-2000 Swedish Match formed a joint venture with gum products manufacturer Gum Tech to produce and distribute non-tobacco nicotine products. In 2001 the company purchased BAT's pipe tobacco business.

   Chief executive Sven Hindrikes, who retired in 2008, was replaced by veteran executive Lars Dahlgren as Swedish Match president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2009 the company completed the sale of its South African operation -- Swedish Match South Africa (Proprietary) Limited -- to Philip Morris International for 1.75 billion ZAR ($229 million). (The company's South Africa businesses logged sales of 687 million ZAR in 2008.)
