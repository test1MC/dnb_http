   Among the world's largest makers of ethanol, Abengoa Bioenergy is the only truly global ethanol producer, with more than a dozen plants in the US, Europe, and South America. Its plants have a production capacity of 842 million gallons a year, (400 million gallons Europe, 370 million gallons in the US, and 62 million gallons in Brazil). The
   <company id="101495">
    Abengoa
   </company>
   subsidiary's primary product is fuel-grade ethanol, which, when blended with gasoline, raises oxygen levels and cuts exhaust emissions pollutants such as carbon monoxide. The parent company began liquidation procedures in 2015, including selling its US assets.

        <p>
   In addition to producing ethanol, Abengoa Bioenergy operates bioethanol, sugar, and electricity production plants. A by-product obtained from the ethanol process - dried distillers grains or DDG - is used mainly as a feed supplement for meat and milk cattle. One of the company's goals is to expand the range of applications for DDG to other markets, such as live poultry or pork.

   The company develops biofuels for transportation, as well as bioethanol and biodiesel among others, plus chemical bioproducts which use biomass (cereals, sugar cane, cellulose biomass, oleaginous seeds, etc.) as raw material. Biofuels are used in the production of gasoline additives (ETBE) as well as in direct mixtures with gasoline or diesel oil. Abengoa Bioenergy is also developing new biofuels (kerosene for aviation and biodiesel from sugar).
  </p>
        <p>
   Abengoa Bioenergy is a leader in the development of new technologies for production of cellulosic ethanol. It has produced cellulosic ethanol from a biomass pilot facility in York, Nebraska and a demonstration scale facility in Salamanca, Spain, and with the

        <p>
   The company also works with commercial partners such as

        <p>
   Stan Larson founded American Gasohol Refiners in 1979. Incorporated in 1980, the firm completed its first plant, in Colwich, Kansas, in 1982. In 1984 the company was renamed High Plains, and Raymond Friend and others were hired to make extensive design changes to the company's plant, which returned to service in 1986.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1992 sales were boosted after the Federal Oxygen Program required the addition of oxygenates such as ethanol to gasoline during the winter to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. High Plains purchased equipment from two defunct ethanol refineries and built a plant in York, Nebraska, which began production in 1994.
  </p>
        <p>
   The next year the Federal RFG Program went into effect, and the Treasury Department extended the ethanol excise tax exemption to ETBE, an oxygenate derived from ethanol. But in 1996 high corn prices forced High Plains to shut down its plants for several months. In 1997 Larson stepped down and was replaced as chairman by Daniel Skolness; Gary Smith became CEO in 1998.
  </p>
        <p>
   Meanwhile, High Plains bought a closed plant in New Mexico in 1997 and began operating it in 1998. After running into financial problems, High Plains restructured its debt in 1999.
  </p>
        <p>
   To reduce its dependence on ethanol, the firm launched a pilot program in 2000 to produce glycerol for use in the cosmetics, pet food, and pharmaceuticals industries. (The project was suspended in 2001 because of difficulties in reaching full production levels.) Also in 2000 the company made an agreement to sell its New Mexico facility, but the deal fell through in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   High Plains agreed in 2001 to be acquired by Spanish environmental engineering and construction firm
   <company id="101495">
    Abengoa
   </company>
   . The deal was completed in 2002, and Abengoa changed High Plains' name to Abengoa Bioenergy a year later.
