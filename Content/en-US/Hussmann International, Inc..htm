  <p>
   Hussmann's growth strategy includes the regular introduction of innovative products in areas such as merchandising, energy efficiency and sustainability, food quality and integrity, refrigeration, design and engineering, service and installation, and retail.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched EcoShine Quick Connect LED lights for Service Merchandisers, and the Freedom Line Narrow Footprint Reach-In Case, designed specifically to answer the needs of small format stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Hussmann opened a new 5,520 sq. ft. Food Retail Showroom at the Hussmann facility in Suwanee, Georgia, which features products such as Hussmann's newest refrigerated display merchandisers from its Chino, California; Bridgeton, Missouri; and Monterrey, Mexico facilities. (In 2013 Hussmann also introduced the Entyce line of island merchandisers, EcoVision II Plus doors, and full line of EcoShine II Plus LED lights).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also grows through strategic alliances. In 2014 it teamed up with Marlin Business Services to allow that company to provide financing services to Hussmann's food service and food retailer customers in the US and Canada. Growing its refrigeration system product portfolio, that year the company also formed an alliance with Systemes LMP, of Quebec, Canada, to provide customized solutions for COâ‚‚ transcritical refrigeration systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of strengthening its relationship with food retailers across North America, in 2013 Hussman signed up Hefco, LLC to represent the products and services portfolio of Hussmann to a select group of customers throughout the US Southeast.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, REMCO, Inc. (a Hussmann distributor since 2010) expanded its service area in the Northeast to cover Maryland and Delaware.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 subsidiary Krack sold the assets of its Krack industrial business to SGS Refrigeration Inc., and retained ownership of its commercial business; such as coils, condensers, condensing units and custom engineered products using halogenated and similar refrigerants. The move allows Krack to focus its efforts on serving existing and new customers in the commercial refrigeration market.

  <p>
   In 2012, responding to the merchandising and energy saving needs of its customers, Hussmann entered into a co-development alliance with Nualight Ltd to provide visual merchandising products for food retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it opened new retail innovation center, known as the Global Hub in Bridgeton, Missouri.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hussmann was a subsidiary of industrial giant
   <company id="10785">
    Ingersoll-Rand
   </company>
   until 2011, when turnaround specialist
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   purchased a 60% stake in Hussmann for $370 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1906 by Harry Hussmann. It produced the first patented meat display case, as well as the first frozen food case, for Clarence Birdseye.
