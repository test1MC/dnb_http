   For Russell Stover, life really
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   a box of chocolates. As the largest maker of boxed chocolates in the US, its Whitman Sampler and other boxed candies are its bread and butter and recognizable by most moms. Russell Stover also sells hard candies and jellies that are bagged or individually wrapped, as well as sugar-free candy, such as its sugarless version of Pangburn's Millionaires. The firm's candies are sold by 70,000-plus retail outlets in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico, and in more than 20 other countries, including Canada and the UK. The candymaker operates 40-plus company-owned Russell Stover Candies shops and kiosks in the US and Canada. Swiss chocolate maker

   Russell Stover uses licensing agreements to give additional traction to its candies and a foothold in new niches. To market to younger customers, it has inked a licensing deal to use Beanie Babies to peddle its chocolates. To allow those on

   to enjoy a piece of chocolate on occasion, Russell Stover developed a Whitman's candy under license from the weight loss company that cost consumers one point on its PointsPlus program. The Russell Stover division also offers a line of low-carb candies called Net Carb and Private Reserve, an upscale chocolate.

   To compete on the retail front, Russell Stover is updating its company-owned stores to provide a boutique shopping experience. In addition to chocolates, handmade fudge, and other candies, the stores sell frozen custard and have fully-equipped espresso bars. It also sells candy online.

        <p>
   Russell William Stover began selling Mrs. Stover's Bungalow Candies with his wife, Clara, in 1923. Russell had more than 10 years of experience in the candy industry, including a 1921-23 partnership with Christian Nelson, who created the I-Scream bar (chocolate-coated ice cream). Russell changed the name to Eskimo Pie, and the two did well selling the patented item until look-alikes started popping up; the patent was eventually declared invalid, and Russell sold his interest and moved to Denver.
  </p>
        <p>
   There the Stovers' homemade candies were an instant hit, and by 1925 they were selling their candies in seven local stores. That year they opened candy factories in Denver and in Kansas City, Missouri, to keep up with demand. With Russell as president and Clara as VP, Mrs. Stover's flourished through the rest of the decade and even managed to turn a profit during the lean times of the Depression. A third factory opened in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1942, and the company's name was changed to Russell Stover Candies a year later.
  </p>
        <p>
   By the time Russell died in 1954, the company was selling about 11 million pounds of candy a year through about 2,000 department stores and 40 Russell Stover Candies shops. The Stover family and partners carried on until 1960, when they sold the business to Louis Ward, then president of the Ward Paper Box Co., for about $7 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Evidently Ward enjoyed boxing chocolates more than making boxes, because he took the company national, expanding sales on the East Coast and building a factory in Clarksville, Virginia, in 1969. Ward maintained the use of higher-cost small-batch production processes and continued, in many cases, using recipes unchanged since the 1940s. The firm used marketing to sweeten its sales in the 1970s and 1980s, introducing heart-shaped boxes, cherry cordials, and miniature chocolates. By the mid-1980s Russell Stover was the king of boxed chocolates. The company soon diversified into a wide range of Easter basket items and gift packs. In the late 1980s Russell Stover began roasting its own nuts and established a candy school.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1993 the senior Ward retired after suffering a stroke, and his sons stepped in. That year the company acquired Whitman's Candies. Candy-bar sales had flattened in the early 1990s, and big players such as Mars and Hershey began going after Russell Stover's market by introducing boxed chocolate products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Ward brothers fought back. They began licensing the rights to use artwork and cartoon characters in 1994 and opened new plants in Abilene (1995) and Iola, Kansas (1997). The firm introduced bagged candy the following year. In 1999 the company jumped into the candy bar market with a version of the s'more -- a sticky sandwich of graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate traditionally made around campfires.
  </p>
        <p>
   Russell Stover acquired the trademarks of bankrupt Pangburn Candy Co., makers of Millionaires-brand boxed chocolates in 1999. It also completed a 462,000-sq.-ft. candy plant and kitchen in Corsicana, Texas, the company's fourth new plant in three years. In 2000 Russell Stover closed its plant in Marion, South Carolina. In response to news reports of children working as slaves on Ivory Coast cocoa bean farms, Russell Stover co-president Thomas Ward said in 2001 that the company's supplier contracts forbid the use of child labor. The company also closed its Clarksville, Virginia, factory that year.
