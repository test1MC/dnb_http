   Sometimes it pays to be vain in the vane business. PCC Airfoils, a subsidiary of
   <company id="14463">
    Precision Castparts
   </company>
   , manufactures geometry blades, vanes, and vane segments used in the high-temperature turbines of commercial and military jet engines and power generation equipment. The company's products use both directionally solidified and single crystal casting to engineer the vanes, or airfoils, to withstand the increasingly high temperatures demanded by the aerospace industry. The temperatures are increasingly high as a result of the more and more common demand for higher performing and more fuel efficient aircraft.
