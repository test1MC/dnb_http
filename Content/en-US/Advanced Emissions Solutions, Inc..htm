   Advanced Emissions Solutions wants to make "clean coal" more than just a marketing term. The company makes environmental technology systems and specialty chemicals to reduce emissions at coal-burning power plants. It offers integrated mercury control systems, as well as flue gas conditioning and combustion aid chemicals. Advanced Emissions Solutions provides consulting and testing services and mercury measurement equipment. It also has a joint venture with NexGen Refined Coal to market technology that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides and mercury from some treated coals. The company has three reportable segments: Refined Coal, Emission Control, and CO2 Capture.

  <p>
   Advanced Emissions Solutions took itself private in 2103.

  <p>
   The Refined Coal segment (92% of Advanced Emissions Solutions' 2012 revenues) includes revenues from coal facilities and sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Emission Control segment includes revenues from the supply of emissions control systems including powdered activated carbon injection systems, and dry sorbent injection systems to reduce emissions of pollutants (including particulate matter, SO2, NOx, mercury, and acid gases) and from the licensing of technology and its consulting services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CO2 Capture segment generates revenues from the CO2 capture and control market, including projects co-funded by the
   <company id="138711">
    Department of Energy
   </company>
   (DOE) and private industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Emissions Solutions' four subsidiaries are Advanced Emissions Solutions and ADA Intellectual Property, LLC (neither of which had operations in 2012); BCSI; and ADA Environmental Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Emissions Solutions also holds 42.5% of Clean Coal Solutions, a Colorado limited liability company. The joint venture's partners include an affiliate of NexGen Resources, and an affiliate of

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by almost 300% in 2012, primarily due to the increased rental income from leased Refined Coal facilities, and higher Refined Coal sales from raw coal purchases that Clean Coal Solutions operated on its own account.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emission Control revenues increased due to increased systems and equipment sales, and flue gas chemicals and services. This was partially offset by lower consulting revenues as a result of potential clients deferring compliance work until 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Emissions Solutions' net loss decreased by 34% in 2012 thanks to higher revenues, a decrease in legal and settlement costs associated with its arbitration and litigation, and higher net income from unconsolidated entities as a result of the relinquishment of its interest in ADA Carbon Solutions in late 2011. This was partially offset by the absence of a deferred income tax benefit.

  <p>
   Advanced Emissions Solutions sees the activated carbon market growing rapidly as coal-fired power plants in 19 states and four Canadian provinces move to meet mercury mitigation regulations, and as other governments promulgate new rules.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it had several consulting R&amp;D contracts funded by the DOE, industry groups, and Advanced Emissions Solutions, aimed at controlling mercury emissions through dry sorbent injection systems, providing CO2 capture, and supporting other Refined Coal and Emission Control activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the Clean Coal Solutions joint venture finalized a contract for a fifth Refined Coal facility with a new  investor, with a value for Advanced Emissions Solutions of $10 million. The JV subsequently leased two additional Refined Coal facilities to an existing coal investor for $14 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 the company spent $2 million in cash and $3 million (in payouts over time) to acquire the assets of Bulk Conveyor Specialist, a maker of systems coal-fired power plants use to reduce acid gas emissions. The acquisition includes a manufacturing facility and Bulk Conveyor Services, which provides testing and related services. The purchase positions Advanced Emissions Solutions to take advantage of upcoming
   <company id="130205">
    EPA
   </company>
   mandates to reduce the level of acid gas emissions from coal-fired plants. The assets are held in a wholly-owned subsidiary BCSI.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition increases the company's market leading position in commercial acid gas control, and allows the company to vertically-integrate its Emissions Control business operations, including expanding its capacity to supply Activated Carbon Injection systems.
