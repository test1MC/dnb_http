   FIJI Water proves that it's hip to be square. The premium water, which is sourced from an artesian aquifer at the edge of a rainforest, is available in square bottles at retail food merchants and in luxury hotels, spas, and restaurants in 50 countries. Sourced and bottled on Viti Levu, the largest of the Republic of Fiji's islands, the water has garnered the attention of celebrity chefs and also made its way to the set of popular television programs and movies, including ABC's
   <em>
    Desperate Housewives.
   </em>
   The company, which sells genuine silver sleeves for the water bottles on its website, also offers home delivery of its water throughout the continental US. FIJI Water is part of

   Los Angeles-based FIJI Water enjoys a global reach, operating in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Western Europe, and Asia/Pacific. It serves more than 50 countries. It's bottled at the source -- in the remote Yaqara Valley on the island of Viti Levu.

  <p>
   Operating on the island of Fiji for years, Roll International has been faced with hurdles at the source of its namesake water that ultimately spurred the company to diversify FIJI Water's portfolio. Unhappy with a major government tax increase on Fiji, Roll International ceased operations in the South Pacific nation for a short time in 2010 and later reopened the FIJI Water plant, agreeing to comply with a tax increase imposed by Fiji's military-led government. The nation's prime minister asserted that FIJI Water has paid "minimal corporate taxes since it was set up." As a result of the tax increases, FIJI Water remains skeptical about continuing with construction contracts in Fiji.
  </p>
  <p>
   To this end, FIJI Water has expanded its premium water business into premium wine. Through a purchase Roll International made in 2010, FIJI Water also maintains the operations of Justin Vineyards &amp; Winery, located in Paso Robles, California, and oversees its founders and other executives. The water firm is leveraging Justin's winemaking expertise while sharing its global sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the winery purchase, FIJI Water has concentrated on expanding its business and extending its reach abroad. The company bought New Zealand's SpringFresh Limited in 2008 as part of an expansion strategy to better serve customers in the South Pacific. SpringFresh's water, like FIJI's, is sourced from an artesian aquifer.

   As part of its business, FIJI partners with environmental organization Conversation International. Through the alliance, they're focused on preserving the purity and biological wealth of the Fiji islands.

   FIJI Water was founded in 1996 by David Gilmour, who liked to say the company's water is the purest on earth because it's sourced far from man-made pollutants.

   Roll International, known for its POM elixir, acquired FIJI Water in 2004. The same year it won the
