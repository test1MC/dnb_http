   Big Ass Fan Company, the name says it all. Delta T Corporation, doing business as Big Ass Fans, makes six-to-24 foot diameter ceiling fans. The size of the fans allow them to move massive amounts of air over large spaces while the foils (or blades) moves at a slow to moderate speed. Applications for the company's oversized products include environmental control (circulating hot or cold air) in immense spaces such as warehouses, manufacturing facilities, retail spaces, institutional buildings, or athletic stadiums. The company was founded in 1999.
