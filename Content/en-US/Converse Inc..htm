   With its roots as a popular basketball shoe worn by professionals, Converse has morphed under
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   into a fashionable footwear maker for those off the court, too. It has sold some 750 million pairs of its classic Chuck Taylor All Star canvas basketball shoes, which appeal to consumers ranging from kids to clothing designers. It also licenses its name to sports apparel makers. Converse produces products under the One Star, Chuck Taylor All Star, and Jack Purcell names. It sells them through its own stores and through retailers the likes of

    Target
   </company>
   and even
   <company id="138089">
    DSW
   </company>
   . Converse operates as a separate unit from NIKE's competing sports brands, reining in the kitsch value of Converse's vintage Chuck Taylor brand.

  <p>
   Converse is recognized as a top contributor among a handful of NIKE's brands. To this end, NIKE divested its big-name
   <company id="110241">
    Cole Haan
   </company>
   and
   <company id="102689">
    Umbro
   </company>
   units to focus on growing the NIKE, Jordan, Converse, and Hurley brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   Converse counts its strategy of regularly rolling out new products to keep consumers enticed to keep adding Converse shoes to their closets. The rise can be attributed to increased consumer demand in the US and internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   What has helped to spur sales increases is Converse's launch of a sneaker line linked to classic rock brands, such as The Who and Pink Floyd. The Who tribute shoe even outpaced the firm's previous best seller -- the basic black Chuck Taylor. Converse has added to its collection by debuting sneakers featuring Metallica and AC/DC, as well as a line of Dr. Seuss-inspired sneakers for men, women, and children through a deal with Dr. Seuss Enterprises. The shoe company further identifies with musicians through its Converse Rubber Tracks, a recording studio it opened in Brooklyn in mid-2011 that's offered free to recording artists and groups. In 2014 Converse partnered with British luxury brand Hancock Vulcanised Articles to enhance the Jack Purcell mid-top sneaker with rubber-bonded, water-repellant materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   It relocated its world headquarters in early 2015 to Boston.

  <p>
   With a capital investment of $250,000, in 1908 Marquis Converse established the Converse Rubber Co. in Malden, Massachusetts, with 15 employees. The company got its big break shortly after its Converse canvas All Star shoe was launched in 1917. The shoe was chosen by young basketball star Chuck Taylor as his favorite basketball sneaker. Taylor joined the Converse sales team in 1921 and -- in one of the first examples of sports endorsement -- peddled the shoes at basketball clinics he hosted at schools and colleges. In 1923 Taylor's signature was added to the brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Converse fell into bankruptcy in 1929 and was acquired by Hodgman Rubber. The Depression and reduced profits led to another takeover in 1933, when the Stone family of Boston began its lucrative 39-year period of ownership. WWII provided a boost to the firm as it supplied the US military with protective footwear, parkas, and other equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded after WWII, establishing plants in New Hampshire (1946) and a subsidiary in Puerto Rico (1953). It then acquired Tyler Rubber Co. (1961) and the Hodgman line of sporting goods (1964). Taylor retired from Converse in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1972 Converse was acquired by Eltra, which made electrical and typesetting equipment. Within a year Converse expanded with the purchase of B.F. Goodrich's footwear division. Eltra was acquired by conglomerate Allied Corp. in 1979. Converse executives led a buyout of the division in 1982 before taking it public the next year. The rise of the retro look in fashion starting in the mid-1980s made the old Chuck Taylor sneaker hot with models, film stars, and the fashion-conscious.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furniture, footwear, and apparel firm INTERCO bought Converse in 1986. After being financially overstretched in fighting off a 1988 hostile takeover by the Rales brothers of Washington, DC, INTERCO filed for bankruptcy in 1991 -- then one of the largest bankruptcy cases in US history.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of INTERCO's reorganization, Converse emerged in 1994 as a public company controlled by financial adviser Leon Black. The next year it dumped its outdoor, running, walking, tennis, and football lines. Converse, hurt particularly by weak sales of basketball sneakers and restructuring charges, posted losses and saw revenue fall in 1995 and 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sporting goods veteran Glenn Rupp was hired as chairman and CEO in 1996. Converse had record sales in 1997, but still finished in the red, due in part to a slowdown in retail demand in the last half of the year. The company laid off 5% of its workforce in 1998 and another 20% the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Converse slipped close to NYSE delisting due to low stock price and market cap. CVEO Corporation, which owned the Converse brand, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2001 following years of declining sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   A firm backed by chairman Marsden Cason and private investor William Simon stepped in that spring, however, and bought the rights to the names and property of Converse. Former Converse employee Jack Boys was named CEO. Converse closed its factories in North America (two in the US and one in Mexico) and sent all production to its suppliers in the Far East and Indonesia. Menswear designer John Varvatos signed an agreement in late 2001 to design a series of Chuck Taylor All Star and Jack Purcell products for fall 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to closing its US-based manufacturing facilities, the company also made a failed attempt to go public in late 2002. In 2003 sports apparel giant
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   swooped in and purchased Converse for about $305 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2008 the company launched the EB1 basketball shoe, which retailed at $65, and was named after Elton Brand who plays for the Philadelphia 76ers. The shoes are sold exclusively at J.C. Penney stores. For the 2009-2010 basketball season, Converse created the EB2 to retail for the same price and $50 for kids.
