   Airvana makes a technology called femtocells, which are basically 3G network cell phone transmitters that improve weak signal reception indoors. Airvana's femtocell products, sold under the HubBub brand, bring better voice service and speed up data downloads and uploads for 3G network users in homes and small offices. The company has partnered with several telecommunications and IT manufacturers to integrate femtocell technology with their equipment. These companies include

   ,
   <company id="41866">

   provide service powered by Airvana femtocells. In late 2015, the company was acquired by cable products maker

   Airvana makes femtocell products for mobile broadband access. Femtocells can be characterized as small base stations that improve 3G service indoors through a fixed-line broadband connection and mobile Wi-Fi devices. Using a small wireless access point on a broadband Internet connection, a femtocell is especially well-suited for connecting a home or small office with a mobile operator's network. Because femtocells function in a licensed frequency spectrum, they are offered only by mobile telecommunications providers who control the spectrum in a specific area.
  </p>
  <p>
   Femtocells power telecommunications products to provide more services than traditional devices. Included among these services are a virtual home number for all handsets in a household or office and remote control of other devices, like a digital video recorder. Femtocells can work together with WiFi to ease the burden for telecommunications companies of fast-expanding data and signaling traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airvana's Femtocell Service Manager allows mass market use of femtocells by managing millions of them at a time through such capabilities as remote configuration and advanced algorithms.

   Airvana boasts several innovations in the development of femtocells. It provided the first 3G CDMA femtocell to the mobile telecommunications industry. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) works with 3G -- or the third generation of cellular phones -- to provide access to higher speeds in telecommunications and computing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other technological innovations from Airvana include the delivery of the first IP Multimedia Subsystem-based dual-mode femtocell, which works with the two main versions of CDMA. This femtocell helps mesh the operations of an Ethernet router and a VoIP analog telephone adapter.

  <p>
   In order to focus on the femtocell market, in 2013 the company sold its EV-DO macro-cell radio access network business unit to Ericcson.
