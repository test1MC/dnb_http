   Beiersdorf is a master of soft sell. Its NIVEA skin care line, with the slogan "Touch and Be Touched," is #1 in Europe and has helped the company expand into color cosmetics and shaving items. The firm makes anti-aging products under the Caviar Collections, Eucerin, and La Prairie brands. Its body care brands include such items as Labello, 8x4, and Florena. Beiersdorf also makes and markets bandages, surgical gloves, disinfectants, and dermatological skin care products (such as Hansaplast, Aquaphor, and Eucerin). Under the tesa name, the company offers tapes and adhesives for home, office, and industrial settings. Coffee and cigarettes firm

  <p>
   Beiersdorf operates two business units: Consumer and tesa. Consumer is by far the larger of the two, at over 80% of total sales. The division's brands include Nivea, the most significant for the company, Eucerin and La Prairi. It also sells Libello, Hansaplast, 8x4 and Florena brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tesa business, which has operated independently since 2001, is a tape adhesive manufacturer that sells more than 300 products including Powerstrips, masking and surface protection, and electrical insulation.

   In 2015, revenue continues its recent growth trend, climbing 6% on prior year to €6.3 billion. The weakness of the Euro helped sales climb in the Consumer segment. Nivea sales increased 4.5%, Eucerin 5.4%, and La Prairie 1.2%. Tesa sales were up 5.9%, again largely as a result of currency translation. Sales declined in Asia due to weakness in the local electronics industry.

   Net income was up 25% on 2014, at €660 million, in line with the increase in net sales.

  <p>
   Beiersdorf's strategy is mostly based on product innovation and targeting new markets. Recent product releases include deodorant (Nivea Deo for Black &amp; White), and body moisturizer Nivea Body In-Shower. A recent advertising campaign for a moisturiser targeted the large demographic of young men who do not moisturize.

  <p>
   Hamburg pharmacist Paul Carl Beiersdorf began Beiersdorf in 1882 when he received a patent for his method of making guttapercha plaster gauze, a medicated dressing. After his son committed suicide in 1890, Beiersdorf sold his laboratory to pharmacist Oskar Troplowitz. (The founder himself committed suicide in 1896.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Troplowitz, the innovative company came up with Leukoplast, the first sticking plaster, in 1901. In 1909 Beiersdorf launched Labello, the first lip balm in a push tube. The company also got into adhesive tapes and toothpaste. In 1911 Beiersdorf introduced NIVEA, a pure white skin cream that was the first water-in-oil emulsion product. Troplowitz died in 1918.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beiersdorf had factories in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, France, Mexico, Russia, and the US by the beginning of WWI, and exports accounted for more than 40% of its sales. That all came to a halt during the war, but Beiersdorf soon rebuilt its international operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company put NIVEA into its well-known blue packaging in the 1920s, and it launched Hansaplast, the first ready-to-use plaster, in 1922. The company's innovations continued when it introduced tesa, the first transparent adhesive film, in 1936. Insurer Allianz took a stake in Beiersdorf in the mid-1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beiersdorf suffered at home and abroad during WWII. In Hitler's Germany it was targeted as a Jewish company, while Allied countries seized its assets elsewhere. In the 1950s, while introducing new products (8 x 4 deodorizing soap in 1951, atrix hand cream in 1955), the company began reacquiring the international rights to its brands. The process would take almost half a century, starting in the Netherlands in 1952 and ending with the acquisition of a Polish company in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beiersdorf set up a joint venture with Japanese personal care products maker Kao in 1971. The Herz family, owners of German coffee company Tchibo Holding, bought about one-fourth of Beiersdorf in 1974. Beiersdorf restructured that year to focus its operations on three main product groups: cosmetics and skin care, pharmaceuticals, and adhesives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years the company allowed its number of brands and products to mushroom without thought for the economies of scale that come from focusing on a limited number of major names and lines. In 1989 Beiersdorf began reducing its number of products, cutting loose several noncore businesses, and refocusing on skin care, especially the NIVEA brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those moves continued when Rolf Kunisch became CEO in 1994. By early 2000 Beiersdorf's market value had tripled under Kunisch. In 2002 Beiersdorf purchased Florena Cosmetic GmbH, which had made Beiersdorf cosmetic products under contract prior to the sale. In May 2005 Thomas-Bernd Quaas succeeded Kunisch, who retired as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In  June 2006 the company established Beiersdorf Middle East, based in the United Arab Emirates. The new affiliate will serve 16 countries across the Middle East, and North and West Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2007 the company sold its Hirtler soap factory in South Baden to the Dutch personal and household care group Budelpack International.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2008 the firm sold its Futuro health supports (wraps, braces, and elastic bandages ) and compression hosiery product line to

   . Beiersdorf acquired Futuro in 1996.
