   Photo-Me International (PMI) flashes for thousands of people every day. The firm is best known as a maker and operator of photobooths that produce four-picture strips -- strips that serve as identification or as painful reminders of your exes or fading youth. PMI boasts nearly 44,000 photobooths that are found in shopping centers, train stations, and tourist areas. The company also uses its booths as digital printing kiosks and other photo-processing equipment, as well as kiddie rides and amusement machines. PMI operates in some 15 countries, including the UK, Ireland, France, and Japan. Company deputy chairman and CEO Serge Crasnianski owns more than 22% of the PMI.

   Americans Gupp Allen and I. D. Baker designed one of the first photo booths in 1946. They sold their creation to amusement and arcade operators in New York. Baker and Charles Clark agreed in 1952 to market the photo booth in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Photo-Me Studios was formed in 1958 to make and operate photo booths in the UK and export them globally. In 1961 Dan David joined the company, which went public in 1962 as Photo-Me International.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales were boosted in 1966 when Photo-Me's black-and-white photographs were approved for British passports. Ten years later the company's color photographs were approved for passports. In 1982 Photo-Me bought Photomaton and Photoquick.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company bought French partner KIS, a maker of advanced photo booths, as well as film processing equipment and other machines; KIS's majority owner, Serge Crasnianski, received a large stake in Photo-Me. It bought US photo booth company Irata in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Crasnianski took the title of CEO in 1998 from David, who remained chairman. That year the pair were paid two years' salary in advance as a reward for higher profits, while their company cut about 15% of its European workforce. In addition, Photo-Me bought Swiss photo booth rival Prontophot Holding in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold loss-making subsidiary Foto-Mi Mexicana. The company also introduced personalized postcard machines, which allowed individual portraits to be superimposed on scenic backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Photo-Me began working with
   <company id="41763">
    BT Group
   </company>
   (formerly British Telecommunications) to wire photo booths with Internet connections. The same year the company formed a joint venture with
   <company id="44448">
    SanDisk
   </company>
   , a maker of flash-memory products, to expand operations of self-service digital photo printing kiosks in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decreased travel in 2001 led Photo-Me to announce in October its intent to sell all or parts of the company. However, since that time the company has turned in a better-than-anticipated performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2002 it launched a new photo lab processor, the DKS 1500, which was well received by the marketplace. In April 2003 Photo-Me purchased high-speed technology from
   <company id="61195">
    Gretag Imaging
   </company>
   , and now sells the photo machines under the Imaging Solutions name.
  </p>
  <p>
   David retired as chairman in 2005. (He later shed his director and president titles in 2007.) Crasnianski stepped down amid shareholder pressure in late 2007 and was replaced by Thierry Barel, a company executive and former CEO of Swiss manufacturer Staubli.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining revenue in PMI's manufacturing and vending divisions led the review launched in late 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2009 Barel left the company to join the French railway systems company Faiveley. He was succeeded on an interim basis by ex-CEO Crasnianski.
