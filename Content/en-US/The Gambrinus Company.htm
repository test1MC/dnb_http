   Taking its name from the legendary King Gambrinus of Flanders (aka the King of Beer), The Gambrinus Company brews and distributes a fine libation with which to toast -- Shiner Beer. Shiner is brewed by Gambrinus' Spoetzl Brewery located in Shiner, Texas. The company also owns Portland-based BridgePort Brewery, Oregon's oldest microbrewery; Pete's Brewing Company, maker of Pete's Wicked Ale; and Berkeley, California-based Trumer Brauerei, which makes Trumer Pils in a joint venture with Austrian brewer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl. Gambrinus brews are available nationwide, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, and Italy. Owner Carlos Alvarez founded Gambrinus in 1986.

  <p>
   Gambrinus lost its agreement to distribute brands such as Corona from Mexico's
   <company id="52130">
    Grupo Modelo
   </company>
   in the Eastern US in 2006, when
   <company id="11800">
    Constellation Brands
   </company>
   took over the account. The next year, it sold the US import rights for Moosehead Lager back to Moosehead Breweries of Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the loss of its Mexican and Canadian beer import business, Gambrinus began focusing on its domestic brands, in particular targeting the Chicago area for its Shiner products.
