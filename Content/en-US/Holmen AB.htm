   Holmen AB can see the forest for the trees. The company's three product-based business segments include Holmen Paper (printing paper for magazines, catalogs, direct mail, books, and newspapers), Iggesund Paperboard (solid bleached board and folding box board for consumer packaging), and Holmen Timber (pine joinery and spruce construction timber). Its two raw materials-oriented businesses include Holmen Skog (timberland management) and Holmen Energi (21 hydro and three wind power plants). The company produces more than 2 million tons of paper products a year from five plants. Swedish brokerage firm L E Lundbergföretagen has a controlling stake in Holmen, which was formed in 1936.

  <p>
   Holmen AB was established as Mo och Domsjö (MoDo) in 1873 by J. C. Kempe. The company's operations included ironworks, shipbuilding, and wood products, as well as a sawmill located in Mo (built 1759) and another in Domsjö (1865). Pulp, which could be produced in sulfite mills from sawmill waste, had become a leading export in the 1890s, and between 1902 and 1903 the company established sulphite mills.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1914 production from MoDo's sulphite mills accounted for over a third of its sales and additional sulphite mills were added to the company's operations. By 1919, the year MoDo started producing kraft pulp, its main product had become pulp.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the introduction of new saws for cutting lumber and the use of trucks for distribution during the 1920s and 1930s, MoDo's operations continued to expand. Also in the 1930s the company's stock began trading on the Stockholm exchange. During WWII its sulphite mills were used to produce other types of pulp and items such as animal feeds not available because of the war. The company also started producing chemical derivatives. In 1951 MoDo established a fine-paper mill in Hörnefors.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s the company continued to expand by purchasing paper mills in France and Italy. It also began producing paper products from its own pulp. In 1963 MoDo diversified into petrochemical production, making acquisitions in the industry, although it exited that business after a decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions during the 1970s included paper mills, sawmills, and a tissue business. Also, MoDo merged its chemical operations into MoDoKemi AB. Globally, the company had expanded operations into Austria, Belgium, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK. In 1988 MoDo accomplished one of its biggest sequences of acquisitions when it purchased paperboard manufacturer Iggesund Bruk (which had been established in 1685 as an iron mill) and newsprint maker Holmens Bruk (established in 1609 as a flour mill). Following those acquisitions, MoDo sold its Holmen Hygiene (tissue and hygiene products) to Metsa-Serlä.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company started to trim its workforce in response to a recession in the paper industry. Between 1991 and 1993 it implemented other cost-cutting initiatives, including shutting down a pulp mill and a line of production at one of its other mills. MoDo returned to profitability in 1994, and its profits nearly tripled the next year as the company raised selling prices of its pulp. Also in 1995 the company sold its MoDo packaging unit to Sweden's AssiDomän (forest products). As industry conditions began to improve, MoDo also began to improve its operations, including investments in 1997 and 1998 to modernize some of its equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   MoDo formed a joint venture with Svenska Cellulosa in 1999 to produce fine paper (MoDo Paper), but both companies sold their shares in the venture to Metsa-Serlä the following year. Also in 2000 MoDo changed its name to Holmen. The company outlined plans to strengthen its paper and paperboard operations, and it acquired Spain-based Papelera Peninsular.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an attempt shore up fiscal discipline to one of its lagging businesses, during March 2002 Holmen invested 75 million krones (SEK) to modernize Iggesund Sawmill to increase production and lower operating costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   President and CEO Göran Lundin announced his retirement effective March 31, 2004. Magnus Hall, president of Holmen Paper was his successor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since selling its pulp and fine-paper business in 2000, the company had focused on expanding its Holmen Paper and Iggesund Paperboard operations through acquisitions and by modernizing existing equipment. By 2005, however, both Holmen Paper and Iggesund Paperboard had announced plans to cut jobs.
