   Goodman Manufacturing has built a business providing the tools to maintain just the right temperature. The company makes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment for residential and light commercial use in North America. Goodman, which sells its products through more than 60,000 affiliated dealers at 1,000 locations, is one of the largest domestic makers of air conditioners, humidifiers, gas furnaces, heat pumps, and other products. It manufactures its products (under the Goodman, Amana, and Quietflex brands) at facilities in Texas and Tennessee. Goodman is a subsidiary of

   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Based in Houston, Goodman sells its HVAC products nationwide, with operating plants in the southern half of the US.

  <p>
   Since its inception, Goodman has focused on growing organically, aggressively striving to be the high-value (high quality at low cost) unit manufacturer in the HVAC industry. Roughly three-quarters of its sales come from replacement products, which are newer, more efficient models built to replace existing heating and air conditioning units in older homes.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the economy rebounds, Goodman is positioning itself for growth. Its hub-and-spoke distribution system allows the company to easily move its products from manufacturing plants to dealers and customers. Its US plant network is supported by a 1-million-sq.-ft. logistics center in Houston. Distribution centers are also set up in targeted markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is looking to enhance operating efficiencies while expanding its distribution network as its market share increases. To this end in early 2015, parent company
   <company id="106212">
    Daikin
   </company>
   invested $417 million -- it's largest-ever investment in North America -- in building a consolidated HVAC equipment engineering, manufacturing, and logistics campus in Waller, TX (north of Houston), which will consolidate its Daikin, Goodman, and Amana brand operations from Texas and Tennessee, while adding the option to expand for projected growth and house up to 4,000 employees. In 2013, expanded its Dayton, Tennessee, facility with a $2 million investment there.

   In 2012 Goodman's parent,
   <company id="146920">
    Goodman Global

   , was acquired by
   <company id="106212">
    Daikin Industries Ltd.
   </company>
   (DIL), based in Osaka, Japan for $3.7 billion. The deal  combined the global, environmental, technological and commercial expertise of Daikin and the logistical, residential, and light commercial expertise of Goodman.

   Goodman was founded by Harold Goodman in 1982.
