   Littelfuse is big on circuit protection. The company is one of the world's largest fuse makers. In addition to its fuses, Littelfuse's other circuit protection devices include positive temperature coefficient devices that limit current when too much is being supplied and electrostatic discharge suppressors that redirect transient high voltage. The company's thyristors protect telecommunications circuits from transient voltage caused by lightning strikes. It also supplies fuses for HVAC systems, elevators, and machine tools. Littelfuse's 5,800 customers include electronics manufacturers (

  <p>
   The company operates in three geographic territories -- the Americas, Europe, and Asia/Pacific -- and has 30 manufacturing and distribution facilities in about 15 countries. The company gets about 40% of its sales outside the US. China is another large market, representing 22% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through three business unit segments. Electronics includes circuit protection products for wireless telephones, consumer electronics, computers, modems, and telecommunications equipment, and markets the products under brand names PICO and NANO. Considering the average car contains 30 to 100 fuses, the automotive segment stays busy making fuses for gas and electric automobiles, trucks and buses, and to protect electrical power to operate lights, heating, air conditioning, radios, windows, and other controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some automotive brand names include ATO, MasterFuse, JCASE, and CablePro. In addition to fuses, electrical makes ground-fault and protection relays to safeguard personnel and equipment from electrical shock hazards in industrial environments and underground mining or water treatment applications. Brand names include POWR-GARD.

  <p>
   Littlefuse markets its products indirectly through a worldwide organization of 60 manufacturers' representatives and distributes through a network of electronics, automotive, and electrical distributors. Its domestic sales and marketing staff of over 100 people maintains relationships with major OEMs and distributors.

  <p>
   Littlefuse enjoyed unprecedented growth in 2015 as sales peaked at a record-setting $868 million. Profits, however, decreased by 17% due to additional pension settlement charges and expenses related with acquisitions. Littlefuse's operating cash flow has trended upward over the last four years and surged by 8% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by an uptick in automotive sales and strong growth for automotive sensor products as a result of continued strength in the heavy truck market. This growth was offset by a general market slowdown within the construction, agriculture, and global mining industries.

  <p>
   Littelfuse operates in a highly competitive industry, matching up against much larger manufacturers by focusing on brand name, price, quality, and service. The automotive industry witnessed a rash of bankruptcies before and during the recession, and the electronics industry reeled from the economic downturn, as well. The company's dependence on customers in the automotive, communications, and consumer electronics industries leaves Littelfuse vulnerable to cyclicality in those industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   One important element of Littelfuse's strategy is product development, which has resulted in about 200 patents in North America, some 85 in the European Union, and more than 60 in other foreign countries. After consulting with customers, sales and marketing staff often suggest new products, which then undergo a development process that can last from a few months to up to 18 months.

   In 2015 the company acquired
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   's circuit protection business (CPD), which has expertise in polymer-based resettable circuit protection devices. The business was acquired for $350 million and has operations in Menlo Park, California, and manufacturing facilities in Tsukuba, Japan; and Shanghai and Kunshan, China. The acquisition expanded the company's capabilities in the battery and automotive market and increased its presence in Japan.

  <p>
   Littelfuse was formed in 1927 to make the first small, fast-acting fuse able to protect test meters. In 1968 military electronics firm Tracor (later part of the UK's General Electric Company, now telent) bought the company. Littelfuse entered the power (industrial) fuse market in 1983. Tracor ran into financial troubles with the end of the Cold War and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1991. As a result of Tracor's reorganization, Littelfuse became an independent company in 1992.
