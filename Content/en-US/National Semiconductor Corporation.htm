   As pioneering chip maker, National Semiconductor was one of the companies that put "Silicon" in Silicon Valley. Now the company does business as Silicon Valley Analog (SVA) and is a division of
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   (TI). SVA offers a variety of integrated circuits, especially analog and mixed-signal (which blends analog and digital functions) chips. The majority of its sales come from analog devices, which transform physical information -- light, sound, pressure, even radio waves -- into data that a computer can use. SVA's chips are used in wireless, networking, medical, solar, automotive, and industrial applications. It gets most of its sales from customers outside the US. National Semiconductor has been a part of TI since 2011.

   National Semiconductor's products extend the breadth of TI's product portfolio and strengthen its position in the analog market, as well as add a range of power management chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was active in acquisitions -- and divestitures -- as it shaped its product portfolio. Power management continues to be the predominant theme for SVA, which invests in products that boost energy efficiency, particularly for mobile electronics, communications infrastructure, renewable energy, medical, sensors, and detection equipment.

  <p>
   National Semiconductor was founded as a transistor maker in 1959 by eight engineers from Sperry Rand Corporation. The company was established in Danbury, Connecticut. In 1966, as the company was struggling with only $7 million in annual sales, Peter Sprague (heir to the Sprague Electric fortune) took over as chairman. The next year he hired manufacturing expert Charles Sporck away from
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   to be National's CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sporck transferred headquarters to Silicon Valley (the Danbury facility closed in 1989), halved the company's transistor workforce, and plowed the savings into developing linear and digital logic chips. During the 1970s National's mass manufacturing of low-cost chips made the company the leading US semiconductor maker for a time; its no-frills management approach led to its employees being dubbed "the animals of Silicon Valley."
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought National Advanced Systems (NAS), a distributor and servicer of
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   mainframes, in 1979 and Data Terminal Systems, which made point-of-sale terminals, in 1983; the two were combined to form Datachecker. When Japanese manufacturers dumped memory chips on the market in 1984 and 1985, National pulled out of the memory business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sporck moved to transform his low-cost commodity chip maker into a higher-margin supplier of niche products. National bought troubled Fairchild in 1987 for its logic chip designs and the custom linear circuits it made for the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   With mounting mainframe competition from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and Amdahl, in 1989 National sold Datachecker. National left the high-speed, high-density static random-access memory (SRAM) business, and in 1991 Sporck retired. Former Rockwell International (now
   <company id="11283">
    Rockwell Automation
   </company>
   ) executive Gilbert Amelio became CEO and undertook another restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1993 National had shifted production to Arlington, Texas. In 1995 the company purchased SiTel Sierra, a Netherlands-based supplier of cellular and wireless products.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Amelio joined Apple Computer (now just
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   ) in 1996, National chose
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   veteran and LSI Logic EVP Brian Halla as its new leader. Halla consolidated National's operations and resurrected the Fairchild name for its commodity chip business. Soon after Halla's arrival, about 600 jobs were cut, two COOs left, and 14 of 56 VPs resigned or were fired.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 National sold Fairchild. It bought
   <company id="16430">
    Cyrix
   </company>
   (microprocessors for inexpensive computers) in 1997 and ComCore Semiconductor (communications ICs) in 1998. That year National cut another 10% of its workforce in the face of an industry slump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Things looked up in 1998 when heavy hitters IBM,
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   , and Packard Bell signed on to use Cyrix chips. However, Intel's low-end Celeron chip hammered Cyrix's sales, and National exited the PC chip market. National sold its flat-panel display operations to
   <company id="15949">
    Three-Five Systems
   </company>
   , and Cyrix to Taiwan's
   <company id="60278">
    VIA Technologies
   </company>
   . Write-offs and acquisition costs in the face of a tough market led to a $1 billion loss for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999 National unveiled its Geode system-on-a-chip, targeting the handheld computer market. In 2000 the Geode processor debuted in a TV set-top box made by
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   for
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   's AOLTV service. That year the company rebounded into the black after two years of losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company cut 1,100 jobs -- about 10% of its workforce -- in response to another, particularly brutal, dropoff in the global chip market. The next year National acquired DigitalQuake, a privately held designer of scaler chips for digital displays. In 2003 the company shuttered a unit that made baseband chips for wireless communications applications and sold the Geode processor line to AMD.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the semiconductor industry recovered from its meltdown in the early years of the 21st century, National set plans in 2004 to expand its wafer fabrication plant in South Portland, Maine. The company said it would spend $58 million on the expansion and hire 100 more production employees, increasing headcount at the fab to 650. The same year National opened its assembly and test plant in the Suzhou Industrial Park, located outside of Shanghai and employing about 400 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   National also sold its small business in image sensor chips to Kodak in 2004, and its Advanced PC division to Winbond Electronics the following year. Among other restructuring moves set in 2005, National Semi said it would sell its assembly and testing facility in Singapore. Four months later the company said it would close the facility and transfer its equipment to plants in China and Malaysia. The shuttering was completed in 2007 and the facility was sold later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Donald Macleod, National's EVP, COO, and GM of product lines since 2001, was promoted to president of the company in 2005, retaining the COO's title. He earlier served as National's EVP/CFO for a decade and joined the company in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company provided video iPods to all of its 8,500 employees, celebrating National's success in the previous year. The company supplied analog chips that went into the popular MP3 music player from Apple. The iPods were not, however, gifts from the company to the employees. When National laid off 35 employees from its wafer fab in Arlington, Texas, later the same month, those employees were told to turn in their iPods as company property.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="143884">
    Xignal Technologies
   </company>
   , a German developer of high-speed analog-to-digital converters, in 2007 for about $9 million, including the assumption of liabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009, as part of a planned succession, Brian Halla stepped down as CEO, replaced by Donald Macleod. Halla remained chairman until his retirement the following year, when Macleod took on the additional role of chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009, with the industry in a prolonged downturn and the global economy in a slump, the company consolidated facilities and idled more than a quarter of its worldwide workforce. National closed its assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China, that year. Its wafer fabrication facility in Arlington, Texas, was closed the following year. Production from those plants was transferred National's remaining manufacturing facilities in Maine, Scotland, and Malaysia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its SolarMagic power optimizer was initially launched in 2009 as a standalone product, used to help prevent energy loss caused by shading and array mismatch problems in photovoltaic solar arrays. Also that year, the company bought Act Solar, a privately held solar energy company, to expand its portfolio of power optimization technologies, diagnostics, and panel monitoring capabilities for solar arrays. It was folded into the SolarMagic business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 National bought Fremont, California-based fabless semiconductor company GTronix to boost its expertise in programmable and adaptive analog sensor processors. GTronix's technology was designed to improve the efficiency of audio user-interface and voice processing applications in mobile phones and other electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2011 National Semiconductor was acquired by one of its chief rivals,
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   , for about $6.5 billion in cash. The company began to do business as the Silicon Valley Analog (SVA) division shortly after the acquisition was complete.
