   KRONES has tried to bottle success, and put a cork in it, since 1951. The company makes machines that clean, fill, seal, label, transport, and package bottles and cans. It also makes machinery that puts corks in bottles. The company manufactures high-speed stretch blow-molding machines that make plastic containers. In addition, KRONES provides production-line planning services and line-data storage software. Most of the company's business comes from the beverage industry, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. European customers account for more than half of sales.

   Electrical engineer Hermann Kronseder founded KRONES AG in 1951 with just five employees. Within a year the small firm had designed and constructed a semi-automatic labeling machine that could place labels on 3,600 bottles per hour -- a high-speed machine for the time. By 1956 the company had made its machines fully automatic and had increased machine production capacity to 4,000 bottles per hour.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1960s saw the company doubling sales every three years and its entry into the export business -- in 1961 KRONES entered the Japanese market, and in 1966 it established a US subsidiary. Kronseder made the company a limited partnership in 1967. The company continued to improve its products throughout the 1970s and introduced empty-bottle inspectors (1970), fillers (1974), and the KRONES BLOC concept of mechanically interlinking fillers, cappers, and labeling machines (1974).
  </p>
  <p>
   With a market capitalization of about DM 12 million, KRONES converted from a partnership to a limited company in 1980. Two years later, the company organized itself into the Kronseder group of companies -- STEINECKER GmbH (brewhouses, filtration systems, and process automation) and SEEGER GmbH (malthouses and CO

   systems). The company went public in 1984, but sold only preference shares to the public. The Konseder family retained ownership of all common shares. KRONES purchased Zierk GmbH (bottle washers and pasteurizers) in 1988, and opened a service center in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 KRONES held more than 800 patents and had added packers and palletizers to its product mix. Continuing to expand geographically as well, the company opened KRONES Southern Africa Ltd., its 19th foreign subsidiary, in 1993. Hermann Kronseder turned over the chairmanship of the executive board to his son, Volker Kronseder, in 1996. The next year Hermann withdrew completely from the company because of poor health. After converting 30% of its preference shares to common shares in 1998, KRONES listed all of its common shares on the stock exchange. Sales slipped in 1999, and the company's stock price fell, prompting KRONES to buy back about 10% of its shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   KRONES reorganized and sold several plants in 2000 in an effort to counter slumping sales. The company has continued to consolidate operations with an increasing focus on contracted services. In 2002 it installed a major turnkey assembly line for PET bottles at mineral water bottler Adelholzener Alpenquellen GmbH.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 KRONES started work on one of its biggest contracts ever, expanding the Beer Thai brewery near Bangkok.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steinecker, the brewery equipment manufacturer, was consolidated into the Krones Group in 2005 and became the group's Krones Process Engineering division. Syskron, the affiliated provider of IT services, was similarly consolidated that year. Later in 2005 KRONES established a new division, Handling Parts, for retrofitting work on individual machines and entire production lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 KRONES took on the building of a $120 million brewery for Saigon Beer, Alcohol, and Beverages (Sabeco), a state-owned enterprise in Vietnam. The facility started shipping beer in 2007. Later that year KRONES and its American subsidiary won a contract for the company's first complete brewery project in the US. KRONES built the facility in Wisconsin for New Glarus Brewing Company, a microbrewery noted for its Spotted Cow ale and "unplugged" specialty beers.
