  <p>
   The company's net revenues have been increasing in recent years, until 2016. In fiscal 2016, the company's net revenue decreased by 3% due to a sales drop in Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, resulting from the impact of foreign currency translation from a weaker euro.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenues in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1% due to a 5% drop in retail comparable store sales, primarily as a result of the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in US stores located in international tourist locations due to the stronger dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenues decreased by 10% (including a 15% negative foreign currency impact).
  </p>
  <p>
   PFH's net income net income increased by 30% in fiscal 2016, mainly due to higher net revenues and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to lower retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial gains; a 70 basis point reduction due to a lower Warnaco integration and restructuring costs; and a decline in the Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash inflow increased by 14% in fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   PVH's strength lies in the fact that it maintains a strong, diversified brand portfolio that is growing through acquisitions and supported by a model that offers multiple brands and product types globally at different price points and across a range of distribution channels -- from retail to licensing -- allowing PVH to reach a broad range of consumers in various geographic regions thus reducing reliance on any one demographic.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses on reinvesting in businesses and pursuing strategic acquisitions.

  <p>
   Moses Phillips came to America from Poland in 1881. While living in a one-room apartment in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, he sold flannel shirts (which his wife sewed) to coal miners from a pushcart. He soon brought the rest of his family to the US and upgraded the pushcart to a horse and buggy. Business continued to grow, and the Phillips-Jones Corporation was formed in 1907.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved to New York in 1914, and control passed from father to son for four generations. Isaac followed Moses, then Seymour took over in 1941 until he handed the reins to Lawrence, who joined the company in 1948 and became president and CEO in 1969. Ads in the 1950s featured such actors as Anthony Quinn, Burt Lancaster, and Ronald Reagan in Van Heusen shirts. In 1957 the company received its new name, Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH). It grew via acquisitions throughout the 1970s and began selling its merchandise at its own outlet stores in 1979, but it didn't want its products sold at the off-price outlets that became popular in the early 1980s. The company stopped doing business with stores and distributors that allowed PVH merchandise to reach cut-price vendors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 PVH bought back more than 5 million shares of stock in order to fend off an acquisition bid by the Hunt family of Texas. Lawrence stepped down in 1993, ending the unbroken chain of Phillipses at the helm. In 1995 the Phillips family sold its stake in the business. In June 2011 the company renamed itself PVH Corp., officially dropping the Phillips-Van Heusen moniker, to emphasize its diversified portfolio of brands.
