   This company gives the Big D a helping of news with breakfast. A. H. Belo is a leading newspaper publisher with a portfolio of three daily newspapers anchored by
   <em>
    The Dallas Morning News
   </em>
   , one of the country's top papers with a circulation of about 260,000. It also owns
   <em>
    The Press-Enterprise
   </em>
   (Riverside, California). In addition to its flagship papers, A. H. Belo publishes the
   <em>
    Denton Record-Chronicle
   </em>
   (Texas) and several niche papers such as the Spanish-language paper Al Dia (Dallas), along with websites serving most of its publications. The company was spun off from TV station operator
   <company id="10002">
    Belo Corp.
   </company>
   in 2008.

   The company's advertising and marketing services segment accounted for nearly 60% of total revenue during fiscal 2014, while circulation revenue (which includes subscriptions) accounted for a little more than 30%.

   The company reported revenue of more than $272 million for fiscal 2014. That was a 1% decrease compared to the prior fiscal period. A. H. Belo's net income was $92.9 million in fiscal 2014, which was a dramatic increase of 477% compared to fiscal 2013, buoyed by income from investments.

  <p>
   The company's newspapers have been struggling along with the rest of the industry as advertising revenue and circulation continue to decline. Belo separated its newspaper business in effort to eliminate economic drag from its 20 television stations. It also hoped that the independent company would be able to focus on reviving the papers.

   During 2014 the company's subsidiary The Providence Journal Company sold off the assets of
   <em>
    The Providence Journal
   </em>
   , which is published in Rhode Island.
