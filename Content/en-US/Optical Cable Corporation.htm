   Optical Cable Corporation (OCC) wants to keep you connected, with a little help from its products, of course. The company makes fiber-optic cable and copper data communications connectivity equipment and systems. Its high-bandwidth cables transmit data, video, and audio over distances of up to 10 miles. OCC's fiber-optic cables, which are suitable for indoor and outdoor use, are used in local-area networks (LANs) for schools, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and business facilities. OCC also produces security cables for use with surveillance cameras and specialty fiber-optic cables for military tactical field applications. Customers include electrical contractors, OEMs, systems resellers, and distributors.

  <p>
   OCC, along with its primary subsidiary Applied Optical Systems (AOS), operates through manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas. It sells its products in more than 50 countries, and the US generates 70% of its net sales.

  <p>
   While OCC is a leading manufacturer of fiber-optic cable for the military defense and commercial markets, its products are also used in industrial, mining, oil and gas, and broadcast applications. It sells its products internationally and domestically through its sales force to its customers, which include major distributors, various regional and smaller distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and value-added resellers.

  <p>
   OCC's balance sheet has fluctuated over the years. After posting revenue increases in 2014, the company's revenues fell 11% to $74 million in 2015. After posting positive net income for 2014, it posted a net loss of $4 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue dip for 2015 was primarily driven by the absence of large orders from customers and decreased fiber optic cable products sales in various specialty markets. OCC was also hurt by a decrease in sales from harsh environment and specialty connectivity products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net loss for 2015 was attributed to a spike in income tax expense of $1.5 million as a result of a negative tax rate of 53% over a 30% positive tax rate the previous year.

  <p>
   OCC aims to continue to increase its manufacturing capacity and product distribution through process upgrades and the development of strategic alliances. Throughout 2015 the company spent about $3 million to add new manufacturing equipment at its fiber optic cable production facility in order to expand its production capabilities and to support anticipated increased demand for its fiber optic cable products.
