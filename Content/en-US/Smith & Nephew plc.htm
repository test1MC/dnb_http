   hip. Focusing on orthopedic reconstruction, wound care, sports medicine, and advanced wound management, the firm makes products to repair joints, skin, soft tissue, and bone. The company's orthopedic products include hip, knee, and shoulder replacements, in addition to fixation and bone-growth devices used to repair broken bones. Smith &amp; Nephew also offers minimally invasive surgery for joints through its sports medicine division, and broken bone repair through trauma and extremities. Its advanced wound management products include bandages and dressings used to treat a variety of injuries. The company operates in more than 100 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   On a product basis, knee implants account for 19% of revenue; hip implants 12%, joint repair 12%, arthroscopic enabling technologies 12%, trauma and extremities 11%, and other surgical businesses 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wound care accounts for 16% of revenue, followed by advanced wound bioactives (7%), and advanced wound devices (4%).

  <p>
   Although Smith &amp; Nephew is headquartered in the UK, several of its main operating units are based in the US, which supplies about 50% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates about a dozen of its own plants in the US, the UK, Switzerland, Germany, India, Canada, Costa Rica, Russia, China, and also in the Dutch Caribbean. Smith &amp; Nephew also contracts out select manufacturing functions to third parties, usually to lower costs or to obtain specialized services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Smith &amp; Nephew markets its products directly to patients, specialty physicians, hospitals, and wholesale product distributors. It also communicates through digital and social media, including Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
  </p>

  <p>
   Revenue has been trending upwards for the past five years, and in fiscal 2015 it grew marginally to $4.6 billion, largely due to the first full-year contribution from the acquired AnthroCare business. Reconstruction outpaced the market, driven by knee implant sales. Growth was witnessed in all sales regions, including 11% growth in China and 5% growth in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income slipped 18% to $410 million due to higher SGA expenses, while cash flow from operations increased 51% to $1 billion.

  <p>
   Smith &amp; Nephew's strategy for operational growth also includes developing or acquiring new products, strengthening its stance in core geographic markets (the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan), expanding in emerging geographic markets (such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia), and widening the demographic makeup of its customers to include younger customers. The firm spends some $170 million on R&amp;D each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company introduced new versions of its cementless hip stem system, a shoulder and hip repair product, and a dissolvable nasal dressing to minimize post-op bleeding.
  </p>
  <p>
   It acquired BST-CarGel, a cartilage repair product for use with microfracture and other bone marrow stimulation techniques. It also acquired a knee replacement product, the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee system, for the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   It divested its gynaecology division to Medtronic for $350 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   The firm has traditionally expanded through a number of such small acquisitions, though it does occasionally buy up larger rivals. For instance, in early 2016, Smith &amp; Nephew bought US-based Blue Belt Holdings for $275 million in a deal to expand in the orthopedic robotic surgery market; and in 2014, it acquired ArthroCare Corporation, a medical device company, for approximately $1.7 billion to strengthen its sports medicine portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired manufacturer DeOst's trauma and orthopedics distribution business, which had distributed Smith &amp; Nephew's products in Russia for years. That purchase furthered its strategy of growing in emerging markets. In Colombia the company acquired its distributor for orthopaedic reconstruction, trauma and sports medicine products.

  <p>
   Pharmacist Thomas James Smith opened his first apothecary in 1856 in Hull, England. Bankrolled by his father, Smith's store prospered, including a brisk business in cheap, better-tasting (!) cod liver oil. Smith's nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, joined him in 1896 and the firm, renamed T. J. Smith and Nephew, began making bandages. Thomas Smith died that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1906 Smith and Nephew began operating overseas (under contracts with Canadian hospitals), and in 1912 it bought sanitary napkin maker SASHENA, establishing the Lilia brand (in 1954 its Lil-lets brand became a leading sanitary napkin).
  </p>
  <p>
   Wars are good for bandage companies. Smith &amp; Nephew boosted production to meet the demand of WWI (going from 50 employees to more than 1,200); it also began making weapon belts and other gear. In 1928 it developed the Elastoplast bandage and two years later launched the Gypsona plaster of paris bandage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smith &amp; Nephew opened subsidiaries in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa over the next 20 years and launched refinements of its successful Elastoplast product (including waterproof Ultraplast).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1951 the company finally obtained in-house product development capabilities when it bought Herts Pharmaceuticals, a struggling firm that made tuberculosis treatments and psychotropic drugs as well as a wound-covering product. It was renamed Smith &amp; Nephew Research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smith &amp; Nephew established subsidiaries in Spain, Norway, Sweden, and several other European countries throughout the 1960s and 1970s. It fended off a takeover bid from consumer products giant Unilever in 1968 and launched burn treatment Flamazine in 1973.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1980s, the company was on an acquisition binge. It bought winners, including Richards Medical Company (orthopedics, 1986) and Dyonics (arthroscopics, 1986). But it also mucked about in intraocular lenses, surgical gloves, hospital beds, operating tables, and more (even ice cream containers), all in an attempt to turn itself into a distributor of hospital supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the consolidation of the US health care industry and the advent of the European Union, Smith &amp; Nephew struggled to find its place in the new global order. Its drive to become the medical products supplier of choice was found wanting because it still lacked the cachet of a medical products innovator. Smith &amp; Nephew recognized it would never break out of the Johnson &amp; Johnson-led pack selling hospital beds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Smith &amp; Nephew began selling all of its 1980s acquisitions except its tissue-repair lines. In 1996 the company formed a joint venture with Advanced Tissue Sciences to develop Dermagraft; it launched the synthetic skin in the UK the following year. In 1998 the company reorganized firmly around its tissue-repair, endoscopy, and orthopedics businesses and said it had plans to divest all noncore businesses by 2002. As part of the effort, Smith &amp; Nephew sold its bracing business (DonJoy, Procare) to a unit of Chase Manhattan (now J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.) in 1999.
