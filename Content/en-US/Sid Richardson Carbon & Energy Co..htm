   Sid Richardson Carbon &amp; Energy (SRCE) operates in the black -- as in furnace carbon black, a primary non-rubber additive used in the manufacturing of tires. Its Sid Richardson Carbon subsidiary manufactures and markets carbon black at plants in Louisiana, the Texas Panhandle, and West Texas, where the plants convert diesel oil into material used to harden rubber tires. The company produces more than 970 million tons of carbon black a year. Its more than 40 grades of carbon black are also used in industrial rubber applications such as automotive sealing systems and sheet roofing, as well as for printing inks, paints, and batteries.

  <p>
   The company's products range from one pound pre-weighed bag to a 100,000 pound hopper car of carbon black. It has an annual production capacity of 413,000 metric tons of furnace carbon black, including more than 40 grades of
   <company id="112988">
    ASTM
   </company>
   (standards organization-certified) and specialty carbon blacks to more than 80 companies.

  <p>
   Its Akron, Ohio sales office is in the heart of the US tire industry. SRCE's distributors include Paramount Colors (Elk Grove Village, Illinois); Gillen Company (Cuddy, Pennsylvania); Tartan Color &amp; Chemical (Mississauga, Ontario; and Harwick Standard Distribution, (Akron).
  </p>
  <p>
   SCRE serves the car and truck tires, off-road tire, belt, extruded rubber goods, flooring, hose, mulch colorant, molded rubber goods, paint masterbatch, polymer, roofing, wire and cable industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to tire makers, SRCE sells its products to more than 200 non-tire manufacturers through a distribution network of representatives and agents covering Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's customers include

  <p>
   To grow its market share, the company focuses on developing new grades of carbon black, developing improved test methods to more accurately guide the production process, and in tire products, to create new carbon blacks that improve treadwear and traction.
  </p>
  <p>
   To mitigate its carbon footprint and defray costs of production, two of the company's manufacturing plants together produce 55 MW of electricity as a byproduct of carbon black manufacturing and it sells 50% of this power to the deregulated electric distribution market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company announced plans to build a carbon black plant in Mexico, SRCE's first outside of the US, by 2017.

  <p>
   Successful oil wildcatter Sid W. Richardson established his namesake company in 1947 in order to accelerate the development of the newly discovered Keystone Field in West Texas. SRCE is owned by founder Sid Richardson's heirs, the ultra-rich Bass oil family of Texas, through their Bass Enterprises holding company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 SRCE sold its Sid Richardson Energy Services (natural gas gathering and processing) unit to
   <company id="11375">
    Southern Union
   </company>
   for $1.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 SRCE introduced a modified carbon black, EM 200, which delivers reduced hysteresis (retardation of structural properties caused by wear and friction) with equivalent or better wear in rubber compounds.
