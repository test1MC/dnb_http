   Yaskawa Electric sets things in motion, and keeps them going with robots and engineering. The global supplier competes in motion control, robotics, and system engineering. Serving the mechatronics market -- combining mechanical, electronic, and software engineering, the term was created by a Yaskawa engineer -- Yaskawa offers industrial automation products, such as servo drives, motion controllers, and inverters, along with the Motoman line of industrial robots and automation engineering for steelmaking and other heavy industries. It also provides IT services, office machines, and multi-card readers.

  <p>
   The company gets more than 70% of its sales from customers in Asia; about 45% comes from Japan.

  <p>
   Yaskawa operates through nearly 80 subsidiaries and some 25 affiliates. It has four operating segments: motion control, robotics, system engineering, and information technologies. However, during 2014 the company will restructure into three segments: motion control, robotics, and system engineering as information technologies will be included in "other."

   Yaskawa has a joint venture with

    Brooks Automation
   </company>
   known as Yaskawa Brooks Automation, or YBA. The venture makes robots for semiconductor wafer handling applications. Yaskawa sold its

  <p>
   In order to reduce dependence on its traditional markets, Yaskawa is looking to new markets for growth, including alternative energy and energy efficiency, electric cars, and human assistance robotics. Within these markets, the company sees opportunities to expand products developed for industrial applications into adjacent markets. For example, it plans to develop robots that are easy for people who need assistance to use, along with robots that can be used in medical and nursing environments, in order to create a new market for robotics. Other initiatives include making solar and wind energy systems more efficient and developing electric components for electric cars, using both the company's mechatronics and systems engineering experience.

  <p>
   In late 2012 Yaskawa acquired VIPA GmbH, a German programmable logic controller (PLC) manufacturer in a deal that reinforced its ability to provide total system products and services for factory automation systems by combining its outstanding motion control products with the PLC and I/O products of VIPA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focusing on western Canada, also in 2012 acquired the business operations of Wermac Electric, a system integrator based in Alberta, Canada. As a result of the acquisition, Yaskawa now sells products directly in the growing Canadian oil industry using its Yaskawa brand, which leads to growth of its AC drive business in the Americas.

  <p>
   Yaskawa itself dates back to 1915, and in preparation for its centennial year in 2015, the company is promoting its long-term vision, "using the group's core technologies to solve emerging global problems."
