   Five generations of Kleins have had a grip on Klein Tools, a maker of non-powered hand tools. The company's products are particularly popular among electricians and can be found in the tool pouches of other professionals in the construction, mining, and telecommunications industries, among others. (Klein makes their pouches, too.) Its lineup includes cable cutters, chisels, drill bits, hammers, pliers, saws, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and wrenches. Klein also sells diagnostic equipment, occupational protective gear, and specialty chemicals. Products are distributed globally and sold by hardware and building supply stores such as

    The Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40005">
    Ace
   </company>
   . The firm is still owned by the founding Klein family.

   Klein Tools goes to market with a Made-in-the-USA message. Indeed, the company is quick to note that the majority of its more than 3,000 products are made in America. In 2014 the company expanded its Personal Protective Equipment  product line with the new Journeyman Gloves. and in 2014 it grew its Voice/Data/Video punchdown tool line with a new Cushion-Grip Impact Punchdown Tool and Blade. It also opened of new heat treating facility in the US that year.

   While best known as a maker of hand tools, the company has signaled an interest in power-driven gear and in expanding its assortment of diagnostic equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tools maker regularly rolls out products to keep its portfolio fresh. In 2013, Klein Tools added new tech bags to its Tradesman Pro Organizers line that are designed to hold laptops and other tech devices such as meters and smartphones.

  <p>
   The company is actively pursuing international expansion through acquisitions. In 2014 the company expanded initiatives in the UK and Ireland through a major financial investment in and strategic partnership with Super Rod, a leader in wire installation tools.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Klein Tools entered the Australian market by making a significant financial investment in Mumme Tools, which specializes in making mining tools. Also that year it acquired Civitella &amp; Cia, a privately-held tool and equipment manufacturer in Brazil. Based in Sao Paulo, Civitella makes products for the electrical, construction, oil and gas, and telecommunication industries.

   In 2012 Klein Tools added to its manufacturing facilities with its Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center, located in Mansfield, Texas. The facility provides cutting-edge manufacturing processes, advanced research and development capabilities, and can test automated and robotic products.
  </p>

   While exploring powered tools, Klein has expanded its existing assortment of diagnostic equipment. In late 2010 the company acquired a 50% stake in UEi Test Instruments, an Oregon-based maker of measurement and testing equipment for HVAC and refrigeration professionals. Klein started peddling the UEi line to certain customers in 2011.
