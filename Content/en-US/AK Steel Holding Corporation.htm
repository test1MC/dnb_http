   Automobile sales help AK Steel's business keep rolling, though it also has operations in the infrastructure and manufacturing industries. The company manufactures carbon, stainless, and electrical steel. It sells hot- and cold-rolled carbon steel to construction companies, steel distributors and service centers, and automotive and industrial machinery producers. AK Steel also sells cold-rolled and aluminum-coated stainless steel to automakers. The company produces electrical steels (iron-silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties) for makers of power transmission and distribution equipment.

  <p>
   AK Steel has eight steelmaking, two coke plants, and finishing and tubing facilities in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The company also operates subsidiaries in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Germany, and other countries. The US accounted for 87% of AK Steel's 2015 revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The steelmaker operates on a consolidated, integrated basis in order to use the most appropriate equipment and facilities for the production of each product. Its major subsidiaries include AK Tube LLC, AK Coal Resources, Inc and Magnetation LLC. AK Tube produces carbon and stainless electric resistance welded tubular steel products for truck, automotive and other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   It produces flat-rolled value-added carbon steels, including premium-quality coated, cold-rolled and hot-rolled carbon steel products, and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in sheet and strip form, as well as carbon and stainless steel that is finished into welded steel tubing.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also works through joint ventures to share costs. Its Magnetation LLC joint venture with Magnetation, Inc. uses advanced magnetic separation technology to recover iron ore from existing stockpiles of previously-mined material.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, AK Steel indirectly owns 50% of Vicksmetal/Armco Associates, a joint venture with
   <company id="56930">
    Sumitomo
   </company>
   unit Vicksmetal Company. The joint venture slits electrical steel primarily for AK Steel and for third parties.

  <p>
   AK Steel sells a major portion of its flat-rolled carbon steel products and stainless steel products to US automotive manufacturers and to distributors, service centers, and converters. It sells electrical steel products (in the US and globally) to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers and electrical motors and generators to the infrastructure and manufacturing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The automotive industry accounted for 60% of the company's net sales in 2015; distributors and converters, 24%; infrastructure and manufacturing, 16%.

   <company id="10597">

   accounted for 12% and 11% of net sales in 2015. AK Steel shipped 81% of its flat-rolled steel products in 2015 to contract customers, with the balance to customers in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale.

  <p>
   In 2015 AK Steel's net sales increased by 3%  due to the addition of net sales from Dearborn Works following the September 2014 acquisition of that company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss increased by $412.1 million due to higher impairment of the Magnetation investment, and pension and Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefit net corridor charges, partially offset by increased sales. (The company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $256.3 million for 2015 related to its investment in Magnetation).
  </p>
  <p>
   AK Steel's net cash provided by the operating activities in 2015 was $200.3 million compared to $322.8 million cash used for the operating activities in the previous year. The primary reason was due to a change in accounts receivable and inventories.
  </p>

  <p>
   The steel industry has been consolidating for years as troubled companies have been snapped up by market leaders. AK Steel has maintained its independence, however, in part because of its status as a leading supplier of some high-grade niche products, such as components of stainless steel exhaust systems for carmakers.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2015, the company began to implement a strategy to target markets for its carbon steel products that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the lower margin carbon steel spot market, which experienced a sharp decline in pricing as a result of a deluge of low-priced imports of foreign steel. As a result, in late 2015, the company temporarily idled the blast furnace and steelmaking operations at its Ashland Works in Kentucky to improve capacity use at its Middletown Works and its Dearborn Works.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has increased its focus and spending on new product innovation, with particular focus on advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) for the automotive market with a to ship Next-Generation AHSS to its customers by early 2017. To accelerate innovation, it is building a new research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio with completion planned for late 2016. This center will provide advanced technical support to its customers, and develop new and improved products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a refinancing move, in 2013 the company's Magnetation LLC joint venture completed a $325 million senior secured note offering and has entered into a $50 million senior secured credit facility. The proceeds will be used to fund construction of a new plant in Reynolds, Indiana to produce high-quality iron ore pellets to supply AK Steel's blast furnaces in Ohio and Kentucky. Magnetation began providing the company with 50% of its annual iron ore requirements in 2015.

   Growing its assets, in 2014 AK Steel acquired
   <company id="17189">
    Severstal North America
   </company>
   's integrated steelmaking plant in Dearborn, Michigan for $707 million. The acquisition of Dearborn enhanced its business and operational strategies by positioning its carbon steelmaking operations close to its major northern automotive and other customers, expanding its platform to meet the increasing light-weighting demands of its  automotive customers, and enhancing its operational flexibility.

  <p>
   George Verity, who was in the roofing business in Cincinnati around the turn of the century, often had trouble getting sheet metal, so in 1900 he founded his own steel company, American Rolling Mill. His first plant, in Middletown, Ohio, was followed by a second production facility 11 years later in Ashland, Kentucky. Plant superintendent John Tytus, whose family was in paper milling, applied those rolling techniques to make American Rolling Mill's steel more uniform in thickness.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1926 Columbia Steel developed a process to overcome several production problems inherent in the Tytus method, and in 1930 American Rolling Mill bought Columbia Steel. The company changed its name to Armco Steel in 1948.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armco began diversifying in the 1950s and continued diversifying until the early 1980s. Subsidiaries were involved in coal, oil, and gas-drilling equipment and insurance and financial services, among other things. In 1978 the company changed its name to Armco Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armco began shedding subsidiaries in the early 1980s. Sales and market share increased as the company approached the billion-dollar mark at the end of the decade. In 1989 Armco formed Armco Steel Company with Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales reached $1.3 billion in 1991, though the high operating expenses in the steel industry of the 1990s kept profits low. Armco began looking outside the company for help, and in 1992 it persuaded retired steel executive Tom Graham to head the company. Graham brought with him another industry veteran, Richard Wardrop, who would succeed Graham as CEO in 1995. After evaluating the company's holdings, the two divested more than 10 subsidiaries and divisions. Armco also worked on improving quality and customer service, with special emphasis placed on timely delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Armco's limited partnership with Kawasaki was altered and AK Steel Holding Corporation was formed, with AK Steel Corporation as its main subsidiary and the Middletown and Ashland plants as its production base. The holding company went public the same year, raising more than $650 million, enabling the company to pay off its debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   AK Steel Holding moved its headquarters to Middletown, Ohio, in 1995. Despite many naysayers, Graham then pushed a plan to build a state-of-the-art $1.1 billion steel production facility. Many doubted the wisdom of going into long-term debt so soon after coming out of the hole -- especially when a similar facility had produced lackluster results for Inland Steel. Graham stuck by his plant, and in 1997 ground was broken on the facility in Spencer County near Rockport, Indiana (Rockport Works). Graham retired that year, and Wardrop took over as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company opened its Rockport Works cold-rolling mill and began operating a hot-dip galvanizing and galvannealing line. The next year AK Steel bought former parent Armco for $842 million. AK Steel acquired welded steel tubing maker Alpha Tube Corporation (renamed AK Tube LLC) in 2001. In late 2001 the company took a charge of $194 million for losses in its pension fund, which had been battered by a weak stock market and lowered interest rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   AK Steel sold its Sawhill Tubular Division to John Maneely Company (Collingswood, NJ) for roughly $50 million in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   AK Steel offered to purchase
   <company id="16005">
    National Steel
   </company>
   , which was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. However, AK Steel's bid was trumped in 2003 by one from
   <company id="12969">
    U.S. Steel
   </company>
   that included a ratified labor agreement with the United Steelworkers of America. AK Steel also lost out in an effort to acquire Rouge Industries (later
   <company id="17189">
    Severstal North America
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and CEO Wardrop and president John Hritz left their posts in September 2003. CFO James Wainscott was named president and CEO, and Robert Jenkins became chairman. (Wainscott succeeded Jenkins as chairman in January 2006.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to reduce its debt, AK Steel in 2004 sold its Douglas Dynamics unit, a maker of snow and ice removal equipment, for $260 million, and its Greens Port Industrial Park, a 600-acre development in Houston, for $75 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company moved its corporate headquarters to West Chester, Ohio.
