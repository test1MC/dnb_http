   MediaNews Group counts some notable newspapers among its fold. The company operates some 60 daily newspapers, serving markets in about a dozen states. Its portfolio includes
   <em>
    The Denver Post,
   </em>
   the
   <em>
    St. Paul Pioneer Press
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    San Jose Mercury News
   </em>
   . Altogether, MediaNews publications boast a combined daily circulation of 2.3 million; Sunday circulation is about 2.5 million. It operates websites for all of its newspapers, hosted and supported by its MediaNews Group Interactive division. As part of its business, it owns a
   <company id="12435">
    CBS
   </company>
   affiliate TV station in Anchorage, Alaska, and four radio stations in Texas. Holding company Affiliated Media, which owns MediaNews, entered then later emerged from bankruptcy in 2010.

  <p>
   With the newspaper industry struggling, Affiliated Media filed for Chapter 11 to reduce its debt by about 80%, from about $930 million to $165 million.  Because only MediaNews' holding company filed for bankruptcy, its newspapers remained unaffected during the reorganization.

   The company, which is the second largest US newspaper company by circulation, has been focused on expanding its digital media distribution operations to take advantage of increased ad spending online. MediaNews plans to start charging viewers to read online content on its newspapers' websites. Subscribers, however, would be given free access.
  </p>
  <p>
   MediaNews has built its business through a series of acquisitions focused on creating newspaper clusters in specific markets, particularly in California, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Northeast. Its growth also has been helped by a variety of partnerships with other newspaper businesses.
   <em>
    The Salt Lake Tribune
   </em>
   is run under a joint operating agreement (JOA) with The Deseret News Publishing Company (part of
   <company id="43075">
    Deseret Management
   </company>
   and owner of the
   <i>
    Deseret News
   </i>
   ). MediaNews has a 60% interest in a partnership with
   <company id="163382">
    Gannett
   </company>
   that operates newspapers in Texas, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania.

  <p>
   When 14-year-old Dean Singleton started working in the mailroom of a Texas newspaper in 1966, he dreamed of owning his own paper. Following a failed attempt to revive the struggling Fort Worth Press in 1975, he was pelted with beer cans as he told the staff of its demise. Singleton honed his success-at-any-cost attitude at
   <company id="57181">
    Allbritton Communications
   </company>
   , where he became president in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   He teamed with third-generation newspaper owner Richard Scudder in 1983, co-inventor of the newsprint recycling process, to purchase New Jersey's
   <em>
    Gloucester County Times
   </em>
   . The duo then bought five more dailies in New Jersey and Ohio, and later formed MediaNews Group as a corporate rubber band for all their papers. MediaNews acquired the lackluster
   <i>
    Dallas Times Herald
   </i>
   in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later it bought
   <i>
    The Denver Post
   </i>
   and the now-defunct
   <i>
    Houston Post
   </i>
   (which it sold in 1995 to
   <i>
    Houston Chronicle
   </i>
   publisher
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst
   </company>
   ). Singleton reduced staff at the
   <i>
    Times Herald,
   </i>
   closed news bureaus, and eliminated the Sunday magazine. MediaNews sold the paper in 1988; it closed for good in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   MediaNews continued to buy newspapers, including five from
   <company id="127169">
    Eagle Publishing
   </company>
   (1995), 15 from Thomson Corp. (1996; now
   <company id="159650">
    Thomson Reuters
   </company>
   ), and the
   <i>
    Los Angeles Daily News
   </i>
   (1997). It also sold
   <i>
    The North Jersey Herald and News,
   </i>
   plus 11 community weeklies to a
   <i>
    Herald and News
   </i>
   rival. MediaNews acquired 50% of Charleston Newspapers (West Virginia) and the
   <i>
    Farmington Daily Times
   </i>
   (New Mexico) in 1998. The next year it increased its stake in
   <i>
    The Denver Post
   </i>
   to 80%. It also acquired Garden State Newspapers in 1999 but sold most of its assets the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company ventured into radio and television in 2000 with the acquisition of some radio stations in Alaska and Texas, and TV station KTVA in Anchorage, Alaska. It acquired another big market paper in 2001 with the purchase of
   <em>
    The Salt Lake Tribune
   </em>
   . That year MediaNews and
   <company id="13254">
    E. W. Scripps
   </company>
   formed the
   <company id="113078">
    Denver Newspaper Agency
   </company>
   to run their competing papers
   <i>
    The Denver Post
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Rocky Mountain News
   </i>
   under a joint operating agreement. (E. W. Scripps closed its money-losing paper in 2009; the JOA was later dissolved.) In 2001 the company also bought several papers in New Mexico, including the
   <i>
    Alamogordo Daily News
   </i>
   . MediaNews Group added to its holdings with its 2002 purchase of
   <i>
    The Reporter
   </i>
   newspaper in Vacaville, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company acquired Pennsylvania newspaper, the
   <em>
    York Daily Record,
   </em>
   from News Alliance, and the following year MediaNews purchased
   <em>
    The
   </em>
   <em>
    Detroit News
   </em>
   from
   <company id="10623">
    Gannett
   </company>
   . MediaNews, along with Hearst, struck a $1 billion deal in 2006 to acquire four newspapers from
   <company id="10971">
    McClatchy
   </company>
   , including the
   <em>
    San Jose Mercury News
   </em>
   , the
   <em>
    Contra Costa Times
   </em>
   , and the
   <em>
    St. Paul Pioneer Press
   </em>
   . The following year Hearst transferred its share of ownership in the group to MediaNews in exchange for a 30% stake in the company's newspaper operation outside the San Francisco area.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 MediaNews' debt-ridden parent company, Affiliated Media, filed for Chapter 11; it emerged from bankruptcy later that year after reducing its debt by more than 80%.
