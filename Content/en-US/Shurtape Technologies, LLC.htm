   Shurtape Technologies is on a roll and holding strong. Its tape products include: masking and paper, foil and film, double-coated, cloth and duct, and specialty (insulation and printable). Applications for Shurtape's products include packaging and project, industrial, retail, HVAC, arts and entertainment, professional paint, auto, marine, and aerospace. Shurtape has plants and facilities in China, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America. The company derives its name from its original parent, Shurford Mills, which began as a maker of textile yarns and a leading manufacturer of cordage and twine.

   Shurtape's packaging and project tapes are made for carton sealing and strapping, as well as outdoor tread (anti-skid) and electrical applications. The company makes gaffer's tape and other specialty production-related tapes through its entertainment division Permacel Arts, and partner Pro Tapes &amp; Specialties. Masking, poly cloth, and film tapes are used in painting applications. It also makes products for aerospace, ship and boat building, as well as automotive OEMs.

   Shurtape's new tape product designs include PF 220, which is designed to protect HVAC equipment from contaminants. PC 626 features the official digital camouflage pattern used for US Army combat uniforms. T-REX duct tape is made by laminating layers together to produce a strong tape that is weather-resistant.

  <p>
   In 1955 Shurford Mills started a tape division to respond to the growing US demand for masking tape and spun it off as Shurtape Technologies, which today designs, develops, and makes pressure sensitive tapes.
