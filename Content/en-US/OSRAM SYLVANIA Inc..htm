   OSRAM SYLVANIA's general lighting business unit manufactures incandescent, fluorescent, and high-intensity discharge lamps that are marketed and distributed throughout the US to industrial, commercial, and retail customers, as well as to OEM and aftermarket lamp manufacturers.

The company sells products for homes, businesses and vehicles under the OSRAM, Traxon, ENCELIUM and SYLVANIA brand names.

   Financial Performance
  </p>
  <p>
   The company saw marginal decline in revenues in 2013 largely due to the drop in the traditional general lighting business and OSRAM SYLVANIA's exit from the traditional maintenance business in the US.

   According to the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   , lighting is said to be responsible for about 20% of electrical energy consumption in the US. Consumers and businesses spend approximately $37 million a year to light their homes, offices, streets, and factories. However, advanced technologies can significantly reduce energy consumption and costs. LED lighting coupled with lighting management systems, for instance, can save up to 80%. Demand for such products and integrated systems is increasing due to both consumer and government outcries for better energy savings. This demand is leading to reduced usage of incandescent light bulbs and increased adoption of LED-based lighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to this demand, OSRAM SYLVANIA is busy building out its energy-efficient lighting portfolio, introducing a comprehensive SYLVANIA fixture line for commercial and residential use that includes LED modules, power supplies, controls, lighting services, and LED retrofits. It is also making improvements to predecessor products, including its high-efficiency QUICKTRONIC, T5, T5HO, and T8 PROstart electronic ballasts and longer-life OCTRON lamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company introduced OSRAM LIGHTIFY connected lighting kits (indoor and outdoor lighting products that can be controlled and automated via an app on a customer's mobile device).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it expanded its OSRAM OPTOTRONIC Programmable LED power supplies, which include outdoor drivers, and grew its indoor portfolio, and also launched a line of ORIOSTM LED lamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year
   <company id="10920">
    Lowes
   </company>
   introduced SYLVANIA ULTRA iQ, the first LED bulb designed to work with the Lowe's Iris home management system.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 OSRAM SYLVANIA teamed up with
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   to offer energy efficient light bulbs that can be controlled remotely from anywhere through Comcast's Xfinity Home platform. Comcast also plans to enhance its Xfinity Home service by providing Sylvania's energy-saving LED smart light bulbs that can save up to 83% in energy costs and last up to 17.5 times longer than standard incandescent light bulbs.

  <p>
   Strengthening its general lighting business unit's position in light emitting diode-based technologies and lighting control software, OSRAM SYLVANIA signed an agreement with Townsend Ventures in 2011 to increase its stake in Encelium Technologies from 15% to 100%. Encelium complements the company's general lighting portfolio of energy-efficient lighting products for industrial and commercial buildings.

   OSRAM AG transitioned into a stock corporation from a limited liability company called OSRAM GmbH in 2011. The year before OSRAM SYLVANIA Inc. merged into OSRAM SYLVANIA Products Inc., with the resulting entity renamed OSRAM SYLVANIA Inc.
