   them. ASICS America is the North American arm of Japanese athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories maker
   <company id="101085">
    ASICS Corporation
   </company>
   . Its shoe collection -- featuring a trademarked stripe design -- includes footwear for basketball, running, golf, track and field, tennis, soccer, volleyball, walking, and wrestling. ASICS products, which were introduced in the US in 1977, are sold at regional and national retailers throughout the country, as well as through online vendors such as

   ASICS America contributed about 29% of its parent's fiscal 2014 revenue. It attributes the gains to strong sales of running shoes and the positive effect of foreign exchange rates.

   For parent ASICS, its North American subsidiary is where it has found successes in recent years in marketing high-end running shoes. As with other competitors, such as
   <company id="11266">
    Reebok International Ltd.
   </company>
   , ASICS is focused on supplying its customers with sports lifestyle products and targeting general consumers, rather than the upscale, professional sports audience. In 2014 it's continuing its efforts to penetrate the beach volleyball niche.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent company ASICS has plans for stores in US markets, such as Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Indeed, through 2017 ASICS plans to open about 80 directly managed stores each year in certain markets, such as Europe and the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support its growth, ASICS America has been expanding its footprint in Mississippi in recent years. In 2014 the company created a central footwear and apparel distribution center in Byhalia, Mississippi, inside the Chickasaw Trail Industrial Park. The move consolidated a 520,000-sq.-ft. distribution center that it opened in 2011 and added another 342,000 sq. ft.

   ASICS derives its name from the Latin phrase, Anima Sana in Corpore Sano -- a sound mind in a sound body. It took ASICS 60 years to expand its retail business to US soil. ASICS America opened a 1,100-sq.-ft. store in New York across from Bryant Park in a former
   <company id="42602">
    New Balance
   </company>
   location. As the activewear sponsor of the 2010 New York City Marathon, ASICS America strategically positioned its marathon merchandise in the front of the store.
