   Bullets?!! We don't need no stinkin' bullets -- not with the Buck Rogers technology of Applied Energetics. The company is developing Laser Guided Energy and Laser Induced Plasma Channel directed-energy weapons for sale to the US government. In plain English? Laser-guided, man-made lightning! Applied Energetics is developing more compact laser sources and field testing its technology for mobile platforms such as tanks, Humvees, and personnel carriers. Depending on the military situation, the charge can be set to stun or kill people, or to disable vehicles. Applied Energetics also develops technology for neutralizing car bombs and other explosives.

  <p>
   Former mergers-and-acquisitions attorney and New York real estate developer Robert Kassel decided to start a company aimed at environmentally conscious home gardeners. Set up as Natural Earth Technologies in 1990, the firm went public in 1992 and bought Golden West Chemical Distributors the same year. Kassel changed corporate strategy in 1994 and bought Easy Gardener, a market leader in garden fabrics. The next year Natural Earth changed its name to U.S. Home &amp; Garden (USHG) to reflect its broadening product range.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions made the company one of the leading consolidators in the highly fragmented home gardening market. Purchases included Emerald Products (garden-edging equipment, 1995), Weatherly Consumer Products (Jobe's plant spikes and other products, 1996), and Plastic Molded Concepts' Plasti-Chain decorative edgings line (1997). USHG's 1998 growth included acquisitions of Landmaster Products, Tensar's lawn and garden fencing product line, and Ampro Industries, a distributor of specialty grass and flower seeds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched its www.Egarden.com business-to-business sales Web site in 1999. Losses from the Egarden startup, prolonged winter weather, and the recall of a Weed Wizard trimmer head model hurt the company's sales in 2000 and 2001. In 2001 USHG closed Egarden.com and an Ampro facility in Michigan. The company took a nearly $17 million write-off for restructuring and loss of goodwill resulting from the Weed Wizard recall; it discontinued the Weed Wizard business in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its home and garden business to Easy Garden Products in 2003. USHG merged with Ionatron, a developer of directed-energy weapons, in 2004 and changed its name to Ionatron that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2004 Ionatron bought the assets of North Star Research, a maker of high-voltage equipment for aerospace, defense, medical, and semiconductor applications. Ionatron then signed a deal to move its operations to a former ammunition plant at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. These operations, however, were disrupted in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina and the manufacturing activities conducted there were moved to Tucson, Arizona.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 and 2006 the company, at the behest of the US government, worked to develop a system to counter improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, that have proven catastrophic for US troops serving in Iraq. In 2007 the company completed a series of government-sponsored tests on its newly developed anti-IED system. Unlike its made-made lightning weapon, the company's anti-IED system was likely to be fielded in battle sooner, rather than later. That same year Ionatron was awarded contracts by the

    Navy
   </company>
   and
   <company id="150344">
    Army
   </company>
   for about $12 million. In 2008 Ionatron changed its name to Applied Energetics.
