   Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but for&#160;General Cigar a cigar is money. The company produces Macanudo, the #1 premium cigar in the US, and other brands, such as Cohiba and Bolivar, which are distributed for sale through tobacco retailers nationwide. The Macanudo brand consists of Macanudo, Macanudo Robust, Macanudo Maduro, and Macanudo Vintage Cabinet Selection. The&#160;firm operates the Club Macanudo cigar bar in New York City and grows, cures, ages, and processes&#160;wrapper tobacco in Connecticut through its&#160;Culbro Tobacco unit.

   The Cullman family emigrated from Germany in 1848. For two generations they prospered as tobacco merchants, before Joseph Cullman, Jr., began growing wrapper tobacco in Connecticut. His sons, Edgar and Joseph III, both followed him into the industry. Joseph III eventually became chairman of Philip Morris.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1961 Edgar -- along with his family, the Haas family (owners of Levi Strauss), and The Ford Foundation -- bought General Cigar Holdings, whose brands included White Owl. During the next three decades, the company expanded into consumer products by buying Imperial Nurseries (1967) and wholesaler Eli Witt (1983, 50% sold in 1994). The company became Culbro in 1976.
  </p>
        <p>
   Tobacco sales fell to a low of 9% of Culbro's total revenues in 1987, but a resurgence in cigar smoking during the 1990s sparked sales. Renewing its commitment to the cigar industry, it purchased Florida-based cigar maker Villazon (owner of popular cigar trademarks Punch, Hoyo de Monterrey, and El Rey del Mundo) in 1996. Culbro split into two public companies -- General Cigar Holdings and Griffin Land &amp; Nurseries -- in 1997. Toward the end of that year, General Cigar's stock price began a long slide.

        <p>
   In 1997 General Cigar began battling with Empresa Cubana del Tobaco (Cubatabaco), which produces the highly prized Cohiba cigar (initially made for Fidel Castro). Cubatabaco's cigar can't be sold legally in the US, where General Cigar (which registered Cohiba as a US trademark in the 1970s) has been selling its own Cohiba-brand stogie. Cubatabaco sued General Cigar over trademark infringement; General Cigar's request for a jury trial was rejected in late 2000. In 2004 a New York judge ruled against General Cigar over the use of the Cohiba trademark. The company plans to appeal the decision.

   General Cigar sold its mass-market cigar business (Garcia y Vega, White Owl, Tiparillo, and Tijuana Smalls brands) to Swedish Match in 1999 for $200 million. In 2000 Swedish Match's purchase of 64% of General Cigar took the company private. To consolidate cigar manufacturing, the company closed its Cifuentes y Cia plant in Jamaica in 2000 and its Villazon plant in Tampa, Florida, in 2001. In 2002 General Cigar lost the antitrust lawsuit it filed against competitor

   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Until&#160;early 2005 the Cullman family owned about 36% of General Cigar. After heated buyout negotiations, Swedish Match purchased the remaining shares&#160;held by the&#160;Cullmans.

   President and COO Daniel Nunez retired in 2009 after 34 years with the company. Dan Carr, the company's&#160;SVP of sales and marketing, succeeded Nunez.
