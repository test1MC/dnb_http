   Richline is extending its reach through licensing agreements. In 2013 it inked a deal with PrivateCollection &amp; Co. to make, market, and distribute jewelry in the US and Canada under the Marie Claire brand, which has a strong presence in both Asia and Australia in fashion, beauty, and home decor (generating some $350 million in sales annually).

   To expand its portfolio of products, Richline in 2013 bought freshwater cultured pearl brand Honora in the US, as well as the Rio Grande jewelry brand. Boosting its presence in Europe, Richline acquired the assets of Italian jeweler Rosato in 2011.
