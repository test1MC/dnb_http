   Itinerant brewer and barrel maker Conrad Binding purchased a small brewery, the Ehrenfried Glock, in the old town district of Frankfurt in 1870. Seeking to modernize the business and increase brewing capacity, he followed the purchase by building a new brewery on the Sachsenhäuser Berg, also in Frankfurt. The brewery was incorporated as Binding-Brauerei AG in 1884.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1921 the company merged with two other breweries (the Schöfferhofer Court Beer Brewery and the Frankfurt Citizens Brewery) and became Schöfferhofer-Binding-Bürgerbräu AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like many European businesses, the company suffered the disastrous consequences of WWII. Allied air raids in 1945 left its Frankfurt brewery 70% destroyed. It was 1957 before the company could build a new brew house. The years between 1961 and 1969 also saw major construction projects: New facilities for bottling, administration, and brewing were built.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 Binding-Brauerei acquired the Selters mineral spring and began producing the Selters brand of carbonated mineral water. (Common mispronunciation led the product to become known as "Seltzer" or "Seltzer water" in some parts of the world.) In addition, the company was among the first to develop a nonalcoholic brew. Its Clausthaler brew was launched in 1979 and quickly established itself as the leader in the nonalcoholic market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s the company began looking outside its native Germany for business opportunities. It acquired the Royal Krusovice Brewery in the Czech Republic in 1995 and the Dojlidy Brewery in Poland the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2000 Binding-Brauerei decided to sell its Meyer &amp; Sohne subsidiary (maker of the Riegeler beer brand) to Furstlich Furstenbergische Brauerei as part of its strategy to focus on national and international beer brands. Klaus Peter Erbrich, formerly chairman of the management board, was named chairman of the supervisory board in July. Ullrich Kallmeyer succeeded Erbrich as management board chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2000 the company became an acquisition target as feuding families sought to gain control of Austria's BBAG brewing empire. BBAG is now owned by

    Heineken
   </company>
   . In January 2002 the company changed its name to Radeberger Gruppe AG. Two years later the company purchased a majority stake in Brau und Brunnen.
