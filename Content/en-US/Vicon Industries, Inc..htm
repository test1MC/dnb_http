  <p>
   The company reported a 20% drop in revenues in 2013, primarily due to a slump in North American sales and order rates, which were negatively affected by, among other things, a technical matter relating to a prior release of its ViconNet video management software application
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks to a gain on the sale of its Hauppauge, New York, headquarters facility in August 2013, Vicon reported net income of $19,000 for 2013 compared with a net loss of $1.4 million in 2012. Vicon has posted a loss in cash flow from its operations for the last four years.

  <p>
   Vicon plans to continue investing heavily in product development, in spite of its losses. It sees development of new products, such as high definition surveillance cameras, as key to staying ahead of its competition and remaining relevant in the security products industry. Vicon is constantly seeking out other security and video companies whose products complement its video surveillance offerings. As a result, it enters into several strategic partnerships with companies who meet our criteria of product excellence, innovation, and value.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company partnered with Axis Communications, engaged in network video, for applications development at an event held in Mexico City. That year Vicon also introduced the V920D Series of rugged indoor and outdoor network domes, with a choice of standard definition, 720p and 1080p resolutions. It also launched the H264-16CH-ENCDR (a high-performance, 16-channel H.264 encoder that allows for the use of analog cameras side-by-side with IP models within a VMS network) and the HDExpress, a revolutionary IP video product.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company introduced the 1080p version of its Surveyor HD PTZ dome at ISC West; a new corner-mount camera, V-CELL-IP, for Prison Cells; ViconNet IP video management software; and other products.
