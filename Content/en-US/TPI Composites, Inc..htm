   Without TPI Composites, there would be no wind in "wind power." The company is an independent manufacturer of composite wind blades. It signs agreements with its wind turbine manufacturer customers in which they use TPI's facilities in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets, which consists of at least three wind blades. Major customers include
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="121333">
    Vestas Wind Systems A/S
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="106443">
    Nordex SE
   </company>
   . The company operates through five facilities in the US, three in China, and one each in Mexico and Turkey. TPI traces its founding back to 1968, but it began producing wind blades in 2001. It launched an IPO in mid-2016.

  <p>
   TPI launched an IPO in the summer of 2016 and raised almost $69 million. It will use the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of its existing manufacturing operations and expanding in existing and new geographies. It also plans to use about $2 million of this amount to pay down debt.

   Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, TPI operates out of other facilities in Newton, Iowa; Fall River, Massachusetts; Warren, Rhode Island; and Santa Teresa, New Mexico. International facilities reside in Dafeng, China; Taicang Port, China; Taicang City, China; Juarez, Mexico; and Izmir, Turkey.

   TPI caters mainly to OEM customers that manufacture wind blades and related precision molding and assembly systems. It typically enters long-term supply agreements in which it grants customers access to its facilities in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets, which usually consist of three wind blades. TPI believes this supplier model guarantees itself contracted volumes that generate significant revenue opportunities and allows it to produce wind blades at a lower total delivered cost.

   Its OEM customers include

   </company>
   , Gamesa Wind US, and

  <p>
   To meet ongoing growth in the wind power generation industry, many OEMs are shifting from manufacturing wind blades themselves to the outsourced manufacture of their wind blades -- and this is where TPI comes into play. TPI's collaborative approach, advanced composite technology, and strategic global manufacturing footprint have allowed it to capitalize on this trend by replacing or augmenting the in-house capabilities of its customers and efficiently delivering wind blades where required.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, its facilities in the US, China, Mexico, and Turkey create a geographically-diverse, global production platform to meet its customers' needs in key large and growing wind markets. It will continue to expand in certain existing markets and in new locations that represent growth opportunities for the wind energy market and its customers.
