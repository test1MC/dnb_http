   Special Devices aims to feel, well, special among the leading US makers of initiators (pyrotechnic devices) -- used primarily in automotive airbag systems. The airbag initiators activate inflators that enable the airbag to be deployed. The company also makes micro gas generators that remove seat belt slack in the event of a collision. Other products include bolts, nuts, fire suppression systems, cable cutters, pin pullers and pin pushers, propelling cartridges, and other engineered energetic devices. Special Devices sells its products primarily to airbag manufacturers, including
