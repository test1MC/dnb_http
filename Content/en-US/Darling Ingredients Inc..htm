   A rather dainty name for a messy business, Darling Ingredients is the largest publicly traded rendering operation in the US; it collects and recycles animal by-products, used cooking grease, and bakery waste, and offers grease-trap cleaning services. It counts restaurants, butcher shops, grocery stores, and independent meat and poultry processors among its customers. Darling also produces yellow grease, tallow, and meat, bone, and blood meal. The company sells its products nationwide and overseas to makers of soap, rubber, oils, pet and livestock feed, and chemicals.

  <p>
   Texas-based Darling Ingredients rings up about 55% of its sales in the US. Export markets include Asia, the European Union, Mexico, North Africa, the Pacific Rim, and South America. The company operates a global network of over 200 locations, including 140 production facilities spanning five continents.

   In 2014 the company's business operations were reorganized into three new reportable operating segments: Feed Ingredients (61% of net sales), Food Ingredients (32%), and Fuel Ingredients (7%). The restructuring was fueled by a previous acquisition and aligned the company's operations based on the products and services offered to various end markets.

  <p>
   The company operates a fleet of trucks, trailers, and railcars for collection of its raw materials.

  <p>
   Darling's revenues skyrocketed by more than 100% in 2014 to achieve record-shattering growth mainly due to additional revenue from a previous acquisition. The historic growth was fueled by extra sales from Fuel Ingredients, its newest segment. Darling's profits, however, have declined over the years and fell from 2013 to 2014 due to rising depreciation and amortization expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisitions it made.

  <p>
   For Darling, competition comes mostly from obtaining its raw materials. Large meat-packing companies usually handle their own rendering in-house. As the meat industry has consolidated, fewer independent meat and poultry processors are left from whom to collect scraps; however, until the economic recession, Darling had been seeing growth in its restaurant-services division, even though collecting spent grease from restaurants is highly competitive. When it comes time to sell its commodity-grade products, Darling competes with vegetable-oil producers as well as other rendering operations.

  <p>
   Darling achieved historic growth in 2014 through the use of key acquisitions. In 2014 the company added a new segment to its operating structure when it acquired the VION Ingredients business division of VION Holding for approximately â‚¬1.6 billion in cash. VION Ingredients develops and produces specialty ingredients from animal origins for applications in the pharmaceuticals, food, feed, pet food, fertilizer, and bio-energy sectors.

   Throughout 2013 Darling acquired two businesses: Rothsay, a leading recycler of animal byproducts and producer of biodiesel in Canada; and Terra Renewal Services, a provider of essential environmental services focused on the collection, hauling, reprocessing, and recycling of waste cooking oil and disposal of non-hazardous, liquid and semi-solid waste streams.
