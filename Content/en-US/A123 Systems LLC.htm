   A123 Systems wants to get everyone all charged up over electric vehicles -- as long as they use its rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The company develops and makes rechargeable batteries and battery systems for the transportation, commercial, government, and electric grid services sectors. It also targets the fast-growing hybrid and electric automotive and heavy-duty vehicle markets. In the electric grid sector, the company is working with power generator
   <company id="10667">
    AES
   </company>
   to produce multi-megawatt battery systems that take the fluctuations out of the electricity grid and provide backup power during shortages. A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2012 and was bought by
   <company id="149861">
    Wanxiang Group
   </company>
   in early 2013.

   After struggling with sky-high expenses for years, A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012, listing a debt load of $376 million. Shortly after it filed, Chinese auto parts conglomerate
   <company id="149861">
    Wanxiang Group
   </company>
   agreed to acquire the majority of A123's assets for $257 million. Assets include technology, products, customer contracts, and US facilities in Michigan, Massachusetts and Missouri; manufacturing operations in China; and an equity interest in Shanghai Advanced Traction Battery Systems Co., A123's joint venture with
   <company id="57065">
    Shanghai Automotive

   . Due to foreign ownership regulations, Wanxiang Group  was not allowed to buy A123's government business that has contracts with the US military.

   Much of A123's growth has been tied to growth in the hybrid electric car and heavy-duty vehicle and electric grid storage markets. Overall sales surged by 64% in 2011 over 2010 ($159 million from $97 million), mostly as a result of an increase in the company's manufacturing capacity. However, the bad news for A123 is that it has never been profitable. It continues to report losses -- its net loss in 2011 was $258 million --as it invests in product development, sales, and marketing to support future growth. The company has incurred significant expenses in transitioning from prototype to volume production. It has more than doubled its worldwide manufacturing capacity, purchased capital equipment, and moved more of its production in-house. The company in 2012 closed its plant in Korea in an effort to cut costs and consolidate its resources.

   A123 was formed in 2001 and went public in 2009. The company used the proceeds of its IPO to expand its manufacturing facilities and to fund additional research and development. The R&amp;D side is a company stronghold, partly because its Nanophosphate technology comes from nanoscale materials developed at
