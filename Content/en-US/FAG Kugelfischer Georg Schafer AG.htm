   FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer (FAG) likes to keep things moving. It began as a sewing machine repair shop in the late 19th century, but FAG is now a worldwide bearing manufacturer. The company makes ball and roller bearings and linear guidance systems for aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications. Its FAG Industrial Services affiliate provides services to the construction, engineering, and steel industries. FAG also sells its bearings to the automotive industry for use in the chassis, engines, and drive trains. The company exited the sewing machine business in 2005. FAG is a brand of parent company and fellow German bearing maker, the

  <p>
   The origins of the rolling steel bearing, a piece of technology that often goes unnoticed, can be found in a small repair shop of the late 19th century. In 1872 Friedrich Fischer started a small sewing machine repair shop, and this eventually blossomed into an early version of FAG in 1883. That year Fischer began mass producing uniform-size steel balls, a pioneering feat that earned him the nickname "Kugelfischer" (Ball Fischer). At about the same time Georg Schäfer founded a locksmith's business, but in 1906 merged it with a tubing and metal works business to form the Georg Schäfer and Cie. firm. Friedrich Fischer died of a stroke in 1899 at the age of 50, leaving behind a business employing 400 people. In 1909 the Fischer and Schäfer firms teamed up as a general partnership. The FAG acronym -- for Fischer Aktien-Gesellschaft -- was originally registered in 1905 (but not added to the company's name until 1979). Employment grew to 1,000 employees at the outset of WWI.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the retirement of minority partners in 1919, Georg Schäfer and his son-in-law, Hermann Barthel, acquired full control of the firm. After recovering from the hardships of the war and poor business conditions in the postwar Weimar Republic, FAG employed nearly 2,000 workers when Georg Schäfer died in 1925. Ownership was divided among his widow, son-in-law Hermann Barthel, and his son, Georg Schäfer Jr., who had joined the company in 1919 and became its executive director three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1936 FAG established its first overseas plant in Wolverhampton, UK. Threats of war forced the plant's closure, however. Hermann Barthel left FAG in 1939 and died in 1941, at which time the company became known as Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer &amp; Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the company set up subsidiary plants in Ebern and Eltmann. Bombing raids that commenced in 1943 and continued until the end of the war left the company's main Schweinfurt plant in ruins and FAG's prospects dim. Georg Schäfer Jr. and his brother Otto resumed management of FAG in 1948.
  </p>
  <p>
   FAG kept its business within German borders until the 1950s when it began setting up foreign distribution and production companies. Georg Schäfer Jr. died in early 1975 at the age of 78.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the late 1970s executives decided that a change was in order and reorganized the company as a limited partnership. The company was listed publicly for the first time in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through much of the 1990s Germany was racked by a slow economy, and FAG felt the pinch. In 1993 FAG began to restructure, selling off three of its non-core divisions. The next year it expanded its line of bearings by opening a new superprecision unit to make rolling bearings for the aerospace, machine tool, and medical industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the restructuring continued, and the plan proved to last much of the recession-ridden decade. In 1997 FAG was still paring down; that year it began cutting jobs -- laying off more than 160 workers by year's end. In the late 1990s FAG hoped to soften the blow by expanding its international contracts. In 1997 the company opened a ball bearing plant near Shanghai, China, to focus on Asian car manufacturers. FAG dipped into its pocketbook in 1998 to buy 70% of a joint venture with Korean rolling bearing maker Hanwa Machinery. That year FAG also purchased HK Autoteile, an auto parts company based in Cologne, Germany. In 1999 former

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000, with the German economy improving and the company's restructuring complete, FAG opened its new FAG Automotive Hungary subsidiary, which makes cylindrical roller bearings and tapered roller bearings for passenger cars and transmission systems. FAG entered into a joint venture with Japanese bearing manufacturer

   in 2001 to make wheel hub bearings in the US. Later that year private German bearings maker INA-Holding Schaeffler made a hostile bid to acquire FAG. Without any other offers on the table, the company reluctantly accepted the offer at $670 million. Soon after the transaction was completed, Uwe Loos resigned from FAG.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made its Korean operation a wholly owned subsidiary in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   On July 29, 2005, FAG held global celebrations of the brand's centennial anniversary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Until 2005, FAG continued to make sewing machines through its
