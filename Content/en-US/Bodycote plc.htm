   Bodycote specializes in heat treatments, but don't look for its services at your day spa. The company applies thermal processing, consisting of heat treatment and metal joining, to improve the wear, resistance, and strength of metals, such as those used in jet engine turbine blades and car engines. Services include surface treatment and hot isostatic pressing -- a process that combines high-pressure inert gas with high temperatures to enhance the function of metals and other materials. Through a global network of plants, Bodycote serves a diverse group of OEMs in the aerospace, defense, power generation, and oil and gas markets, as well as automotive, construction, machine building, medical, and transportation.

  <p>
   Founded by Arthur Bodycote in 1923, the enterprise that bears his name originally made underwear. It went public in 1951. In 1969 Slater Walker exchanged various textile companies for a controlling stake in the company. Under Walker, the company grew and was renamed Bodycote International (1972). It gained independence from Walker in 1973 and diversified into safety products and workwear. The firm sought a service business and selected metal heat treating with its 1979 purchase of Blandburgh.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a 1980s foray into packaging, Bodycote got back on track in 1990, buying Metallurgical Testing Services. The next year it acquired HIP. Bodycote expanded into Europe and the US, and by 1995 it had 42 processing plants in eight countries. To fund its metal treatment operations, the company sold its textile businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bodycote expanded its surface coatings activities (sherardizing, electroplating) with the purchase of Hauzer Industries in 1996. It also bought Hinderliter Heat Treating (US) that year. In 1997 Bodycote expanded in Europe and Asia with the purchases of Brukens and HIT. Bodycote added Thermal Processing Group (UK) the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Bodycote sold its equipment manufacturing business and continued its international push into metal treatment services by picking up Metal Treating and Progressive Heat Treatment (US) and Twins Eloxering and Dala Plating Gruppen (Sweden). The company followed up in 2000 by buying Böhler-Uddeholm Thermo-Tech (Canada), Industricrom Fastighets (Sweden), Société Procolor (France), and Diamond Black Technologies (US).
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 Bodycote acquired two finishing companies: US-based Lindberg Corporation (now called Bodycote Lindberg Corporation), its largest single acquisition to date, and Oy Galvano AB of Finland. It added 11 other bolt-on acquisitions during the year, including K-Tech (ceramic coatings, US). In addition, the company's Canadian materials testing segment expanded into railway and aerospace testing services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Bodycote bought Italian-based Gamma and its heat treatment facilities located in Brescia and East Milan, which was integrated into its Gorgonzola business.
