   Medical Action Industries knows in advance that its products will end up in hospitals' waste bins. The company manufactures, markets, and distributes a wide range of single-use, disposable medical products. Some of its main products include IV start kits, sterilization products, surgical instrument kits, and dressing and surgical sponges. Though it sells primarily to hospitals, Medical Action Industries also serves doctors, dentists, veterinary clinics, outpatient centers, and nursing homes. Domestic sales, handled by in-house reps, are the bulk of revenue but Medical Action also sells internationally through independent distributors. Health care logistics firm

   In 2014 the company's largest distributor,
   <company id="11131">
    Owens &amp; Minor
   </company>
   , paid about $208 million for Medical Action to expand its service offerings and strengthen its relationships with manufacturers.

  <p>
   The company operates two US manufacturing facilities, in North Carolina and Virginia, where it assembles procedure kits and trays. The company purchases most of its cotton-based product lines (operating room sponges and towels) from overseas manufacturers, largely based in China; it also makes some products under private-label agreements with other medical suppliers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medical Action's top selling products include IV start kits, operating room towels, and central line dressing trays.

  <p>
   The company sells its products internationally and has offices in the US, China, and Brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in the US. Domestic sales account for 98% of Medical Action's revenue.

  <p>
   Medical Action's products are marketed in the US to hospitals and other acute care facilities through direct sales representatives, while distribution is handled by wholesalers. It also has limited international sales operations through independent distributors. Many of the company's US hospital customers are served through contracts with group purchasing organizations (GPOs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Wholesale distributors account for the majority of Medical Action Industries' annual revenues, including Owens &amp; Minor (45% prior to the acquisition) and Cardinal Health (19%). The wholesalers in turn deliver the company's products to end users including hospital GPOs Novation, Premier, and MedAssets, which together account for about 55% of total sales.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company reported a 35% decrease in revenue, from $441.6 million to $287.8 million, after disposing of its patient care division even though the rest of the business showed some growth due to higher sales and a price increase. After a huge net loss in 2013, $54.9 million, due to goodwill impairment, Medical Action reported net come of $4 million in 2014 without the impairment. The lack of impairment, however, impaired cash from operations and caused a 15% drop, from $20 million to $17 million.

  <p>
   To increase sales and profits, Medical Action Industries has widened its product line over the years through strategic acquisitions. Significant acquisitions include AVID Medical, a manufacturer of custom procedure trays, for some $62 million in 2010. The purchase gave Medical Action Industries' clinical care operations a healthy boost and accounted for 75% of the company's revenue growth in 2012 and is now the basis of its product line. Historical acquisitions have expanded the company's product line in areas including bedside, lab, and operating room supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Medical Action Industries conducts internal product development efforts to both add new offerings and to improve the design of existing products. The company's strategy also consists of adding sales and marketing resources, finding new markets for existing products, facilitating international expansion, and increasing productivity and efficiency. As GPO contracts are an important part of the firm's business model, the company seeks to maintain relations with such purchasing organizations and to expand the breadth of services provided to each group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company sold Medegen Medical Products and the rest of its patient care unit (bedside products, medical-waste containment systems, lab products) to Inteplast Group for about $75 million. The move brought in cash and reduced the company's exposure to volatile pricing in the resin market.
