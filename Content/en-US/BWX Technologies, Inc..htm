   Formerly Babcock &amp; Wilcox, BWX Technologies makes nuclear reactors for submarines and aircraft carriers and provides nuclear fuel to the US government. It also provides precision manufactured components to the commercial nuclear industry and offers technical, management, site support, and environmental remediation services to both governmental and commercial facilities. Operating through subsidiaries such as
   <company id="119295">
    Nuclear Fuel Services
   </company>
   , BWX has locations across North America; US government agencies are its largest customers. In 2015 the former Babcock &amp; Wilcox spun off its power generation business and renamed itself BWX.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BWX operates in three reportable segments: Nuclear Operations, Technical Services, and Nuclear Energy. Technical Services provides specialty services to the US Government, including uranium processing, environmental site restoration services and management and operating services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nuclear Operations and Technical Services work on the company's defense and nuclear contracts. Among its several efforts, B&amp;W manufactures nuclear power systems, integral to submarines and aircraft carriers. Its services include management and operation of the DOE's nuclear weapons base. The Nuclear Energy segment supplies commercial nuclear steam generators, components and services to nuclear utility customers. BWX has supplied the nuclear industry with more than 1,300 large, heavy components worldwide.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Through its Nuclear Operations segment, BWX owns and operates manufacturing plants in Lynchburg, Virginia; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Euclid, Ohio; Barberton, Ohio; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Erwin, Tennessee. In addition, the company has plants in Canada, Denmark, Scotland, Germany, Mexico, Canada, and China. The US accounted for 90% of BWX's revenues in 2016.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US government is BWX's largest customer, accounting for 87% of net sales in 2016.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BWX's revenues jumped 10% from $1.4 billion in 2015 to $1.6 billion in 2016. The growth was fueled by sales increases from all its segments: Nuclear Operations (8%), Technical Services (16%), and Nuclear Energy (22%). Geographically, BWX saw sales from Romania skyrocket by 76% in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Nuclear Operations experienced increased activity in the manufacturing of nuclear components for US Government programs in 2016, as well as increased demand from its naval nuclear fuel and downblending operations. Technical Services experienced higher activity at its Naval Reactor decommissioning and decontamination project, while Nuclear Energy experienced a higher volume of outage projects in Canada and a rise in refurbishment projects for the overall Canadian nuclear industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   BWX's net income climbed from $131 million in 2015 to $184 million in 2016 mainly due to the absence of costs associated with the previous spinning off of its power generation business. On the flip side, cash provided by operating activities decreased by $95 million to $240 million in 2016 largely due to changes in net contracts in progress and advance billings.

  <p>
   BWX touts more than five decades in delivering a slate of nuclear components and related facility services to US Naval programs, and to a lesser extent, to other US government, industrial, commercial, and institutional programs. However, competition for large government contracts typically attracts the world's largest rivals, including
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="121708">
    Bechtel National
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12066">
    Jacobs Engineering
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   BWX's bids are primarily made through joint ventures with other contractors, where BWX will accept a minor role, minimizing exposure to its market position. Examples are Pantex Plant, co-owned with
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   and Bechtel, and Y-12 National Security Complex, co-owned with Bechtel. Both are National Nuclear Security Administration sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 BWX signed a massive $3.1 billion contract to provide naval nuclear reactor components and fuel for the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. About $1.2 billion of this payout was received in 2016, and the majority of the remaining contract awards are expected to be received in 2017 and 2018, subject to annual Congressional appropriations.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core nuclear operations, BWX in 2015 separated its Power Generation business and Government and Nuclear Operations into two publicly traded companies. The nuclear operations remained with BWX, while the power generation business was spun off as Babcock &amp; Wilcox Enterprises.

  <p>
   In late 2016, BWX obtained Canada-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. The deal improved BWX's position within the CANDU market. CANDU stands for "CANada Deuterium Uranium" and refers to a Canadian-developed, pressurized heavy water reactor used to generate electric power.

  <p>
   Stephen Wilcox patented the water tube boiler in 1856, and two year later Wilcox and George Babcock established Babcock, Wilcox &amp; Company. At the turn of the century, B&amp;W boilers powered New York's first subway and President Roosevelt's Great White Fleet. In the mid-1940s the company provided components and materials for the Manhattan Project and designed components for the the world's first nuclear powered submarine, the
   <em>
    USS Nautilus
   </em>
   , a decade later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Babcock &amp; Wilcox became a subsidiary of engineering and construction giant
   <company id="10972">
    McDermott International
   </company>
   in 1978. As a result of mounting asbestos liability costs, B&amp;W filed for bankruptcy in 2000. McDermott deconsolidated B&amp;W's operations from its own financial statements at that time. Emergence from Chapter 11 in early 2006 returned B&amp;W to full reporting status.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further its ambitions in government operations, in 2007 the company bought Marine Mechanical Corporation for $71.5 million. MMC manufactures and supplies electro-mechanical equipment for the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   . The next year it acquired three companies, first paying $20 million for the Intech group of companies (Intech, Inc., Ivey-Cooper Services, L.L.C. and Intech International Inc.), a provider of nuclear inspection and maintenance services in the US and Canada. Delta Power Services, LLC, which serves the US power generation industry, complements the company's fossil fuel and biomass markets and will help it to expand into the natural gas-fired power generation market. Delta Power was bought for $13.5 million. Specialty nuclear fuels and service provider

    Nuclear Fuel Services
   </company>
   , bought for $157 million, brought experience in converting highly-enriched uranium into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors. Its fuel production facility is where the US military's submarines and aircraft carriers get their nuclear fill-up.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made two acquisitions in late 2009 and early 2010 to boost its international presence. First it bought Instrumentacion y Mantenimiento de Calderas, S.A., a boiler manufacturer in Mexico. A few months later it purchased Götaverken Miljö, a Swedish company specializing in flue gas cleaning and energy recovery, giving the company an entrée to the international energy market. The acquisition was made a part of B&amp;W's Volund unit, which creates thermal energy through byproducts such as household waste and biofuels.
