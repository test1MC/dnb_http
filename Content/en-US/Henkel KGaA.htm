   Home and hearth are at the heart of Henkel. The company makes branded products for laundry and homecare (Persil, Purex, Pril), cosmetics and toiletries (Schwarzkopf, Dial, Syoss) and many adhesives (Loctite, Ceresit, UniBond). Henkel's business is centered in Europe, with a growing presence in developing economies, such as Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America. It owns
   <company id="52370">
    The Dial Corporation
   </company>
   , anchoring its US market. Henkel owns subsidiaries in some 75 countries with offices located nearly everywhere. Started in 1876, the company is owned by descendants of the founding Henkel family. In 2016 the company bought laundry care company
   <company id="111086">
    Sun Products
   </company>
   in a deal worth $3.6 billion.

  <p>
   Henkel's business is divided among three units: laundry and homecare, which generates nearly 30% of sales; beauty care, approximately 20% of sales; and adhesive technologies, 50% of sales, which includes industrial adhesives as well as those for consumers, craftsmen, and building. Each unit claims a large share of their market through established brands. All told, the company's top 10-brands account for about 60% of sales. In beauty care 90% of sales are driven by the business unit's top-10 brands; in laundry and homecare, more than 80%; and in adhesive technologies, about 55%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Laundry and homecare and beauty care are primarily sold in Europe and North America, and certain developing regions. The company's adhesive technologies have gained a worldwide presence. Emerging markets (Eastern Europe, Africa/Middle East, Latin America, and Asia, excluding Japan) generate more than 40% of Henkel's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel manufactures products at 170 facilities dotting about 55 countries. Its largest plant, located in Düsseldorf, Germany, makes detergents and household cleaning products, as well as adhesives. The company's cosmetics and toiletries are produced at eight plants, with the largest located in Wassertrüdingen, Germany.

  <p>
   Revenue at Henkel has been growing steadily since 2010. In 2014 it increased about 3% due to slight increases in laundry and home care as well as beauty care. Adhesives were unchanged. The company cited global unrest, particularly in developing markets, along with a lack of growth in the eurozone. However strong cost controls allowed the company to deliver 2% profit growth.

  <p>
   A key component of Henkel's strategy is to simplify its operations. To that end, it has integrated its systems and applications software in Europe and Asia, converted nearly 50,000 employees to digital work environments, and combined its sourcing and supply chain activities into a global supply chain unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also uses acquisitions, in new and established markets, as a key part of its growth strategy. It made five purchases in 2014 in Europe and the US. Three of them were US professional hair care product manufacturers, making Henkel number three in the market.

  <p>
   In 2016 the company acquired laundry care company
   <company id="111086">
    Sun Products
   </company>
   from
   <company id="56734">
    Vestar Capital Partners
   </company>
   for some $3.6 billion. The acquisition, which includes Sun Products' Snuggle, all and Wisk detergents, and other brands, positions Henkel as second in the laundry care market in North America, behind
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The previous year, Henkel purchased
   <company id="10363">
    Colgate-Palmolive's
   </company>
   entire line of laundry care products in Australia and New Zealand, making it one of the largest detergent makers in those two countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it picked up three US-based professional hair care product companies - Sexy Hair, Alterna, and Kenra. It also purchased France's Spotless Group, which makes laundry and household care products and leads the market in France, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Later in the year Henkel acquired The Bergquist Company, a US-based supplier of thermal management products, to complement the adhesives product group. Lastly, it bought Novamelt, a German hotmelt adhesive maker.

  <p>
   In 1876 Fritz Henkel, a chemical plant worker, started Henkel &amp; Cie in Aachen, Germany, to make a universal detergent. He moved the business to Düsseldorf in 1878 and launched Henkel's Bleaching Soda, one of Germany's first brand-name products. In the 1880s the company began making water glass, an ingredient of its detergent, which differs from soap in the way it emulsifies dirt. Henkel debuted Persil, a detergent that eliminated the need for rubbing or bleaching clothes, in 1907. Persil became a leading detergent in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel set up an Austrian subsidiary in 1913. In response to a postwar adhesives shortage, the company started making glue for its own packaging and soon became Europe's leading glue maker. Henkel began making cleansers with newly developed phosphates in the late 1920s.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Fritz died in 1930, Henkel stock was divided among his three children. In the 1930s the company sponsored a whaling fleet that provided fats for its products, and by 1939 the firm had 16 plants in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Henkel lost most of its foreign plants and made unbranded soap in Germany. After the war the company retooled its plants, branched out into personal care products, and competed with Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Colgate-Palmolive for control of the German detergent market. (By 1968 Henkel dominated, with close to a 50% share.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 Henkel bought its first US company, Standard Chemicals (renamed Henkel Corp. in 1971). Konrad Henkel, who took over in 1961, modernized the company's image by making changes in management structure and marketing techniques. Henkel patented a substitute for environmentally harmful phosphates, acquired 15% of Clorox in 1974, and bought General Mills' chemical business in 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel, owned at the time by 66 family members, went public with nonvoting shares in 1985. It bought US companies Nopco (specialty chemicals) and Parker Chemical (metal surface pretreatment) in 1987 and Emery, the #1 US oleochemicals maker, in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel reorganized its product lines in 1991 by selling several noncore businesses. That year Henkel formed a partnership with
   <company id="10503">
    Ecolab
   </company>
   (of which it owned 24% -- later expanded to 50%); acquired interests in Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Slovenia; and introduced Persil in Spain and Portugal. In 1994 Henkel expanded into China and bought 25% of a Brazilian detergent maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 1995 acquisition of Hans Schwarzkopf GmbH made Henkel the #1 hair-coloring manufacturer in Germany. The company bought Novamax Technologies, a US-based maker of metal-surface treatments, in 1996. The next year Henkel paid $1.3 billion for US adhesive giant Loctite, its biggest purchase to date. In 1998 it bought Ohio-based adhesive maker Manco to combine its US and Canadian consumer adhesive businesses (parts of Loctite and LePage, respectively) under Manco. Henkel pushed into the US toiletries market in 1998 by paying $93 million for DEP and creating a new subsidiary, Schwarzkopf &amp; DEP Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Henkel created chemicals unit Cognis to focus primarily on palm kernel- and coconut oil-based products. To strengthen Cognis, Henkel bought Laboratoires Serobiologiques, a French producer of ingredients for the cosmetic and food industries, and divested specialty-paper chemicals operations. Henkel also formed a joint venture with soap maker Dial (Dial/Henkel LLC); the joint venture later bought the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning business from Creative Products Resource.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel picked up Yamahatsu Sangyo, a Japanese maker of hair colorants, in 2000. The company sold its Substral unit (fertilizer and plant care) to Scotts Company (now
   <company id="13555">
    Scotts Miracle-Gro
   </company>
   ). In 2001 Henkel bought
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   's metal-treatment chemicals business. In addition, the company sold its Cognis specialty chemicals unit to private equity funds Schroeder Ventures and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for about $2.2 billion. Also in 2001 Henkel said it would cut 2,500-3,000 jobs (about 5% of its workforce) over the next two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Henkel purchased a majority stake in La Luz S.A., a Central American manufacturer and marketer of detergents and household cleaners. (Henkel entered the Latin American detergents market via Mexico in 2000.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel strengthened its adhesives business in Russia and North, Central, and Eastern Europe when it acquired Makroflex from YIT Construction Ltd. in July 2003. Makroflex, located in Finland and Estonia, developed and made old sealants and insulation materials for the construction industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Henkel acquired
   <company id="10048">
    Alberto-Culver
   </company>
   's Indola European professional hair care business, which had logged about $55 million in recent annual sales. That year Henkel and US bleach giant
   <company id="10354">
    Clorox
   </company>
   agreed to a deal (in the form of an asset swap) that dissolved Henkel's nearly 30% stake in Clorox. The $2.8 billion transaction involved Henkel's purchase of Clorox's 20% stake in Henkel Iberica, a joint venture between the two in Portugal and Spain. Henkel also bought Clorox's stake in a pesticide company as part of the transaction and added Combat insecticides and Soft Scrub bathroom cleaner to its brand portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henkel acquired Advanced Research Laboratories in 2004 and folded the company into its existing Schwarzkopf &amp; Dep subsidiary, based in California. The deal boosted the company's share of the US hairstyling market. Henkel bought US-based Dial Corporation (Dial soap, Purex laundry products, Renuzit air fresheners) in 2004 for $2.9 billion in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 Henkel bought 70% of Coventry's Chemtek, an independent firm that specializes in formulating and manufacturing liquid cleaners. The balance of the share is owned by Charteredbrands of Edinburgh.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its foothold in the electronics market in China, Henkel in late 2005 bought a majority stake in Huawei Electronics Co. Ltd., a maker of epoxy molding compounds for semiconductors.
