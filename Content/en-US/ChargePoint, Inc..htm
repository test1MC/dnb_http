   If you own an electric or hybrid car, ChargePoint (formerly Coulomb Technologies) products and services may get you charged up. The start-up company designs and builds charging stations for plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles. The company's branded charging stations are targeted to parking lot owners and municipalities and can be installed in areas like apartment and workplace parking lots as well as along public streets. The stations are linked together on a network and are tied into municipal electrical grids; drivers pay for access to ChargePoint's stations through subscription-based memberships. The company was co-founded in 2007 by CEO Richard Lowenthal and other company executives.
