   If your head craves sweet tunes, Skullcandy has a treat for you. The youth-oriented firm designs and sells edgy, stylish headphones, ear buds, docking speakers, and other audio goodies, as well as apparel and accessories under the Skullcandy, Astro Gaming, and 2XL brands.

   , through the company's website, and in more than 80 countries where youth culture thrives. Skullcandy retains its street cred by sponsoring boarders, surfers, and BMX bikers. Founded in 2003, Skullcandy went public in 2011; in 2016, consumer technology company Incipio agreed to acquire the company for $188.6 million.

  <p>
   The headphone maker, whose shares priced at $20 apiece, raised about $188 million in its July IPO. Strong demand for the deal led the shares to price above their expected range. Skullcandy used the proceeds to pay off a debt load of $45 million, provide working capital for general corporate purposes, and to acquire other businesses, products, or technologies. (In August it acquired the distribution rights to its products in Europe for about $18.6 million.)

   Skullcandy divides its products into audio entertainment and gaming categories. Audio entertainment, which is about 85% of sales, includes about 25 headphone models, Bluetooth speakers, sports performance models, and products targeted to women. Licensing for computers, apparel, and other accessories also fall under the audio entertainment umbrella. Gaming covers the Astro Gaming and Skullcandy Gaming brands of high-performance gaming headsets with price tags to match. Its flagship A50 wireless Dolby headset runs about $300.

   Besides the usual headphones, ear buds, and other audiophile gear, the company serves its youthful target market by working with other manufacturers to include Skullcandy-branded audio technology into helmets, hats, jackets, and bags. It also serves up the hip brand and skull logo through partnerships with rapper Jay-Z's Roc Nation entertainment company, the

   After several years of trending upward, sales fell 29% in 2013 to $210 million as North America's contribution plummeted 30% as the company reduced its reliance on lower priced channels in the US and online and converted to a direct distribution model in Canada. Net income also fell $29 million from $25.9 and became a net loss of $3 million. The main factors in the drop were the lower revenue along with higher expenses, including severance for a departing CEO, property disposals, and the closure of the company's marketing office in San Clemente, California. Cash from operations actually rose by $10 million to $23.5 million as accounts receivables and accounts payable fell.

   While the company generates some 90% of its sales from headphones and boasts 1,200 products, it's working to expand its product portfolio and extend its reach in the US and abroad. The audio equipment supplier has also been pumping out more premium products to cater to customers with higher discretionary incomes including gamers. Known to market headphones as a lifestyle product, much like

  </p>

   Another goal for the company is to get more of its products on retailers' shelves and in in-store displays. It's doing so by strengthening its relationships with existing clients, such as
   <company id="57958">
    Dick's Sporting Goods,
   </company>
   and increasing its visibility with new mass merchants and specialty shops, particularly those who sell electronics, sporting goods, and mobile phones. Skullcandy also is investing in the interactive platforms on its website to drive sales by providing customers with ways to customize their shopping experience and by launching international websites with local content. Online sales account for about 4% of the firm's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company opted to save money by consolidating its US operations at its Park City, Utah headquarters and close its California marketing office. Also that year, it granted Toshiba a license to use the Skullcandy name and trademark for laptops while Skullcandy helps boost the audio performance of the devices.
