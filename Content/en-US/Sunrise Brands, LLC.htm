   The company's licensing efforts, in recent years, have been hit and miss. An agreement with Jessica Simpson master license firm Camuto was a hit -- at first. The original licensing deal, inked in 2005, turned rocky in 2006. TAG began to produce pop-star Jessica Simpson-branded jeans and casualwear. It made JS by Jessica Simpson denim with
   <company id="12948">
    Charming Shoppes
   </company>
   and Princy by Jessica Simpson apparel for department stores. After having logged sales of more than $12 million in 2005 and nearly $9 million in 2006 under the brand names, TAG became involved in a dispute with Camuto. The deal soured in 2006, when TAG sued Camuto for $100 million, alleging that Simpson failed to promote her two apparel lines. Camuto later countersued TAG for $100 million. In late 2007, TAG entered into a settlement agreement with Camuto. As part of the settlement, both parties agreed to "dismiss with prejudice all claims relating to these actions or the sublicense agreement" and TAG walked away with a $3 million payment. (Camuto in 2010 signed a licensing deal with
   <company id="14954">
    Jones Apparel Group
   </company>
   to develop, design, produce, and distribute a jeanswear collection under the Jessica Simpson name.)
  </p>

   On the payment front, TAG in early 2008 was ordered to pay $14 million to the
   <company id="150643">
    Internal Revenue Service
   </company>
   for back taxes, interest, and penalties for the seven years ended 2002. As part of the agreement, the firm paid $4 million immediately and was asked to pay $250,000 a month until the balance is zero.
