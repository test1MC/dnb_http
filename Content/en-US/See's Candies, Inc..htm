   The company is extending the reach of its network of stores into existing and new markets. It has opened See's Candies stores in Ohio, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. New stores are also slated for Missouri, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee, with an eye on establishing new stores well outside its existing footprint in the likes of Florida and Washington, DC, by 2015.

   See's Candies' recipe for success has been not to mess with it. The more than 90-year-old business still features a picture of Mary See -- whose recipes are still used -- on every candy box and she's featured on the company's website.
