   Virgin Drinks wants to take some of the fizz out of soft-drink venerables

Selling some 1 million products globally each day, Virgin Drinks peddles its products in the UK, US, Canada, France, China, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Iraq, and other countries.

  <p>
   Although the company's plan to dethrone the reigning cola kings hasn't quite worked out, Virgin Drinks has not given up. The company has regrouped, focusing its soft drink business on markets where it has been more successful and adding product lines that include alcoholic drinks and soft drink alternatives such as fast-growing energy drinks. The company also has made inroads to China, where rivals
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi
   </company>
   are not yet synonymous with soft drinks.
