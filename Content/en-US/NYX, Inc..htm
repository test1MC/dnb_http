   NYX has been selling off units and offices in order to focus solely on its molding operations. In mid-2013 it sold off a facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which specialized in vacuum boost technologies and structural parts for the auto and heavy truck industries. Also during that time, NYX sold its Tennessee-based Bates LLC subsidiary to
