   SAIC General Motors (formerly Shanghai General Motors) is where East meets West in the automotive world. The company, a joint venture between leading Chinese car maker

    Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation Group
   </company>
   (SAIC; 51%) and
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   (GM; 49%), manufactures and markets vehicles, engines, and transmissions from four plants. It concentrates on making sedans, including models under the Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands. The company's operations are supported by a network of dealerships, repair facilities, and auto parts centers throughout the country. SAIC GM is one of the fastest-growing car companies in China.

   SAIC GM has Pudong Jinqiao, Yantai Dongyue, Shenyang and Wuhan branch Beisheng as its four production bases; seven vehicle production plants, and four powertrain plants. SAIC GM has the Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, more than 20 series product lineup (ranging from high-end luxury cars to economy cars), as well as MPV, SUV, hybrid and electric vehicles.

   Both GM and SAIC have pegged India as the next uncharted territory to conquer. GM announced in December 2009 it turned over 1% of Shanghai GM to SAIC, thus giving it majority ownership (51%) -- the 1% was valued at $85 million. In turn, SAIC invested as much as $350 in the India push; overall, the investment can top $650 million or more. The company is also looking at other Southeast Asian emerging markets where it could gain a geographic foothold.

   GM has shifted its global strategy to focus on China, but the fact that it relinquished its control of the JV denotes its need for money. SAIC benefits from holding a majority stake; it was able to report the venture's financial results as part of its own earnings. The deal heralded SAIC as the first Chinese automaker to crack the Indian auto market.

   SAIC GM was established in 1997.
