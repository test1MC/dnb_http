   Hyster-Yale Materials Handling isn't concerned about pleasing your palate, but it does want to move your pallets -- and containers. A leading lift truck manufacturer, the company designs, manufactures, and sells a variety of forklifts and other lift truck products through its
   <company id="111353">
    Hyster-Yale Group
   </company>
   (known as NACCO Materials Handling until Jan. 1, 2016) subsidiary. Its trucks are sold under the Hyster, Yale, and UTILEV brands and include everything from hand-controlled pallet lifts to heavy-duty container handlers. The company, which operates facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, was spun off from
   <company id="11031">
    NACCO Industries
   </company>
   in 2012 and restructured as an independently operated public company. Hyster and Yale branded products, originally made and sold in Japan, have been sold worldwide since the early 1970s.

  <p>
   Hyster-Yale Materials operates its business through three reportable segments: the Americas, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. The Americas comprises the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Latin America, and its corporate headquarters. The company's Europe segment consists of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The US does the heavy lifting for Hyster-Yale Materials, providing 61% of revenue (the rest of the Americas account for 7%). The Europe segment generates 24% of revenue with the Asian markets contributing 8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nuvera is a recently added segment (obtained by acquisition). It makes hydrogen fuels cells, which the company is using for forklifts.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in Ohio, Hyster-Yale Materials operates a dozen manufacturing and assembly facilities worldwide, as well as five plants in the Americas, three in Europe, and four in the Asia/Pacific region. It also enjoys a global reach through joint venture operations.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company spent about $11.7 million on advertising in 2015, a slight dip from the $12 million spent on advertising in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hyster-Yale Materials distributes its familiar yellow lift trucks and aftermarket parts primarily through two channels: independent dealers and a national accounts program. Its dealers, which are located in 129 countries, are generally independently-owned and -operated. The company operates a national accounts program for both Hyster and Yale that focuses on large customers with centralized purchasing and geographically dispersed operations in multi-dealer territories. The company's sales and marketing organizations align with its Americas, Europe, and Asia segments.
  </p>

  <p>
   Hyster-Yale reported $2.6 billion in sales in 2015, an 7% decreas from 2014. Customers are switching to the company's lower priced (Class 3) trucks and away from the higher priced trucks (Class 5). Customers not only paid less, but they bought less as sales volumes decreased in 2015. Foreign currency movements also had a negative effect on revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit was down in 2015 as well, falling 32% to $75 million in 2015. Besides the reduced sales, the company had higher selling, general, and administrative costs for the year. Cash generated by operating activities slowed to $89 million in 2015 from $110 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Looking ahead, Hyster-Yale Materials anticipates the overall global market for forklift trucks to grow moderately in 2015 versus 2014, driven primarily by increased volumes in the Americas, with smaller increases in the Asia-Pacific market and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hyster-Yale Materials is counting on Nuvera Inc., acquired in 2014, to lift the company on a cloud of hydrogen. Nuvera develops hydrogen fuel cell stacks and related systems. Hyster-Yale Materials intends to commercialize Nuvera's research and integrate it across a wide swath of its lift truck products. The end product should be an integrated, factory-fitted fuel-cell lift truck with on-site hydrogen generation and delivery capability. Intended not only for new lift trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials expects to retrofit electric-powered lift trucks on the job today with hydrogen fuel cell technology.

  <p>
   In 2016 Hyster-Yale Materials agreed to acquire Penta Holding S.p.A, an Italian holding company which holds 50.4% of
   <company id="183862">
    Bolzoni
   </company>
   S.p.A. Bolzoni, which makes attachments for forklifts, will operate as a subsidiary of Hyster-Yale Materials. The deal was to close in 2016 second quarter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2016 acquisition, Hyster-Yale Materials bought Speedshield Technology's telematics installation and distribution businesses in the US and UK. Hyster-Yale Materials gets exclusive distribution rights of products in all areas outside of Australia. The acquired Speedshield businesses are to be rebranded as HYG Telematic Solutions. Speedshield Technology provides telematics technology for material handling equipment, as well as other fleet vehicle applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hyster-Yale Materials made the Nuvera acquisition in late 2014. The price for privately held Nuvera was not disclosed, but Hyster-Yale Materials described the amount as modest. Hyster-Yale Materials expects to spend $40 million-$50 million a year for several years to further develop Nuvera's technology. Besides incorporating Nuvera technology into its products, Hyster-Yale Materials will try to parlay the technology into a foothold in the fuel cell  industry.
