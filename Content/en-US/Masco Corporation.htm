   Masco's ideal customer is a home improvement junkie with a thing for cabinets and plumbing fixtures. It is a leading manufacturer of a variety of home improvement and building products, with cabinet and plumbing products accounting for more than 60% of its sales. Cabinet brands include KraftMaid, Cardell, Quality Cabinets, and Merillat in the US and The Moores Group in Europe. Faucets and bath and shower accessories are sold under the Delta and Peerless brands in the US and as Hansgrohe in Europe. Masco also makes BEHR paints and stains, windows, doors, staple guns, locksets, and HVAC products. It spun off its installation services business as TopBuild in 2015.

  <p>
   The company operates in a handful of segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The businesses in its Plumbing Products segment (47% of Masco's 2015 revenues) sell a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for Masco. Products include single-handle and double-handle faucets, showerheads, handheld showers and valves, and toilets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also produces Decorative Architectural Products (28%), including paints, primers, specialty paint products, stains, and waterproofing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Cabinets and Related Products segment (14%) manufactures and sells cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office, and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points. In Europe, it also makes and sells assembled and ready-to-assemble kitchen, bath, storage, home office, and home entertainment cabinetry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other Specialty Products (11%) include vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows and patio doors, as well as the ESSENCE SERIES windows and doors, which combines a wood interior with a fiberglass exterior, under the MILGARD brand name for home improvements and new home construction, principally in the western US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company spun off its Installation and Other Services segment, which sold installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market, and, to a lesser extent, the retrofit and commercial construction markets, throughout the US. In addition to insulation, it also sold installed gutters, after-paint products, garage doors, and fireplaces.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />

  <p>
   Masco's products and services are offered through home builders, retail chains, and wholesale outlets. The company capitalizes on the popularity of DIY chains
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   , which offer a single source for its wide range of home improvement products ranging in style and price. Home Depot alone accounts for about a quarter of Masco's sales and is the company's largest customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are sold to primarily to dealers and homebuilders. Plumbing products are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware wholesalers, home center retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Masco's net revenues stood at $7.14 billion, a drop of 16% compared to 2014 due to the spin off of its Installation and Other Services businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was $355 million, down 59% due to lower net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, cash from operating activities was $699 million, up 16% compared to 2014 due to changes in inventories and higher deferred income taxes.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company had been contending with lower sales and profits for a number of years as a result of the slowdown in new home construction and tightened consumer spending for home improvement. To counteract the downturn, Masco implemented several cost-cutting measures. It has shuttered more than 20 cabinet and window plants and more than 100 installation locations. In all, the company has cut its workforce by nearly half since 2005. Masco is banking on the strength of its brand names and its ongoing slate of new product releases to lift its performance as the housing market recovers.
  </p>
  <p>
   By leveraging its brand strength, it is able to drive consumer demand and expand its market leadership positions. With well-known brands such as Delta, one of the strongest brands in North America's plumbing industry, it continues to extend into complementary plumbing categories, targeting multiple price points and distribution channels in this industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash an pursue a more focused growth strategy, in 2015, in a major reorganization, Masco spun off its Installation and Other Services businesses (18% of the company's 2014 revenues) as TopBuild.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2015 Masco acquired Endless Pools, which allowed the company to expand into the aquatic fitness category, open new channels of distribution, and access a new customer base.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Masco founder Alex Manoogian moved to the US at age 19 in 1920. He wound up in Detroit, and with partners Harry Adjemian and Charles Saunders, he started Masco (the first letters of their last names plus "co" for "company") Screw Products Company eight days before the crash of 1929. Manoogian's partners left within the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Largely reliant on Detroit's auto industry, Masco grew slowly during the Depression, making custom parts for Chrysler, Ford, and others. With sales of $200,000 by 1937, it went public on the Detroit Stock Exchange. During WWII Masco focused on defense, and in 1942 sales passed $1 million. A new plant opened in 1948 in Dearborn, Michigan, as Masco resumed peacetime business, mainly in the auto industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1954 Masco began selling Manoogian's one-handle kitchen faucet (Delta). Sales of faucets passed $1 million by 1958, and Masco opened a new faucet factory in Indiana.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Manoogian's son Richard -- whose dinner was often delayed while his father used the stove to test the heat tolerance of new faucet parts -- Masco Corporation (so renamed in 1961) diversified. From 1964 to 1980 it bought more than 50 companies, concentrating on tool and metal casting, energy exploration, and air compressors. In 1984 the firm split. Masco Corporation pursued the course set by its successful faucet sales, expanding its interests in home improvement and furnishings. The industrial products business was spun off as Masco Industries, a separate public corporation (later
   <company id="16920">
    Metaldyne
   </company>
   ) in which Masco maintained a sizable stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   Masco Corporation became the #1 US furniture maker in the late 1980s by buying Lexington Furniture (1987) and Universal Furniture (1989), both of North Carolina. In 1990 Masco acquired KraftMaid cabinets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later the company sold its interests in Mechanical Technology, Payless Cashways, and Emco Limited of Canada (Masco bought back 40% of Emco in 1997). Masco reduced its stake in Metaldyne from 47% to 35% in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Masco sought to establish itself in Europe, and in 1994 it bought a German cabinetmaker and a UK producer of handheld showers. In 1996 founder Manoogian died, but the company flowed on. It added a UK cabinetmaker, a German shower manufacturer, and a German insulation firm. That year Masco sold its troubled furniture unit to a group of investors and executives (who renamed the unit
   <company id="57514">
    LifeStyle Furnishings International
   </company>
   ) for about $1 billion and further reduced its stake in Metaldyne to less than 20% (and later sold it all).
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in 1997 included cabinetmakers Texwood Industries of Texas and Liberty Hardware Manufacturing of Florida. The next year it bought Vasco (heating systems and equipment, Belgium) and Brugman (building and home-improvement products, the Netherlands). It sold its Thermador unit (ovens and ranges) to US joint venture Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Masco made 13 acquisitions from 1999 through early 2000, including Heritage Bathrooms (bathroom equipment, UK), Faucet Queens (plumbing and hardware supply), GMU Group (kitchen cabinets, Spain), Avocet Hardware (locks and hardware, UK), BEHR Process (coatings), and Mill's Pride (cabinets). Boosting its services in 1999, it acquired The Cary Group, an installer of fiberglass insulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   To increase its geographic reach, Masco bought Tvilum-Scanbirk (ready-to-assemble furniture, Denmark), Masterchem Industries (specialty paint products), and Glass Idromassaggio (bathroom equipment, Italy), in 2000. In late 2000 and early 2001 it acquired two US-based installation services companies, Davenport Insulation Group and BSI Holdings, respectively. Also in 2001 Masco acquired Milgard Manufacturing, a vinyl window and patio door maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2002 Masco acquired home improvement products and service companies that included Bristan Ltd. (kitchen and bath faucets and shower and bath accessories), Brasstech, Inc. (faucets, plumbing specialties, and bath accessories; California), Cambrian Windows Ltd. (vinyl window frames), Duraflex Ltd. (extruded vinyl frame components), Premier Manufacturing Ltd. (vinyl window and door frames), SCE Unlimited (siding, shutters, gutters; Illinois), IDI Group (fireplaces, garage doors, shower enclosures; Atlanta), Service Partners LLC (insulation and other building products, Virginia), several small installation and other service companies, and Diversified Cabinet Distributors (cabinets and countertops, Atlanta). Masco also increased its interest in Hansgrohe AG (kitchen and bath faucets, hand-held and fixed showerheads, luxury shower systems, and steam showers; Germany) to 64%. The company sold its StarMark Cabinetry business for about $15 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Masco increased its ownership interest in Hansgrohe AG (kitchen and bath faucets, hand-held and fixed showerheads, luxury shower systems, and steam showers; Germany) to 64% from 27%. The company established Color Solutions Centers in more than 1,500
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   stores throughout the US. Masco sold its Baldwin Hardware and Weiser Lock businesses (builders' hardware and locksets) to Black &amp; Decker (now
   <company id="11397">
    Stanley Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   ) and The Marvel Group, a provider specialty products such as office work stations and machine stands, to members of Marvel's management team (led by president John Dellamore) for $289 million in total. Acquisitions in 2003 included PowerShot Tool Company, Inc. (fastening products, New Jersey) and several small installation service companies for a combined $63 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Masco sold its Jung Pumpen (pumps), The Alvic Group (kitchen cabinets), Alma Kuchen (kitchen cabinets), E. Missel (acoustic insulation), and SKS Group (shutters and ventilation systems) businesses for $199 million. Masco continued its business review in 2005, selling two operating companies that made and distributed cabinets, vanities, medicine cabinets, shower rods, and bath accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   After reorganizing its European business operations, Masco sold off several of its operating units, including Gebhardt Consolidated (HVAC), The Heating Group (radiators), and GMU Group (cabinets). The company also disposed of North American businesses that were not core to its long-term growth strategy, which included Computerized Security Systems (CSS) and Zenith Products (bathroom storage).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company merged its Mill's Price brand with KraftMaid to form the
   <company id="119060">
    Masco Retail Cabinet Group
   </company>
   . It also merged Merillat and Quality Cabinets to form
   <company id="111634">
    Masco Builder Cabinet Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to cutting costs through divestitures, Masco has streamlined its operating structure to trim spending. In 2011 the company merged its wholesale and retail cabinet units to form Masco Cabinetry. It also decided to stop making ready-to-assemble cabinets, a non-core offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking toward a growth market, in 2012, Masco entered into the fast-growing Indian bathroom and kitchen faucet sector by launching its line of residential and commercial products in that country. The company sees India as an integral part of the global expansion plan for the Delta Faucet Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2013, Behr Process Corporation completed the rollout of its products to Home Depot stores across Mexico, continued to build the foundation of its China business with dealers and expanded its retail relationships into Latin America. Hansgrohe, one of the leading global bathroom specialists, continued geographic expansion in its Decorative Architectural Products and Plumbing Products segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Masco Cabinetry launched Arbor Creek Cabinets, a stand-alone brand of ready-to-assemble cabinetry in four birch door styles and three finishes, offering customers choices ranging from a sleek, contemporary look to more traditional options.
