  <p>
   The firm later known as Summa Industries and Habasit America began in 1942 as Southern California Plastics Co., a manufacturer of plastic injection-molded products. In the 1960s it changed its name to Maxad. In 1974 Maxad bought (and renamed itself after) industrial machinery maker Morehouse Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Morehouse began to diversify in the 1990s when it bought GST Industries (1991), formed Morehouse-COWLES (1992; sold 1996), and acquired KVP Systems (1993). In 1993 the company again changed its name, this time to Summa (Latin for "highest"), and bought the assets of Armenco Engineering, which it absorbed into Morehouse-COWLES in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Summa moved from building machinery to making plastic industrial components during the 1990s. It bought LexaLite, a company nearly three times its own size, in 1996. The next year Summa bought plastics maker Calnetics, including its Manchester Plastics, Ny-Glass Plastics, and Agricultural Products subsidiaries. Acquisitions continued in 1998 as Summa picked up former competitor Falcon Belting and consolidated it with its KVP Systems unit to form KVP Falcon Plastic Belting. That year Summa sold GST Industries, makers of non-plastic firefighting and military equipment, for about $2.7 million. Though GST was profitable, Summa believed the unit's growth prospects were unattractive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Summa bought Plastron Industries and Broadview Injection Molding, both privately held makers of thermoplastic parts used in wound electronic components such as relays and coils. The next year it added Yarbrough-Timco (molded plastic coils), Plastic Specialties (thermoplastic lenses), and the Ram Belts &amp; Chains unit of Rainbow Industrial Products Corp. With its stock price languishing, in August 2001 Summa announced that it would seek potential buyers for the company. It retracted the announcement only one month later, citing uncertain business conditions. Summa acquired Pavaco Plastics' Genesta Manufacturing division in 2002; Genesta made extruded profiles and thermoformed components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company sold its Plastron Industries (plastic winding cores found in small electric motors and transformers) segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Habasit Holding AG bought Summa Industries for some $60 million; the company was renamed Habasit America. Habasit Holding, a privately held Swiss firm, also assumed around $21 million in Summa's debt.
