   You don't have to twirl a red cape in front of this bull to get a charge out of it. Red Bull markets its eponymous energy drink around the globe. The nonalcoholic drink contains the amino acid taurine, B-complex vitamins, caffeine, and carbohydrates. Red Bull claims that the human body needs more taurine than it produces naturally during physical exertion&#160;-- thus the need for partaking of its beverage. Sales of the drink grew&#160;quickly from&#160;the beginning&#160;and Red Bull now dominates the world's energy-drink market with a 40% market share; 5 billion cans were sold in 2012. Red Bull was founded in 1984 by sports enthusiast Dietrich Mateschitz who reportedly drinks up to 10 cans of it a day.

        <p>
   Red Bull's unique way of advertising involves sponsoring extreme sports that have been&#160;sponsored by other energy drink brands. Another marketing trend within the industry&#160;is the use of free product distribution. Red Bull gives free samples of its drinks to the public. However, competitors Monster Energy and Rockstar have also followed suit, leveraging "street teams" that take the product to the public.

   Sales of energy drinks have grown at double-digit rates in recent years, outpacing cola, the traditional king of the beverage market. As a result, the field has become more crowded and market leaders Red Bull and

   are feeling the heat. Trailing&#160;these two tops brands&#160;is the Rockstar energy drink, made by

   ' Frucor&#160;Beverages unit. Rockstar and sister brand "V" are sold in about 20 countries worldwide. Red Bull states that it has captured 70% of the market share for energy drinks.

        <p>
   The&#160;red-hot segment&#160;of the energy drink&#160;market&#160;currently is "energy shots,"&#160;which is growing at a rate of about 35% annually, compared with 10% for energy drinks like Red Bull and Monster. Shots, including 5-hour Energy and a long list of imitators,&#160;make up about 14% of the energy drink market.&#160;Acknowledging this, Red Bull has introduced Red Bull Energy Shots. The product was initially sold only in the US and is being rolled out globally.

   Red Bull, which makes several variations of its energy drink -- including Red Bull Simply Cola (launched in 2008)&#160;&#160;-- claims that about&#160;5.2 billion cans of Red Bull&#160;are consumed annually worldwide. The company is targeting the markets of Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea, and the US for future growth.

   Its 2012 revenues were the best in the company's history, increasing by 16% due to higher prices and fluctuations in currency. Red Bull was helped by growing sales in South Africa (up by 52%), Japan (51%), Saudi Arabia (38%), France (21%), Germany (14%), and the US (17%). The company also attributed the increases to its cost-management efforts.

   A former employee of
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   , Dietrich Mateschitz often traveled to Asia as part of his job. While there, he was introduced to syrups that Asian business executives added to their drinks for energy. The drinks revitalized Mateschitz, and -- excited by the business opportunity -- he worked with Bangkok-based TC Pharmaceuticals to create his own non-carbonated energy soft drink called Red Bull Krateng Dang, which&#160;was sold only in Asia. To please the European palette, Mateschitz refined the recipe to make it less syrupy and more fizzy, and in 1987 he founded his company and launched Red Bull in Austria. The can, featuring two bulls, was and still is adorned with the Buddhist-inspired colors red and gold.

   By 1993 Red Bull was selling more than 35 million cans a year. The drink was introduced in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK in 1994 and reached the Eastern European countries in 1995. Expansion abroad continued, including in Australia and Brazil. In 1997 Red Bull was rolled out in the US by subsidiary, Red Bull North America. It tackled Asia next, starting with Japan and is making inroads in China. Red Bull has operations worldwide. And although the company originated in Austria, the recipe for Red Bull is said to come from Thailand.

   In 2006 the company paid more than $100 million for the US

   team, the MetroStars, and renamed it Red Bull New York. The company&#160;built a new stadium called Red Bull Arena for its new team.

   Despite the fact that cola sales have been shrinking, Red Bull decided to take on the Cola Cartel, the sector-dominating duo

   and

   In&#160;2009 Red Bull extended its portfolio with the introduction of Red Bull Energy Shots.
