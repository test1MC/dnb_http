   It's not refined Greek thought, but refined Greek oil that makes Hellenic Petroleum the leading oil refining company in Greece and neighboring Macedonia. Greece's largest company, Hellenic Petroleum operates four refineries: at Aspropyrgos, Elefsina, and Thessaloniki in Greece, and Skopje in Macedonia. In Greece, EKO's network of gas stations amounts to 900; it has 287 stations in Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia. Its other businesses include petrochemical production, oil and gas exploration, and infrastructure development. Hellenic Petroleum is owned by Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings S.A. (42.6%) and the Greek government (35.5%).

  <p>
   The company's segments are refining, marketing, exploration and production, petrochemicals, gas &amp; power, and others.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Aspropyrgos, Elefsina and Thessaloniki refineries processed a total of 13.6 million tons of crude oil and other raw materials (intermediates) with a combined production of 12.5 million tons. Refining accounted for 71% of Hellenic Petroleum's revenues in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is active in the marketing and distribution of petroleum products, both in Greece through its subsidiaries ΕΚΟ S.A. and HELLENIC FUELS LTD, as well as internationally through its subsidiaries in Cyprus, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Marketing accounted for 26% of Hellenic Petroleum's 2014 revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company owns and operates the only vertically integrated petrochemicals complex in Greece that produces polypropylene, with a significant export orientation. One of Greece's leading producers of petrochemicals and chemicals (including PVC, solvents, naphtha, and hexane), Hellenic Petroleum has recently completed a polypropylene plant in Thessaloniki and a propylene splitter in Aspropyrgos. This segment contributed 3% of total revenues in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hellenic Petroleum's oil and gas exploration and production take place in Greece, Egypt. and Montenegro.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the energy segment the company operates two combined cycle natural gas plants with a total capacity of 810 MW, through ELPEDISON, a joint venture with
   <company id="52278">
    Edison
   </company>
   . It is also active in renewables, with a portfolio exceeding 200 MW.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also active in the natural gas sector through its 35% participation in DEPA SA, while the remaining 65% is owned by the Greek State.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2014, net revenue decreased by 2% (in local currency).
  </p>
  <p>
   In refining, results were driven by improved refining operations, following the de-bottle necking works at Elefsina aswell as by the favorable international refining environment during the second half of the year. Further support came from continuous cost control efforts and growth in exports, accounting for 50% of total sales. In 2014, the group's total sales from its domestic refineries increased by 7% amounting to 13.5 million tons, mainly due to a 19% increase in exports
  </p>
  <p>
   The results of the first half of 2014 were affected by low refining margins, as well as the temporary shut-down of the Elefsina refinery for required maintenance. It operated at high utilization rates, with all units exceeding design specifications and middle distillates yield at 73%, while all refineries recorded strong performance. These were reinforced by improved refining margins. Moreover, the domestic fuel market rebounded for the first time since the beginning of the financial crisis, with auto fuels consumption increasing in the second half.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 net loss increased by 36% due to the sharp decline of crude oil prices, impacting year-end inventory valuation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flows were up 73% thanks to increased profitability, combined with normalized capex levels, which led to reduced leverage. In terms of funding, despite the continued challenges, Hellenic Petroleum's position improved following the Eurobond issues and the renegotiation of existing credit facilities.

  <p>
   The Group's main strategic objectives are extroversion, innovation, and operational optimization, On this note, Hellenic Petroleum has successfully completed the launch of two innovative differentiated products, the new ΕΚΟ Diesel Avio and ΒΡ Ultimate Diesel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hellenic Petroleum is deepening the vertical integration of its businesses while expanding its presence within Greece and the Balkans.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Exploration and Production, the Group is focusing on activities in Greece. In 2014 its international joint venture commenced exploration activities in the West Patraikos Gulf offshore area.

  <p>
   Following discovery of the South Kavala gas field and Prinos oil field in the North Aegean Sea, the Greek government formed its own exploration company, Public Petroleum Corp. (DEP), in 1975. The company subsequently acquired control of the Hellenic Aspropyrgos Refinery (ELDA), a major refinery near Athens.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s the state bought the Greek assets of Esso (now ExxonMobil), including a refinery and chemicals and marketing units. This Esso business (renamed EKO) set up two new oil-related enterprises: DEP-EKY (exploration and production) and DEPA (natural gas import and distribution). DEP retained control over crude imports, refining, and product trading. The company also set up engineering unit Asprofos, originally as a joint venture with Foster Wheeler Italiana, to upgrade and expand the Aspropyrgos Refinery. (Foster Wheeler sold its stake in 1988.) The refinery branched into petroleum marketing with the formation of another unit, ELDA-E.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1991 and 1997 EKO expanded, establishing marketing activities in Georgia and acquiring Greek liquefied petroleum gas firm Petrolina. DEP and ELDA formed a petrochemical venture, and DEP-EKY joined a consortium to explore for oil and gas in western Greece.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the Greek government restructured the oil and gas industry. DEP became Hellenic Petroleum Company, and other oil- and gas-related enterprises were merged into it. As part of the restructuring, EKO and ELDA merged their marketing segments to form EKO-ELDA, which acquired marketing unit G.MAMIDAKIS later that year. Although 85% of the natural gas company, DEPA, was transferred back to the government, Hellenic Petroleum retained the option to buy back shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hellenic Petroleum was partially privatized in 1999, and the government kept a 75% stake (later reduced to 35%). Expanding in the Balkans, the company acquired control of the oil refinery in Skopje, Macedonia, that year, and bought 75% (later boosted to 86%) of Global, a petroleum marketing company in Albania. It also upped its stake in DEPA to 35% and began construction of polypropylene and propylene units.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Hellenic Petroleum completed a crude oil pipeline linking its Macedonian refinery to its refinery at the Greek port of Thessaloniki. In 2003 it absorbed the operations of refining rival

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired Opet Aygaz Bulgaria, which operates a network of 17 gas stations in Bulgaria. Building its assets at home, in 2009 Hellenic Petroleum acquired

   's network of 1,200 gas stations in Greece for about €360 million ($515 million US). Formerly called BP Hellas, the company has been rebranded Hellenic Fuels, though the service stations will retain the BP brand for at least five years.
