   Headwaters is a modern-day alchemist, turning stone and coal into money. Through subsidiaries, it provides building materials such as coal combustion products (CCP) and synthetic gypsum and reclaims waste coal in North America. Headwaters' light building products segment -- its largest -- makes stone products and siding accessories under the Eldorado Stone brand. The heavy construction materials segment sells residuals from the coal combustion process (such as fly ash), which can be used as a substitute for Portland cement in building materials. Headwaters' energy technology segment licenses coal conversion and heavy oil upgrading technology. In late 2016, Headwaters agreed to be purchased by Australia-based

   .

   Headwaters in late 2016 agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="54853">
    Boral Limited
   </company>
   , an Australia-based maker of building and construction materials, for $1.8 billion. The deal will double Boral's US presence and create the largest US supplier of fly ash.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company conducts its operations through three reporting segments. Building products has expertise in the designing, manufacturing and marketing of architectural stone under the Eldorado Stone brand and siding accessories used in residential repair and remodeling and new residential construction applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Construction materials is involved in the marketing of fly ash and synthetic gypsum. It procures fly ash from coal-fueled electric generating utilities and supplies it to customers as a partial replacement for portland cement in the production of concrete. The energy technology segment specializes in heavy oil upgrading processes through the sale of HCAT catalyst material.

  <p>
   Headwaters' building products segment markets its products to the new construction, home improvement, commercial, and institutional markets. It sells its products throughout North America, Europe and Asia primarily on a wholesale basis through a network of distributors, including masonry and stone suppliers, roofing and siding materials distributors, fireplace suppliers, and other contractor specialty stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also distributes some brands through national retail home centers. It has more than 1,000 US wholesale distributors and generates incremental sales through big box stores.

  <p>
   Headwaters' revenues peaked at $975 million in 2016, its highest total in about eight years. Profits, however, plunged 63% to $48 million in 2016 mainly due to the absence of income tax benefits it received the previous year. The company's operating cash flow increased to $120 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue growth in 2016 was due to higher sales across all its major product groups as a result of demand-driven volume increases and acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016. Led by its trim product, the company's siding products contributed significantly to overall segment revenue growth and margin expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand was also strong in its non-residential Texas markets in 2016, offsetting any impact from low oil prices on residential construction. Operational improvement efforts within its stone and block categories also contributed to margin improvement. In addition, several of its product groups continued to benefit from lower raw material, transportation and energy costs, which more than offset increased costs in other areas.

  <p>
   With the housing market projected to explode over the next few years, Headwaters plans to increase the number of products it sells to core customers through internal development and bolt-on acquisitions. It is also focusing its sales and marketing spending to core customers and additionally plans to standardize non-customer interfacing infrastructure.

  <p>
   Headwaters' blueprint for growth involves the use of acquisitions. In 2016 it purchased Krestmark Industries, which manufactures and sells vinyl windows for new residential construction in the south central region of the US, for $240 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, the company gobbled up Kentucky-based Synthetic Materials, an expert in the synthetic gypsum processing and management industry, $38 million. The deal complemented Headwaters' coal combustion product management operations.
