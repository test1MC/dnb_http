   Omega Protein is the alpha dog of the fish-meal market. With a handful of US processing plants, a fleet of some 40 fishing vessels, and 30-plus spotter aircraft, the company is the largest US producer of fish meal and fish oil, derived from menhaden (an inedible fish found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast). Animal-feed makers and livestock ranchers use Omega Protein's fish meal for protein additives in feed; the fish oil is used in Europe in margarine and for industrial ends. Rich in Omega-3 fatty acids (linked to health benefits), fish oil is also used as a human food supplement. Through subsidiaries, Omega Protein provides nutraceutical ingredients and compounds, including Omega-3 fish oils.

  <p>
   Omega Protein's operations consist of four primary subsidiaries: Omega Protein processes and harvests menhaden fish; Omega Shipyards owns and manages the drydock facility for the company's fishing fleet and, occasionally, third parties; Cyvex Nutrition, supplies ingredients to the nutraceutical market; and InCon Processing is a specialty toll processor that uses molecular distillation technology to create Omega-3 fish oils.
  </p>
  <p>
   Omega Protein's fish oil brands include Virginia Prime, OmegaPure, and OmegaActiv; fish meal brands include Special Select and SeaLac. The company also makes fertilizer (OmegaGrow) and a fungicide/insecticide (SeaCide). Many customers are feed producers, who use Omega Protein's products to manufacture feed for swine and dairy cattle, as well as for domestic pets. An increasing percentage of the company's products is being used by the aquaculture industry, as the practice of aquaculture increases worldwide.

  <p>
   The US is the Houston-based company's largest market, accounting for 50% of its sales. Asia contributes nearly 30%, while Europe represents more than 10%. Other markets include Canada, South and Central America, and Mexico.

   Omega Protein's largest customer in 2013 was
   <company id="104717">
    Nestl√© Purina PetCare
   </company>
   , which contributed approximately $22.7 million (or 9% of sales) to the company's coffers. The company's products are sold directly to some 200 domestic and foreign customers, most of which are located in Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. Independent sales agents generate a small amount of sales.

  <p>
   Omega Protein has been reporting rising revenues since 2010. In 2014 it grew another 26% to hit $308.6 million due to contributions from acquisitions and higher prices for some items. Net income has fluctuated over the years and fell 40% in 2014 to $18.5 million because of higher impairment of goodwill.

  <p>
   Omega Protein's strategy going forward includes growth through acquisitions, most recently of human nutrition businesses. In September 2014, the company acquired Bioriginal Food &amp; Science Corp. to expand and diversify its human nutrition business. Canada-based Bioriginal Food &amp; Science supplies plant- and marine-based specialty oils and essential fatty acids to the food and nutraceutical industries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Bioriginal Food &amp; Science, which had about $98 million in net revenues, operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Omega Protein. It paid $70.5 million for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2013 the company purchased Wisconsin Specialty Protein (WSP), based in Madison, to build on its human nutrition business with WSP's specialty whey protein products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also acting to expand and trim select operations. In 2014 it streamlined operations in the Gulf of Mexico by closing its menhaden fish processing plant in Cameron, Louisiana and redeploying certain ships from that plant to reduce maintenance-related capital expenditures. Also in mid-2014 the company completed an expansion, roughly doubling capacity, at its specialty dairy protein production facility in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2013 Omega Protein resolved investigations by the

   </company>
   and the
   <company id="130205">

   by entering into a plea agreement with the US Attorney's Office. The company pleaded guilty to two Clean Water Act violations and paid a $5.5 million fine.

  <p>
   Omega Protein's predecessor dates back to a fish processing operation founded in Reedville, Virginia, by John and Thomas Haynie in 1878. (The site currently is home to the company's largest plant.) Almost a century later, Zapata, an oil and gas firm co-founded by George H. W. Bush, acquired Haynie Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The division became known as Zapata Haynie. The company spent the late 1980s and 1990s fighting for FDA approval of refined menhaden oil for human consumption (the oil contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids touted as having health benefits); approval was finally granted in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Financier Malcolm Glazer first acquired a stake in Zapata in 1992. That year Zapata acquired 60% of Venture Milling, a Delaware-based blender of animal protein products. Two years later the division was renamed Zapata Protein, to reflect its expansion into animal feed. Zapata sold most of the assets of Venture Milling in 1997 and acquired two of its four US rivals: Chesapeake Bay area-based American Protein and Louisiana-based Gulf Protein. Also that year it renamed the division Marine Genetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Zapata changed Marine Genetics' name to Omega Protein and spun off about 40% in that division to the public. Despite an active hurricane season that crimped the fishing season, Omega Protein reported record profits in 1998. However, dramatic price drops for fish meal and fish oil (caused by a global glut in those markets) squeezed the life out of sales and profits in 1999. Omega Protein responded by mothballing part of its fleet for the 2000 fishing season.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Omega received two separate unsolicited takeover offers -- the first at $45 per share by merger and acquisition firm Hollingsworth, Rothwell &amp; Roxford; the second at $9.50 per share from Australia-based Ferrari Investments and unidentified US partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Omega completed a processing facility in 2004 in Reedsville, Virginia, that tripled its existing refined fish-oil production capacity. The factory also expanded capacity for oils used in leather, drilling fluid, and animal food.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company shut down its sales office in Mexico in 2005 and consolidated its functions with those at its Houston headquarters. The company's Moss Point processing facility and its shipyard in Mississippi were severely damaged due to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Its Cameron and Abbeville plants in Louisiana were shut down that September due to damage sustained from Hurricane Rita. Moss Point and Abbeville were reopened in mid-October. The Cameron facility was rebuilt and back in operation by 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Omega Protein was 33% owned by investor and then Omega chairman Avram Glazer's family, which maintained its shares through
   <company id="11658">
    Zapata Corporation
   </company>
   . However, Zapata sold its holdings in Omega in 2006, at which time Glazer stepped down as chairman and president and CEO Joseph von Rosenberg replaced Glazer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company opened a technical center in Houston (The OmegaPure Technology and Innovation Center) to research and develop new Omega-3 products.
