   While most Yankees are good at warming their homes, the ones at The Yankee Candle Company (YCC) are also good at making their homes smell like Egyptian Cotton or Home Sweet Home. YCC makes and sells candles -- known for their burning longevity and strong fragrances -- in some 150 fragrances. It also sells candleholders, accessories, and dinnerware. Its products are sold by some 29,00 gift shops nationwide, as well as internationally in about 50 countries. The company operates more than 500 stores in the US and Canada, mostly in malls, and sells online and through catalogs. With roots going back to 1969, YCC is owned by consumer brands giant

  <p>
   YCC was banking on growing as part of former parent Madison Dearborn, but the downturn in the US economy and dismal climate for retailers led to a restructuring -- and a continued cautious outlook. As part of the plan, the company discontinued its Aroma Naturals line of soy-based candles, closed its
   <company id="118657">
    Illuminations
   </company>
   retail chain, and halted its consumer direct business. It then shifted its focus to Yankee Candle shops, opening its 500th location in Saugus, Massachusetts. While the moves -- combined with increasing sales -- have helped its bottom line, the company maintains a cautious outlook going forward. It plans to continue growing its store base in Massachusetts and other high-performing regions across the country, as well as work to keep costs under control.
  </p>
  <p>
   One area where the YCC business is boldly moving forward is its expansion northward. The candle maker opened its first company-owned stores in Canada in late 2011 with five locations in the Toronto area. While YCC has plans to open stores in other countries around the world, it has yet to specify which ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   YCC's target audience is women ranging in age from their early 20s into their 60s. Attempting to lure individuals outside of its core customer base, the company has introduced new products, such as electric devices that can be plugged into the wall and continuously dispense fragrance and "Car Jars" hanging tags (to scent the car).

  <p>
   In 1969 Michael Kittredge, 16 years old and strapped for cash, needed a Christmas present for his mother. He made a candle by melting crayons, using a milk carton for the mold and taking a wick from a dining room candle. A visiting neighbor admired his creation and bought it for $1.36. (He made another one for Mom.) Kittredge then began selling candles to other neighbors and friends, and later to gift shops.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kittredge moved his one-man business from his parents' garage into a former paper mill in 1973. By 1983 Yankee Candle had more than 30 employees and had outgrown the old mill. The company opened its South Deerfield, Massachusetts, location that year with a 1,600-sq.-ft. store; it opened a 15,000-sq.-ft. factory there in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1987 Yankee Candle employed 150 workers, had a 40,000-sq.-ft. factory, and was distributing its products in Canada. The company opened what it dubbed the "world's largest Christmas shop" in 1993 at its South Deerfield location.
  </p>
  <p>
   Production was moved from South Deerfield to a 285,000-sq.-ft. facility in Whately, Massachusetts, in 1994. The following year Yankee Candle opened 20 stores along the East Coast, added a candlelit restaurant to its flagship store, and opened a car museum to placate candle non-enthusiasts accompanying visitors to the store. Also in 1996 Kittredge handed the company's day-to-day operations to new president Michael Parry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parry was promoted to CEO in 1998. That year New York investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co. bought 90% of Yankee Candle for a reported $400 million, funding the company's expanded production, upgraded warehouse systems, and new European distribution arm. Costs associated with the company's recapitalization led to a loss in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yankee Candle went public in July 1999 and used the proceeds to help open about 40 more stores that year. In February 2001 the company said it was laying off about 14% of its workforce and closing a distribution center due to dampened holiday sales. In April Parry retired, and Craig Rydin, an executive from
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell Soup
   </company>
   , joined the company as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2003 Kittredge resigned his position as chairman, and Yankee Candle's board appointed Rydin chairman of the board. Kittredge remains as chairman emeritus. In June 2004 Yankee Candle acquired GBI Marketing, Inc., a distributor of selected gift products (including Yankee Candle products) to fundraising organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yankee Candle in July 2006 bought Candle Acquisition Co.'s Illuminations brand for about $22 million and folded it into its operations. As part of the deal, Yankee Candle picked up 15 Illuminations retail shops (located in California, Arizona, and Washington), as well as its consumer direct business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm, acquired Yankee Candle in February 2007 for $1.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid weakened consumer spending and the US recession, the company halted operations of its Illuminations subsidiary in April 2009. As part of Yankee Candle's restructuring plan, about 30 shops were shuttered, and its consumer direct business was discontinued.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former chairman and CEO Craig Rydin handed over the title of CEO to Harlan Kent, the company's president and COO, in October 2009. Rydin serves as executive chairman through October 1, 2010, and as a non-executive chairman thereafter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2013, Yankee Candle was sold to
   <company id="16009">

   for $1.8 billion.
