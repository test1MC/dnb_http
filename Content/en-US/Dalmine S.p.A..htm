   Whether you're told to pipe up or pipe down, Dalmine (marketed as TenarisDalmine) can handle the order. The company produces drawn carbon steel pipes, steel bars, fiberglass pipes, welded and seamless stainless steel pipes, and gas cylinders from seamless tubes. Customers include automobile makers, gas and water companies, bearing makers, industrial and medical gas companies, and power producers. Seamless pipe, the company's principal product, is made at an annual rate of some 800,000 tons. It also produces 900,000 tons of steel bars. Luxembourg-based holding company
   <company id="107143">
    Tenaris
   </company>
   owns most of Dalmine, which represents the Italian tubular production for the Tenaris Group.

  <p>
   Dalmine's roots reach as far back as 1885 to brothers Max and Reinhard Mannesmann. The Mannesmanns created a process to make seamless steel tubes while working at their father's factory in Remscheid, Germany. In a short period of time the brothers had factories in France, Germany, the UK, and in Dalmine, Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Germany's involvement in WWI led the Mannesmanns to sell the Italian factory to Italy's Banca Commerciale in 1915. In 1920 the company's name was changed to Stabilimenti di Dalmine. It fell under the control of the state-owned steel company, Finsider, in 1937.
  </p>
  <p>
   An Allied air raid in 1944 left nearly 1,000 casualties in its wake and halted the plant's operations. The early postwar years saw changes that included a new name -- Dalmine S.p.A. -- and the start of a restoration project. During the next several years Dalmine expanded through acquisitions that included Mass Carrara (pipes used for oil exploration, 1948), Sabbio Native (gas cylinders, 1956), and Costa Volpino (steel pipes, 1957).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dalmine began using the mandrel rolling mill in 1978 to increase seamless pipe production. A steel crisis in Europe led to the fall of Finsider in 1988 and the assumption of Dalmine's operations by another state-owned steel conglomerate, Ilva.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dalmine was privatized in 1996 before becoming a part of the Techint Group, along with
   <company id="95419">
    Tubos de Acero de México
   </company>
   (TAMSA) and
   <company id="95239">
    Siderca
   </company>
   . Dalmine was named in a lawsuit by UK-based BHP Petroleum in 1998 for faulty pipe used in a 1994 underwater gas pipeline project. In 1999 the European Commission found Dalmine and seven other seamless pipe makers guilty of violating antitrust regulations. The next year Dalmine formed natural gas and electricity company Dalmine Energie and Internet information service systems company i-Dalmine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Techint changed the name of its association of seamless and welded tube makers from DST to
   <company id="107143">
    Tenaris
   </company>
   in 2001. In 2002 Tenaris began a process by which it acquired almost all of Dalmine, Siderca, and TAMSA.
