   You might say this mapmaker lets you know where you stand.  Commercial mapmaker Rand McNally is famous for its top-selling flagship product, the
   <em>
    Rand McNally Road Atlas
   </em>
   . In addition, the company publishes map books and educational products for classrooms, as well as travel-related software and online map and travel content. It also makes GPS devices and routing navigation software for the commercial transportation industry (IntelliRoute), as well as fleet management software (TruckPC).  The company traces its roots to 1856 when William Rand opened a small printing shop in Chicago; he and Andrew McNally founded Rand McNally &amp; Company in 1868. Today Rand McNally is owned by private equity firm
   <company id="161125">
    Patriarch Partners
   </company>
   .

   Its popular road atlas and other printed products continue to form the core of Rand McNally's business, but the company is focused on remaking itself for the digital age. To compete with Google Maps (from search giant
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   ) and other online services, Rand McNally has expanded its offerings to include trip and travel services, traffic reports, and a travel blog.

   Rand McNally was founded by William Rand and Andrew McNally in 1868 when they bought the job-printing department of the
   <i>
    Chicago Tribune.
   </i>
   Originally focused on printing railroad tickets and schedules, the partners published their first book, a Chicago business directory, in 1870.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1872 the company printed its first map for the
   <i>
    Railway Guide.
   </i>
   Rand McNally later expanded into publishing paperback novels (popular among train travelers), and by 1891 annual sales topped $1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1890s McNally bought Rand's share of the business, and the company branched into printing school textbooks. Rand McNally's first photo auto guide was issued in 1907, and the company introduced its first complete US road atlas in 1924.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Rand McNally's New York stock of European maps sold out in one day. WWII necessitated the revision of a number of maps -- a challenge that the company continued to face throughout the 20th century.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the company abandoned adult fiction and nonfiction in 1914, it re-entered the field in 1948 when a company official persuaded explorer Thor Heyerdahl to write a book for the company about his adventures. First published in 1950, Heyerdahl's
   <i>
    Kon-Tiki
   </i>
   sold more than a million copies in its first six years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rand McNally produced its first four-color road atlas in 1960, and during the 1970s it began publishing travel guides for Mobil Oil. The next decade the company published several new road atlases to fill the void created when gas stations discontinued their practice of giving away free road maps. Rand McNally sold its textbook publishing business to Houghton Mifflin in 1980, and five years later it began computerizing its cartography operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 the company acquired Allmaps Canada Limited (now Rand McNally Canada). It introduced
   <i>
    TripMaker,
   </i>
   a CD-ROM vacation-planning program, the next year. Also in 1994 Rand McNally won a contract to create maps for a
   <i>
    Reader's Digest
   </i>
   atlas. The company debuted its StreetFinder street-level software in 1995 and created its Cartographic and Information Services division in 1996. It also established a website that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year, as part of a plan to focus on mapmaking and providing geographic information, Rand McNally sold a number of its subsidiaries (Book Services Group, DocuSystems Group). AEA Investors bought a controlling interest in the company later in 1997, bringing an end to more than 140 years of McNally family control (though it did retain a minority stake). While Rand McNally was still profitable, the sale to AEA underscored the challenges facing the company: Growth in earnings had slowed, and technological changes (Internet maps and software) had altered the mapmaking industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rand McNally expanded in 1999 with acquisitions of mapmakers Thomas Bros. Maps and King of the Road Map Service. Later that year Henry Feinberg resigned as chairman and CEO. Richard Davis was appointed CEO and John Macomber became chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company relaunched its website in 2000 with additional trip planning capabilities. That year it also became the primary North American distributor of
   <i>
    National Geographic
   </i>
   maps, and COO Norman Wells replaced Davis as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Michael Hehir was named CEO, Wells replaced Macomber as chairman, and Macomber remained as a director on the board. In 2003 Rand McNally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company exited bankruptcy within two months, with buyout firm
   <company id="55199">
    Leonard Green &amp; Partners
   </company>
   as its new majority owner. Also that year Hehir left the company, and Allstate executive Robert Apatoff was named CEO. Wells was replaced by Peter Nolan, a managing partner at Leonard Green &amp; Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product development efforts languished as Rand McNally focused on fixing its balance sheet. Late in 2007 private equity firm
   <company id="161125">
    Patriarch Partners
   </company>
   purchased the company. Former video game executive Dave Muscatel later took over as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company acquired Tripology, an online lead generation service that matches consumers with trip planners.
