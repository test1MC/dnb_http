   For electronic test and measurement equipment, hit the Rohde &amp; Schwarz (R&amp;S), Jack. The company is a leading manufacturer of diagnostic equipment used primarily for mobile radio and digital and analog television broadcasting applications. Its products include radio-frequency test equipment, radio location and communication systems, and signal test gear. In addition to test equipment, the company makes radio and TV transmitters, two-way radio systems, and communications systems for security and military organizations. It markets its products worldwide through subsidiaries and representatives in more than 70 countries. Lothar Rohde and Hermann Schwarz founded the company in 1933; their families continue to control it.

  <p>
   Lothar Rohde and Hermann Schwarz met while studying physics at Jena University in Germany; they built their first measuring instrument (a frequency meter) in 1932. The next year the pair opened a laboratory called Physikalisch-technisches Entwicklungslabor Dr. Rohde &amp; Dr. Schwarz (PTE). The first electronics company in Munich, PTE focused on developing radio-frequency (RF) technology. It also offered consulting services and contributed technical articles to gain industry recognition. PTE filled its first order outside of Germany in 1934 when a UK-based ceramics company requested a dissipation factor meter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orders for measurement tools from communications companies took off in the late 1930s and PTE quadrupled its product line by 1938; additions included quartz time measuring instruments and power supplies. In 1939 the company changed its name to Rohde &amp; Schwarz and opened an office in Berlin. That year WWII began and the company relocated its production and development facilities to escape Allied air raids. Rohde &amp; Schwarz was dormant until the end of the war in 1945, when it reopened and was hired by the

    US Air Force
   </company>
   to repair radio equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rohde &amp; Schwarz branched out into communications devices, including radio and TV transmission and receiving equipment and portable shortwave hardware, as the 1940s came to a close. In 1949 the first VHF FM broadcast transmitter in Europe, built by Rohde &amp; Schwarz, went on the air in Germany. The company prospered in the 1950s as global demand grew; it established a presence in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK during that decade and the next. In time Rohde &amp; Schwarz's sales network grew to include Africa, North America, Asia, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became Rohde &amp; Schwarz GmbH &amp; Co. KG in 1966 and took on Friedrich Schwarz (Hermann's son) as a third partner. Rohde &amp; Schwarz embraced digital technology in 1967 when it introduced a test system for integrated circuits. At that point the company began capitalizing on its broad technical expertise by offering systems integration services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rohde &amp; Schwarz in 1975 introduced the first system for monitoring TV signal quality. In the 1980s the company moved into Canada with the intention of serving the US defense market, but cutbacks hampered this initiative. In 1981 Rohde &amp; Schwarz began selling

   test and measurement instruments in Germany; it later expanded the distribution relationship to all of Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of South America. Lothar Rohde died in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 the company developed a mobile-radio system simulator for testing emerging digital transmission technology such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications). Rohde &amp; Schwarz gained ground in the US in 1993 when it forged a sales and support alliance with instrument manufacturer

    Tektronix
   </company>
   . The company acquired broadcasting equipment maker FTK the next year. Also in 1994 Rohde &amp; Schwarz signed a licensing deal with
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   allowing it to develop and market test equipment based on QUALCOMM's code-division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communications standard. Hermann Schwarz died in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company expanded its distribution reach into Mexico and began providing test and measurement gear to digital video broadcasters initially in Europe as digital TV took off. The next year Rohde &amp; Schwarz added to its secure communications expertise when it acquired Bosch Telecom's information security products department.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rohde &amp; Schwarz signed joint marketing partnerships with

    Siemens

   and
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   in 2000. The next year the company expanded its Latin American presence when it partnered with Brazilian television transmitter maker Tellys. Also in 2001 Rohde &amp; Schwarz acquired the hardware cryptology business of Siemens' Information &amp; Communication Mobile division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company established a subsidiary in Mexico. The following year, Rohde &amp; Schwarz set up a support center in Japan, supplementing the sales and service functions of Advantest, which had exclusively been distributing Rohde &amp; Schwarz products in Japan since 1992. In 2004 the company took over marketing, sales, and support of its products in Japan from Advantest. That same year, Rohde &amp; Schwarz assumed sales and service for its products in Canada and the US from Tektronix.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved into the lower end of the test and measurement instrument market with its 2005 acquisition of Hameg Instruments, a German firm. Rohde &amp; Schwarz retained all of Hameg's employees and facilities, and kept the Hameg brand name alive.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2008 Rohde &amp; Schwarz changed the name of its R&amp;S BICK Mobilfunk subsidiary to Rohde &amp; Schwarz Professional Mobile Radio to position the firm more clearly in the world market. Founder Heinz Bick, who stepped down as president of the firm in 2007, sold his minority equity stake in BICK Mobilfunk to Rohde &amp; Schwarz in late 2008, making the firm a wholly owned subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2010, as part of its effort to respond to such current technologies as wireless network security and Bluetooth and to serve new geographic markets, Rohde &amp; Schwarz began aligning itself with other equipment makers in joint sales and marketing deals and emphasizing its R&amp;D operations.
