   Alliance Fiber Optic Products (AFOP) is no lightweight in light waves. Communications equipment designers and manufacturers plug AFOP's fiber-optic components into products used to build networks that connect cities, regions within cities, and telecommunications service providers with their individual customers. Its optical path integration and optical fiber amplifier components, which include attenuators, couplers, depolarizers, multiplexers, and splitters, account for most of sales. The company sells directly to telecom equipment makers, primarily in North America, where it gets about half of sales. AFOP has more than 200 customers; in mid-2016 it was acquired by
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   AFOP's products are connectivity devices and passive optical devices. Connectivity products bring in 75% of revenue, and they include optical interconnect devices, couplers and splitters, planar lightwave circuits, and customized modules of devices. The rest of the revenue comes from optical passive products, which include wavelength-division multiplexing, coarse wavelength-division multiplexing, and dense wavelength-division multiplexing components and modules that use thin-film filter technologies to separate optical signals, variable attenuators, optical switches, and other optical devices using micro-optic lensing technology.

   The company make its devices in plants in Taiwan and China. In late 2014 AFOP leased to manufacturing facilities next to its plant in Shenzen, China, for additional capacity.

  <p>
   About 61% of AFOP's sales go to customers in North America, with 21% going to Europe and customers in Asia accounting for the remaining 18%.

   AFOP sells through its own sales team and aims mostly at US customers. It has a sales support staff in Taiwan to serve customers in the Asia/Pacific region. One customer accounted for about 40% of AFOP's revenue in 2014.

  <p>
   AFOP's revenue increased 13% to $86 million (a new high for the company) in 2014 from $76 million in 2013. The company recorded growth in connectivity and optical passive products with increased orders that resulted in higher volume shipments. Profit fell 22% from its peak in 2013 to $14.5 million in 2014. The company boosted research and development with more employees and equipment purchases, which cut into net incomes. Cash flow from operations increased to $23 million in 2014 from $19.6 million in 2013.

   AFOP should be in a good position as companies such as
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   (Google Fiber) and
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   (Gigabit Internet) build out high-speed internet networks of fiber-optic cable. As the networks moves closer to the premises, more networks connections are needed. And that's what AFOP provides. The company, however, is a small player in a business with hefty leaders. Competitors include
   <company id="110386">
    TE Connectivity
   </company>
   ($13 billion revenue) and
   <company id="41984">
    Viavi Solutions
   </company>
   ($1.7 billion). Even a smaller competitor,
   <company id="100566">
    Oclaro
   </company>
   , has revenue that's four times that of AFOP.
