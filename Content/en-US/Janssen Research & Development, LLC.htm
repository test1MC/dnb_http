   Janssen Research &amp; Development, formerly known as Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Development (J&amp;JPRD), provides research and development support for the pharmaceutical business units of parent company
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   (J&amp;J). The company divides its main research processes into central nervous system and internal medicine; biotech, immunology, and oncology (in concert with fellow J&amp;J subsidiary
   <company id="12923">
    Janssen Biotech
   </company>
   ); and virology (with another J&amp;J unit, Tibotec). The subsidiary -- which represents the largest segment of J&amp;J's pharmaceutical R&amp;D -- also does research in collaboration with other pharmaceutical organizations and biotech researchers.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Janssen Research &amp; Development has research hubs around the globe, including locations in Belgium, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US (California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania). Its central nervous system and internal medicine unit works on psychiatric, neurology, pain, infection, cardiovascular, and metabolic disease targets, primarily at the La Jolla, California, research center. Its virology division works with Tibotec on HIV and tuberculosis treatments from facilities in Belgium, Ireland, and the US.

   Janssen Research &amp; Development focuses on developing treatments in five therapeutic areas: cardiovascular and metabolism, immunology, infectious diseases and vaccines, neuroscience, and oncology, Many of the medicines researched and developed by Janssen Research &amp; Development are now big global sellers for parent company
   <company id="10824">
    J&amp;J.
   </company>
   Some of the top products are Topamax for epilepsy, antipsychotic Risperdal, Procrit for anemia, Stelara for psoriasis, Prezista for HIV, and Concerta for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's strategy is to identify the unmet medical needs and match them with science (organically or with the help of partners) to find effective treatments for patients. Its current development pipeline, which it hopes will produce tomorrow's blockbusters, includes potential treatments for diabetes, leukemia, ovarian cancer, HIV, and stroke prevention. It has about two dozen drugs in late-stage clinical trials or awaiting FDA approval. Overall, J&amp;J spends more than $4 billion on pharmaceutical research each year. Once the products are approved by regulators, they are passed along to other J&amp;J units for commercialization.

   In 2013 Janssen Research &amp; Development launched EXPLORER, a  global research program for XARELTO® (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant to improve cardiovascular patient outcomes.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's biotech, immunology, and oncology organization primarily operates alongside Janssen Biotech (formerly named Centocor Ortho Biotech), which is based at facilities in Pennsylvania. Janssen Biotech and Janssen Research &amp; Development worked together to receive approval for Cougar's prostate cancer drug, Zytiga, in 2011.

   on a potential drug for hepatitis C.
