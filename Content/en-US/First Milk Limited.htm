   First Milk packs the collective power of nearly 3,000 UK dairy farmer members. As the largest UK-based cheddar supplier, First Milk churns out 1.8 billion liters of milk per year. Through its dairy-processing plants, the cooperative oversees the processing and distribution of milk, cheddar cheese, and dairy ingredients, including whey, lactose, milk powders. Popular brands include Lake District Cheese Co., Scottish Pride, and Pembrokeshire. Making products under private labels, First Milk counts other dairy processors, food retailers, and school lunch providers among its milk and cheese customers. The company also provides ingredients to the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. First Milk Direct represents the company's buying unit.

  <p>
   The company organizes its operations based on the five main markets it serves. These include the cheddar and regional cheese division (which makes cheddars, red leicester, and double goucester), soft cheeses (such as cottage cheese, mozzarella, quarks, and mascarpone), dairy ingredients (which include butters, skimmed milk powder, creme fraiche, and whey proteins), fresh milk, and sports nutrition.
  </p>
  <p>
   First Milk's sports nutrition business, CNP, offers supplements, whey protein powders, as well as protein bars and drinks.

  <p>
   First Milk's financial performance has been volatile in recent years as the price and demand of milk has fluctuated around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue climbed by 15% to £610 million ($1.01 billion) in fiscal 2014 (ended March), while operating profits swelled by 210% for the year as the manufacturer kept its sales costs under control.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite higher operating profits during FY2014, First Milk suffered a net loss of £5.2 million ($8.7 million) as it paid a £9 million in charges associated with the closure of one of its packing facilities, restructuring and redundancies. The company did, however, improve from its net loss of £7.36 million ($11.2 million) in FY2013.

  <p>
   First Milk reiterated in 2015 that its long-term growth plans included: developing brands through consumer-led, new product development; building its growing lifestyle nutrition business; leveraging and creating new export business toward the goal of international expansion; targeting high growth sectors in the fast-growing "out of home" market; and ensuring that its supply chain is secure and efficient in part by utilizing measures that reduce cost and maximize efficiencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boasting annual export sales of roughly £50 million, First Milk in 2014 focused on developing new sales leads with customers in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America. The company reached big milestones later in the year, as the manufacturer began seeing its export sales reach the shores of the US and Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   First Milk has also been securing important supply partnerships in recent years to keep its sales steady. In a huge deal in mid-2014,
   <company id="41815">
    Nestle
   </company>
   chose First Milk to be its long-term dedicated supplier of fresh milk in the UK for the Nescafe and Kit Kat brands. In late 2013, the company secured a contract with Adams Foods, giving First Milk both a competitive price for its cheese along with a long-term outlet for the majority of First Milk's hard cheese supply.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its also continued to innovate and create new products to expand into new food markets and keep its brand fresh on consumer minds. In mid-2014, the company launched its The Lake District Dairy Co. Cooking Sauces line in three flavors: garlic &amp; herb, tikka, and tomato &amp; basil.

  <p>
   Looking to maintain its ranking as one of the UK's leading dairy companies, First Milk has spent the past couple of years diversifying its customer base and product offering. To this end, the company acquired the sports nutrition firm CNP Professional in 2012. The purchase CNP, which targeted sportsmen and women with high-margin functional foods, built on First Milk's joint venture (formed in 2011) with New Zealand-based Fonterra, which produced whey protein as ingredients for functional foods.

   First Milk rolled out its first Dairy Maniacs-branded product -- Cheddar Stix -- to supermarkets in 2011 through a licensing agreement with US-based film company

   . First Milk also acquired Fife, Scotland-based Kingdom Cheese and Kingdom Dairies in 2011. The move boosted its presence in the UK and in the cheese section, with Kingdom's cottage cheese, soft cheese, and mozzarella products and creams. The acquisition also allowed First Milk to expand its business in major retailers, foodservice, wholesalers and food manufacturers, and pizza chains across the UK, Ireland, and Europe.
