   Autoliv operates through four primary segments: airbags and associated products (55% of total sales), seat belts and associated products (28%), passive safety electronic products (10%), and active safety products (7%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 2015, the company launched a new internal structure consisting of two business segments: passive safety (including airbags and seatbelts) and electronics (including passive safety electronics and active safety), to manage its business operations.

  <p>
   After posting a revenue milestone of $9.24 billion in 2014, Autoliv saw its revenues dip slightly to $9.17 billion in 2015. The marginal decrease was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency effects primarily in Japan and Europe. Excluding foreign currency effects, net revenue increased by 8% in 2015 due to a spike in organic growth in both the segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Organic sales for passive safety electronics products (mainly airbag control modules and remote sensing units) grew primarily from higher sales in China and South Korea in 2015. The company also experienced higher sales of replacement inflators, inflatable curtains, and steering wheels; in addition, seatbelt products sales climbed in Europe and North America. Autoliv in 2015 experienced a strong increase in sales of active safety products (automotive radars, night vision systems, cameras with driver assist systems, positioning systems and brake control systems) resulting from higher sales of radar related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autoliv's profits remained consistent for both 2014 and 2015, hovering around the $460 million mark. Its operating cash flow has fluctuated over the last five years; after decreasing in 2014, it jumped by 5% in 2015.

  <p>
   The company is focused on growing by increasing its organic sales overseas. In 2014 the company began production on two of its largest investments, a propellant plant and a textile center, in China. A major advantage to expansion outside of its traditional market of North America is that cars built in developing economies have tended to lightly adopt safety features -- so there is room for further penetration.

  <p>
   Autoliv traces its origins back to 1956 when Autoliv AB, a Swedish corporation, pioneered automotive seat belt technology. By 1967, the company had invented the retractor belt. Granges Weda AB, another maker of seat belt retractors, acquired the company in 1975.

    Electrolux
   </company>
   bought the Granges Group (later renamed SAPA) in 1989 and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the company continued to grow through acquisitions, buying seat belt manufacturing operations primarily in Europe, but also in Australia and New Zealand. In 1994 the company changed its name to Autoliv AB and went public, with Electrolux selling all its shares during the offering.
