   Acelity is a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in developing and commercializing medical devices, especially in the areas of advanced wound therapeutics and regenerative medicine. Its primary operating units are
   <company id="13908">
    Kinetic Concepts
   </company>
   , and Systagenix. Acelity's products, which carry such brand names as Strattice, VeraFlo, and Promogran, are sold throughout the US and in more than 75 nations abroad. Additionally, Acelity has operating units that provide contract manufacturing operations in England. Acelity sold

   to Allergan for $2.9 billion in 2017.

  <p>
   Acelity operates through two primary businesses: advanced wound therapeutics (
   <company id="13908">
    Kinetic Concepts
   </company>
   and Systagenix, representing about three-fourths of total revenue) and regenerative medicine (
   <company id="45891">
    LifeCell
   </company>
   , representing around 20% of total revenue).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's core strengths include negative pressure wound therapy, breast reconstruction, hernia repair, and advanced wound dressings.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acelity primarily operates in the Americas (especially in the US) and in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region. Revenues from the Americas account for more than three-quarters of the group's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's regenerative medicine business is focused on Europe, while its advanced wound therapies business is expanding in several markets across Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The group has direct sales teams in more than 25 countries, as well as indirect sales operations in another 50 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced wound therapy customers include health care facilities, group purchasing organizations representing groups of health care facilities, and individual patients. Regerative medicine customers include hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers as well as group purchasing organizations. Acelity both sells and rents its products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, revenue rose a modest 4% to $1.867 billion (versus $1.866 billion in 2014), largely due to an increase of rental revenue in the advanced wound therapies business. However, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates had an effect on the company's revenues that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acelity lost a net $47.7 million in 2015, an improvement over the net $230.5 million it lost in the prior year. Chief among the reasons for this improvement was the absence of a $198.6 million litigation-related charge related to a settlement agreement between Kinetic Concepts and Wake Forest.
  </p>

  <p>
   Acelity's operating subsidiaries offer a full complement of medical devices that can help patients as they advance in their treatments. This enables the company to cross-sell and co-market its various products. Additionally, the group is focused on developing new products to expand its existing portfolio. Among its newer technologies are the V.A.C. VeraFlow wound treatment system, the Revolve system for fat grafting procedures, and the CelluTome system for skin grafting procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the world population ages, and increasingly faces obesity, Acelity stands to benefit from higher demand of its products. However, the company has also taken a hit from such factors as pushback on prices from such payers as Medicare and group purchasing organizations as well as increased competition in its market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Acelity agreed to sell its
   <company id="45891">
    LifeCell
   </company>
   subsidiary to Allergan for $2.9 billion, which will allow the company to focus on its larger advanced wound care operations.
