   Ariens is a manufacturer for all seasons. The company makes a line of consumer lawn and garden equipment. Its mowers to tillers are sold under multiple brands including the Ariens name, and its snow removal equipment under the Sno-Thro brand. Semi-famous "Lawnmower Boy" Ryan Tripp used an Ariens mower to mow the grounds of 50 state capitols and the White House -- all for charity. The company's Stens Corp. offers aftermarket replacement parts for power equipment via catalog sales and dealers in more than 30 countries. Ariens also produces Gravely-brand commercial grounds-maintenance equipment, and the Locke and National brands for intricate golf course maintenance. The family of founder Henry Ariens owns Ariens.

  <p>
   Ariens is continuing to fuel its growth by expanding its geographic footprint as well as by adding new sales channels, products, and brands. Its diverse set of businesses also allow it to balance seasonal and weather-driven demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy was bolstered by a $3.8 million expansion and upgrade of its Wisconsin office and research and development center in 2011. The investment included redesigning workspaces for greater efficiency and replacing a boiler system with a sustainable geothermal heating and cooling system.

  <p>
   Ariens has a deal to supply one of the largest distributors of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) equipment in the US,

   . Ariens launched four of its brands (the Ariens lawn and Sno-Thro lines, EverRide lawn products, and Parker debris-maintenance) through Grainger's website and 2011 catalog.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also maintains a steady flow of new products. In 2012 it introduced the Hydro Pro Sno-ThroÂ® featuring Ariens' first hydrostatic transmission in a snow thrower.

  <p>
   To cut costs, in 2013 the company closed its Opp, Alabama plant, laying off 17 employees.

   Henry Ariens established his namesake company with his sons in 1933. In 1982 Ariens purchased Gravely Company, a maker of commercial lawn and garden equipment since 1916. The company is led by the founder's great-grandson Dan Ariens.
