   While the company maintains its expertise in home spa and therapy products, HoMedics has been expanding into new niches for revenue growth. HoMedics rings up sales as a manufacturer for other consumer products companies. For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, it makes the iShred paper shredder. The company also boasts a $540 million licensing deal with Sharper Image that extended through 2013 to make products under the Sharper Image brand name. The move has involved creating a company named SI Products to focus on the less-expensive models. HoMedics views the partnership as a way to enter new product categories and complement its existing business streams. Under the agreement,
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy

   stores sell about two dozen home-audio products under the Sharper Image brand.

   During the past decade, HoMedics had been developing and investing in its
   <company id="60358">
    Taylor Precision Products
   </company>
   business, which it acquired in 2002. Taylor, which specializes in making precision thermometers and scales, bought Springfield Precision Instruments in 2010 to add decorative outdoor thermometers and rain gauges, as well as energy-saving products and kitchen timers. HoMedics opted to divest Taylor's operations in mid-2012, however, selling it to middle-market private equity firm
   <company id="160661">
    Centre Partners
   </company>
   . At the time HoMedics cited that it was shifting its focus back to products in the consumer health and wellness and electronics lifestyle markets.
