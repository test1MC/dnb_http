   Mechanical equipment artist Vermeer is an old master in the production of farm equipment, distributed through a global dealer network. Its line includes hay tools, such as balers and rakes, tedders, and silage wrappers, as well as biomass harvesting equipment used in renewable energy. It also offers landscaping products, from mowers to cutters and edgers. Vermeer's heavy-duty workhorses include equipment for construction, surface mining, and organic recycling, wood waste processing, and tree care. Vermeer sells ground-locating and mapping software for construction use, too. The company is owned and run by the founding Vermeer family.

   In order to grow, the company has invested in emerging markets such as energy and recycling by launching a series of new products. Over the years Vermeer has unveiled a 400,000-pound, 24-foot high terrain leveler for rock excavation. The largest piece of equipment made by the company to date, it reportedly removes specific ore veins with minimal damage to the environment.

   Targeting the growing market for corn ethanol plants, Vermeer has debuted a cob harvester. Hitched behind a combine, the equipment runs off its own engine to gather corncobs, which are then separated and flung into bins for later use as the biomass ingredient in ethanol production. The company also introduced a flex-angle drill to support geothermal field loop installations, specifically in residential construction projects. An industry first, the drill works at a range of angles, handling vertical and steep-angles as well as horizontal conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vermeer has addressed the market for wind-energy, too, by offering an attachment designed to help in building farms. Rather than requiring multiple passes to install transmission lines, the Vermeer track trencher attachment accomplishes the task in just one pass. Vermeer also recently rolled out an electric-powered horizontal grinder for wood waste recycling.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company introduced a new ride-on service plow suited for customers who  install fiber-optic lines, electrical and gas services and irrigation systems. Other launches that year included a new drilling fluid reclaimer specially designed drilling applications in areas where methane, ethylene and similar gases are present, and the first fully continuous round baler (in collaboration with the Lely Group).
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company announced plans to build the Vermeer Applied Technology Hub in Iowa State Research Park, to allow Iowa State students, faculty, and members of the Vermeer team to work collaboratively on technology advancements for Vermeer's industrial and agricultural equipment.

   In 2014 the company announced that third-generation family member Jason Andringa will serve as Vermeer's next President and CEO, beginning in November 2015.
