   Gerdau Ameristeel puts its stamp on the steel business in the US. The company is one of the largest minimill steelmakers in North America, with a capacity to produce about 12.4 million tons of finished steel annually.  Through about 20 mills, Gerdau Ameristeel sells to the eastern two-thirds of North America. The company also operates scrap recycling operations, specialty processing centers, and rebar fabricating and coating plants. Its minimills produce beams, flat-rolled steel, merchant bar, rebar, and wire rod primarily used in the automotive, appliance, construction, machinery, and equipment industries. The company is owned by Brazilian steelmaker

   The company's North America Business Operation has an annual production capacity of 12.4 million tonnes of crude steel and 12.4 million tonnes of finished steel products. It has a vertically integrated network of 15 steel units for the operation of a mini-mill, 33 scrap recycling facilities, 66 downstream operations (including three joint ventures) and fabshops.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerdau's North American subsidiaries include Gerdau USA Inc., Gerdau Ameristeel US Inc., GNA Partners, Pacific Coast Steel Inc., Gerdau Ameristeel Perth Amboy Inc., Sheffield Steel Corporation, Gerdau Ameristeel Sayreville Inc., TAMCO Steel and, Chaparral Steel Company. Gerdau Ameristeel also had a 50% interest in the jointly controlled entity Gallatin in Kentucky, but in 2014 Gerdau and partner

   sold the Gallatin plant to
   <company id="11098">

   for $770 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company produces special sections such as grader blades, smelter bars, light rails, super light I-beams, elevator guide rails and other products that are made on demand for its clients, which are mainly manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recycled scrap metal provides more than 90% of the steel for its minimills, making the company the continent's second-largest scrap recycler. Its own scrap operations provide much of the raw material for the minimills. And once the company's minimills produce the steel, the steel product can be sent to its many downstream operations, which include rebar fabrication plants, railroad spike makers, wire and nail operations, and cold drawn plants.

   North America Business products are sold to steel service centers and steel fabricators or directly to OEM (original equipment manufacturers) for use in a variety of industries, including construction, automotive, mining, cellular and electrical transmission, metal construction fabrication and equipment fabrication. Most of the raw material feed stock for the mini-mill operations is recycled steel scrap.
  </p>
  <p>
   The North America Business Operation accounted for 33.7% of overall Gerdau sales volumes in 2015. The company's Canadian operations sell a significant portion of its production in the US.

   Gerdau Ameristeel reported in 2011 that it had manufactured 17,000 tons of sheet piling for the Panama Canal expansion, a major $5.25 billion project that will double the capacity of the canal, allowing more ships (and larger ships) to traverse it.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Gerdau Ameristeel opened a new rebar fabrication facility in Navasota, Texas, to serve the Houston construction market. The facility will have an eventual capacity of 40,000 tons.

   Parent company Gerdau, which already owned most of Gerdau Ameristeel, moved to buy all outstanding shares in 2010, taking the company private and making it a wholly-owned subsidiary.

  <p>
   Starting in 1955, Gerald Hefferman built up Premier Steel Mills (Alberta, Canada) into a multinational steel producer. Hefferman sold Premier to Stelco in 1962 and soon began building the Lake Ontario Steel Co. (Lasco). In 1970 he formed Co-Steel International Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-Steel borrowed heavily in the late 1970s, targeting $500 million for acquisitions and plant upgrades. It bought 63% of UK-based Sheerness Steel in 1972, and in 1973 it formed Chaparral Steel with metal and concrete producer Texas Industries. Co-Steel's New Jersey-based Raritan Steel opened in 1980 and changed its name to Co-Steel in 1986. It went public that year to ease its debt; the US steel market was slumping and Japanese steel was abundant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Co-Steel bought the rest of Sheerness. That year Texas Industries completed its purchase of Chaparral Steel from Co-Steel; the deal raised Co-Steel's stake in Texas Industries to 22%. In 1991 Co-Steel merged Sheerness' Raw Materials division with Mayer Newman &amp; Co., forming Mayer Parry Recycling (UK). With a growing international presence, in 1992 Co-Steel reorganized and renamed several operations, including Co-Steel Lasco, Co-Steel Raritan, and Co-Steel Sheerness. Co-Steel formed a partnership with Dofasco in 1993 to build the Gallatin Steel Mill, a $360 million minimill for producing flat-rolled steel in Kentucky.
  </p>
  <p>
   An industry boom boosted sales in 1994. However, Europe's depressed market kept Sheerness' sales low. By 1995 Co-Steel had sold its stake in Texas Industries and had begun production at Gallatin Steel. Co-Steel experienced its first-ever loss in 1996, related to the Gallatin Steel startup. That year Co-Steel expanded its North American metal-recycling operations by buying Ken Lener &amp; Sons (New York) and Frampton Auto Parts (Ontario). In 1997 it bought Michigan-based recycler Jackson Iron &amp; Metal. Also in 1997 Mayer Parry Recycling formed Hammond Recycling, a joint venture that merged the Irish recycling operations of Mayer Parry (UK), Hammond Lane Metal (Ireland), and European Metal Recycling (UK).
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 1998 Co-Steel acquired
   <company id="14236">
    New Jersey Steel
   </company>
   (New Jersey Steel was previously 60% owned by Swiss steelmaker Von Roll Group) and changed its name to Co-Steel Sayreville. Minimill firm New Jersey Steel had started as Steel Holdings, formed by the 1976 consolidation of New Jersey Steel, Structural Corp., Capital Steel, and the Fireproof Products Co. The company changed its name to New Jersey Steel in 1978. In 1988 New Jersey Steel bought a third of New Jersey-based reinforcing-rod fabricator A.J. Ross Logistics, which had previously supplied steel for New York City's George Washington Bridge and Jacob Javits Convention Center. When A.J. Ross went bankrupt in 1993, it owed $5.3 million to New Jersey Steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-Steel sold its money-losing Sheerness plant to UK steelmaker ASW Holdings for a loss in 1999. It also faced losses that year from Russian, Ukrainian, and Indonesian steel firms flooding the US market. Co-Steel and other US steelmakers asked regulators to impose new tariffs or import quotas, but the requests were denied. In 2000 the company sold its 76% stake in steel recycler Mayer Parry (UK).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 a subsidiary of Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau S.A., called Gerdau North America, bought Co-Steel, changing the company's name to Gerdau Ameristeel. (Ameristeel was an 87%-owned subsidiary that was fully acquired in 2002 and rolled up into the new company.) In 2004 Gerdau Ameristeel grew when it purchased the
   <company id="104804">
    North Star Steel
   </company>
   assets (including steel minimills, recycling facilities, and downstream operations) from Cargill for approximately $300 million. The company began trading on the NYSE that year.
