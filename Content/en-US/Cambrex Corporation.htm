   Cambrex focuses on health. Providing products, services, and technologies which help to accelerate the development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics, the company develops products for the human health care market that include active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates for over-the-counter and prescription branded and generic pharmaceuticals. It also makes intermediates used in cosmetics and food additives. Cambrex focuses on developing drug delivery technologies and the manufacture of high-potency compounds and controlled substances.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Canbrex has facilities in Estonia, Germany, India, Italy, Sweden, and the US. R&amp;D and specialty manufacturing facilities are located in Europe, India, and the US. In 2012 Europe accounted for 54% of sales, North America, 38%.

        <p>
   The company sells its products through a combination of direct sales and independent agents. In 2012 Gyma Laboratories of America accounted for 13% of the company's sales. One active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), sold to multiple customers, accounted for 12% of Cambrex's 2012 total revenues.

        <p>
   Canbrex's revenues grew by 8% in 2012 despite foreign currency exchange rate that unfavorably impacted sales by 3.4%. Excluding foreign currency, sales volumes increased in most of the company's product lines, including controlled substances, generic APIs, custom development and products using Cambrex's drug delivery technology. It also experienced a modest increase in its custom manufacturing product sales, including APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates sold to innovative drug companies. Higher demand for certain APIs was partially offset by a newly approved product in which the customer built up inventory in 2011. In 2012 custom development and manufacturing product contributed 45% of Cambrex's total revenues; generic APIs, 36%.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, net income spiked by 468% in 2012 thanks to higher revenues, increased income from continuing operations, the increased absorption of R&amp;D expenses into inventory, and the lower cost of goods sold as a result of increased revenue generating custom development activity.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Cambrex's stated strategy is to grow its portfolio of customer development projects -- primarily those in the latter stages of the clinical trial process -- and secure long-term supply agreements to make APIs and intermediates for recently approved drug products. It also seeks to expand sales based on its technologies and to partner with generic drug manufacturers to expand the company's portfolio of APIs. It also drives growth in strategic business segments through the selective acquisition of businesses, products, product lines, technologies and capabilities.

   In 2013 Cambrex and
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   signed a deal for Cambrex to contract make Dow Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Acetate Succinate for Drug Solubility Enhancement. Dow's polymer science and application expertise, coupled with Cambrex's capabilities positions Dow for rapid entry into the market, using the AFFINISOL™ product platform.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Cambrex also agreed to supply an active pharmaceutical ingredient for a customer's Phase 3 program during 2013 and 2014.

   In 2016 the company acquired PharmaCore, a privately-owned company located in High Point, North Carolina, specializing in developing, manufacturing and scaling up small molecule APIs for clinical phase projects.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired a 51% stake in Zenara Pharma in 2010, giving Cambrex a platform within India's growing pharmaceutical market and making it a global player in the nicotine replacement therapy market. Cambrex has an option to obtain the remaining 49% in 2016.
