   Qumu has ditched the disc and punched play on video. The company provides services that help companies create, manage, secure, distribute, and measure the reach of their videos. It divested its business tied to CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs to concentrate on products and service surrounding digital video. Qumu targets businesses that use video for meetings, communications, sales, training, and other purposes. Following an industry trend, the company is moving from an on-premise video product to cloud-based model. Users can play Qumu videos on any device. The company counts

   Services generate almost three-quarter of Qumu's revenue. The category includes revenue from term software licenses, cloud services, maintenance and support, and professional services. The remaining revenue comes from software and appliance sales, which are perpetual software licenses and hardware.

   In 2015 Qumu's revenue reached $34.4 million, a 30% from 2014. A 65% in service revenue drove the overall increase. The company gained in subscription, maintenance and support revenues from a growing customer base from the acquisition of Kulu Valley. Software license revenue fell on a decrease in the value of perpetual product license contracts entered and converted to revenue. A 200% revenue increase (some $5.4 million) from Europe also helped the top line.

   Qumu's exit from the disc business continued to effect the bottom line. The company's loss ballooned to $29 million in 2015 from a loss of $8.5 million in 2014. The company wrote down equipment it plans to no longer use as well as third party agreements and expenses related to divestiture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its negative cash flow was about even in 2015 and 2014 at about $23 million.

   Qumu is positioning itself to be a go-to provider of end-to-end video services for companies, particularly big companies. Enterprises have increased their use of video to communicate with employees and customers. Qumu is working to come at the market from all sides. Its products and services enable the viewing of video on multiple devices. It has added resellers in Europe to build on its strong 2015 growth on the continent.

   The company Qumu transitioned to enterprise video content management in July 2014 when it closed the sale of its disc publishing assets to Equus Holdings Inc. and Redwood Acquisition Inc., known as Rimage Corp.
