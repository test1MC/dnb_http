   The company's net sales declined 20% from $193 million in 2014 to $155 million in 2015. The decline was attributed to discontinued operations of its former POC business. After posting $14 million in net income in 2014, Black Diamond suffered a net loss of $76 million in 2015. The loss was fueled by the impairment of goodwill and increases in interest expenses. In addition, the company's cash flow has fluctuated wildly over the years; after posting negative cash flow of $29 million in 2014, it posted $3.7 million in positive cash flow during 2015.

  <p>
   The company is growing its portfolio of outdoor brands and products through new product innovations and by expanding organically. It has specifically grown its sales through innovation in gloves, trekking poles, helmets, headlamps and apparel as well as introducing new technologies, such as JetForce avalanche airbags.
  </p>
  <p>
   Black Diamond is also focused on expanding its brand presence and penetration outside of the US market. It believes the European alpine market is significantly larger than the US market and is highly fragmented by country. To gain market share, it is emphasizing its Black Diamond brand and positioning it as a global brand with American roots and PIEPS as a global brand with European roots.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also believe its presence in Asia, driven by their business in Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan and other key Asian markets, represents a significant growth opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of this strategy, Black Diamond sold its former POC product line to
   <company id="42861">
    Investcorp
   </company>
   for $65 million to focus solely on its Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS brands.
