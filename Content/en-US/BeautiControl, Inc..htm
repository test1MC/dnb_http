   BeautiControl is looking to be ageless in the business of aesthetics and enjoys calling the Lone Star State home, alongside rival

   , BeautiControl sells its personal care items through more than 140,000 independent sales consultants, who in turn sell to consumers in the US, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Consultants provide computer-assisted, head-to-toe makeup advice through in-home demos. Its products include skin care, hair and nail care, fragrances, cosmetics, toiletries, nutritional and weight-management food supplements, and in-home spa retreats. Tupperware has owned BeautiControl since 2000, when it sought to expand its direct-selling reach to beauty and personal care items.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Texas-based BeautiControl operates in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

  <p>
   BeautiControl operates as part of Tupperware's Beauty North America segment, which houses premium cosmetics, skin care, and personal care products marketed under the brand names Armand Dupree, Fuller Cosmetics, and namesake BeautiControl. The segment brings in about 12% of its parent's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tupperware owns BeautiControl's Carrollton, Texas, headquarters (outside Dallas) and leases its manufacturing and distribution facilities in the state.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its BeautiControl Research Institute works to develop exclusive formulations and provide advanced beauty products.

  <p>
   The direct-selling cosmetics company, which is a member of the Personal Care Product Council, sells its products through more than 140,000 Independent Consultants and online.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales force remains predominantly female. Outside the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico, the BeautiControl line is sold through representatives in select markets within the Tupperware organizational structure. Consultants can place orders, keep track of sales, and recruit clients through the company's online service.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tupperware's Beauty North America segment logged an 8% decline in fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, sales had actually dropped a noteworthy 10%, due primarily to lower volume and unfavorable product mix, as well as lower prices. BeautiControl attributes the double-digit decrease to ineffective recruiting and high field-manager turnover at its Fuller Mexico business and a smaller and less active BeautiControl salesforce overall.
  </p>
  <p>
   The segment's profit slipped by 47% in fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 due to lower sales, along with concessions in gross margin and from increased spending to grow the size of its salesforce. As a percentage of sales, BeautiControl posted a nearly 5% profit.

  <p>
   BeautiControl is working to swing back after years of sales declines spurred initially by the global economic downturn. The company points to a dwindling salesforce -- and therefore fewer consultants to peddle its products -- as a primary reason for missed sales targets. It hopes to boost recruiting through a revised compensation plan for sales consultants that focuses on selling products through spa parties and recruiting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, BeautiControl has been targeting an older customer and the Hispanic market, as both markets are growing. Aimed at mature women, the company has launched new products, such as eyecreams and serums. BeautiControl has also launched the Armand Dupree line of products, targeted at the Hispanic market and sold in Mexico and in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, BeautiControl entered a new product category with the 2012 launch of BC Spa for Baby. The new products take their place in two significant categories in the skin care and bath and body arena.

  <p>
   Jinger and Richard Heath sank their life savings into a defunct direct-sales cosmetics company in 1981, buying up machinery, inventory, and the name BeautiControl. (Richard had been an executive at the company's parent, Tri-Chem, and Jinger had sold its products.) They resuscitated BeautiControl by color-coding the product line according to skin tones and teaching saleswomen to offer customers more services, such as color analysis. Although the company almost went belly-up in 1983, it went public three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   BeautiControl launched computer-assisted image makeovers, including fashion tips for body and personality types, in 1987. Among its most successful product lines has been its Regeneration alpha hydroxy acid skin care products, introduced in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   After low unemployment in 1997 hampered consultant recruiting and sales dropped, BeautiControl revamped its product packaging, lowered the entry fee for recruits, and bumped up commissions. The company also entered markets in Taiwan (1998) and Hong Kong (1999). (It abandoned both markets after being acquired by Tupperware Brands Corporation in 2000.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 BeautiControl started subsidiary Eventus International to develop nutritional supplements and introduced BeautiNet Plus, which enables consultants to manage business online. Also that year BeautiControl hired Sheila Cooper, an executive at archrival Mary Kay, to be its president and COO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2000 the company was purchased by fellow direct-marketer Tupperware Brands Corporation. Cooper left the company and was replaced by Richard W. Heath who became BeautiControl's president and CEO. Soon after the acquisition BeautiConrol discontinued the Eventus nutritional product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 BeautiControl launched operations in Mexico and the Philippines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2003, co-founder, president and CEO Richard Heath stepped down and his son Rick became BeautiControl's president. Jinger Health retired as chairwoman in 2004. The same year Rick Heath was named as an executive at parent corporation Tupperware, and Kristi Hubbard was appointed president of BeautiControl.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2009 Albert Bosch succeeded Kristi Hubbard as president of the company.
