   Omthera Pharmaceuticals hopes to produce a pill that marks the end of high triglycerides. The specialty drug company focuses on treatments for blood abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. Epanova, its only candidate, uses omega-3 fatty acids to reduce triglycerides, which have been linked to heart disease and stroke. The drug's key ingredient is derived from fish oil, and the company says Epanova's once-a-day dose is more convenient for patients. Omthera plans to market the drug to cardiologists and other specialists in the US, as well as internationally. Omthera went public in 2013; shortly after the IPO it was acquired by

  <p>
   Omthera was formed in 2008 as a private entity. It became public through the completion of a public offering in 2013. About a month after it completed its IPO, the company became part of the AstraZeneca organization. Through the $443 million deal, AstraZeneca will expand its cardiovascular offerings and boost its development pipeline with candidates that could replace bestsellers that have lost patent protection in recent years. Omthera will gain access to AstraZeneca's broad R&amp;D and commercialization resources.

   Omthera's plans for its $64 million in IPO proceeds included continuing to work toward

   approval for Epanova, as well as to ramp up its manufacturing and sales and marketing operations post-approval. Following its acquisition by AstraZeneca, the company will pursue those same goals with the added support of a new parent.

  </p>
  <p>
   Omthera has no sales yet but once Epanova is approved, it plans to begin selling in the US through an in-house sales force. It also owns the exclusive worldwide rights to Epanova through a licensing agreement with Chrysalis Pharma, and it plans to seek partnerships to help it commercialize its product internationally.

    Strategy
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Once it has obtained regulatory approval for Epanova for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, or high triglycerides, Omthera intends to seek approval for additional cardiovascular-related treatments. It also plans to form in-house sales and marketing teams and then expand its marketing efforts internationally through partnerships.
