  <p>
   A turbocharger (turbine, compressor, shaft, and bearing system) converts waste energy to air, then compresses the air before it flows into a diesel engine. More air means more fuel can be added, and that means more engine power. Turbocharge technology increases engine power without increasing the engine size, which allows for improved fuel consumption, better performance in altitudes, and lower emissions. Cummins Turbo Technologies gives its parent company the confidence to actually look forward to tougher emissions standards, which is crucial as more environmentally friendly legislation gets passed in the upcoming years.
