   The company is the leading manufacturer and marketer of biscuits in the UK and second largest in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Ireland. It owns and operates 16 manufacturing facilities, of which seven are in the UK. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries in Europe, North America, the Middle East, Africa, India and other parts of Asia, and Australia.

   The company's strategic objectives are: Reinforcing McVitie's as a global mega brand; rapidly developing its savory business in the UK; strengthening its relationship with customers as the category experts; making the Northern Europe business a fighting, sustainable challenger; accelerating growth of the business in emerging markets; and improving operational performance and cost effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, McVitie's launched personalized Jaffa Cakes. That year UB also launched a limited edition range of 'Stiglets', with an on-pack promotion teaming up Twiglets with
   <company id="122260">
    BBC Worldwide
   </company>
   's Top Gear Track Experience and the 'tame racing driver', The Stig.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year UB also created am exclusive retailer Ambassadors Club (12 carefully selected independent retailers from both affiliated and unaffiliated sectors across the UK). The United Biscuits Ambassadors Club (UBAC) will convene on a quarterly basis to discuss current hot topics and share category experience, allowing the company to gain deeper insights on the challenges faced by retailers in the current environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, UB announced a strategic three-year partnership with
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   whereby Cargill's cocoa and chocolate business will supply all UB' derived cocoa and chocolate products and will support the company with the delivery to its seven manufacturing facilities across the UK, as well as the four facilities in Northern Europe. Both companies will work together to investigate new ways to use chocolate more effectively, helping drive continual innovation
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to regain profitability, the company has trimmed costs and stepped up its co-packing arrangements with other food companies. It owns the Nik Nak and Wheat Crunchies brands of biscuits and snacks, but their manufacturing is done by the UK salty snack maker
   <company id="147583">
    Tayto
   </company>
   . UB has also focused on strengthening its market presence and expanding production capacity in India. After expenditures on capital, restructuring, and pensions, cash generated from operations increased, earmarked for paying down debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the company continues to focus on consumer food trends, eliminating saturated and trans-fats, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and artificial colorings from its products. Its efforts extend to such environmental best practices as fueling its delivery fleet with its used vegetable oil and installing more efficient ovens to reduce its energy use.

  <p>
   Formed in 1948 from the merger of Scottish biscuit makers McVitie &amp; Price and Macfarlane Lang, United Biscuits Holdings (UB) is made up of companies that date as far back as the early 1800s. The most significant of them grew from Robert McVitie's food store in Edinburgh. His son, Robert Jr., was a baker's apprentice who introduced Vienna bread to Scotland and inherited the store in 1884. To expand his sales territory, McVitie concentrated on biscuits, which kept fresh for a longer period than breads. In 1888 Cadbury salesman Charles Price joined McVitie, later becoming his partner. By the time Price left the company in 1901, McVitie &amp; Price had become a national institution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon McVitie's death in 1910, Alexander Grant, who developed the company's Digestive-brand biscuit, became managing director (and later chairman). During WWI, McVitie &amp; Price provided "iron ration" plain biscuits for soldiers.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII rationing forced McVitie &amp; Price to cooperate with Macfarlane Lang, a rival biscuit maker. Founded in Glasgow in 1817 by James Lang, the company had grown under the leadership of John Macfarlane and his sons, and it was named Macfarlane Lang in 1885. It grew throughout the early 1900s. The companies merged in 1948 as United Biscuits Holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although united in name, the units operated independently. In the early 1960s UB acquired two UK bakers, shortbread maker William Crawford &amp; Sons, founded in 1813, and William MacDonald &amp; Sons, known for chocolate-covered biscuits. UB moved into salty snacks with the acquisitions of chip maker Meredith &amp; Drew in 1967 and nut processor Kenyon Sons &amp; Craven in 1968. These two companies became its KP Foods division (now part of UK Foods). The company bought biscuit maker Carr's of Carlisle in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   UB acquired a few companies overseas in the early 1970s, and made its biggest geographic leap in 1974 by acquiring
   <company id="47109">
    Keebler
   </company>
   , a US cookie and cracker maker. Further diversifying its holdings, UB acquired the Wimpy hamburger chain in 1977. (It sold Wimpy, as well as its Pizzaland and Perfect Pizza chains to
   <company id="55181">
    Diageo
   </company>
   forerunner Grand Metropolitan in 1989.) In 1988 the company moved into frozen foods, adding Ross Young's.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s UB made major strides into Europe, acquiring Netherlands-based Verkade (1990), Finnish-based Fazer Biscuits (1991), and Polish-based biscuit maker San (1994). In 1993 it entered the Australian snack market by acquiring The Smith's Snackfood Co.

  <p>
   Struggling against
   <company id="103392">
    Nabisco
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   's snacks in many markets, UB sold money-losing Keebler in 1996 to investment group INFLO. (It was later bought by
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg's
   </company>
   .) UB swapped its snacks arm (including Smith's) for Pepsi's biscuit operations (BN) in 1997. By early 1998 the company had limited international operations to biscuits. UB also added
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell Soup
   </company>
   's European biscuits division, Delacre, in 1998. The company spun off its seafood business and sold UK Foods' chilled and frozen food businesses to the US's
   <company id="10693">
    H. J. Heinz
   </company>
   for $317 million in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   After months of competing against each other, in 2000 Burlington Biscuits (Nabisco Holdings and
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (then known as Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst) and Finalrealm (led by
   <company id="41774">
    Groupe Danone
   </company>
   ) joined together and bought 87% of the company. Malcolm Ritchie became CEO that year. It was subsequently purchased by a consortium of investors made up of Cinven, PAI, Nabisco (now owned by Kraft), and DB Capital Partners which was later acquired by MidOcean Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better focus on biscuits and snacks, in 2002 United Biscuits sold its share of
   <company id="124566">
    Young's Bluecrest Seafood
   </company>
   to Young's senior management and sold its UK Foods' chilled and frozen food businesses (including San Marco pizzas and McVitie's frozen desserts) to Heinz. That same year the company centralized its offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having settled on a diet of biscuits and snacks, United Biscuit set to refining the mix in 2004. The company purchased Portuguese biscuit maker, Triunfo Productos Alimentares (Chipmix, Clásicas, Corintia, Hookie, and Waferland), and then sold off its Benelux snack business to local maker Roger &amp; Roger. Later in the year, the company attempted to acquire Irish Biscuits from
   <company id="41774">
    Groupe Danone
   </company>
   but the deal fell through. However, this freed it up to focus on its purchase of the Jacob's biscuit group from Danone. The Jacob's acquisition gave United Biscuits access to a pantry full of strong domestic biscuit and cracker brands in the UK and the license to market Nabisco's Ritz brand in the UK and Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
   UB sold its operations in Spain and Portugal to
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   in 2006, along with the rights to the Nabisco brand in those markets for about $1 billion. United Biscuits continues to hold the license to make and market some of Nabisco's biggest brands, (Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz) in other parts of Europe, and exports Carr's crackers and cookies to North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company was put up for sale. UB was said to be worth £2.3 billion ($4.2 billion); and despite the fact that the company had £1.8 billion ($3.3 billion) in debt and an approximate £386 ($712 million) pension deficit, rival
   <company id="117846">
    Premier Foods
   </company>
   and Blackstone expressed interest in acquiring it; however, Premier pulled out, leaving Blackstone as the only contender.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year Blackstone, along with investment firm
   <company id="133849">
    PAI
   </company>
   (which already owned 30% of UB), agreed to buyout UB from then current owners
   <company id="102597">
    Cinven
   </company>
   (30%),
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   (25%), and MidOcean Partners (15%). The deal was completed in 2006, for a purchase price of more than £1.6 billion (about $3 billion), and resulted in a 50-50 ownership by PAI and Blackstone.
