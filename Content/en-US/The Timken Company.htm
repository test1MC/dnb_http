   The Timken Company keeps its bearings straight. The company makes bearings that find their way into products from consumer appliances to railroad cars. Timken also makes bearings, helicopter transmission systems, rotor-head assemblies, turbine engine components, gears, and housings for civil and military aircraft. Its customers include the makers of cars, light and heavy-duty trucks, railcars and locomotives, and heavy duty industrial vehicles as well as process customers in the energy, power transmission, and military markets. Timken traces its roots to its founding by carriage maker Henry Timken in 1899.

  <p>
   In 2014 Timken created and spun off
   <company id="163312">
    TimkenSteel
   </company>
   as an independent company. It earned about $853 million in its IPO.

  <p>
   Timken serves 30 countries through some 60 manufacturing facilities, 12 technology/engineering centers, and 23 distribution centers and warehouses worldwide. Almost 53% of its net sales come from the US.

  <p>
   Timken is divided into two market-based divisions. Mobile Industries (54% of net sales) targets manufacturers of cars, light and heavy-duty trucks, rail cars and locomotives, as well as construction, agricultural, and mining vehicles. Process Industries (46%) serves the energy, paper and saw mills, power transmission, and heavy machinery and equipment industries.

  <p>
   Timken has 90 sales offices and caters to the industrial equipment, construction, agriculture, rail, aerospace and defense, automotive, heavy truck, and oil and gas sectors.

  <p>
   Timken's revenues and profits have steeply declined the last four years. Revenues dropped by 7% from 2014 to 2015, mostly due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency rate changes and lower end-market demand. Timken also posted a net loss of $71 million in 2015, its first loss in about five years. This was the result of the decreased sales coupled with a surge in pension settlement charges.

  <p>
   The company has restructured over the years in order to focus solely on its Process Industries and Mobile Industries business segments and get its balance sheet out of the red. In 2014 Timken spun off its steel operations as
   <company id="163312">
    TimkenSteel
   </company>
   . It also sold its aerospace engine overhaul assets that year.

  <p>
   In 2015 Timken acquired Carlstar Belt for $213 million. Carlstar is a North American manufacturer of belts used in industrial, commercial, and consumer applications, based in Springfield, Missouri. The acquisition diversified Timken's portfolio beyond engineered bearings, bringing its customers an expanded offering of mechanical power transmission products and services.

  <p>
   Veteran St. Louis carriage maker Henry Timken patented a design in 1898 for tapered roller bearings (enclosed bearings between a pair of concentric rings). The following year Timken and his sons, William and Henry (H. H.) Timken, founded the Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company to make bearings for carriage axles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1902 the company moved to Canton, Ohio, to be near the growing steelworks of Pittsburgh and the new auto industries of Buffalo, New York; Cleveland; and Detroit. With the debut of the
   <company id="10597">
    Ford Motor
   </company>
   Model T in 1908, the Timkens' business soared. In 1909 Henry Timken died. That year a separate company, the Timken-Detroit Axle Company, was formed in Michigan to serve the auto industry. The original company changed its name to the Timken Roller Bearing Company and continued to produce bearings. Also in 1909 Vickers began making bearings and axles under license from Timken (Timken acquired that operation in 1959).
  </p>
  <p>
   Suffering steel shortages during WWI, the company began making its own steel in 1916. By the 1920s the rail industry had adopted Timken bearings to increase the speed of trains. Timken stock was sold to the public for the first time in 1922.
