   Federal Prison Industries (FPI), known by its trade name UNICOR, uses prisoners to make products and provide services, mainly for US government agencies. Nearly 12,278 inmates are employed in 80 FPI factories in prisons across the US. UNICOR, which is part of the

    Justice Department
   </company>
   's Bureau of Prisons, manufactures products such as office furniture, clothing, beds and linens, and electronics equipment. It also offers services, including data entry, bulk mailing, laundry services, recycling, and refurbishing of vehicle components.

  <p>
   FPI divides its operations across six business lines: Clothing and Textiles (38% of net sales), Electronics (28%), Office Furniture (21%), Agribusiness (1%), Recycling (4%), and Services (8%).

   Federal law mandates that government buyers consider UNICOR products before they consider competing products from the private sector. FPI's federal government customers include departments, agencies, and bureaus such as the

   The company's revenues jumped 21% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to surges in sales from its Electronics and Textiles business groups.

   UNICOR is self-supporting and is overseen by a governing board that is appointed by the President of the US. The mission of the FPI is to provide job training, job skills, and potential job opportunities to the inmates within the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Unlike most manufacturers these days that look to establish facilities in developing countries, UNICOR tries to leverage its low labor costs and actually looks for labor-intensive products to make.
  </p>
  <p>
   It expanded its operations in 2015 by acquiring two farm operations at El Reno, Oklahoma; and Lompoc, California. Its Agribusiness operations involve beef production as well as the production of dairy products.

  <p>
   FPI was established by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1934 to teach job skills at men's and women's federal prisons. During WWII, 95% of FPI's output was dedicated to the war effort -- the company's products included parachutes and munitions. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, FPI built or renovated structures at 18 of the 31 federal prisons. In 1974 it established regional sales offices, and in 1977 it took the name UNICOR.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although self-supporting, UNICOR remained necessarily inefficient because of its goal to put as many inmates as possible to work. However, as the prison population increased, the company underwent rapid expansion and added skilled services in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   UNICOR put its product catalog online in 1996. The next year the Senate authorized a study of ways to make UNICOR more competitive, after private businesses had complained that the booming prison population, low wages (23 cents to $1.15 per hour), and government preferential treatment gave UNICOR an unfair advantage. Legislation to force FPI to bid against the private sector for government contracts was brought before Congress in 1999; at the same time, a bill was introduced to allow the company to offer its products to the private sector. Meanwhile, FPI began selling services such as data entry to private-sector customers.

  <p>
   In 2003 Dell Computer dropped UNICOR as the vendor for its computer recycling program.
