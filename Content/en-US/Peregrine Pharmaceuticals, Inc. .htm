   Peregrine Pharmaceuticals is spreading its wings and taking flight to attack and kill its prey: cancer and viral infections. While nearly all its revenue comes from its Avid Bioservices subsidiary, which provides contract antibody and protein manufacturing to drug companies, Peregrine is focused on shepherding its own candidates through clinical trials. Up first is bavituximab, a monoclonal antibody candidate being tested to treat lung, pancreatic, and liver cancers, as well as for other oncology and infectious disease applications. Next is Cotara, being tested to treat glioblastoma multiforme, a deadly brain cancer. The company also has development programs for potential diagnostic imaging agents.

  <p>
   Peregrine conducts its research programs at facilities in the US, which accounts for nearly all revenue. Avid Bioservices serves customers primarily located in North America and Europe.

  <p>
   The company supports its development activities with revenues earned by Avid Bioservices subsidiary, which accounts for nearly all of Peregrine's revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also seeks out licensing and development partnerships to bring in additional funding for its research operations. For instance, it has licensed some of its development technologies to the likes of Affitech and

    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   . It also had a collaboration with the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   to develop antibodies to treat viral hemorrhagic fever infections that brought in revenues for several years until 2012, when the contract ended.

  <p>
   As a development-stage drug company, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals' revenues fluctuate each year, depending on how much the company earns from its licensing, development, and contract manufacturing agreements. Revenues increased by 42% in 2012 due to increased contract manufacturing activities at the Avid Biosciences unit. Like many pharmaceutical R&amp;D firms, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals has yet to turn a profit as its research expenses outweigh earnings. Its net loss for 2013 did decrease by 29% as R&amp;D expense dropped.

  <p>
   Peregrine is focused on the development of its two core drug candidates, with the ultimate goal of commercializing the drugs in the US and international markets. It als seeks to license the core technologies used in its candidates to additional partners. Bavituximab uses its PS-targeting (phosphatidylserine-targeting) technology, which works by turning off natural immune suppression, allowing the body to fight off infections with more vigor. Cotara uses Peregrine's TNT (tumor necrosis therapy), which uses radioisotopes to attack tumor cells without harming healthy tissue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once Peregrine's products gain regulatory approval, the company plans to market the drugs through collaborative partners or via a direct sales force.
