   Each year, Furman Foods farms more than 600 acres of its own land. Together, with its company-owned farms and those of its growers, 80% of its tomatoes are grown in Pennsylvania. Nearly half of these come from within 20 minutes of its processing facility. The rest of its tomatoes are grown within a four-hour truck drive to the plant, which allows Furman Foods to can them within hours of harvesting.
