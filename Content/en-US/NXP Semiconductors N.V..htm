   NXP Semiconductors has a full menu of chips to choose from. The one-time semiconductor unit of
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   is one of the largest chip makers in the world. Analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) from its huge product portfolio are used in everything from car radios and automotive networking systems to notebook computers and wireless base stations. The company also makes many types of general-purpose discrete semiconductors and logic devices. In addition to Philips, NXP's customers include

  <p>
   At $47 billion, the QUALCOMM offer for NXP is the biggest in the history of the chip business. QUALCOMM seeks to extend its portfolio from mobile phones to the growing automotive market as well as the internet of things, areas where NXP is strong. The boards of both companies have OKed the deal, but it could run into regulatory headwinds in Europe and the US.

   NXP added not just another arrow to its quiver, but another quiver of arrows to its product lineup with its $11 billion acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor in 2015. The combined company would make and sell semiconductor products for a range of applications from automotive (for operating vehicles and in-car infotainment systems) to mobile devices.
