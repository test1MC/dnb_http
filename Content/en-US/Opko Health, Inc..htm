   Opko Health may have started out in the US developing treatments for eye diseases, but it has expanded its geographic and therapeutic reach. In addition to research and development of ophthalmic drug candidates, the company is working on biopharmaceuticals for oncology, neurology, and infectious diseases. It has development programs for vaccines and molecular diagnostic tests, and operates clinical laboratories that provide testing services to the medical community. To support its research programs, Opko Health sells a number of prescription pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter products in Latin American countries.

  <p>
   Opko has been focused on diversifying its pharmaceutical operations across several countries. It now manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients in Israel and holds a significant stake in a private Israeli company that produces a third-generation hepatitis B vaccine (Sci-B-Vac). It is pursuing growth in emerging markets, including Chile and Mexico, where it has acquired manufacturing facilities and hopes to develop new vaccines in partnership with local research facilities. The company also has expanded into Europe both through product introductions and the acquisition of a Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.

  <p>
   Financially, Opko is able to offset some of the expense of drug development through its product sales. Products sales accounted for almost 100% of the $28 million it took in during 2011. However, its net loss that year was still $1.3 million simply because its research and development costs jumped to some $11.4 million.

  <p>
   Acquisitions of products, technology, and entire companies have helped Opko build up its range and reach into new areas including biotechnology, molecular diagnostics, and pharmaceutical distribution. Since 2009 the company has made about a dozen acquisitions, struck new partnerships, and established new commercial operations. Sales of non-core operations have helped offset some of the expense of its purchases.

  <p>
   One of its candidates in development is rolapitant for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced vomiting and nausea. It has also bought up technology to produce enzymes and proteins to help it develop new drugs. The company bought up a molecular diagnostic technology from the
   <company id="121820">
    University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
   </company>
   and used it as the basis for a blood test that is being developed to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. It is also working on diagnostic tests for Parkinson's disease and some cancers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 2012 Opko partnered with natural products company
   <company id="162414">
    ChromaDex
   </company>
   to commercialize its expanding pipeline of new ingredients, including its pTeroPureÂ® pterostilbene and its recently launched BluScience

   line of dietary supplements in Latin America. (Opko holds a $1 million investment in ChromaDex.)

  <p>
   In early 2013 it acquired Silcon Comercio, which expanded its diagnostic operations into Brazil. The purchase was part of Opko's efforts to grow in emerging markets. Later that year the company acquired PROLOR Biotech for some $480 million to expand its specialty operations. PROLOR is developing several longer-acting versions of existing medicines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Opko acquired
   <company id="45225">
    Bio-Reference Laboratories
   </company>
   , which provides clinical testing services to medical offices, hospitals, long-term care providers, clinics, and employers. The $1.47 billion deal was somewhat unique in that Bio-Reference was much larger than Opko at the time of the acquisition. It also makes Opko one of the nation's largest medical laboratory firms. (In a related deal, Opko purchased Prost-Data and its OURLabs unit in 2012.)

  <p>
   The firm, formerly named eXegenics, discontinued its former drug development operations in 2003 but revived itself in 2007 by merging with two privately held biotech companies: Froptix and Acuity Pharmaceuticals.
