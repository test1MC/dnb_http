   Transportation applications include sensors that measure air, fluids (oil, coolant, hydraulic, and brake), and temperature for passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks and buses, motorcycles, and for vehicles used in mining, construction, agriculture, rail, marine, and recreation. Sensors are used to ensure occupant comfort, vehicle safety, and filtration of particulate matter. Kavlico also launched a line of liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas pressure sensors for vehicles that use alternative fuels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial applications include irrigation control, pipeline monitoring, HVAC compressors, refrigeration pressure, power generation, and hydraulic systems for heavy equipment. Medical pressure sensors are used in respirators, ventilators, surgical equipment, and medical beds. The company also has a line of sealed stainless steel industrial pressure sensors for harsh environments, which utilizes Kavlico's oil-filled piezoresistive (a change in the electrical resistivity of a semiconductor or metal when mechanical strain is applied) sensing technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kavlico manufactures all-systems sensors and cockpit control devices for the aerospace and defense market. Products include thin-film force sensors for rudder controls, ailerons, and flight data recorders, as well as landing gear, speed brakes, thrust control, steering, and auto throttles. The sensors are used in commercial aviation, helicopters, spacecraft and missiles, fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, bombers and attack aircraft, and other special-purpose aircraft. Customers have included such big names as
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="99064">
