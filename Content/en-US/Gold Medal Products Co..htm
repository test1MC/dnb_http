  <p>
   The company has expanded its global presence and has experienced recent growth in Brazil, Russia, India, and China. It has been helped by developments like the explosion of worldwide movie theaters and customers enjoying new concession concepts. In 2012 it bought a 42,000-sq.-ft. building near its headquarters for $1.7 million to accommodate growth, especially from international sales.

   The company was founded as the Kings Ink Company in 1919. In 1931, under new ownership, the company broadened its ink-only line to include paste, glue, soft drink concentrates, cake flavors and coloring, eyeglass cleaners, window washing compounds, and other products. Food items began to be sold under the "Gold Medal Products" label.
