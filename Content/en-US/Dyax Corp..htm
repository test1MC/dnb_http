   Dyax has two ways to make a difference -- by developing its own drugs or by licensing its proprietary discovery technology to help others discover and develop drugs. The biopharmaceutical firm's phage display technology rapidly identifies proteins, peptides, and antibodies useful in treating disease. Its first commercial drug, Kalbitor, is approved in the US to treat hereditary angioedema (HAE, a condition causing tissue swelling) and enjoys orphan drug designation in patients 12 years of age and older. The firm is also investigating the drug for use in treating other types of angioedema and working to obtain regulatory approval for the drug in overseas markets. UK-based

    Shire
   </company>
   is buying Dyax for $5.9 billion.

  <p>
   Dyax developed Kalbitor (ecallantide) using its phage display technology, and is working to gain approval for the drug in international markets, as well as for additional indications. The company also has a second candidate (DX-2930) in development for the treatment of HAE, and it is developing diagnostic assays to identify HAE-related disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Dyax has focused its own development efforts on angioedema candidates, other drugmakers have developed an entire portfolio of candidates based upon its discovery technology. Its licensees have candidates in every stage of development (including
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   's FDA-approved CYRAMZA) with an emphasis on oncology, as well as non-core product areas such as diagnostic and research reagents. The company also develops certain candidates through partnerships; altogether Dyax has more than 70 revenue-generating licensees and partners.

  <p>
   Though it primarily operates in the US, Dyax has collaborative research operations in Australia, Japan, Europe, and other countries and regions.

  <p>
   Dyax's Kalbitor offering is marketed to hospitals and infusion service providers in the US through a team of about 25 direct sales representatives who target specialists such as allergists and immunologists. The product makes its way to customers via specialty pharmaceutical distributors who are accustomed to handling delicate biotech drugs, such as Walgreens Infusion Services (34% of revenues in 2014), US Bioservices (28%), and ASD Specialty; Dyax added several new specialty distributors in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company markets the product in Latin America through a collaboration with Novellus; in 2014 this agreement was amended to include Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and South Africa. Through a collaboration with CVie Therapeutics, Dyax markets Kalbitor in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.

  <p>
   Revenues for Dyax have fluctuated over the past five years. In 2014, revenue increased 52% to $82 million on higher Kalbitor sales (and prices); this was partially offset by lower licensing and development fees. Also that year, Dyax received royalty earnings based on the sales of Eli Lilly's CYRAMZA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even as it stretches to commercialize Kalbitor, Dyax is still a drug development company, which means its research and development expenses weigh heavily against any revenues. The company expects to continue to report net losses as it increases commercialization activities in coming years. In 2014 net loss decreased 57% to $12 million. As of the end of 2014, the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $545.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow decreased 46% to $9 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The company is working to increase sales of Kalbitor by increasing commercialization efforts and expanding its distribution network. It is working with international partners to gain approval for the drug in other markets. In 2013 the agreement between Dyax and Sigma-Tau to pursue commercialization in Europe, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand was terminated. However, the company entered into a separate agreement with CVie Therapeutics to commercialize Kalbitor; that collaboration was later amended to include Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Also in 2013, the company struck up a partnership with Novellus Biopharma to commercialize Kalbitor in Latin America; that agreement was amended the following year to include Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and South Africa. Dyax continues to aggressively pursue technology licensing agreements for its phage display assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move that should both help expand the distribution of Kalbitor and promote the development of pipeline candidate DX-2930, Dyax has agreed to be acquired by Shire, which already has HAE treatments Cinryze and Firazyr.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, licensee Eli Lilly received FDA approval for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel for the treatment of of second-line non-small cell lung cancer. It is also testing the candidate for other indications.
