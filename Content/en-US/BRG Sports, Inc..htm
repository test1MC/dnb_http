   BRG Sports (formerly Easton-Bell Sports) is a top maker of helmets and other sporting goods used by professional and recreational athletes alike. It caters to the football and hockey markets, as well as to cycling, snowsports, and powersports enthusiasts. Items are sold under its namesake Bell, Riddell, and Giro names, among others. It also owns the licensing rights for the MacGregor golf brand. BRG's products are sold through national chain stores the likes of

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and to local retailers. The former Easton-Bell Sports was created by the 2006 merger of Riddell Bell and Easton Sports. The company changed its name in 2014 when it sold the Easton business to

  <p>
   Based in Van Nuys, California, BRG operates through two business segments: Team Sports and Action Sports. Team Sports is the larger operation, generating 58% of revenue in 2013, and accounted for sales of football, ice hockey, baseball, and softball products, as well as reconditioning services and licensing. The exited Easton business was part of this segment. The Action Sports unit, which brought in 42% of 2013 revenue, focuses on making cycling, snowsports, powersports, and fitness products, such as helmets, wireless audio gear, cycling components (read: handlebars and wheels), and accessories for yoga and pilates.

  <p>
   Each BRG business unit extends its reach worldwide. Besides the US, the company boasts manufacturing, assembly, and distribution facilities in Canada, Mexico, Sweden, China, and Taiwan. BRG also sources goods from third parties. A third party distributor in Tennessee provides apparel, in the UK one provides Bell mass products, and in France another distributor supplies products for the Bell and Giro lines. It's building a new distribution, assembly, and shared services center in Rantoul, Illinois, which was completed in late 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   It generated 86% of its revenue in North America in 2013, 11% in Europe, and 4% elsewhere. Its reconditioning services are performed in the US, Canada, and Mexico.

  <p>
   Today BRG holds the #1 spot in its sports markets for the Riddell, Bell, Giro, and Blackburn brands. Indeed, Riddell has been the official helmet of the
   <company id="40330">
    NFL
   </company>
   since 1989 and will remain so at least through 2014; it is also the official helmet and protective gear provider of USA Football and American Youth Football, which together have more than 3 million youth participants.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of acquisitions and consolidations in its industry, BRG has identified two basic strategies that are used by those who supply the industry. While others compete on price through mass merchants and big-name sporting goods chains, BRG has stuck to focusing on making products that tap the latest sports equipment technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former majority investor Fenway Partners had intended to sell off its entire Easton-Bell Sports holding in 2014. The firm's efforts were stalled, unfortunately, from liabilities associated with gridiron concussions, as its Riddell-brand helmets are worn by a majority of NFL players. Fenway Partners later changed its strategy and generated solid interest in selling the company's growing Easton baseball and softball helmet and bat business. Publicly traded Bauer Performance Sports picked up the Easton business for $330 million in early 2014.

  <p>
   BRG has logged revenue declines for the past two years. Revenue dropped slightly -- 1% -- in fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 due to declining net sales within its Action Sports segment and the reporting period's unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate. In fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 revenue slipped another 6%, contributed by declines across both of the company's segments. Lower sales of its Easton hockey products (from market share loss and inflated retail inventories mostly within the stick category) conspired against BRG, which posted a 6% decrease in its larger Team Sports segment. Within its other Action Sports segment, BRG logged 6% in revenue declines, thanks to lower sales of cycling helmets and accessories in the specialty and mass channels, fewer sales of Easton cycling products stemming from quality issues, and the company's choice to exit low-margin, non-core fitness products.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the fiscal 2013 reporting period, BRG posted a $15.2 million loss due to decreasing revenue and increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A multi-channel marketer, BRG sells its products through specialty retailers, national and regional full-line sporting goods retailers and distributors, mass merchandisers, educational institutions, and athletic leagues. The company also relied on its top 10 customers for about 32% of its 2013 revenue. Wal-Mart accounts for about 13% of net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   BRG uses separate sales forces and a variety of distribution channels for its product segments. This allows the company to design specific marketing strategies for each brand and product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising costs for the company have run $5,580 for 2013, $5,759 for 2012, and $5,846 for 2011. Besides seeking media exposure, BRG taps several media outlets to get its brands in front of customers, such as industry periodicals, magazines, newspapers, television, and Internet media. It leverages coaches clinics and equipment shows throughout the year to display its product lines and promote them along with the company's reconditioning services.

  <p>
   The company traces its roots to the Los Angeles suburb of Bell, a hotbed of auto racing, and Roy Richter, a racer who operated Bell Auto Parts. Richter began making racing helmets in 1954 and became a leading maker of motorcycle and ski helmets during the 1960s. In 1975 Bell Helmets introduced the Bell Biker, the first hard-shell bicycle helmet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Phil Matthews, a former executive with
   <company id="111429">
    Wilson Sporting Goods
   </company>
   , and Terry Lee, an executive with bankrupt motorcycle accessory maker Vetter Products, purchased Bell Helmets with several partners in 1983 (the group merged Vetter and Bell). Motorcycle helmet sales slowed, but sales of bicycle helmets (including lines for infants and children) propelled the company during the 1980s. Bell Helmets began selling products in Europe in 1988, and in 1991 it sold its motorcycle helmet business to Italian manufacturer Bieffe for $15 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1992 as Bell Sports and began benefiting from new state laws requiring children to wear helmets while bicycling. Also that year it acquired Blackburn, a maker of pumps, racks, packs, and accessories, but by 1995 competition began cutting into sales and profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   To protect its market share, in 1995 the company acquired American Recreation, the nation's #2 helmet maker. To reduce debt Bell sold its Mongoose bicycle unit in 1997 for $22 million. Investment firms Charlesbank Capital Partners and Brentwood Associates Buyout Fund II took the firm private the next year and installed Mary George as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Bell narrowed its focus, selling its auto-racing helmet business and closing or selling all but one of its factories. Investment firm Chartwell bought Bell in 2000, and moved Mary George to executive chairman. Bell moved its headquarters in 2001 to Irving, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company broadened its product offerings when it bought
   <company id="16653">
    Bollinger Industries'
   </company>
   fitness accessory product line in 2002; products range from yoga mats to jump ropes and weightlifting belts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fenway Partners acquired Bell Sports for $240 million in September 2004. Fenway combined the company with its Riddell Sports Group (football helmets) to form Riddell Bell Holdings. Under this umbrella Fenway created one of the top global suppliers of helmets. Bell Sports and Riddell were once a combined company when William Zimmerman (then president of Zimmerman Holdings) and James Marshall Galbraith purchased Bell Helmets and Riddell to form Bell-Riddell. The companies were sold separately in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2004 Riddell Bell purchased Sports Instruments, an athletic performance technology company. Sports Instruments' products, which include heart rate monitors and sports watches, were absorbed into Riddell Bell's specialty retail division. In January 2005 the company purchased auto racing helmets maker Bell Racing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Easton-Bell Sports was formed in 2006 when Easton Sports and Riddell Bell Holdings merged their operations. Tony Palma, Easton's former chief executive, took over as CEO upon completion of the deal. He held that position until March 2008, when he departed the firm. Bill Fry, Riddell Bell's top executive, was named EBS's president. Fry left the company in early 2007, following the merger transition. Palma was replaced by former
