   Fluke's products are really hip (pocket-sized, that is). Fluke, a subsidiary of
   <company id="10434">
    Danaher
   </company>
   (maker of Craftsman tools), makes handheld electronic test tools used by electricians, HVAC technicians, and engineers to install, maintain, and service electrical and electronic equipment. Its multimeters, oscilloscopes, and other devices measure current, voltage resistance, frequency, pressure, temperature, and air quality. It also makes calibrators and calibration software, waveform generators, and power harmonics meters. Its Fluke Biomedical unit makes patient simulators, diagnostic imaging, and radiation safety products, among others. Fluke has production facilities in the US, the UK, Asia, and the Netherlands.

   Companies owned by Fluke include Comark (thermometers, pressure, and humidity meters), Datapaq (temperature measurement for hostile thermal environments), DH Instruments (pressure and gas flow instruments), Fluke Networks (network testing of copper, fiber, and wireless networks), Hart Scientific (thermometers and temperature calibration), Ircon (industrial temperature measurement), and Raytek (thermometers and thermal imagers).

   Fluke continues to grow by expanding applications for its tools and by acquiring companies and complementary product lines. In 2012 Fluke acquired TTL Technologies, a distributor that has represented Fluke in India since 2001. Fluke also purchased test tool manufacturer Martel Electronics Corp. in 2012 and bolstered its calibration product group.
