   Life without salt would not only be bland but slippery; thankfully, Morton Salt produces the grains in bulk and in shaker. It's the #1 consumer salt maker in the US, marketed to industrial and retail customers under a big umbrella held by a girl in a yellow dress logo. In addition to household grocery staples (table, kosher, and canning salt), Morton makes consumer and professional salt for controlling ice on roads, conditioning water, as well as salt for the food service and food-manufacturing industries. The company extends its reach through Canadian Salt Company's Windsor brand. Founded in 1848, Morton, owned by German commodities giant
