   Doubling profits would turn some non-union heads at Deublin, a leading manufacturer of rotating unions (a specialty mechanical device that allows the transmission of pressurized fluid from a stationary source into rotating machinery for heating, cooling, or the transfer of fluid power). Rotating unions are used in equipment such as air clutches, gearboxes, machine tool spindles, and rubber and plastic manufacturing machinery. The company also makes turbulence bars, siphons, and steam joints, which are sold to the automotive, machine tool, and printing industries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has about 20 subsidiaries in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the US.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's product offerings include more than 500 standard rotary unions, 3,000 separate models, and more than 6,000 components to support their use.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its steam joint and siphon technology, Deublin offers services for steam systems and dryer section optimization. Dryer sections consume the most steam energy in a paper machine; their efficiency is most important to the financial cost of the process. Deublin offers services to design and install machinery, conduct diagnostics, supply equipment, and train operators.

  <p>
   The company serves a range of industries including machine tools, printing, plastics, tire and rubber, steel manufacturing, oil and gas exploration, paper and corrugating equipment, wind turbines, and mining.
  </p>
  <p>
   It makes products for air clutches, gear boxes, machine tool spindles, textile equipment, rubber and plastic manufacturing machinery, steel continuous casting machines, paper machine calendar stacks, and paper machine dryer cans and sells them through authorized distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deublin operates sales offices in Canada, Sweden, and the US.

  <p>
   Growing its product portfolio and distribution network, in 2012 Deublin acquired Cary, Illinois-based Barco Seals, which develops swivels and ball joints for the railroad industry. Following the acquisition, in 2013, Deublin began to offer Plane Swivel Joints that provide 360ÌŠ movement between piping elements in one or more planes for conveying a wide range of fluids.

  <p>
   Luke Deubler and Dick Linn founded the company in 1945. The name "Deublin" is a combination of the founders' surnames.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deublin did not invent the rotating union, but introduced a mechanical seal to the union design that quickly made Deublin's rotating union products popular in the printing industry, and subsequently in a range of other manufacturing segments.
