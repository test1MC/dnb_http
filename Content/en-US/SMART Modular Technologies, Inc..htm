   In 2011 the company was taken private by equity investors Silver Lake Partners and Silver Lake Sumeru in a deal valued at around $645 million. The move allowed it shed the regulatory and market burdens of a public company to better navigate the notoriously cyclical DRAM industry.

  <p>
   Outside of the US, SMART has manufacturing facilities in the Brazil and Malaysia, an engineering facility in Seoul, South Korea, and a distribution office in Scotland. The company expanded its operations in Asia with a research and development facility for advanced memory design in Taiwan. The company largely serves the Americas region, with Brazil and the US accounting for the majority of its sales.

   SMART maintains relationships with top global semiconductor companies and often works with them in bidding for design-in projects. Meanwhile, the company's partnerships with suppliers gives SMART help it to procure materials, even during industry shortages.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added DDR4 modules to its Enterprise Memory line in 2015. The DDR4 builds on SMART's experiences with it its DDR3 RDIMM Enterprise Memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company inserted a 24GB CoolFlex RDIMM to its product lineup. The 24GB DDR3-1333 1.35V RDIMM helps solve unique memory capacity constraints in servers. SMART's CoolFlex module product family uses flexible substrate technology to increase system memory capacity, and by combining CoolFlex and DDR3 technologies, SMART Modular can offer OEMs a product that bests standard PCB options in terms of providing superior signal integrity performance.

   after the company ignored his urging that it enter the memory module market, founded SMART in 1988 with the help of his wife, Lata Krishnan, and Mukesh Patel. The company began by making surface-mounted single in-line memory modules, which topped the performance of standard memory chips. SMART moved into the specialty and PC card memory markets in 1991; two years later it unveiled a line of PC card communications devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1995. The purchase of Apex Data (1995) extended its PC card expertise in mobile computing, connectivity, and data storage. The acquisition of RISQ Modular Systems (1996) increased SMART's presence in the industrial control, networking, and telecommunications markets, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
   More complex programs and speedier microprocessors continue to bolster demand for SMART modules. In 1997, ducking the industry trend toward cheaper manufacturing in Asia, SMART opened a plant in Scotland to stay close to its European customers. The company shut down its Scottish plant and a plant in Massachusetts as part of a corporate restructuring in 2003. Hedging its geographic bets, SMART opened a plant in Malaysia in 1998. The following year the company acquired Compaq Computer's embedded products business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999, SMART was acquired by
   <company id="14296">
    Solectron
   </company>
   , one of the world's largest providers of contract manufacturing services for OEMs, in a deal valued at about $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   SMART operated as a Solectron subsidiary until 2004, when the company was acquired by an investor group led by
   <company id="128276">
    Francisco Partners Management
   </company>
   and Texas Pacific Group (now
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   ). Co-founders Ajay Shah and Mukesh Patel joined the board of the newly independent company. SMART filed for a new IPO in 2005 and completed the offering in early 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 SMART paid $20 million to buy
   <company id="130125">
    Adtron
   </company>
   , a maker of solid-state flash drives (SSDs), in order to diversify its product offerings beyond DRAMs. Adtron was later integrated into the company.
