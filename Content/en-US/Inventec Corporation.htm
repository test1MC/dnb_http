   Just 3% of Inventec's revenue comes from its solar energy systems with the rest generated by its information technology manufacturing and services operations. The company runs some of its operations through subsidiaries: Inventec Appliances Corp, which designs and manufactures smart phones and related devices; Tnitek AIO, which designs and manufactures computers; Inventec Solar, which makes solar batteries and modules; and E-TON, which makes solar batteries.

   Inventec has felt the impact on the slowdown in notebook sales around the world. In 2015 the company's revenue dipped 9% and its net income dropped 37%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The overall deflation of the notebook market was not helped by the introduction of the Windows 10 operating system and notebook-related revenue fell 25% in 2015 from 2014. Server products, driven by the adoption of cloud computing, posted a 25% revenue increase in 2015 while mobile products managed to stay even with 2014 figures. Solar products revenue rose about 15% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The slide in profit was attributed to the lower computer-related revenue. Cash flow from operations, however, was higher in 2015 than 2014 due to adjustments to the product mix and improvements in cost structure.

  <p>
   Diversification is in Inventec's plan for dealing with declining PC and notebook sales. The company is moving into servers that run data centers, and the software that runs them. Over time, the company has moved into making higher end products as it has develop manufacturing expertise and because of higher margins. In that vein, the company is making higher-end servers, where margins are higher than the cost-driven servers at the lower end of the market. In making smartphones and other mobile devices, Inventec is increasing automation of production as a cost-reducing measure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is expanding geographically. It is adding to facilities in Mexico and the Czech Republic to handle increases in server product and in India for making smart terminals. Responding to an immediate demand, Inventec has increased production capacity at a plant in China to make Xiaomi's popular Mi 5 phone. Inventec is considering building a factory in Indonesia to serve that market.
