   This Boler wants the big wheels of the road to ride smoothly in their own lanes. The holding company's main subsidiary Hendrickson makes suspension systems for heavy and medium-duty trucks, buses, and RVs. A trailer division focuses on air ride suspensions. Auxiliary axle systems and controls are made for heavy-duty trucks and trailers. A stamping division supplies bumpers and components; its spring division makes heavy-duty steel flat-leaf and parabolic taper-leaf springs. Boler sells to heavy-duty truck and trailer OEMs in the US, with distribution to countries in Latin America and Europe as well as Australia and Japan. Boler is led by founder and chairman John Boler and his son, president and CEO Matthew.

  <p>
   The Boler Company started out by manufacturing leaf springs and metal bumpers, but in 1978, it purchased Hendrickson, whose history dates back to 1913. Magnus Hendrickson founded The Hendrickson Motor Truck Company in Chicago, where he built trucks initially.
