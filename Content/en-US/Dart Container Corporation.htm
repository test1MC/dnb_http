   Dart Container is a world cup winner -- not in soccer, but in foam cups and containers. The company commands about half of the global market in foam cups in addition to the iconic
   <company id="59812">

   </company>
   . Its foodservice products, which include lids, containers, dinnerware, plastic cups, and cutlery, are sold to hospitals, schools, restaurants, and retailers. To make its products, family-owned Dart touts a secret molding method for expandable polystyrene. It also builds its own molding machinery and uses Dart trucks to deliver products from more than 40 plants in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   As part of its business, Dart operates several subsidiaries, including Dart Products Limited, Dart Canada. Dart Sudamericana, Brasbar Embalagens Do Brasil Ltd., Dart Cup Ltd., Dart de Mexico, and Phoenix Manufacturing Services Pty. Ltd. The company operates more than 40 manufacturing plants worldwide in the US, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the UK. Dart expanded its Mason, Michigan, headquarters as well as a warehouse in Plant City, Florida.

  <p>
   Based in Michigan, Dart operates its business across the US in several states, such as Mississippi, California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, Washington, and Kentucky. Its business also reaches to Canada, Mexico, the UK, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil.

  <p>
   Dart's prime customers are the distributors and retailers, sell the cups and containers to restaurants, stores, and consumers. The company's foodservice products are generally sold through a distributor network, whereas retail and consumer products are sold through retailers.

  <p>
   One of the reasons Dart's a leader in its industry is because it operates autonomously. The company makes its own equipment, produces the raw materials it needs, converts the materials to finished products, and then delivers the products globally. It even has printing capabilities for which it makes its own ink. The company also makes clear plastic containers that are used in delis and take-out restaurants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of the disposable nature of its products, Dart makes its environmental efforts a key part of its practice and message. Several cities have proposed bans on the use of foam cups and containers. To counter such moves, Dart has partnered with other companies and municipalities to build and operate recycling centers. It has about 100 of these foam recycling drop-off locations spread across the US to provide an option for residents, businesses, and organizations to recycle foam plastics, which are labeled with a No. 6 chasing arrows symbol.
  </p>
  <p>
   The king of cups is also shaped by its history of secrecy. The Darts never patented the cup-making machine they developed. This allowed them to avoid revealing how it works. Most of the company's factory workers have never seen the machines, and Dart's salespeople are not allowed inside the plants.

  <p>
   William F. Dart founded a Michigan firm to make steel tape measures in 1937. Dart's son William A. started experimenting with plastics in 1953, and in the late 1950s the two devised a cheap way to mold expandable polystyrene and built a cup-making machine. Dart Container was incorporated in Mason, Michigan, in 1960 and shipped its first cups that year. By the late 1960s the rising demand for plastic-foam products sparked an increase in R&amp;D. In 1970 the company built a plant in Corona, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was a family feud in the making in 1974, as William F. divided the business among his grandsons -- Tom, Ken, and Robert -- in separate trusts that named William A. trustee for all. Tom branched out in 1975 and founded oil and gas company Dart Energy, which was later absorbed into Dart Container. William F. died the next year. Following the oil market crash of the early 1980s, Tom went through a sticky divorce and admitted to cocaine abuse. His father temporarily removed him as head of Dart Energy in 1982, and the next year the entire family underwent group psychiatric counseling.
  </p>
  <p>
   The family reorganized its assets in 1986, giving Ken and Robert the cup business and Tom the energy business plus $58 million in cash. In 1987 Ken began to swell the family fortune with a series of successful investments. Better tax rates motivated Dart family members to move to Sarasota, Florida, in 1989. They set up shop in an unmarked building behind a sporting-goods store. By the late 1980s Dart Container commanded more than 50% of the worldwide market for foam cups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ken bought 11% of the
   <company id="13944">
    Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   </company>
   (Freddie Mac) in 1991, as well as portions of Salomon and Brazil's foreign debt. According to Tom, that year Ken also financed brain research in hopes of finding a way to keep his brain alive after the death of his body in an attempt to avoid future estate taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tom sued his brothers and father in 1992 for allegedly cheating him out of millions in trust money in the 1986 reorganization. Ken turned a $300 million investment into $1 billion by selling the Freddie Mac shares. The next year he and Robert renounced their US citizenship to avoid paying taxes. Ken also made a failed attempt to block the restructuring of Brazil's debt (of which Dart owned 4%). That year Ken's new $1 million Sarasota home was firebombed (the case remains unsolved), and Robert moved to Britain, where he soon filed for divorce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ken began hiring bodyguards, and he moved his family to the Cayman Islands in 1994. In 1995 Tom was fired from Dart Energy, and Ken tried -- and failed -- to return to the US as a diplomat of Belize. In 1996 Tom accused Judge Donald Owens of being biased in favor of William A. The judge succumbed to the pressure in 1997 and removed himself from the proceedings, only to be ordered back on the case by Michigan's Court of Appeals. The lawsuit was settled in 1998 before going to trial, but the terms were kept secret. The following year saw yet another series of lawsuits for the container company. In 1999 Dart Container filed an appeal to an
   <company id="150643">
    IRS
   </company>
   demand to pay $31 million in back taxes from 1994 and late penalties. The legal wrangling continued through 2001, but in 2002 the company agreed to pay $26 million to settle the issue.
  </p>
  <p>
   A slight shift in its operational practices occurred in 2005 when employees at the company's unionized Corona, California, plant voted to end its union contract. The move came as a result of management-style changes that valued worker input more than in the past. Also, in an effort to support operations at the Corona facility, Dart opened a new facility in Tijuana, Mexico, in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began offering custom-graphic printing on its hot beverage cups under the Fusion brand name in 2008. Struck by the economic downturn, Dart tightened its operations in early 2009 by laying off about 6% of its Mason, Michigan, workforce; the shrink was Dart's first since 2002. The hard choice was preceded by the company's almost $40 million investment to revamp two of its Pennsylvania warehouses and a manufacturing plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   After surviving the recession, Dart embarked upon its biggest transaction to date: In May 2012, the company acquired long-time rival
   <company id="59812">
    Solo Cup
   </company>
   in a milestone deal valued at $1 billion.
