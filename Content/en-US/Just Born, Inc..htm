   Just Born gave birth to marshmallow treats for all occasions. The company makes the popular Easter candy sold under the name Marshmallow Peeps, as well as Peeps Minis, a new year-round treat that's bite-sized. These once-strictly-seasonal candy versions of little chickettes and bunnies come in a variety of colors and flavors. Moviegoers will recognize the company's Hot Tamales and Mike and Ike brands. Other candy treats produced by the company include Just Born Jelly Beans, Teenee Beanee Gourmet jelly beans, and Peanut Chews. Sam Born founded the company in 1923. The family-owned and -operated company is run by co-CEOs Ross Born (Sam Born's grandson) and David Shaffer (Sam's nephew).

  <p>
   Pennsylvania-based Just Born sells its candy and other items to consumers in more than 45 countries. The company makes its products with international-specific packaging for countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific (Korea), the Middle East (Israel), Europe, and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's retail stores are located in the Mall of America, Minnesota; National Harbor, Maryland; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

  <p>
   As part of its business, Just Born has manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania in the cities of Bethlehem and Philadelphia. Its more than 600,000-sq.-ft. warehouse in Bethlehem has become the central storage and distribution point for all Just Born products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its retail stores are located in National Harbor, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes more than 1 billion Peeps a year (enough to circle the earth twice, according to the company). Just Born makes Peeps in shapes of snowmen, trees, and stars for winter holidays; cats, ghosts, and pumpkins for Halloween; and hearts for Valentine's Day. (Peeps are occasionally offered out of season at the company's online store.) Sugar-free versions of its little critters are available, as well.

  <p>
   Just Born sells its food products through retailers and online.
  </p>
  <p>
   It launched its first television ad campaign during a holiday season in 2013 with Santa Hop to remind consumers that the company makes Peeps outside the popular Easter holiday time frame.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the first time in company history, Just Born in 2014 entered the everyday candy aisle when it launched its Peeps Minis chick-shaped confections in multiple favors. It marketed the debut with TV commercials that spotlight a woman celebrating inspired seasons, such as Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day, with Peeps, because "Every day is a holiday."

  <p>
   The company is concentrating on extending the reach of its market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Just Born teamed up with
   <company id="106025">
    Universal Pictures
   </company>
   and Illumination Entertainment. Through this partnership, Just Born created innovation and extensions of product lines within the existing PEEPS and MIKE AND IKE brand families that mimic the dynamic Minions characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to leverage the fun and quirky vibe of Peeps and extend the product outside the confines of seasonal sales, Just Born in 2014 rolled out Peeps Minis, which are available year-round on retailers' candy -- rather than the seasonal -- aisle.
  </p>

  <p>
   Operating under the Peeps &amp; Company banner, Just Born's small network of stores has grown prudently. The candy company's first store opened at National Harbor, Maryland, in 2009. Its Mall of America store opened its doors in 2011, representing the second retail location for Just Born. Just Born's third store, which debuted in 2012, is located next to the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, at The Shoppes Sands.

  <p>
   Russian immigrant Sam Born started the company with a single candy store in New York; the business moved to Pennsylvania (also the home state of candy giant

   ) in 1923.
