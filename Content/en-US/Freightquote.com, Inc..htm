   Freightquote organizes its freight solutions in categories that meet customer's different needs, including truckload (TL), less than truckload (LTL freight), expedited LTL, or intermodal (shipping by rail).

   To accommodate the company's recent growth, Freightquote is moving its corporate headquarters to a larger facility in Kansas City, Missouri. The new building will be 200,000 square feet and is set to open in 2013. The move is a response to increased demand.
