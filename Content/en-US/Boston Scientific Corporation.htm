   Boston Scientific makes medical supplies and devices used to diagnose and treat conditions in a variety of medical fields, with an emphasis on cardiovascular products and cardiac rhythm management (CRM). It also makes devices used for electrophysiology, endoscopy, pain management (neuromodulation), urology, and women's health. Its 13,000 products -- made in about a dozen factories worldwide -- include biopsy forceps, catheters, coronary and urethral stents, defibrillators, needles, and pacemakers. Boston Scientific markets its products in more than 115 countries.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Boston Scientific's largest segments make cardiovascular and cardiac rhythm products: The interventional cardiology products (coronary stents, catheters, guidewires) segment generates about 30% of annual revenues, while peripheral intervention products (non-coronary vascular stents) bring in 10% of sales. The CRM business (pacemakers and implanted coronary defibrillators or ICDs) accounts for more than 25% of the company's sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boston Scientific's other product segments account for about 30% of sales, with endoscopy bringing in some 20%, followed by the urology and pelvic health, neuromodulation, and electrophysiology divisions.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company operates in 40 countries and markets its products in 115 nations.
  </p>
        <p>
   While the US is still Boston Scientific's largest single market, international sales have grown to make up about 60% of total sales. Boston Scientific has six manufacturing plants outside the US (three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica, and one in Puerto Rico). Other international facilities include physician training centers in France, South Africa, Turkey, China, and Japan, and research operations in Ireland, India, and China.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities, and medical offices are the company's key customers, and in the US large group purchasing organizations (GPOs), hospital networks, and other buying groups acting on behalf of their customers make up a significant portion of its sales. During 2015, the company marketed its products to some 30,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities, and medical offices around the world.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boston Scientific markets products through direct, disease-focused sales forces in the US and about 40 other major international markets; it also uses dealers and distributors in certain countries. Some products are marketed through partnerships; for instance, Boston Scientific distributes urology laser systems made by Lumenis through a development and commercialization agreement.

        <p>
   Market challenges including economic conditions, competitive pressures, and product safety issues took a toll on Boston Scientific's revenues in recent years. Sales were also impacted by asset divestitures, and the company saw revenue declines until 2013. However, in 2014 and 2015, Boston Scientific saw marginal growth of 3% and 1% (to $7.5 billion), respectively.
  </p>
        <p>
   Growth in 2015 was driven by increases in the urology and pelvic health segment -- partially due to that year's acquisition of American Medical Systems' urology portfolio, as well as increases across the rest of the segment's franchises. The peripheral interventions and neuromodulation segments each saw 6% growth in 2015, while electrophysiology grew 3%. However, these gains were partially offset by declines in interventional cardiology, cardiac rhythm management, and endoscopy (which saw higher sales but were impacted by currency exchange rates).
  </p>
        <p>
   Profits have fluctuated over the past few years. The company reported a net loss of a whopping $4 billion in 2012 due to increased expenses -- primarily caused by a $3.6 billion goodwill impairment charge on the decreased value of its operations in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) markets -- as well as due to lower revenues. The company also revised the value of its US CRM business by some $748 million that year. In 2013 it recovered slightly as goodwill impairment charges eased. It reported a net loss of $121 million. The company reported another modest recovery in 2014, when it lost $119 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, net loss doubled in 2015 to $239 million. This was due to a number of factors including contingent consideration expenses related to liabilities that year, increases in litigation-related charges surrounding transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases, and higher interest expenses.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations has also been fluctuating over the past few years. It fell 53% to $600 million in 2015 due to cash used in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

        <p>
   The company is focused on growth measures that drive innovation in core markets, expansion of its global commercial presence, and diversification into additional areas of disease. Its strategies include acquisitions, research and development partnerships, and internal development efforts. Boston Scientific spends about 11% of its net sales (about $876 million in 2015) on R&amp;D each year and strives to lead the market for minimally invasive medical devices that address unmet patient needs. Product launches in 2015 included the Enblem S-ICD for the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest, the LithoVue Single-Use Digital Flexible Ureteroscope, and the SpyGlass DS Direct Visualization System.
  </p>
        <p>
   The following year, the company launched the AXiOS Stent and Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System for drainage of pancreatic pseudo cysts. Other new products that year included the Precision Montage MRI Spinal Cord Stimulator System and two new catheters (IntellaNav XP and Intella Nav MiFi XP) for use with the Rhythmia Mapping System. The company additionally received

   approval for its ImageReady MR-Conditional Pacing System and its Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boston Scientific also looks to expand geographically and is working to build an infrastructure to support growth in such emerging markets as China, India, and Brazil. In 2015, it entered a partnership with Frankenman Medical Equipment to develop, manufacture, and market products in China. It also opened Institutes for Advancing Science in Turkey, China, and South Africa, and established a new R&amp;D center in India that will focus on developing products for emerging markets.

   ' urology portfolio, which includes its men's health and prostate health businesses, for $1.6 billion. The acquired businesses, which generated some $400 million in sales in 2014, became part of Boston Scientific's urology and pelvic health division, strengthening its position in the urology device market.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a separate deal,Boston Scientific acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of Texas-based CeloNova Biosciences for $70 million plus additional milestone payments. The deal included CeloNova's Embozene and Oncozene  drug-eluting microspheres (small particles that slow or stop the blood supply to growths or tumors).

        <p>
   The company has purchased a number of smaller businesses in the past few years, expanding product offerings in areas including electrophysiology mapping and ablation systems, as well as coronary occlusion catheter systems. </p>
        <p>In 2017 Boston Scientific agreed to buy Symetis for $435 million. Symetis, based in Switzerland, makes heart valve devices for severe cardiac valve conditions. The deal expands Boston Scientific's heart valve product line with a complementary portfolio and extends its reach in Europe. Symetis has manufacturing operations in Switzerland and Brazil.</p>
        <p>In 2014 it bought the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million, expanding its portfolio of treatments for challenging vascular conditions. That year it also bought the remaining 72% stake in pre-commercial stage company IoGyn it didn't already own.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 Boston Scientific bought Endo International's American Medical Systems urology portfolio for $1.6 billion plus an additional funds based on 2016 sales. That deal brought in a portfolio of products for treating conditions including benign prostatic hyperplasia, male stress urinary incontinence, and erectile disfunction.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also acquired medical device firm Xlumena for $63 million; Xlumena makes minimally invasive devices for endoscopic ultrasound procedures. Boston Scientific additionally bought a 27% stake in Preventice, which makes mobile health solutions, thereby strengthening its cardiac monitoring portfolio. And it bought a 25% stake in Frankenman Medical Equipment in China.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2016 Boston Scientific acquired EndoChoice Holdings, which focuses on developing infection control products and single-use devices for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions, for $210 million.

        <p>
   Many medical companies start near a hospital, but Boston Scientific's roots sprouted at a children's soccer game where two dads found common ground. John Abele and Peter Nicholas had complementary interests: Wharton MBA Nichols wanted to run his own company; philosophy and physics graduate Abele wanted a job that would help people.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1979 the two men founded Boston Scientific to buy medical device maker Medi-Tech. Abele and Nicholas had to borrow half a million dollars from a bank and raise an additional $300,000. Medi-Tech's primary product was a steerable catheter, a soft-tipped device that could be maneuvered within the body. The catheter revolutionized gallstone operations in the early 1970s, and Boston Scientific expanded on the success of the product. The company adapted it for a slew of new procedures for the heart, lungs, intestines, and other organs.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boston Scientific's sales were healthy in 1983, but the firm still lacked funds. It eagerly accepted $21 million from
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   in exchange for a 20% stake. New FDA regulations slowed product introduction and put a crimp in the company's growth. Boston Scientific found a legal loophole in the late 1980s to avoid lengthy delays: The company described its products in the vaguest possible terms so upgraded devices were considered similar enough to predecessors to escape the in-depth scrutiny of the new approval process. Still, Abele and Nicholas had to mortgage their personal properties to stay afloat before this linguistic legerdemain helped to clear government red tape. Boston Scientific returned to profitability in 1991 and went public the next year, buying back Abbott Laboratories' interest in the company as well.
  </p>
        <p>
   Boston Scientific acquired a bevy of medical device companies throughout the late 1990's which expanded its range of cardiology products and doubled sales. Among them were SCIMED Life Systems, Heart Technology, Meadox Medicals, EP Technologies and Symbiosis, Target Therapeutics, and
