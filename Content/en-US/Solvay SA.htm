   Solvay produces and sells chemicals, advanced plastics and lightweight materials. End markets for its products are diverse and include automotive, aerospace, consumer goods, electronics, energy and the environment. Solvay operates some 145 plants in 53 countries, and has major operations in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as a smaller operation in Latin America. The Solvay process, a method of producing sodium carbonate, or soda ash, is named after company founder Ernest Solvay, who invented it in the 1860s. The compound remains a core product and still brings in €1.5 billion a year.

  <p>
   The company operates four main segments: Advanced Materials, Advanced Formulations, Performance Chemicals and Functional Polymers. Materials and Chemicals bring in around 30% of revenue each, with Formulations at 25% and Polymers 15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal-replacement high-performance polymers is the Advanced Materials segment's biggest product, in which it ranks first globally. Customers include Boeing, and Solvay's products were used in the experimental solar-powered Solar Impulse aircraft, which made headlines in 2016 after it circumnavigated the world on solar power alone. Performance Chemicals is the world's largest producer of soda ash (sodium carbonate) and hydrogen peroxide, and also deals in cellulose acetate tow, which is used in cigarette filters. Formulations' outputs include surfactants, phenol and vanillin for agriculture, consumer goods and food market segments. Functional Polymers makes polyamides.
  </p>
  <p>
   US lightweight materials company Cytec, acquired in 2015 as part of a major strategic shift towards lightweight materials, has been divided into two global business units, Composite Materials, part of the Advanced Materials segment, and Technology Solutions, part of Advanced Formulations.

  <p>
   The company operates 145 industrial sites across the world, with the greatest concentration in Europe. The Asia-Pacific region is the largest by revenue (and also the fastest growing), at 35% of total, followed by the Europe at 32% and North America at 23%.

  <p>
   Sales grew in 2015 by 4% to €10.6 billion, mostly due to favorable exchange rate effects. Weakness in the Advanced Formulations segment was due to the significant downturn in the US unconventional oil and gas markets, with the Novecare business hurting in particular. Advanced Materials grew strongly however and ended the year as Solvay's biggest segment by revenue, overtaking both Formulations and Chemicals. Its specialty polymers business was aided by strong demand from the smart device industry. Overall, Performance Chemicals was up but strength in Soda Ash was counterbalanced to an extent by weakness in the cigarette market, on which acetate tow sales (down 16%) depend.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income of €454 million was €441 million higher than 2014 due to an increase in sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities fell to €1.4 billion due to lower depreciation, amortization and impairments.

   Solvay is undertaking a strategic shift towards advanced and lightweight materials. The company expects the sector to expand as lightweighting becomes key to increased energy efficiency and feeds into the global push towards energy reduction. Automotive is expected to be a major part of this increase in demand as the technology makes its way from high-tech F1 and luxury cars into the consumer segment. In 2015, Solvay acquired lightweight materials company
   <company id="110402">
    Cytec
   </company>
   . The acquisition made the company the world's second largest player in aerospace composite materials, and is hoped to achieve €100 million in combined synergies a year. In addition, the Cytec acquisition is part of a geographic repositioning towards the US in search of growth opportunities, and has increased its talent pool in the region. Indeed, the company focused the majority of its capital investment for 2015 into its Advanced Formulations and Materials segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The strategy is also a shift away from the volatile world of commodities: Solvay is vulnerable to downturns in oil and gas, as seen in recent years. To raise cash, in 2016 the company agreed to sell its 58.77% stake in Thai-based plastics maker
   <company id="153950">
    Vinythai

   to
   <company id="52333">
    Asahi Glass
   </company>
   for 33.5 billion yen ($291 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also sold its 70.59% stake in

   to Brazilian chemical group Unipar Carbocloro.

  <p>
   The company acquired Cytec, a US lightweight materials company, for €4.9 billion, as part of a major shift in strategy towards advanced and lightweight materials.

  <p>
   Solvay began in the 1860s when founder Ernest Solvay perfected a method that created soda ash at a lower cost than the prevailing Leblanc process. In 1886 the company began to diversify into manufacturing chlorine and expanded beyond Belgium into the France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the US. By the 1900s Solvay had reduced the price for soda ash by two-thirds what it had been before his entry into the field.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost its Russia-based plants during the Russian Revolution. Ernest Solvay died shortly thereafter in 1922. To overcome its Russian losses, the company modernized its remaining plants and added new businesses such as potassium mining.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1930s and 1940s the company began to switch its plants to the electrolysis process and expanded into Italy, Greece, and other countries. Because of their locations, the firm's plants suffered during WWII, and the company lost several as the Iron Curtain descended across East Europe. The company rebuilt what facilities it could and once again diversified its product base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solvay began making plastic (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) in 1949 at its plant in Jemeppe, Belgium, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s the company developed into a major manufacturer of bulk chemicals. In the late 1960s Baron Rene Boel, who had married into the family, managed the company; he took it public in 1971. Boel hired executives from outside the family and modernized the company's management structure. These changes kept the company financially healthy until 1976, when US companies began manufacturing soda ash from trona rock mine. Cheaper and more environmentally friendly, the process forced Solvay to close its soda ash plants. (The company later returned to making soda ash.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite these problems, Solvay continued expansion during the 1980s, which included creating Solvay America, a holding company for its US companies. Recognizing its vulnerability from a reliance on bulk chemicals, the company began to diversify into drug production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Solvay recorded a $198 million loss, its first in more than a decade. Analysts questioned whether the company could compete against companies such as Akzo (now
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel
   </company>
   ), which produced nothing but pharmaceuticals. Under the leadership of CEO Baron Daniel Janssen, Solvay tried to kill off its reputation as an industrial dinosaur. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Solvay recovered many of the plants it had lost during WWII and the Cold War. It renovated them, closed many of its unprofitable operations, and sold off noncore businesses such as its animal health units to American Home Products (renamed Wyeth in 2002). To improve profits, it teamed up with companies such as US pharmaceutical giant Upjohn (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1996 Solvay concentrated on chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and processing (manufacturing finished products such as pipes and fittings). In 1998 Solvay veteran Aloïs Michielsen replaced Daniel Janssen, who retired as executive committee chairman and CEO. The appointment marked the first time a non-family member was tapped to run the company. Michielsen went to work on improving the company's old-fashioned image, which he considered partially to blame for depressing the firm's stock price.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's plastic division in 1999 suffered from low PVC prices, which rebounded within the year when EVC International NV (now
   <company id="135967">
    INEOS Vinyls
   </company>
   ) shut down its PVC plant in Italy. Solvay bought US-based Unimed Pharmaceuticals and a strategic stake in generic prescription drugmaker Duramed that year. In 2000 Solvay entered into a 50/50 venture with Plastic Omnium (plastics processing) called
   <company id="107988">
    Inergy Automotive Systems
   </company>
   ; the new company is the largest maker of plastic fuel tanks in the world. In 2002 the company acquired Ausimont from Montedison and Longside International for about $1.1 billion. It also has acquired pharmaceuticals makers and products, including hypertension medications Aceon and Teveten.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Solvay acquired Egyptian chemicals maker Alexandria Sodium Carbonate Company (ASCC) for $130 million. The company viewed the acquisition as an entry not only into the Egyptian market but also into the greater Middle East and Northern African regions. Solvay began doubling the capacity at ASCC's manufacturing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solvay sold its manufactured pharmaceuticals unit to US-based
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   in 2010 for $7.6 billion.
