With a top speed of more than 200 mph, the Murciélago's 6.5-liter, 12-cylinder power plant (which delivers 630 horsepower -- more than five

  <p>
   Ferruccio Lamborghini was born near Bologna, Italy, in 1916. The son of a farmer, he displayed an interest in mechanical objects from an early age and completed studies in industrial design just before WWII. Upon enlisting in the Italian army, he was assigned to Rhodes, Greece, where he gained a reputation -- first with the Italians, then with occupying British forces -- as a mechanical genius. (After the war he claimed that he was always the first one to receive manuals and would quickly memorize and destroy them in order to ensure his place as
   <em>
    capo
   </em>
   of mechanics.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Ferruccio's father found himself in need of a tractor after the war, so Ferruccio built one from old military vehicle parts. Other farmers were impressed, and young Ferruccio soon had himself a booming trade in cobbled-together tractors. By 1948 he had his own factory, and in 1949 he founded Lamborghini Trattori, which became one of Italy's largest agricultural equipment makers. A wealthy Ferruccio founded Lamborghini Bruciatori to make heaters in 1960; by 1963 the company was the second-largest heating company in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Always a fast-car enthusiast, Ferruccio routinely used his substantial wealth to buy the latest sports cars, including
   <company id="59581">

   , Morgan,
   <company id="56156">

   </company>
   , and
   <company id="104498">
    Maserati
   </company>
   models. Legend has it that he was unsatisfied with one of his Ferraris and drove it right to the factory to confront Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari with his complaints. During that heated exchange, Ferrari reportedly blurted, "You stick to tractors, and let me build sports cars!"
  </p>
  <p>
   The affronted Lamborghini apparently decided otherwise, however. Just a year later, in 1963, the first Lamborghini production model, the 12-cylinder 350 GT, was completed. Perhaps it was not incidental that Ferruccio, born under the zodiac sign of Taurus, chose a charging bull as the Lamborghini emblem. (Ferrari's logo is a prancing horse.) In 1966 the legendary Lamborghini Miura (named after a Spanish fighting bull) made its debut. The sleek two-seater coupe, on display in New York's

   , could reach 186 mph and was the fastest production car of its time. The four-seater Espada followed in 1968. No doubt Ferruccio derived a great deal of satisfaction from the fact that many of his customers chose Lamborghini rather than rival Ferrari. Among Lamborghini's customers were Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra (who custom-ordered a car with leopard-skin interior).
  </p>
  <p>
   The next major offering, the Countach, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971. The prototype received its name after a shocked observer declared "Countach!" -- an Italian interjection along the lines of "Great God!" -- upon first seeing the futuristic-looking, wedge-shaped vehicle. In 1972 Lamborghini introduced the Urraco and the Jarama models. The company hit financial skids during the oil crisis and recession of 1973, and Ferruccio retired the same year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lamborghini kept going, however. It debuted the Silhouette in 1976 and tried its hand at off-road vehicles in 1977. In 1980 the company went bankrupt and was sold to the Minram brothers, Swiss entrepreneurs who injected a great deal of money into Lamborghini before selling it to
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   for about $25 million in 1987. Chrysler, too, spent plenty on the company. It retired the venerable Countach and introduced the 575-horsepower Diablo, a 6.0-liter V-12 with a top speed close to 210 mph, in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chrysler modernized Lamborghini's distribution system, but unsatisfied with low production and financial losses, sold the company in 1993 to Indonesian conglomerate SEDTCO (part owned by Tommy Suharto).
  </p>
  <p>
   Producing only about 200 Diablos a year, Lamborghini achieved profitability in 1997 and was sold to

    AUDI
   </company>
   division in 1998. In 2002 Lamborghini introduced its first new model in more than 10 years -- the Murciélago. The following year the company rolled out a smaller, less expensive Lamborghini, the Gallardo (named for a breed of fighting bulls). Lamborghini designed the Gallardo to compete with the Ferrari F360 and the Porsche GT2.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Lamborghini introduced the Gallardo Superleggera. The latest version of the Gallardo weighs 150 pounds less than its predecessor and has 10 more ponies under the hood. The result is a car that goes from zero to 62 mph in less than 4 seconds -- and can reach a top speed of just over 195 mph.
