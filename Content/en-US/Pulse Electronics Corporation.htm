   Pulse Electronics (formerly Technitrol) pulses with the desire to control electronic impulses. The company makes a variety of electronic components used in network, power, and wireless devices. Network products include passive magnetic components, including chokes, filters, transformers, and splitters. Power components include current and voltage sensors, ignition coils, power transformers, and magnetic devices. Its wireless devices are primarily antennas and mounting devices for handsets. Pulse Electronics has manufacturing facilities in China and the US. The company gets around 85% of its sales from outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Based in San Diego, California, the company also operates about six manufacturing plants in the US and China, and has other locations in Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Germany, and Finland.

  <p>
   Pulse Electronics' products and services are offered through direct sales forces operating in eight sales offices worldwide to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and electronic contract equipment manufacturers (CEMs).

  <p>
   In 2013 it reported its lowest sales in five years. Revenues fell 5% from 2012 driven by ongoing economic and industry weakness which constrained demand for network and power products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pulse Electronics reported a loss of $27.1 million in 2013 (compared to a $31.9 million loss in 2012) due to the absence of debt restructuring and related costs (compared to $1.2 million in 2012) together with a decrease in its severance, impairment, and other associated costs ($3.3 million compared to $5.9 million in 2012), partially offset by lower sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash flow from operating activities in 2013 moved up by $17.7 million in 2013 (from a deficit of $9.7 million in 2012) due to higher operating profit as well as lower severance, tax, and interest payments.

   Focusing on investing in technological developments, in 2014 Pulse Electronics extended its line of high-frequency multilayer ceramic chip inductors and introduced power splitters for the PIMinator line of Low PIM in-building DAS antennas and four new input/output connectors in 2013.

   The company decided to focus on its electronic components operations, and to use the proceeds from divesting other lines of business for reducing its debt. The company trimmed its net loss from continuing operations in 2010 to $28 million from a loss of around $73 million the prior year. After selling its electrical contacts business line, Pulse Electronics saw sales rise 8% in 2010 over 2009, with stronger sales in its network and power business units offsetting lackluster sales in its wireless business group. In 2011, however, Pulse Electronics announced an uptick in sales for wireless antennas, with more than 40 new design wins and the addition of

   as a customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pulse Electronics sold its Electrical Contact Products Group (
   <company id="131191">
    AMI Doduco
   </company>
   ) to a group of investors that included AMI Doduco management, Tinicum Capital Partners, and JP Asia Capital Partners in 2010. AMI Doduco specialized in precisely engineered electrical contacts and assemblies used in a slew of products, from circuit breakers to electrical switches and relays, consumer appliances, and thermostatic devices. Its North American electrical contact products business was snapped up by
   <company id="113814">
    Metalor Technologies International
   </company>
   . The deal included operations in Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, and Mexico City. In 2009 Pulse Electronics unloaded its medical technology unit, Medtech (electromechanical components and transducers), to Altor Fund III.

  <p>
   Technitrol was founded in 1947 by Gordon Palmer and three other
   <company id="40498">
    University of Pennsylvania
   </company>
   engineering graduates, all of whom helped develop ENIAC, the world's first electronic computer. Technitrol held the first patent for a magnetic disk drive, the most widely licensed disk memory device during the 1960s and 1970s. The company's licensees included
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company never made the drive, focusing instead on the development of its other breakthrough invention, the pulse transformer, and supplying this and other components to the emerging computer industry. But changes in core memory technology for mainframe computers in the 1970s nearly sank Technitrol's pulse transformer business, prompting the company to diversify.
  </p>
  <p>
   Technitrol began pursuing a strategy of buying troubled companies and folding them into existing operations to win market leadership in niche component areas. In 1972 it bought electrical contact maker Advanced Metallurgy and measuring instruments and scales specialist John Chatillon &amp; Sons. By the end of the 1980s Technitrol had settled on three core lines -- electronics, metallurgical, and test and measurement.
  </p>
  <p>
   When sales began stagnating in the early 1990s, Technitrol turned to higher-margin products in the computer network and telecommunications realms. It bought Fil-Mag in 1994 and
   <company id="113325">
    Pulse Engineering
   </company>
   in 1995. That year longtime company executive Thomas Flakoll became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company acquired Doduco, a Germany-based maker of electric contacts, and reshuffled its magnetic components business under the name Pulse. The company sold off its test and measurement business that year and the next.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued, including purchases of Northern Telecom's (now
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel Networks
   </company>
   ) magnetic components operations (1997), telecommunications and power conversion equipment component maker FEE Technology (1998), and computer network component specialist GTI (1998). Also in 1998, Technitrol unified its metallurgical components businesses under the name
   <company id="131191">
    AMI Doduco
   </company>
   . When Flakoll resigned in 1999, he was succeeded by Technitrol chairman James Papada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both company units made major expansion pushes in 1999 and 2000. AMI Doduco acquired businesses in China, Estonia, and Italy, while Pulse formed a new unit to develop off-the-shelf products for the fast-growing broadband cable market. In 2001 Technitrol further expanded AMI Doduco when it acquired the France-based electrical contacts business of Engelhard-CLAL.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company acquired the consumer electronics components business of Italy-based Eldor Corporation. In 2004 Technitrol acquired the controlling interest in Full Rise Electronic (FRE), a Taiwanese supplier of connector and cabling products. The company first took an equity stake in FRE in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired LK Products, a supplier of antennas and modules for mobile devices, for €67 million (about $83 million) in cash in 2005. Technitrol bought the company from
   <company id="53600">
    Filtronic
   </company>
   and made LK Products part of its antenna products division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Technitrol acquired ERA Group for €49 million (approximately $58 million). ERA Group made electronic coils and transformers, primarily for the European automotive market. Technitrol formed an automotive products division within the power products group of Pulse Engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company offered to acquire rival
   <company id="12760">
    Bel Fuse
   </company>
   , which made its own unsolicited bids for other competitors in the past. Technitrol was offering $480 million in cash to buy Bel Fuse. The company made several private overtures to Bel Fuse regarding a possible acquisition in 2006, with Bel Fuse refusing to go beyond initial talks.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Bel Fuse rebuffed the Technitrol bid as too low, Technitrol offered to increase its value to $514 million, if Bel Fuse representatives would engage in more substantive negotiations. Days after making the conditional higher offer (also rejected by Bel Fuse), Technitrol withdrew the offer, stating that Bel Fuse refused to negotiate in good faith.
  </p>
  <p>
   Technitrol sold its Electrical Contact Products Group (AMI Doduco) to a group of investors that included AMI Doduco management, Tinicum Capital Partners, and JP Asia Capital Partners in September 2010. The move was the last in a series of divestitures designed to make Technitrol a pure-play electronic components provider. Two months later, Technitrol changed its name to Pulse Electronics Corporation. The change was part of a larger reorganization that integrated Technitrol and its Pulse Engineering unit into a single entity. The company also changed its ticker and brand to further reinforce its new identity.
