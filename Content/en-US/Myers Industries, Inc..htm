   Myers Industries manufactures a host of plastic and rubber products, from flower pots to tires, through several operating segments. Its largest segment, material handling, includes plastic and reusable containers and pallets, storage bins, and wire shelving systems. The lawn and garden segment covers plastic flower pots, hanging baskets, and planters and the engineered products segment includes tire repair products, plastic HVAC components, and highway marking tape. The company also distributes products such as hand tools, alignment and balancing equipment, and tire valves to tire dealers and service centers through Myers Tire Supply.

  <p>
   Myers has 22 manufacturing facilities, nearly 20 sales offices, four distribution centers, and three distribution branches located in the Americas, particularly Canada, Brazil, and the US. The company generates 82% of its revenue from the US, followed by Brazil (7%) and Canada (4%).

  <p>
   In 2014 the company discontinued its lawn and garden segment. It also combined its engineered products segment into its two remaining segments: material handling and distribution. Material handing makes products such as decorative resin planters, plastic OEM parts, tire repair materials, and customized plastic and rubber products. Distribution distributes tools, equipment, and supplies used for tire, wheel and under-vehicle service on passenger, heavy truck, and off-road vehicles.

  <p>
   Myers reported a revenue decline of 24% from 2013 to 2014 as it discontinued its lawn and garden segment. (Note: its 2013 annual numbers were restated due to divestitures.) The company earned revenue of $624 million in 2014, which included the acquisition of Scepter Corporation Group. Revenue was also affected by improved pricing to mitigate higher resin prices during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a net loss of nearly $9 million in 2014 due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, which grew from acquisition costs, along with higher interest expenses which grew from an increase in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Myers' operating cash flow fell significantly by 60% from $96 million in 2013 to $39 million in 2014. This was attributed to the net loss and increased cash outflows in prepaid expenses, along with decreased cash inflows from inventories and accounts payable.

  <p>
   Myers grows through the use of acquisitions, keeping a lid on its manufacturing costs, and by establishing joint ventures in emerging markets. In 2015 the company completed the sale of its lawn and garden business for $110 million. The transaction was made in an effort to streamline its business portfolio into material handling and distribution and to increase its focus on its core growth platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company completed its acquisition of Scepter Corporation and Scepter Manufacturing for $157 million. Scepter now operates within the material handling segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2013 it launched a joint venture with India-based TVS Automobile Solutions Ltd. (ASL) to distribute tools, supplies, and equipment into Indian automotive aftermarket. The new company, Myers Tyre Supply India Limited, expanded its distribution segment and provides tools and consumables to independent tire dealers and tire retreaders in India.
