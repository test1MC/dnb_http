   Digital Lightwave puts communications networks to the test. The company makes equipment for monitoring, maintaining, and managing fiber-optic networks. Digital Lightwave's Network Information Computers are portable touch-screen devices used to test networks and transmission equipment during installation and use. It also makes a range of equipment used in optical networks to remotely monitor and test network performance. Customers include telecommunications network operators and systems integrators. The company went private in January 2010 when it merged with Optel Capital, which is controlled by Digital Lightwave chairman Bryan Zwan. VeEX Inc. bought Digital Lightwave in 2016.
