   When it comes to keeping bodily fluids clean, Gambro is fastidious. The medical equipment and technology company is among the world's leading manufacturers of devices and therapies for kidney and liver dialysis. Dialysis helps to remove fluids and toxins from patients with chronic and acute conditions. It specializes in hemodialysis and acute care products, with a portfolio that includes dialyzers, monitors, ultrafilters (for fluid removal), and disinfectants, as well as integrated dialysis units and software that helps to manage data on a patient's dialysis treatment. Gambro makes products for both clinical and home use and distributes them throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. Gambro was acquired by

    Baxter International
   </company>
   in 2013.

  <p>
   Baxter completed its acquisition of Gambro in September 2013 for some $3.9 billion to expand its renal dialysis operations. Baxter purchased Gambro from Indap AB, jointly owned by EQT and
   <company id="90885">
    Investor AB
   </company>
   ; investment firm Investor AB is controlled by Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family.

  <p>
   Over the course of its history, Gambro has poured both time and money into research and development, aiming to launch new products to support its future growth. Newer products include Theralite, a therapy it developed for the treatment of kidney failure in patients with multiple myeloma (cancer of the plasma cells).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 an improved version of its Prismaflex eXeed software was introduced for the Prismaflex system, a widely used continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) device for the treatment of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Its predecessor, the Prisma, was the first automated, integrated system designed to perform a complete range of CRRT functions, as well as therapeutic plasma exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2010 Gambro announced its intent to boost production capacity of dialyzers with synthetic membranes at an existing plant in Germany. The plant expansion was planned for completion in 2013 and boosts annual production capacity to about 18 million dialyzers per year. It complements dialyzer production already undertaken by Gambro's manufacturing plant in Alabama.

  <p>
   In addition to R&amp;D, Gambro has occasionally to acquisitions to expand its offerings. In early 2010 the company acquired privately-held medical device maker CHF Solutions, giving it CHF's leading product, the Aquadex FlexFlow system, used to remove salt and water in patients with fluid overload. Fluid overload commonly accompanies a number of disorders, from heart failure to liver failure to kidney disease.

  <p>
   Gambro originated as an abbreviated form of Gamla Brogatans Sjukvardsaffar Aktiebolag, or "Old Bridge Street Medical Supplies Company Limited," which was registered in Stockholm in 1946. In 1953 the company's name was changed to AB Gambro, which became a recording and motion picture distributor before it was acquired in 1958 by Holger Crafoord.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1964 Crafoord decided to sell renal dialysis technology that had been developed by Professor Nils Alwall. As the company grew, it developed new technologies. Seven years after its founding, the firm introduced the first automatic dialysis machine, the AK-3. The AK-10, the first computerized dialysis machine, followed in 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   Backed by the success of its evolving technologies, Gambro went public in 1983, listing on both the Stockholm and New York exchanges. In the mid-1980s though profits tumbled when reimbursement cutbacks for dialysis treatments in the US cut into profit margins. By 1987 Gambro had recovered enough to buy Swiss dialysis equipment rival Hospal. The next year Swedish industrial holding firm Cardo bought about half of the company from a unit of Volvo and a Crafoord family trust.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gambro began the 1990s in a big way: in 1990 it bought US competitor COBE Laboratories, also founded in 1964. COBE had begun as a small dialysis equipment maker that went global in the mid-1970s. Those same US reimbursement cutbacks that had hurt Gambro had forced COBE to diversify into cardiopulmonary surgical support and other equipment. The purchase kicked off a buying spree of more than 70 deals that helped build and diversify Gambro. Purchases included a nearly 25% stake in REN Corp., leading US operator of dialysis clinics in 1992 (Gambro bought out the company in 1995). During this time, Gambro came under the control of Sweden's Wallenberg family when its Incentive investment arm bought Cardo; Incentive in 1998 became holding company Gambro AB.
  </p>
  <p>
   The late 1990s were a struggle for the company as the costs of its expansion began to take their toll. In 1999 Gambro announced a major reorganization to consolidate its brands and focus on its core dialysis clinics, renal products, and blood component technology operations. It also formed a dialysis equipment joint venture with rival Baxter International. Rumors surfaced the next year about a possible merger, but no deal emerged.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Gambro further expanded its scope in the US by acquiring all of the dialysis-related assets of Renal Management, Inc. In late 2004, however, Gambro announced its decision to divest Gambro Healthcare US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US operation was sold to California-based dialysis clinic group
   <company id="47015">
    DaVita
   </company>
   for $3.1 billion in 2005. The deal handed over more than 560 US clinics and cut the overall size of the company in half. That same year Gambro Healthcare US reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice to resolve compliance and documentation problems stemming from 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Gambro sold off its remaining Healthcare operations (more than 150 dialysis clinics in 14 countries) to private equity firm
   <company id="134139">
    Bridgepoint Capital
   </company>
   , which then renamed the business Diaverum. Prior to the divestitures Gambro Healthcare had accounted for about 60% of the group's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   What had been
   <company id="143921">
    Gambro BCT
   </company>
   (which stood for Blood Component Technology) was hived off as an independent business in 2008 and renamed
   <company id="143921">
    CaridianBCT
   </company>
   . In 2011 Japan's Terumo announced plans to acquire CaridianBCT for $2.63 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   With all of other operations off the table, Gambro Renal Products was rechristened Gambro AB in 2008.
