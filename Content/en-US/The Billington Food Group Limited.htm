  <p>
   The company's history of supplying British-grown sugar reaches back more than 150 years. Although many sugar processors have focused on selling refined white sugar, Billington's has preserved the traditional unrefined cane sugar products, which are only partially refined and offer varying degrees of molasses-rich flavor and color. The company was first to market organic unrefined sugars and was among the first to participate in fair trade unrefined sugars, intended to allow fair prices for farmers.
