  <p>
   Demand continues to be strong for its hydraulic elevators primarily used in low-rise, less-costly building projects. On the high-rise end, the company is going the green route, developing and producing more energy-efficient products, such as the Schindler 7000 elevator for skyscrapers. Elevator energy consumption is a topic of growing interest among architects, property developers, and real estate managers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schindler Elevator continues to grow through the acquisition of independent elevator service companies and by organic expansion.
