   SunEdison Semiconductor (SSI) hopes to be a bright spot for its parent,
   <company id="44021">
    SunEdison
   </company>
   . The company makes a variety of silicon wafers, a key component in semiconductors, which are the basis of electronics including computers, mobile phones, and even appliances as well as  solar cells, LEDs, and other modern technology. The 50-year-old company has pioneered many aspects of wafer production. SSI has about a dozen plants, mostly in Asia to be near its customers, but also in the US and Europe. It sells its wafers to semiconductor manufacturers and wafer customization companies. In 2013, after years of declining semiconductor sales, SunEdison spun off its wafer fabrication unit to focus on its high-margin solar farm business.

  <p>
   After years of declining sales and tight profit margins in its silicon wafer business and stalled demand for its solar panels, parent SunEdison decided to follow several other solar panel makers and move into the solar farm business. To fund farm construction, it created SunEdison Semiconductor (SSI) as a separate entity and put a minority share of it up for sale. The IPO brought in about $94 million. SSI also picked up about $94 million in a private placement of shares to Samsung and secured a new loan for about $210. SSI will keep about $72 million after paying debt and SunEdison will pick up close to $300 million to plow into its solar farms.

  <p>
   SSI makes  silicon wafers ranging in size from 100mm to 300mm -- four inches to one foot -- in diameter. In addition to standard prime polished wafers, SSI makes epitaxial wafers (which have an added layer of single-crystal silicon) for advanced chips, as well as lower-grade wafers used to test chip-making equipment and production lines. The company also makes solar wafers and sells solar-grade polysilicon, both of which go into making solar cells.

  <p>
   Customers in Taiwan and South Korea make up a little more than half of the firm's customers so that's where most of the manufacturing is located. SSI also has plants in Japan, Malaysia, the US, and Italy.

   In 2013 sales to its three major customers,
   <company id="111702">
    Samsung
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="43493">
    TSMC
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   , accounted for about half of sales.

  <p>
   Price cuts due to softness in semiconductor pricing lead SSI to report a 2% drop in revenue for 2013. Meanwhile costs rose, including an 11% jump in R&amp;D spending, resulting in a net loss of $58 million. However, accounts receivable grew while pension and other costs shrank and the company reported a 23% improvement in cash from operations.

  <p>
   Though semiconductor pricing is soft, the demand for ever increasing complexity and innovation remains strong. SSI can significantly improve its prospects by being first to market, or best, with something new. Therefore the company continues to pour money into R&amp;D particularly for wafers used in wireless devices. It also works on keeping it manufacturing process lean and increasing its customer penetration by working with them to develop custom products.

  <p>
   SSI was formed in 1959 as Monsanto Electric Material Company or MEMC. It became SunEdison in 2013 and then was spun off as SunEdison Semiconductor in 2014. SunEdison retained the solar panel business with intentions of becoming a solar farm company.
