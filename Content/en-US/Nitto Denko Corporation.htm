   It has taken adhesive tape and more to hold Nitto Denko together for almost 100 years. The company makes industrial adhesive tapes for the electronics, automotive, health care, packaging, and construction industries. Nitto separates its business into three segments: Industrial Products (double-coated adhesive tape, barcode labels), Optronics Products (flexible printed circuits for smartphones, TVS, and tablets), and Medical and Membrane Products (pest control products and transdermal patches). Its Optronics segment provided 55% of Nitto's sales in fiscal 2016 (March year end).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 net sales decreased by 4% (in local currency) to ¥793.05 billion due to lower sales from Asia and Oceania.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nitto Denko saw decreased revenues from the Optronics business driven by lower sales from Information fine materials and Printed circuit boards sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has been rising since fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net income increased by 5% to ¥81.7 billion due to lower income tax costs and lower other expenses. The business was influenced by a decrease of production in the market for smartphones and hard disc drives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 18% to ¥140.65 billion due to a change in trade and other receivables.
