   The company has found a bump in demand in recent years from US water utilities, as urban governments replace their old infrastructure with the company's zinc-coated ductile iron pipe. ACIPCO's zinc-coated pipe (introduced in the US in 2015) extends the life of iron pipe and protects millions of feet of cast and ductile iron pipe around the world. In 2016, Danville (Indiana) laid its first zinc-coated ductile iron pipe, and

    Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission
   </company>
   , a major US utility, updated its specifications so that all ductile iron pipe installed in its system will be zinc-coated and use V-Bio enhanced polyethylene encasement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to original pipe production, to save costs, ACIPCO also recycles structural steel and iron for water and sewer infrastructure.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company announced plans build a new spiral-welded pipe facility in Flint (Michigan) to support the Karegnondi Water Authority project by supplying 60 miles of spiral-welded pipe, 17 miles of ductile iron pipe, and 24 large diameter Flex-Ring gate valves.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company recycled scrap metal from the decommissioned

   launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Florida. ACIPCO claims that 90% of its ductile iron pipe is made from recycled material.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 and 2012 ACIPCO lobbied the US government to lift the cap on private activity bonds to encourage municipalities to upgrade their water infrastructure as a way to both drive economic growth and provide the company with new product demand.

   John Joseph Eagan founded ACIPCO in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1905, and in 1922 placed all of the company's stock into a trust for employees.
