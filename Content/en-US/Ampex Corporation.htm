   Ampex has recorded quite a history of data storage. The company that invented the VCR, and whose technology has won a Grammy award and a dozen Emmy awards, now specializes in instrumentation recorders used in commercial and military aircraft, satellite surveillance systems, and other aerospace and industrial applications. In addition to its magnetic disk and solid-state memory-based recorders, the company offers tape-based recorders, as well as drives and library systems. Ampex also generates revenues from licensing its patents, with its technology going into digital still cameras, camera phones, digital video camcorders, and DVD recorders. The company has subsidiaries in Japan and the UK.

  <p>
   Ampex was founded in 1944 by Russian electrical engineer Alexander M. Poniatoff, as a small motor manufacturer. The company famously took its name from the initials of its founder, A.M.P., and adding a technical-sounding "-ex" to those letters. In 1948 it began marketing an audio recorder, and in 1956 it introduced the earliest VCR technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the next few decades the company established itself as an innovative broadcast technology developer. (It holds about 600 patents, and has won 12 Emmy awards and an Oscar for its technical prowess.) In the 1970s, however, profits began to fall, affected by an increasingly competitive electronics market and the company's inability to switch broadcasters from standard analog equipment to new digital technology. Ampex was sold to Signal Cos. in 1981 and bought by Sherborne Group, a private investment firm owned by Ampex CEO Edward Bramson, in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bramson took the indebted company public in 1992 but kept more than 65% of its stock. He cut overhead, discontinued outmoded analog broadcast products, and focused on high-end digital storage products. Restructuring charges put Ampex in the red for 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Ampex continued to phase out slow-growth segments while initiating acquisitions to expand its data storage offerings. The next year Ampex bought MicroNet Technology, a data storage and image processing company. In 1999 it took stakes in some Internet broadcasters, and later that year it became a holding company operating through subsidiaries and affiliates focused on Internet video broadcasting and technology, and digital storage.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company announced its intention to sell Ampex Data Systems (audio-visual storage and processing). Later that year it discontinued MicroNet's operations and, in 2001, did the same with its Internet operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Ampex sued
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO
   </company>
   and Sony for patent infringement of digital still camera technology; it reached licensing agreements with both Japanese companies later in the year. It also licensed Canon and sued
   <company id="10500">
    Kodak
   </company>
   over those same patents in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 Ampex signed licensing deals for digital still camera patents with
   <company id="56294">
    JVC
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="56016">
    Olympus
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="58418">
    Pentax
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Struggling with debt obligations related to two pension plans, Ampex filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 in 2008 and delisted its stock from the NASDAQ. Ampex emerged from bankruptcy later that year after receiving new funding from Brookside Equity Partners (formerly Hillside Capital) after a debt-for-equity swap.
