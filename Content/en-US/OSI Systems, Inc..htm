   OSI Systems is keeping a close scan on transportation security and health care worldwide. The company's security division manufactures specialized inspection equipment under the
   <company id="146801">
    Rapiscan Systems
   </company>
   name used to screen everything from baggage and people to cargo and vehicles at airports, ports, and borders. Its
   <company id="15778">
    Spacelabs Healthcare
   </company>
   subsidiary makes patient monitoring, cardiac monitoring, and clinical networking systems primarily for hospitals. A third division makes optoelectronic devices (OSI Optoelectronics) for aerospace/defense electronics, industrial automation, security, medical diagnostics, and other applications. That division also offers contract electronics manufacturing services (OSI Electronics).
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company maintains manufacturing, research and development, and sales operations in theAmericas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It designs and makes optoelectronic devices and provides electronics manufacturing services primarily at its facilities in the US, the UK, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for almost 50% of the OSI Systems' revenues in fiscal 2015 (ended June).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Security is OSI Systems' largest segment, accounting for almost half of its annual revenues. Offering a broad range of screening technologies, Rapiscan Systems has built a solid reputation for its inspection systems, having been installed in such security-tight locations as Buckingham Palace, the Kremlin, the Vatican, and at high-profile events, such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup.
  </p>
  <p>
   OSI Systems' Healthcare division is focused on designing products that make critical patient information more readily accessible both within and outside of a hospital. Its optoelectronic products and manufacturing services are geared at OEM customers in need of specialized electronic components. It also serve OSI Systems' own security and health care divisions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Products are sold by direct sales and marketing representatives and by a network of independent distributors. Major customers within its security segment include the
   <company id="150382">
    Transportation Security Administration
   </company>
   , the
   <company id="150267">
    Bureau of Prisons
   </company>
   , and various international airports around the world (including in the UK, Israel, and Hong Kong).
   <company id="123234">
    Eisenhower Medical Center

   is a major health care customer;
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell

   , a major optoelectronic customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   OSI Systems also sells its products through various group purchasing organizations, including
   <company id="122607">
    Novation
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="108785">
    Healthtrust Purchasing Group

  <p>
   The company has reported revenue growth over the last few years. OSI Systems' revenues increased by 6% in fiscal 2015 due to a 9% growth in Security sales and a 15% growth in Healthcare sales, partially offset by 6% decline in Optoelectronics and Manufacturing revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth in Security division was due to launch of new product and increased cargo sales comprised of $48 million of incremental revenue from the Foreign Military Sale contract with the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   awarded in 2014 to supply multiple units of cargo and vehicle inspection systems and related training, spare parts, service and logistics support for Iraq.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues for the Healthcare division increased due to higher North American sales, an 11% increase in Latin American and Asian markets, and the impact of an acquisition of a European cardiology equipment business in fiscal 2015, which drove 8% of the division's growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   OSI Systems' net income has followed the revenue trend over the last five years. In fiscal 2015 net income increased by 36% due to higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company's operating cash flow decreased by 19% due to the impact of substantial efforts to improve its days sales outstanding in fiscal 2014 and collecting delinquent receivables from the company's turnkey program in Mexico; and a $52.8 million decrease in the change in cash flow from deferred revenue as a result of earning revenue related to the turnkey program in Mexico and for other services and product installations that were previously paid for by customers.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company is looking to expand by leveraging its electronics and contract manufacturing capabilities into selective end product markets through organic growth and acquisitions. Growth areas include strengthening its geographic reach; building Security and Inspection Systems market share; developing new products and improving its existing medical technologies; and entering new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Security division, OSI Systems depends on the growing needs of the international government security markets. It expands in this segment by forming new supply contracts with government agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   OSI Systems believes demand for patient monitoring systems and other health solutions will continue to grow in the US market (and other developing countries) due to an aging population, as well as in developing nations where health care infrastructures are being built and expanded.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the Government of Albania awarded the company's Security Division,
   <company id="146801">
    Rapiscan Systems
   </company>
   , a 15-year contract to provide turnkey cargo and vehicle security screening services at various sites throughout that country.
