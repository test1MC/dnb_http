   You might say this company's games help casinos hit the jackpot. Multimedia Games is a leading manufacturer of slot machines and other gaming systems used by both commercial casinos and by establishments in the Native American gaming industry. It makes both video reel and mechanical reel games, as well as multiterminal games that allow gamblers to compete for jackpots. In addition to its proprietary gaming machines, Multimedia Games licenses games from third parties such as

   and

    Aristocrat Technologies
   </company>
   . It also makes casino management systems that monitor gaming-machine performance and track player activity as well as video lottery terminals.

  <p>
   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 gave entrepreneurs opportunities to bring reservation-based gaming to players around the country. In 1991 Gordon Graves, founder of Datatrol -- which had launched the first online lottery system in the US -- set up TV Bingo Network, which went public in 1993. The next year the company acquired American Gaming &amp; Entertainment, which operated bingo games via closed-circuit television, and changed its name to Multimedia Games.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 it introduced MegaMania, which lets bingo hall patrons play games against each other through linked electronic terminals for average jackpots of $20,000. But casino competition lowered the odds of growth, so Multimedia turned to the potential of at-home play, creating a Web site that let patrons play bingo cards by proxy.
  </p>
  <p>
   MegaMania began attracting attention from federal agencies, which noticed its resemblance to the Las Vegas-style casino electronic games forbidden in Indian bingo halls. A federal investigation concluded in 1997 that Multimedia's games were permitted under the Gaming Regulatory Act. Unsatisfied, the FBI and a US attorney's office conducted a raid on Multimedia's headquarters on New Year's Eve of 1998. Later that year a district court affirmed the legal gaming status of MegaMania; an appellate court later upheld the decision. Also in 1998 Multimedia moved its headquarters from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Austin, Texas.

  <p>
   In 1999 the company struck a licensing deal with WMS Gaming and sold 70% of its ownership of Gamebay.com, an online sweepstakes site launched in October. That year the company agreed to pay Network Gaming International more than $3 million to settle a breach of contract lawsuit. In 2000 it introduced the first WMS machines into Washington State tribal casinos through its licensing agreement. In 2001 Multimedia Games signed a licensing agreement with Alliance Gaming, giving the company permission to distribute Bally gaming products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Multimedia Games filed suit against the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), claiming its CountDown Bingo and Two Step Bingo games are "Class II" games and may therefore be legally conducted on Indian lands without government interference. The NIGC had issued violation notices to facilities operating the games, arguing they were "Class III" and therefore subject to state and local government regulations. Later in the year the case was dismissed on the grounds that the court did not have proper jurisdiction to consider the case and that game vendors are not entitled to contest the classification of their games.
  </p>
  <p>
   Graves stepped down as CEO in 2003 and Clifton Lind was promoted to the top position. That year Multimedia Games entered the charitable bingo market with the installation of several bingo stations in Alabama. The company purchased in 2005 most of the assets of Sigma Game, a maker of mechanical slot and video gaming machines.

   Multimedia Games moved into Mexico's bingo market in 2006 when it agreed to provide electronic bingo to
   <company id="51043">
    Grupo Televisa
   </company>
   subsidiary Apuestas Internacionales, an operator of bingo halls and sports books.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lind stepped down as CEO in 2008 and was replaced by Anthony Sanfilippo, who previously served with casino giant Harrah's Entertainment (now
   <company id="13861">
    Caesars Entertainment
   </company>
   ). Sanfilippo left the company in 2010 to become head of casino operator

    Pinnacle Entertainment

   . Former COO Patrick Ramsey was named CEO.
