   Starting in 1945 with "the miracle cream from the soya bean," Rich Products has grown from a niche maker of soy-based whipped toppings and frozen desserts to a global US frozen foods maker. The family-owned business has developed other products, such as toppings and icings, and Coffee Rich (nondairy coffee creamer). It has expanded its product line to include frozen bakery and pizza doughs and ingredients for the food service and in-store bakery markets, plus appetizers, baked goods, seafood, meatballs, and barbecue meat. Rich Products markets more than 2,000 frozen food items that are sold in more than 110 countries; it has kitchens and bakeries around the world, including about 50 locations on six continents.

   While the company has developed a history in the states, Rich Products has focused on expanding globally in recent years, primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. It operates in Australia through wholesale bakery manufacturer VSE International, which boasts a portfolio of 800 products. The company is also expanding in emerging markets in western Asia. Turkey serves as a base from which to reach customers in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy, Rich Products works to keep up with popular food trends, such as gluten-free products, as it jockeys for market share in the baked goods category. As early as 2010 the company began offering gluten-free items such as Parisian cakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spending some $11 million, the company is expanding its food manufacturing facility in Georgia by 40% to grow its capacity by 30%.
