   Mott's is part of its parent company's Packaged Beverages segment, which in fiscal 2013 contributed 72% of net revenue.

   In 2013 sales of DPS's non-carbonated brands dropped some 4% as compared to 2012. The declines were driven primarily by a 10% drop in Hawaiian Punch sales. During the reporting period, however, Mott's logged a 3% revenue increase, thanks to distribution gains in its juice and sauce categories and increased promotional activity.

   The company had its beginnings in 1842 when Samuel R. Mott began making cider with the help of hitched horses walking in a circle, crushing apples between two large stone drums. The firm was eventually sold to the American Tobacco Company and in 1982 was purchased by UK candy and soft-drinks giant Cadbury Schweppes and made part of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages (CSAB). In 2008 Cadbury Schweppes spun off CSAB from its candy business. As a result of the separation, Mott's became a subsidiary of the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
