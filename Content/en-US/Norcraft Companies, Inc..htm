   Norcraft Companies make everything but the kitchen sink. The company makes kitchen and bathroom cabinets under several brands, including Mid Continent Cabinetry, StarMark, UltraCraft, and Urban Effects. Its product line includes stock and semi-custom cabinets made in both framed and full access styles, and more than 884,000 door and finish combinations. Norcroft's cabinets are made in the US at six manufacturing plants (Urban Effects' cabinets are also made in Canada). While its products are primarily sold through cabinet dealers and wholesale retailers, it does maintain five retail showrooms. In 2015 Norcraft was acquired by

   Fortune owns such brands as MasterBrand cabinets, Moen faucets, and Master Lock. Norcraft, which went public in 2013, will be merged into Fortune's cabinets business.

   The firm's Mid Continent Cabinetry and Norcraft brands make up its Mid Continent Cabinetry business division, which accounts for more than half of all revenues. The StarMark Cabinetry division includes the StarMark, Fieldstone, and Brookwood brands and accounts for another quarter of revenues. Meanwhile, the UltraCraft division makes wall, base, tall, vanity, and specialty cabinets and accounts for some 15% of sales. Finally, the Canadian division (Urban Effects) makes up the remainder of sales.

   Norcraft sells its products through internal and independent sales representatives, retail stores, wholesalers, dealers, builders, e-commerce, and through other channels. It primarily targets kitchen and bath dealers and wholesale retailers.

   In 2014, advertising costs totaled $600,000.

  <p>
   Revenues have been on the rise for the past five years. In fiscal 2014, revenue rose 11% to $376 million due to increased sales across all four business divisions, especially the Mid Continent Cabinetry division. Other factors leading to the increase include promotional sales efforts, discounts, and rebates.

  <p>
   However, Norcraft reported net losses between 2010 and 2013. In 2014 it returned to profitability with some $3.2 million in net income, primarily as a result of a benefit from income tax. Cash flow from operations doubled that year to $36 million.

   To meet growing demand for its Urban Effects products, the company has begun an expansion of its Canadian manufacturing facility.
