   Myriad Genetics is working to detect which diseases folks might develop based on their genes. The company develops and sells molecular diagnostic tests in three main areas: predictive medicine (to assess a patient's risk for developing disease), personalized medicine (to identify likelihood of drug response to therapies), and prognostic medicine (to assess risk of disease progression or recurrence). Its biggest revenue maker, BRAC
   <em>

   </em>
   , helps determine risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Myriad Genetics markets its products in the US through its own sales force and uses collaborations to sell them elsewhere.

  <p>
   The company operates through two reporting segments -- Diagnostics and Other. Diagnostics, accounting for 96% of earnings, provides testing that is designed to assess in individual's risk for developing diseases later in life, identify a patient's likelihood of responding to drug therapy and guide dosing to ensure optimal treatment, or assess a patient's risk of disease progression and disease recurrence. The Other segment (consisting of the former Research and Pharmaceutical and Clinical Services segments) provides testing products and services to research industries, research and development, and clinical services for patients; it also includes Myriad Genetics' corporate functions including finance, legal, and information technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Myriad Genetics' primary line of molecular diagnostic testing products includes BRAC
   <em>

   </em>
   , COLARIS, MELARIS, and the newest addition, myRisk Hereditary Cancer. (Launched in 2013, myRisk is expected to replace BRAC
   <em>
    Analysis
   </em>
   , COLARIS, BART, and MELARIS with a single comprehensive test.) The company markets these to physicians engaged in preventive, rather than reactive, treatments. These tests are designed to assess whether a patient's genetic makeup makes the patient more likely to develop certain cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and skin. Myriad Genetics is ramping up its sales, marketing, and education efforts aimed at OB/GYN doctors in the US, a market that targets women.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's personalized medicine line of products gauges a patient's response to certain drugs and dosages, which then helps physicians tailor treatments to the individual. The THERAGUIDE 5-FU product, through a small blood sample, shows oncologists whether a cancer patient is likely to have adverse reactions to a common chemotherapy.
  </p>
  <p>
   A third set of tests includes prognostic medicine diagnostics that assess disease progression or recurrence rates. Its PROLARIS product helps physicians predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in men.

   Based in the US, the company serves major markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In the US Myriad Genetics operates from offices and labs in Austin, Texas; Salt Lake City; and San Francisco. In Europe it has sales offices in London; Madrid; Milan, Italy; Munich, Germany; and Paris; laboratory operations in Munich; and an international headquarters in Zurich. The company has additional sales offices in Canada and Australia.

   The company's revenue, which had been on the rise for the past few years, declined 7% to $723 million in fiscal 2015 (ended June) as both segments saw decreased sales. BRAC
   <em>

   </em>
   sales dropped after a very strong showing the previous year, and the company also lost a $12 million contract. However, sales of the new VectraDA test were included for the first full fiscal year, which helped offset those declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed revenue trends, dropping 54% to $80 million in fiscal 2015. Higher cost of molecular diagnostic testing and operating expenses cut into the firm's bottom line. Likewise, cash flow from operations fell 26% to $141 million.

   In order to develop the next generation of molecular diagnostic products, Myriad Genetics continues to develop its own proprietary technologies, including bioinformatics and robotics, to better understand genes and proteins and their role in human disease. It also seeks to license or acquire biomarkers or genes from third-party organizations to augment its own in-house product development programs. In 2014 and 2015, it expanded existing collaborations with

    AstraZeneca

   and
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   , whereby its BRAC
   <em>

   </em>
   products will be used along with the other companies' diagnostic or therapeutic products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also working towards transitioning and expanding its hereditary cancer testing products from single-syndrome testing to a more accurate panel approach.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, Myriad Genetics is focused on international growth.

  <p>
   In early 2014 the company paid $270 million for autoimmune diagnostics company Crescendo Bioscience. The move gave Myriad entree into the autoimmune market and provided added product diversification. Crescendo will benefit from Myriad's superior development and sales and marketing infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, Myriad Genetics acquired Privatklinik Dr. Robert Schindlbeck, a private specialty clinic for internal medicine near its laboratories in Munich, Germany. The $20 million purchase should help the company expand its penetration in Germany's molecular diagnostic market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company bought Assurex Health, a provider of genetic testing for psychotropic medicine selection, for $226 million upfront plus a potential $185 million in milestone payments. Assurex's GeneSight diagnostic test will be Myriad's first commercial product in the neuroscience market.

   Myriad Genetics spun off its drug development operations in mid-2009. The spin-off of its drug development arm, Myriad Pharmaceuticals, into a separate, publicly traded company (called
   <company id="161274">
    Myrexis
   </company>
   ) has allowed Myriad Genetics to dedicate substantial focus on molecular diagnostics. Previously, the company had used revenue from its profitable diagnostics business to fund its drug development efforts. But with the company reaching profitability overall for the first time in 2008, it revisited the dual business structure and decided to split itself into two.
