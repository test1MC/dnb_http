   It not all about technology for Altec Industries, but technological innovations and developments do help. Altec manufactures lift trucks, digger derricks, and specialty handling equipment used by electric utility, telecommunications, and forestry industries, and various government branches. After-sale services and parts are offered worldwide, as well. Altec's used equipment is sold through sister company National Utility Equipment Co., and rented through Global Rental Co., also in the Altec family. Altec offers financing, too, through Altec Capital Services. The equipment maker's production, assembly, and service facilities crisscross Canada and the US.

   Altec is looking to expand its presence and product offerings to select US areas. Another part of Altec's growth strategy is to expand its distribution network. Ohio-based ALT Sales, a division of ALL Family of Companies, distributes Altec branded cranes. In addition to ALT, Altec's products are also distributed by Custom Truck &amp; Equipment.

   In 2015 Altec announced the opening of a new service center in Salt Lake City to meet the needs of customers in Utah and the surrounding region. The facility was acquired from Utility Equipment Specialists and will continue to provide a complete range of repair and maintenance work as well as Altec's preventative maintenance inspections.
