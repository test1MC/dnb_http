   Momenta Pharmaceuticals is seizing the moment when it comes to the development of new drugs. The biotech company specializes in unpacking and engineering complex molecules in order to copy existing biologic drugs, develop complex generic drugs, and discover new drugs. Momenta's primary product is M-Enoxaparin, a generic version of
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   's heparin drug Lovenox. The drug has received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval in was developed under an agreement with
   <company id="103281">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   . It is used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis and acute coronary syndromes. The company is also developing a generic version of biotech multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone (marketed by Sanofi and
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   ).
  </p>

        <p>
   The company's revenues slumped by 77% in 2012 due to a decrease in both product revenues and research and development revenues. The decrease in product revenues of $205.7 million (79%) and of
   <company id="103281">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   's net sales (55%) reflected a change in the contractual basis of Momenta's earned product revenues from profit share to royalty-based following the launch of a third-party competitor's generic alternative to Lovenox. Lower market share, as well as a price reduction in response to a competitor reducing prices on an M-Enoxaparin alternative also took its toll.
  </p>
        <p>
   The drop in Momenta's research and development revenues in 2012 of $3.5 million, or 28%, was due to a decrease in reimbursable manufacturing expenses associated with its M356 program (developing a generic form of Copaxone) offset by the amortization of an upfront payment from
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   , a strategic partner.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reported a net loss of $59 million in 2012 due to lower revenues and higher expenses (especially from research and development and general and administrative costs).

        <p>
   While regular generic drugs need to be reviewed and approved by the FDA, generic versions of biologic drugs (also known as "follow-on biologics") have to jump through additional hoops to prove that the facilities in which they are manufactured are fully up to the task.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sandoz, the generic arm of
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   , teamed with Momenta to develop and market M-Enoxaparin. During the development stage, this partnership was the source of all of Momenta's revenues. Once the drug was marketed, Momenta was eligible for 45% of profits from its sale as long as no other generic version of Lovenox hit the market. When that happened (in early 2012), Momenta became eligible for a percentage of royalties. Sandoz is also working with Momenta on developing its M356 product candidate.
  </p>
        <p>
   Being in the business it is (developing generic forms of existing drugs) Momenta has to have a formidable legal team in place at all times to defend itself against other pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking to protect their territory. Shortly after it began marketing Lovenox, Momenta was sued by Sanofi in an attempt to limit or completely halt sales of M-Enoxaparin. Momenta can expect more of the same to come its way when and if it gets other generic versions of successful pharmaceuticals to market.
  </p>
        <p>
   Along with M-Enoxaparin and Copaxone, Momenta is also developing a proprietary anticoagulant candidate to treat cardiovascular ailments including acute coronary syndromes. Another discovery stage program is exploring the role of complex sugars in cancer treatment.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Momenta signed a global collaboration with Baxter for the development and commercialization of follow-on biologics, including the development of M923, M834 and M511. The company is also focusing on M402, a novel heparan sulfate mimetic that binds to multiple growth factors, adhesion molecules, and chemokines to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis. In 2012, the company initiated a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical study in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        <p>
   The company occasionally expands its R&amp;D operations through acquisitions. For instance, in 2011 Momenta acquired a protein-based biotechnology platform from Virdante Pharmaceuticals for some $5 million (plus another $51 million in potential milestone payments). The purchase will help the company expand its pipeline of follow-on biologics in the field of anti-inflammatory treatments.
