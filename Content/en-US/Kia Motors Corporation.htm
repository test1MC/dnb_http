   South Korea's #2 carmaker (behind
   <company id="55281">

   ), Kia Motors produces about 3 million vehicles a year at 10 manufacturing and assembly plants in five countries which are then sold through a network of distributors and dealers covering 150 countries. Its compact Kia picanto is the second-best selling car in South Korea. Other popular models include the Forte, the Sorento, and the Soul. Kia also makes a number of commercial vehicles. Its high-capacity plants outside Korea are in the US, Slovakia, and China. After Korea, Kia's second-largest market is the US. Part of the Hyundai Kia Automotive Group, Kia operates as an affiliate of Hyundai Motor.

   Kia has established manufacturing plants in key regions, two in China (set up as joint partnerships with Yueda and

   ), a Slovakia assembly plant in Eastern Europe (that also produces Hyundai vehicles), and one in the US (in Georgia). In 2014 it invested $1 billion to launch a new manufacturing plant in Monterrey, Mexico.

   Kia is focused on edging out the competition with its stylish design that doesn't come with a European price tag. By strengthening its platform to smaller, lighter cars, Kia aims to rapidly respond to changes in consumer demand. The company markets its value in design esthetics and fuel efficiency. None of its vehicles are gas guzzlers, and its Optima sedan came with a hybrid engine option. Most of its vehicles have a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine that results in better fuel economy.

   Kia's conglomerate ownership is also fundamental to its operation. Favoring its founding family, former president of Kia, Hyundai Motors vice chairman Chung Eui-sun, is the son of Hyundai Kia Automotive Group chairman Chung Mong-koo. The elder Chung is the son of Hyundai's founder and controls the car company through a series of cross-holdings involving auto-parts maker Hyundai Mobis and steelmaker Hyundai Steel. In 2010 he stepped down from Kia Motors' board. To fill his vacancy, the role of CEO was jointly held by Kia vice chairman Chung Sung-eun and Kia president Seo Young-jong until late 2010 when Chung Sung-eun resigned amidst the recall of some 100,000 automobiles. President and COO Lee Hyoung-keun was named as Chung's replacement.

   Leadership has had other rough patches as well. A court found then-chairman Chung guilty of embezzlement and fraud in a slush fund scandal that passed corporate control and wealth from father to son, hurting shareholders' value. An appeals court suspended the chairman's prison sentence to community service, citing the executive's irreplaceable role in the company and country's economic well-being. He was subsequently pardoned by the South Korean president.
