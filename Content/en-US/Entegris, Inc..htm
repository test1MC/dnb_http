   Entegris makes products integral to the manufacture of semiconductors and computer disk drives. The company makes some 20,000 standard and custom products used to transport and protect semiconductor and disk drive materials during processing. Its semiconductor products include wafer carriers, storage boxes, and chip trays, as well as chemical delivery products, such as pipes, fittings, and valves. Its disk drive offerings include shippers, stamper cases, and transport trays. Top customers include

  <p>
   Entegris identifies its products as capital-driven (dependent on capital spending to expand manufacturing capacity) and unit-driven and consumable (products that are used or consumed in the manufacturing process). Unit-driven products, which make up nearly four-fifths of sales, include liquid filters, specialized graphite components, and wafers shippers. They provide some protection against industry cycles by providing a recurring source of revenue. Capital-driven products, 20% of revenue, include wafer process carriers and gas microcontamination control systems. Those products give the company access to more capital when chip makers retrofit or expand production facilities.

  <p>
   Entegris has manufacturing and research and development facilities in France, German, Israel, Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US. It also has sales and service offices throughout Asia and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US and Taiwan each account for 23% of the company's revenue, followed by South Korea with 14% and Japan with 12%. Combined, customers in Asia account for more than 60% of its revenue.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a direct sales force and strategic distributors serving a range of markets, including Semiconductor, Flat Panel Display Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor, Disk Data Storage, Aerospace, Solar/Clean Energy, Life Sciences, Emerging Technologies, and Water Treatment industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 sales to the company's 10 biggest customers accounted for 44% of revenue. It sold products to 2,400 companies.

   Entegris posted a 12% gain in revenue to reach $1.08 billion in 2015. The company realized $105.3 million in revenue from the ATMI acquisition. The company said the strong US dollar cost it almost $7 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit jumped sharply -- more than 900% -to $80 million in 2015 from just about $8 million in 2014. A gain related to the sale of an equity investment and lack of ATMI merger costs as well as reduced integration expenditures boosted net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Entegris had about $121 million in cash flow in 2015 compared to $126.42 million in 2014. The company carried higher inventories in 2015.

  <p>
   In order to counter the cycles of the semiconductor industry, Entegris has expanded into adjacent and ancillary markets including applications in solar, flat-panel displays, and high-purity chemicals. Non-semiconductor industries include the aerospace, biomedical, glass container, and electrical discharge machining markets. Its focus includes strategic acquisitions and partnerships and related transactions that enable it to complement its product markets and broaden its technological capabilities and product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   It expanded its operations in Taiwan to provide manufacturing capabilities to support  important customers in the region and also established sales and service offices in China in anticipation of a growing semiconductor manufacturing base in that region and expanded its presence in Singapore to enhance its global and regional management of supply chain and manufacturing processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded engineering, research, and development operations in South Korea and Taiwan in late 2015 and early 2016. Entegris said the operations are to enhance collaboration between its engineers and its customers in designing and manufacturing products.
