   Low &amp; Bonar can really spin a yarn. Operating through several segments, the company manufacturers high performance geosynthetic products and brands through its Civil Engineering segment, while its Interior and Transportation segment makes a supply of nonwovens under the Colback brand name. Building and Industrial provides a range of differentiated performance materials used in niche applications, and Coated Technical Textiles Mehler Texnologies is a supplier of coated fabrics serving numerous end markets. Sports and Leisure supply yarns to global synthetic turf producers and the woven carpet industry.

  <p>
   Low &amp; Bonar's revenues decreased 4% from 2013 to 2014 due to decreases across almost all its segments, including Building and Industrial (2%), Civil Engineering (10%), and Coated Technical Textiles (6%). In addition, its net income decreased 51% from 2013 to 2014 due to the lower revenue coupled with higher taxes paid.

  <p>
   The company's growth strategy involves geographic expansion, investments, and joint ventures. It recently invested in a new factory building in Changzhou, China, and a new non-woven geotextile factory in Tiszaujvaros, Hungary, to accelerate growth and increase capacity.
