   Headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, AMI has locations in the US and in China, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Its global research and development center in Chennai, India develops the company's new storage products. AMI is targeting resellers in the region who are more focused on products used as part of a larger IT services offering, rather than out-of-the-box distributors. Outside of the IT industry, for which India is well-known, AMI sells to such growing markets as banking and finance, government, and media.
