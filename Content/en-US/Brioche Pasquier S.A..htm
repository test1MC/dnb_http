   Perhaps it was
   <i>
    brioche
   </i>
   , not cake, that Marie Antoinette suggested the starving French people should eat. Two hundred years later, Brioche Pasquier is France's leading pastry and bread maker. Its fresh and frozen pastries are available to the masses through supermarkets in Europe. Along with its specialty breads (or Viennese breads) and breakfast pastries, Brioche makes tarts, biscotti, crackers, croutons, and desserts like
   <em>
    petit fours
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    nougat glace
   </em>
   . Acquisitions have provided leavening for Brioche Pasquier; the company expanded to Spain, where it acquired baking company Productos Recondo. The company also has subsidiaries in Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the UK.

  <p>
   The company has 17 production sites in France, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Germany, and Italy.

  <p>
   As part of its emphasis on freshness, the company has adopted a decentralized, autonomously operating production policy, building new production facilities for specific geographic markets in order to enable daily delivery of fresh baked goods

  <p>
   The bakery started in 1974 and went public on the
   <company id="100729">
    Euronext
   </company>
   stock exchange in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Brioche bought rival baker, Picard, but closed the 143-person bakery in Chateauroux. The next year, it acquired Symphone, a maker of premium frozen pastries, as well as Albatros, a maker of croutons and toasts. Brioche Pasquier delisted in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is owned by the Pasquier family.
