   AR Realisations (formerly Austin Reed) is straying from its bookish look. It makes and sells primarily menswear under the Austin Reed and AR Red names. Men's products include tailored suits and formalwear, but also jackets, slacks, casual wear, jeans, eyewear, footwear, fragrances, and accessories such as belts, cufflinks, socks, underwear, and leather goods. It makes women's products, such as upscale 1950's-inspired shirts, blouses, and matching separates, under the Austin Reed and Country Casual (CC) labels. Austin Reed is sold through some 70 namesake shops, in major department stores, and through its own Web site. Austin Reed went into administration in 2016, changing its name to AR Realisations.

  <p>
   Austin Reed has been concentrating on injecting an urban vibe to its products portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, facing a tough competitive market, in 2015 the company announced plans to close 31 UK stores in a restructuring and receive a £3 million cash injection from shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched the labels RED, Cut, 110 and Luxury for Less within Austin Reed, and Ella within Viyella.

  <p>
   In 2009, the company acquired Viyella, a womenswear retailer, out of administration with plans to keep about half of Viyella's UK shops open for business. (Viyella, which dates back to 1784, had 41 stores and 63 concessions in department stores including

   , Elys, Bentalls, and Fenwick. It also operated three outlet stores.)
  </p>
  <p>
   It launched its AR Red contemporary collection in spring 2009. The collection targets the 30-plus urban male with waistcoats, jeans, T-shirts, trousers, jackets, and ties. It made the same additions to its women's wear line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Austin Reed itself was taken over by Dawnay Day Group's Darius Capital Limited for £49 million in late 2006. Dawnay Day had already owned some 28% of the firm. The purchase involved Austin Reed, CC, and International Licensing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been trading internationally since 1929.
