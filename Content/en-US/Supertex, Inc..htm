   In many ways, Supertex is a superhero for manufacturers needing integrated circuits (ICs). The company designs and manufactures high-voltage analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) and transistors. Its ICs are used in a variety of applications, including automated test equipment, industrial electronics, flat-panel TV displays, medical ultrasound imaging equipment, printers, and telecommunications gear. Supertex touts its proprietary technologies as enabling it to combine low power consumption with high-voltage output on a single chip. About two-thirds of Supertex's sales come from customers outside the US, more than half from Asia/Pacific. In April 2014 Supertex was acquired by
   <company id="16015">
    Microchip Technology
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Supertex sees opportunities for growth within the emerging markets for ultrasound imaging equipment in China and South Korea. The market for medical imaging equipment is also growing in many African countries.

   Customers have included
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   . In addition to competing with other chip makers, Supertex at times competes with the in-house chip design and manufacturing operations of its customers.

   Rather than relying on acquisitions to fuel growth, the company depends on its ability to develop innovative products that meet customer requirements. When its products don't keep up with changes in the end markets it serves, Supertex faces lower average selling prices and higher inventory levels.

   To some extent this happened with products for the printer/EL market, where the company is a key supplier of EL drivers used to backlight cell phone keypads, watches, PDAs, and MP3 players. Though it maintains a significant share of the EL lamp market and its products are used in products where space is limited, sales of traditional cell phone handsets and PDAs have fallen with the rise in demand for smartphones and tablets. Mature markets such as the US and Europe are saturated and subject to price erosion. Supertex works with customers to design-in next-generation products while looking to expand sales of its existing components in emerging markets.
