   Acoustic guitars by C. F. Martin are so prized by collectors that they are often called the American Stradivarius. (Willie Nelson hid his Martin guitar, named "Trigger," when the IRS seized his property.) The company's limited-edition models can reach $100,000, and limited-edition signature models (with artists from Paul Simon to Beck) earn royalties for charities. C. F. Martin IV, the sixth-generation Martin to run the company, revived the once-ailing firm by expanding production facilities and creating a line of guitars under $1,000, making the brand more accessible to musicians. Its guitars are sold by dealers, such as

    Guitar Center
   </company>
   and
   <company id="44152">
    Sam Ash Music
   </company>
   . Founded in 1833, C. F. Martin is one of the oldest family-owned companies in the US.
