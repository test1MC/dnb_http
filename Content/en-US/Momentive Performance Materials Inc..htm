   MPM (dba Momentive Performance Materials) is one of the world's largest producers of silicones and silicone derivatives and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. The company manufactures silicone, quartz, and ceramic products for everything from adhesive labels to hair care products to pesticides. Silicone is used in a vast array of products because of its ability to provide resistance to heat, UV rays, chemical reactions, and friction, while allowing for different levels of adhesion. MPM operates 24 production plants around the world and serves more than 4,500 customers in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   The company's silicones segment operates three main facilities for manufacturing siloxane, a key intermediate used in making silicones. MPM manufactures silicones in Germany, Japan, and the US, and through a joint venture in China. It also buys from other suppliers when pricing is advantageous. The silicones product portfolio consists primarily fluids, silanes and resins, intermediates, elastomers, specialty coatings, room temperature vulcanizers, urethane additives, and consumer and construction sealants.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPM also is a leading fused quartz and specialty ceramics producer. Fused quartz, a man-made glass derived from quartz sand, is used in processes requiring extreme temperatures and high purity. MPM is one of the largest makers of quartz products for the semiconductor and fiber optics markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPM is a leader in several ceramic materials markets as well, including cosmetic additives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silicones represented 93% of the company's 2014 revenues, and quartz the remaining 8%.

   MPM's net sales grew by 3% in 2014 due to an increase in silicones volumes, partially offset by decreased sales from the quartz segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silcones sales increased by 5% due to volume increases and a price and mix shift/  Price and mix were positively impacted by higher sales of specialty grade products, specifically silanes, coatings, and elastomers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales of quartz in 2014 decreased by 11% due to lower demand in the specialty solar market.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPM reported a profit in 2014 after experiencing a consistent increase in losses since 2010. Net income increased by 463% in 2014 due to income before earnings from unconsolidated entities and increased revenues.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   The company's strategy for growth includes developing new products through its R&amp;D initiatives and partnership with third parties, expanding internationally in high-growth regions, and consolidating its sales and distribution infrastructures. MPM believes its scale and global reach provide efficiencies in its cost structure that give it operational, technological, and commercial advantages. It focuses on growth programs in emerging regions to offset the volatility of economic conditions. It also focuses on higher growth product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPM continues to diversify its quartz and ceramics product lines to offset the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. It also is expanding its capacity, including adding a quartz production plant in Germany, and quartz and ceramic plants in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   It intends to continue to grow internationally by expanding its sales presence around the world, primarily in the high-growth regions of Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe, India, Latin America, and the Middle East, where the usage of MPM's products is increasing.

   </company>
   construction sealants in China. In 2014 the company opened of its new automotive glazing coating facility in Leverkusen, Germany, to enable OEMs to test MPM's coating materials in an industrial scale setting. Customers will also be able to coat production-sized automobile parts in realistic climatic conditions, providing a preview of mass production. Additionally, the innovative dual technologies offering of both thermal and UV-cure capacities will provide customers the opportunity to scale up from test specimen-size to production-sized prototype testing
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, MPM announced that its US sales company, Momentive Performance Materials USA, signed new distributorship agreements with three member companies of the KODA Distribution Group (KDG). The KDG companies will serve as authorized distributors of MPM's Silanes products.
