   Since its formation in 1959, the company has sought to lead the avionics industry through its state-of-the-industry products and operations. Astronautics has grown through its success in winning US government contracts, from repair of horizontal situation video display interfaces to repair and modification of steering computers. Some of its projects have included upgrading the C-130 fleet of transport aircraft for the Brazilian air force, providing equipment for new

   aircraft, and providing network server systems for the

   fleet.
