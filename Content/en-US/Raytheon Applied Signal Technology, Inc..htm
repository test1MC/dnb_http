   Eavesdropping is big business at Raytheon Applied Signal Technology (AST). The company makes reconnaissance systems -- including receivers, processors, and software -- used by the US government and its contractors to collect and process electronic communications. Its products are used to scan and filter cell phone, ship-to-shore, microwave, and military transmissions and evaluate them for relevant information. Others are designed to collect and process radar signals for weapons systems. The company sells mostly to intelligence and military agencies, but it has some commercial clients. It is a part of the

  <p>
   James Collins, John Treichler (CTO), and Gary Yancey, all employees of reconnaissance systems maker ARGOSystems, co-founded Applied Signal Technology in 1984. Its early products were designed for the military, but with defense spending cuts in the early 1990s, the company began developing commercial products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Applied Signal went public in 1993. Two years later it teamed up with semiconductor maker VLSI Technology (now part of
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   ) to develop a chip for cable TV set-top boxes, and with Coral Systems to produce cellular call fraud-detection products.
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   tapped Applied Signal to develop modems for use with PCS digital wireless systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Applied Signal won a subcontract from
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   to participate in a joint services project to provide signal intelligence and geopositioning to airborne reconnaissance. It also grabbed a contract from Hughes Electronics for work on the Milsatcom network of military communications satellites. To expand its commercial customer segment, the company in 1998 sold 11 satellite monitoring systems to
   <company id="42607">
    PanAmSat
   </company>
   . The next year Applied Signal entered the digital radio market with a line of modem cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further its quest for commercial customers, Applied Signal in 2000 formed two subsidiaries -- eNetSecure (Internet security products) and Transcendent Technologies (network management and monitoring systems). The next year the company's sales slipped thanks to the unexpected loss of several key contracts; it responded by cutting staff by 30% and consolidating facilities. Applied Signal suffered a loss for fiscal 2001 and reintegrated the operations of its fledgling commercial subsidiaries. The company acquired electronic sensor specialist Dynamics Technology in 2005.

   In 2011 military contractor
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   acquired Applied Signal in a transaction valued at around $490 million. Applied Signal became part of Raytheon's
