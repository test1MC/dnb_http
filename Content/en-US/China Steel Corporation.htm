   There's a lot of steel on China Steel's plate. Taiwan's only integrated steelmaker and slab producer, China Steel Corporation (CSC) makes products used in items ranging from hand tools to bridges. The company's steel plates go into ships; wire rods become nuts, bolts, and hand tools; steel sheets end up as auto parts; cold-rolled coils are used in steel furniture and home appliances. CSC also makes hot-rolled bands, coils, sheets, and hot-rolled pickled and oiled coil. China Steel, which conducts the majority of its business in Taiwan, began as a private enterprise, later became a state-owned corporation, and then was re-privatized (though the government retainsÂ just less than a quarter stake in the company).
