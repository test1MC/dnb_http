   InterDigital is more than just interested in wireless digital telecommunications. The company develops and licenses circuitry designs, software, and other technology using CDMA (code-division multiple access) and other wireless communications standards. Altogether, it holds a patent portfolio of about 2,200 US patents and 10,900 foreign patents. InterDigital licenses its technology patents to companies that make smartphones, tablets, notebook computers and wireless personal digital assistants, as well as wireless infrastructure equipment, such as base stations, and components, dongles, and modules for wireless devices. Top customers include

  <p>
   InterDigital operates from six research and development offices in the US, one in Canada, one in the UK and one in South Korea. \
  </p>
  <p>
   Taiwan is its biggest market, generating about half of revenue. South Korea, the US, and Japan account for 16%, 15%, and 12% of revenue, respectively.

   Historically, the company generates most of its revenues from Asia, where the world's electronics are manufactured. The US accounts for one-third of sales. It also relies on a small number of customers - in 2015,
   <company id="162186">
    Pegatron
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41463">
    Samsung
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="43635">
    Sony Corporation of America
   </company>
   combined accounted for 60% of sales.

  <p>
   InterDigital's revenue rose 6% in 2015 to $441 million from $415 million in 2014. The company had higher per-unit royalties in 2015, driven by more shipments to Pegatron. It also saw a rise in fixed-fee revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 14% hitting $119 million in 2015, compared to $104 million in 2014. The company had lower administration and licensing expenses in 2015. Litigation expenses decreased to $31 million in 2015 from $52 million and $75 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $114 million in 2015, down from $242 million the previous year.

   As a patent licensing firm, InterDigital must continually expand its pool of licensing customers to continue its growth, and the company has a limited number of licensees contributing most of its revenues. InterDigital must also spend money on developing patentable technologies, and it has had to litigate to defend the patents it holds, for years at a time in some cases. In mid-2014 it settled with Samsung over mobile technology royalties for Samsung's 3G and 4G products. Over the next five years InterDigital will receive millions from Samsung.
  </p>
  <p>
   InterDigital is developing technologies for 5G wireless networks and the Internet of Things. In 2015 it launched the MPOWER platform, which enables interoperability and scalability across verticals, networks, and devices. It renewed a joint venture with Sony and Convida Wireless for development in 5G and the Internet of Things.
  </p>
  <p>
   InterDigital's R&amp;D spending was $73 million in 2015, $75 million in 2014, and $65 million in 2013.

  <p>
   InterDigital was founded in 1972 as International Mobile Machines Corporation by Sherwin Seligsohn, who was its chairman until 1990. It began to develop technologies that held the potential to revolutionize radiotelephone communications, but as a small company unable to usher in the digital age on its own, the company patented its inventions. It went public in 1981, which allowed it to expand into product development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its technology portfolio by acquiring the assets of Tantivy Communications, a designer of CDMA-based and other wireless gear, in 2003 for $11.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interdigital worked with
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   at the turn of the century to develop Internet access technology for mobile phones. A legal dispute between the two companies over the amount of royalties Nokia owed was resolved in InterDigital's favor in 2005, when a US District Court judge upheld an international tribunal's verdict ordering Nokia to pay additional royalties to InterDigital. In 2006 Nokia agreed to pay $253 million in one lump sum to InterDigital, and the companies agreed to end their litigation against each other. Nokia and InterDigital immediately terminated their original license agreement and began negotiating a new pact.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those talks apparently came to naught, as InterDigital in 2007 filed a complaint against Nokia with the US International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging that Nokia's handsets infringe on patents held by InterDigital. The company sought to ban sales in the US of the Nokia N75 model and any other handsets that infringe on InterDigital patents. InterDigital separately filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Nokia in US District Court, in Delaware. Nokia said it would vigorously defend against both actions.
