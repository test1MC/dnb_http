   Panasonic has been one of the world's most prolific electronics manufacturers since 1919. The company spans multiple fields: Its consumer business consists of AVC (audio, video, and communications) equipment, along with hardware and software for linking it together, and home appliances (washing machines, vacuum cleaners, personal grooming aids, and commercial HVAC). In the field of devices, Panasonic covers multimedia and eco-car equipment, industrial electronic components, and batteries. The company's solutions equipment targets environmentally conscience businesses, manufacturers, and health care firms.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products and services in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Japan accounts for just over 50% of net sales, while other major markets include North and South America (16%) and Europe (10%).

  <p>
   Within the company's businesses are five segments: automotive and industrial systems (34% of net sales), appliances (23%), eco solutions (20%), AVC networks (14%), and other (9%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Panasonic is financially diversified across its segments, with the digital AVC networks segment consisting of imaging equipment, AVC network equipment such as flat-panel TVs, blu-ray disc recorders, digital cameras, notebook PCs, projectors, and in-flight entertainment systems. Its appliances segment manufactures products like air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, and other home appliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eco solutions supplies lighting fixtures, electric lamps, wiring devices, solar photovoltaic systems, interior furnishing materials, water-related products, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, and air purifiers, among other products. The automotive and industrial segment maintains a broad spectrum of expertise across car-use-multimedia-related equipment, automotive electronics, electronics components, automation controls, electronic materials, semiconductors, batteries systems, optical devices, and manufacturing facility systems.

  <p>
   Panasonic's consumer products are mainly sold to mass-merchandisers through sales subsidiaries. Housing products are sold through agencies and sales subsidiaries. AVC networks products are sold through retail distributors, logistics service providers and public institutions. The company also markets its products through print ads and TV commercials.

  <p>
   Panasonic's overall sales for fiscal 2015 (ends March 31) declined marginally by under 1% due to declines from its appliances and eco solutions segments. These segments were negatively affected by weakening demand after a consumption tax hike and a negative impact from sharp price declines of TVs in Japan.

   In Japan, Panasonic is expanding into the housing improvement market, where future growth is expected. In addition to renovating its showrooms in Japan to make them more compatible with the housing improvement market and targeting new customers, the company is strengthening its direct marketing to clients through PanaHome Reform Corporation, which was established in 2014.

  <p>
   The company is using acquisitions as a means for growth within its satellite-based communications portfolio. In 2015 it acquired ITC Global, a provider of satellite communication services for the energy, mining, and maritime markets. With regional headquarters in Houston; Sion, Switzerland; and Perth, Australia, ITC Global serves customers at more than 1,200 remote sites across 70 countries and all the world's oceans.

  <p>
   Grade school dropout Konosuke Matsushita took $50 in 1918 and went into business making electric plugs (with his brother-in-law, Toshio Iue, founder of
   <company id="41882">
    SANYO
   </company>
   ). His mission, to help people by making high-quality, low-priced conveniences while providing his employees with good working conditions, earned him the sobriquet, "god of business management." Matsushita Electric Industrial grew by developing inexpensive lamps, batteries, radios, and motors in the 1920s and 1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII the Japanese government ordered the firm to build wood-laminate products for the military. Postwar occupation forces prevented Matsushita from working at his firm for four years. Thanks to unions' efforts, he rejoined his namesake company shortly before it entered a joint venture with Dutch manufacturer
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   in 1952. The following year it moved into consumer goods, making televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines and later expanding into high-performance audio products. Matsushita bought a majority stake in
   <company id="56294">
    Victor Company of Japan
   </company>
   (JVC, originally established by
   <company id="104667">
    RCA
   </company>
   Victor) in 1954. Its 1959 New York subsidiary opening began Matsushita's drive overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sold under the National, Panasonic, and Technics names, the firm's products were usually not cutting-edge but were attractively priced. Under Masaharu Matsushita, the founder's son-in-law who became president in 1961, the company became Japan's largest home appliance maker, introducing air conditioners, microwave ovens, stereo components, and VCRs in the 1960s and 1970s. JVC developed the VHS format for VCRs, which beat out Sony's Betamax format.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matsushita built much of its sales growth on new industrial and commercial customers in the 1980s. The company expanded its semiconductor, office and factory automation, auto electronics, audio-visual, housing, and air-conditioning product offerings that decade. Konosuke died in 1989.
