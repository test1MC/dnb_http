   Prairie Farms Dairy is very cooperative. With some 700 dairy farmer/members, the cooperative offers a full line of retail and food service dairy products. It turns raw milk into fresh, fluid, cultured, and frozen dairy products under the Prairie Farms label. It also makes juices and ice cream novelties. The company's customers include food, drug, and convenience stores, mass merchandisers, schools, restaurants, and other food service operators. Located in Carlinville, Illinois, it is the managing partner for joint ventures with smaller regional dairies. It makes its products at 24 Prairie Farms-owned plants and 13 joint-venture plants, which are located throughout the midwestern and southern areas of the US.

   In addition to manufacturing diary foods, co-packing is a big part of Prairie Farms' operation. Approximately 50% of the co-operative's sales come from packing non-Prairie Farm brands. The co-op's PFD Supply and GMS Transportation non-dairy subsidiaries distribute products for fast-food chains, including

  <p>
   The cooperative dates back to 1932, when Illinois farmers formed a statewide organization, Illinois Producers Creameries, to market and sell cream. In 1938 it became Prairie Farms Dairy.
