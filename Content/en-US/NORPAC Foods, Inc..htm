   NORPAC Foods has built a business putting fruits and vegetables into portable packages. The company is a 240-member-strong, grower-owned cooperative that produces frozen and canned fruits and vegetables, as well as soup and pasta mixes. Products are marketed under the FLAV-R-PAC, NORPAC, WEST-PAK, Soup Supreme, and Pasta Perfect labels. It sorts, processes, and packages growers' products in processing plants located in the Northwestern US. NORPAC Foods sells its foods to US foodservice companies, retail grocers, club stores, and food makers. The company also exports products to Canada, Latin America, Puerto Rico, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. NORPAC Foods was formed by a group of Oregon farmers in 1924.

   NORPAC has been working to better position itself for growth. In 2013 the company relocated its headquarters to Salem, Oregon, to be near its packaging facility. As part of the plan, in 2014 it constructed a 260,000-sq.-ft. frozen food storage and distribution facility adjacent to its packaging facility there. To boot, NORPAC anticipates logging energy and cost savings as a result.
