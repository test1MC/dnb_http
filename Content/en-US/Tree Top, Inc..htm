   Tree Top has towered over the Pacific Northwest's apple juice market for more than 50 years. The grower-owned cooperative's 1,000 members cultivate and harvest thousands of tons of apples and pears each year to make a slew of juicy products. The co-op produces the Tree Top brand of apple and blended fruit juices and applesauce, among many offerings, for consumers and food service vendors. It also processes dehydrated and frozen fruit products for food makers worldwide through its ingredients unit. Tree Top operates production facilities in Washington, Oregon, and California, and distributes its products through various channels, including retailers and brokers, in the US and several international markets.

  <p>
   The company has seven Tree Top manufacturing facilities located in Selah, Wenatchee, and Prosser, Washington; Medford, and Woodburn, Oregon; and Oxnard, California. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwest Naturals, is located in Bothell, Washington.

   Beyond juice, Tree Top supplies a wide variety of bulk dried, chilled, frozen apple, and frozen cherry ingredients to food manufacturers. Reportedly, it supplies ingredients to more than 20 of the top 25 US food companies for such applications as baked and frozen desserts, cold and hot cereals, yogurt, fruit fillings, and fruit smoothies. In this vein, the co-op also owns

   , a leading supplier of juice concentrates for the beverage industry, and
   <company id="128033">

   , which manufactures fruit purees, concentrates, flakes and bases used by food companies in the US.

   To grow, Tree Top must compete with beverage giants
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="103458">
    Dr Pepper Snapple Group
   </company>
   , which have responded to consumers' health concerns with a stream of new juices and other noncarbonated beverages. Although Tree Top's apple juice and cider account for the majority of its sales, it has stepped up its marketing efforts, bringing out new product varieties, including low-calorie and reduced-sugar selections, blended juices, flavored applesauce, bagged fresh apple slices, and fruit snacks, as well as increasing its advertising.
