   OmniVision Technologies gets the big picture with a single chip. The fabless semiconductor company designs semiconductor image sensors (CameraChips) that capture and convert images for cameras, mobile phones, notebooks, webcams, surveillance equipment, and medical imaging systems, among other applications. Its CameraCubeChip device combines the company's image sensors with wafer-level optics for a complete camera module. OmniVision outsources manufacturing chores to silicon foundries (contract semiconductor manufacturers), primarily

   (TSMC). Most sales are from Asia, predominantly China. OmniVision was acquired by a group of private equity firms in early 2016.

  <p>
   OmniVision was purchased for $1.9 billion by a consortium of private equity firms based in China. They are a Hua Capital Management, CITIC Capital Holdings, and GoldStone Investment.

  <p>
   Asia is OmniVision's largest market, with China accounting for nearly 80% of sales; South Korea, Singapore, and Japan together contribute some 14%. The US accounted for just 1% of sales in 2015 (ended April).

  <p>
   Manufacturers and value-added resellers account about three-fourths of OmniVision's sales, while distributors make up the rest. Components manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group contributes about 14% of sales and Ningbo Optech Company accounts for 11%.

   After two straight years of revenue growth, OmniVision stumbled in 2015 (ended April) with a 5% decline. It finished the year with $1.38 billion revenue, off from $1.45 billion in 2014. The company's products fetched lower average selling prices in the face of price erosion throughout the market and the introduction of new, lower-priced products. There was, however, an uptick in shipments of chips for products used in mobile phones, security and surveillance cameras, and in automotive applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income also dropped in 2015 to $93.4 million from $95 million. The lower revenue was compounded by higher spending on research and development and general expenses. Cash flow from operations fell to about $75 million in 2015 from $162 million in 2014.

   OmniVision depends on sales to customers in many markets (automotive, entertainment, mobile phone, notebook) that are particularly vulnerable to periods of economic turmoil. In addition, much of OmniVision's business is in mobile phones, a highly competitive market with a handful of leading manufacturers. The company must continually develop and introduce new products for the market to remain competitive with its industry rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   OmniVision continues to focus on mobile phones, its biggest market, and look for growth in China and India as phone use spreads in the those countries. The company also has its eye on maintaining growth in the automotive business, which surpassed notebook computers an entertainment as its second-biggest market. OmniVision has developed products for 360-degree view and backup cameras in vehicles and is developing machine vision products, which would be engineered into self-driving cars.
