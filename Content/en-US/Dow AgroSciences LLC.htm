   Dow AgroSciences is all about growth -- crop growth to be exact. The
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   subsidiary operates as part of its parent's Agricultural Sciences operating segment, developing crop protection products, such as insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fumigants for agricultural, industrial, and commercial pest control. Its seed technology business, called Seeds, Traits, &amp; Oils, develops genetically modified (GM), resilient seeds and healthy oils like canola. With a broad product portfolio, other offerings include vegetation management and turf products. Its AgroFresh unit makes chemicals to keep fruits, vegetables, and flowers fresh.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company works with strategic partners to find and develop breakthrough products and services, such as innovative hybrids and seed varieties, crop-enhancing traits, crop-protection products, residential pest control, healthy oils, and turf and ornamental varieties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow splits its Agricultural Sciences division into Crop Protection and Seeds, Traits, and Oils. The division contributes about 13% of overall sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dow AgroSciences serves customers in North America, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA), Latin America, and Asia. The company generates sales in more than 130 countries worldwide and has about 60 global R&amp;D sites in 20 countries along with about 60  manufacturing sites, mostly in North and South America.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 Dow AgroSciences' revenues grew by 13% thanks to a 10% volume increase and a 3% price rise. North America reported a 27% sales growth. Latin America and Asia Pacific also reported strong returns. Sales of Seeds, Traits and Oils increased 27% thanks to strong growth in the corn, soybean and healthy oils portfolios. SmartStax technology sales more than doubled, driven by the introduction of POWERCORE Insect Trait Technology (Latin America) and REFUGE ADVANCED (North America). New Crop Protection product sales went up 19% led by spinetoram insecticide (up by50%) and aminopyralid herbicide and pyroxsulam herbicide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 revenue improved 12% based on new products along with a slight price increase. Seeds, Traits, and Oils lead with a nearly 20% increase across all major crop groups while Crop Protection posted a 14% gain on new product sales. Geographically, Latin America took top spots with a 21% growth in revenue while North America followed with 13%.

   At Dow AgroSciences, R&amp;D is king. It has approximately 1,800 researchers working in more than 40 countries worldwide. It conducts its own research, as well as research in conjunction with universities, government-sponsored research institutes, and private companies around the globe. Collaborations enable it to bring new agricultural products and technologies to market. Its R&amp;D programs are specifically focused on developing crop protection chemicals, plant genetics, and newer platforms like healthy oils. In 2013 the company opened a new 175,000-square-foot R&amp;D facility near its headquarters.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of Dow AgroSciences' major initiatives is to commercialize its Enlist Weed Control System, which cultivates herbicide tolerance in crops like corn and soybeans. Enlist is a next-generation system that is seen as a replacement for global seed leader
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   's Roundup Ready, which is widely used by farmers on their crops but over time has begun to show signs of weakness as weeds have grown resistant to the herbicide. Dow AgroSciences launched Enlist in corn in Canada and the US in 2013. (Certain scientists, meanwhile, contend that Enlist itself may unleash a next generation of superweeds such as Roundup Ready did. This could cause farmers to react by using even higher doses of the herbicide and result in potentially harmful ecological repercussions).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, Dow AgroSciences launched POWERCORE in Brazil to control major pests in corn in that country.
  </p>
  <p>
   As with several of its competitors, including Monsanto, Dow AgroSciences often uses technology collaborations to push new product development and launches. In 2013 it teamed up with Meiji Seika Pharma to co-develop and commercialize a new fungicide within a new class of chemistry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it announced a three-year, multi-program research agreement with BioDuro, a unit of
   <company id="47793">
    Pharmaceutical Product Development
   </company>
   , to discover novel molecules for crop protection.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 the company bought California-based Cal/West Seeds, a supplier of alfalfa, clover, and other crops to seed companies and growers in the the US, Canada, and elsewhere. With a strong genetics program, Cal/West complements the Dairyland Seeds alfalfa business and research programs to make Dow AgroSciences' forages business one of the largest in the industry. The company renamed its alfalfa unit as Alforex Seeds in 2013.

  <p>
   In 2011 Dow AgroSciences acquired the Prairie Brand Seed brand and its marketing assets from Iowa-based Sansgaard Seed Farms. Dow AgroSciences operates the company as a subsidiary and independently markets corn and soybean seed under the Prairie Brand. Also in 2011 the company expanded its wheat portfolio with the acquisition of Washington state-based Northwest Plant Breeding Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The business unit began in 1989 as a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly (called DowElanco); Dow Chemical acquired Eli Lilly's share in 1997 and renamed the operation Dow AgroSciences the next year. Also in 1998 the company bought Mycogen Seeds, beginning its GM seeds business. Since then it has acquired business lines from Cargill (hybrid seeds) and Rohm and Haas (agrochemicals) in its quest to build a globally diverse company.
