   Counter-intuitive though it seems, you can clean up water by throwing a bunch of chemicals into it, and that's exactly what BWA Water Additives does. The company manufactures industrial water treatment chemicals, desalination products, and membrane systems for water treatment. BWA is among the world's top producers of bromine-based biocides and manufactures a number of other water treatment chemicals used in desalination and oil recovery processes. Its products are sold under the brands Belclene, Belcor, Belgard, Bellacide, Bellasol, Belsperse, BromiCide, Flocon, and Spersal. BWA operates manufacturing locations and technology and development centers around the world.

It also continued its global rollout of Flocon 885, the industry's first and only highly biodegradable, phosphorus free, and nitrogen free antiscalant for reverse osmosis membranes. This product is readily biodegradable in salt water conditions, and inherently biodegradable in fresh water conditions.
