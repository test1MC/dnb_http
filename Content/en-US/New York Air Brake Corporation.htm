   Everyone knows it's hard to stop a train, but that doesn't discourage New York Air Brake. The company (NYAB) makes brakes and related train-control equipment; it also provides repair services and replacement parts and sells its freight and locomotive air brake control systems to the rail transportation industry. Its Premtec division builds end-of-car and specialty hose assemblies as well as associated air hose products. In addition, its Train Dynamic Systems unit has expertise in train dynamics and training simulators. NYAB is a unit of Germany's

   As a part of a realignment strategy, in 2013 the company shut down operations of Knorr Brake Limited, which manufactured locomotive braking systems, among other things. The initiative was made to improve total cost structure and align its manufacturing facilities with a more optimal focus.
