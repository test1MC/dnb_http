   Always whisky-focused, The Glenmorangie Company takes its love for single malt Scotch to unparalleled heights. Glenmoragie's Highland distillery boasts the tallest stills in Scotland, said to ensure that the distilled spirit is purer, lighter, and more elegant than any rival. Its range of distilled spirits, tended by generations of 16 craftsmen from Tain, is sold worldwide under the Glenmorangie brand in Original, 18- and 25-year old bottlings, and extra-matured and special cask bottlings. It also owns the Ardberg brand from Islay as well as operates the inn/resort, Glenmorangie House. Founded in 1893 as the Macdonald &amp; Muir, Glenmorangie has been part of Louis Vuitton MoÃ«t Hennessy (

    LVMH
   </company>
   ) since 2005.

  <p>
   The company operates in the Wines &amp; Spirits segment of its parent company (which contributes about 14% of
   <company id="41804">

   </company>
   's annual revenues).

  <p>
   Glenmorangie's strategy for growth is based on raising the premium status of single malt whisky around the globe. It has debuted several trophy-style offshoots from its cabinet of private edition whiskies, sold for roughly $3,600 a bottle.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Glenmorangie released the latest in its Private Edition range of limited-edition single malts, giving a spicy twist to its original recipe with a barley not normally used for making whisky.

  <p>
   Under LVMH's stewardship, the company has expanded its presence both through promotion as a luxury product and competition. It has won some 18 'Gold Best in Class' medals at the International Wines and Spirit Competition, more than any other single malt Scotch whisky. In 2011 it was named top UK spirits distiller of the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glenmorangie led the process of finishing whiskies in a variety of wine casks coupled with ultra-premium presentation to support its claim to quality and careful handling. Its accelerated distillery pace was matched by a multi-million-pound investment to construct and open a new bottling facility in 2011.
