   Century-old Lane Furniture Industries got its start as a maker of cedar chests. From a chest-manufacturing venture, the company expanded to become a manufacturer of mid-priced living room furniture, including sofas, sectionals, and chairs, as well as a reclining furniture and home entertainment seating. The company also makes outdoor furniture under the Lane Venture brand. Its Lane home furnishings are sold nationwide through specialty retailers (such as

    Macy's
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10463">

   ). Lane Furniture was established in 1912 by John Lane and his son Ed. Today, the company is part of newly-formed Heritage Home Group, owned by
