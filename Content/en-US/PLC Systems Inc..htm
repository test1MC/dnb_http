   PLC Systems guards kidneys against ill effects of dehydration and toxic medicines. Its RenalGuard system, marketed in Europe, is a fluid balancing device that helps physicians monitor and maintain kidney fluid levels during medical imaging procedures. The company also developed the Heart Laser System, a carbon dioxide laser system that performs Transmyocardial Revascularization (or TMR) as an alternative to such conventional therapies as bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty. PLC sold the TMR business to

   in 2011 for $1.6 million, to focus on development of RenalGuard for the US market.

   After working as a scientist for Raytheon, Robert Rudko formed Laser Engineering, Inc. (now PLC Medical Systems) in 1981 to develop carbon dioxide lasers for medical uses. In 1989 Rudko began developing a laser for the San Francisco Heart Institute; a year later the company began testing it on heart patients who had no other treatment options.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise capital, Rudko in 1992 formed a joint venture with Canadian investment firm PLC Systems, which then listed Laser Engineering on the Vancouver stock exchange. That year Rudko took over PLC (the Canadians retained a minority stake), acquired Laser Engineering in a stock swap, and then folded the joint venture. He then listed PLC's shares on the American Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clinical trials expanded into Europe and Asia through 1996. In 1997 an FDA panel rejected the device for premarket approval pending further study (the company's stock plunged, and stockholder suits ensued). The next year the FDA approved the laser for commercialization; in 1999 the product was approved for both Medicare and Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage. Also that year PLC began marketing the Heart Laser System in Europe and South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company launched physician training programs in Houston and Seattle to augment its flagship program in Chicago. A study released that year questioned whether the laser procedure helped patients at all, and indicated that perceived benefits might be the result of an exaggerated placebo effect.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 PLC won approval from the FDA for its Heart Laser 2 product. In 2008 the company won approval to begin testing its second group of products, the RenalGuard system.
