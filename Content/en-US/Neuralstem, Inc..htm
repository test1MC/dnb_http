   Neuralstem is using human neural stem cells to find treatments for central nervous disorders. The company uses a proprietary technology to produce commercial quantities of brain and spinal cord stem cells that are used to develop potential treatments for Lou Gehrig's disease (also known as ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, and stroke. Its spinal cord stem cells are part of the first

   -approved ALS stem cell clinical trial. Neuralstem also has a class of small molecule compounds that it is developing into oral drugs. The first, NSI-189, is undergoing trials to treat major depression. These compounds may also be developed for Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

   The company primarily relies on sales of securities, credit facilities, and the exercise of warrants and options to fund its activities. To a lesser extent, it receives earnings from grants, research contracts, and licensing. Neuralstem hasn't generated significant revenue from product sales. Revenue fell 83% to $83,800 in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neuralstem has also operated at a loss as it covers research and development and product development expenses. Its 2014 net loss increased 14% to $23 million. At the end of the year, its accumulated deficit totaled $151 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also increased, growing 11% to $12 million that year.

   Neuralstem is among a number of biotherapeutics companies operating in the field of regenerative medicine or cell therapy, which refers to disease and injury treatments that are founded on the concept of producing new cells to replace malfunctioning or dead ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company began transitioning the manufacturing of its spinal cord stem cells to its own in-house operations. By taking on that function, it can produce the number of cells necessary for its various trials while also establishing the infrastructure to commercially manufacture the cells down the road.
