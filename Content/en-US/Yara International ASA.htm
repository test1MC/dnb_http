   Yara International has its feet firmly planted in fertilizer. The global chemical company converts energy, natural minerals, and nitrogen into fertilizers for farmers and other products for industrial and environmental use. With sales in 150 countries, Yara's main activities are large-scale ammonia and fertilizer production in Europe, though more recently it is adding capacity in regions with low-cost gas supplies. It is the largest producer of ammonia in the world. Yara also provides local customer service and agronomical support, helping farmers improve crop yields and quality.

  <p>
   The company's net revenues have been growing over the past few years. Yara's net revenues increased by 12% in 2014 due to an 11% increase in fertilizer sales volumes and higher premiums and a 5% increase in industrial sales volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yara's net income increased by 30% in 2014 due to higher net revenues and a change in inventories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash inflow decreased by 30% in 2014 due to changes in working capital as a result of changes in inventories, changes in receivables, and prepaid expenses and other current assets.

   To raise cash, in 2015 Yara agreed to sell its stake in GrowHow UK Group Limited for $648 million.

  <p>
   In 2014 Yara acquired control of Brazil-based Galvani. The deal complements Yara's downstream presence in Brazil (which has included the purchase of
   <company id="58878">
    Bunge
   </company>
   's fertilizer division), and further strengthens Yara's position in the world's fastest growing agricultural region.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also bought OFD Holding Inc, which has production facilities in Cartagena, Colombia and distribution companies across Latin America. The enterprise value is $377 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its emissions control business, in 2014 Yara acquired a majority 63% stake in Green Tech Marine, a leading sulphur oxide (SOX) scrubber supplier to the marine industry. Combining GTM with Yara's existing nitrogen oxide (NOX) portfolio will help the maritime industry clean up their emissions.
