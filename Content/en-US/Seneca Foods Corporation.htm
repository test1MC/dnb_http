   Seneca Foods has a can-do attitude. The company is one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of canned vegetables. Its canned (as well as frozen and bottled) produce lineup is sold under numerous private labels, and national and regional brands, such as Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen, Libby's, Seneca, and Stokely, that the company owns or licenses. Customers are primarily big grocery chains and some export markets, and food service operators and food processors, including
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   (GMOL). Seneca also supplies frozen fruit and vegetables to primarily private-label retail and food service customers, and GMOL. A short list of fruit and snack chip products are sold to retailers and food processors.

  <p>
   New York-based Seneca Foods rings up about 90% of its sales in the US. Export customers in some 90 countries account for the remainder.
  </p>

  <p>
   Seneca's operations rely on contracts with independent growers to supply its fruits and vegetables. Expediently, its facilities -- some 20 processing plants, two can manufacturing plants, two seed processing operations, and a small farm -- are located in major vegetable and fruit producing states: California, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin. The company packs Green Giant, Le Sueur, and other brands of canned vegetables as well as select Green Giant frozen vegetables for General Mills under a long-term alliance agreement.

  <p>
   In 2013, approximately 11% of Seneca's packaged food sales were packed for retail customers under the company's branded labels of Seneca®, Libby's®, Aunt Nellie's®, Read®, and Seneca Farms®. About 25% of packaged foods sales were packed for institutional food distributors and 51% were retail packed under the private label of our customers.  The remaining 13% was sold under the Alliance Agreement with General Mills Operations, LLC (GMOL).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 (ended March), Seneca Foods reported sales of $1.34 billion, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The company credited an increase in frozen food sales, along with increases in fruit sales (due in part to the acquisition of Independent Foods in January), GMOL sales, and canned vegetable sales, among other products. Despite the sales gain, net income tumbled 67% over the same period to $13.8 million. Higher commodity costs, along with lower selling prices and increases in other expenses, squeezed margins in 2013.

  <p>
   Seneca's strategy for growth has included a ramp up in production efficiency as it balances supply with demand. It also relies on acquisitions to grow its business. Indeed, during its 65 years in business, Seneca has made more than 50 strategic acquisitions to expand its dominance in the processed vegetable and fruit industry and leverage distribution capacity.

  <p>
   In January 2013, Seneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the membership interest in Independent Foods, LLC, a packer of canned pears, apples and cherries based in Sunnyside, Washington, for $5 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Founder and chairman Arthur Wolcott and president and CEO Kraig Kayser and their families control approximately 30% of the company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Arthur Wolcott and his father purchased the Dundee Grape Juice Co. in 1949. The company went public in the 1950s but has long been notorious for behaving more like a tight-lipped private firm. It merged in 1971 with a textile and paint business run by one of its investors, Julius Kayser. Two years later the company, then Seneca Grape Juice Corp., bought food company S.S. Pierce, including its mushroom canning business; it took that name in 1977. The company acquired Nestlé's Libby vegetable business in 1982 and was renamed Seneca Foods in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraig Kayser, Julius' son, joined the company in 1991 and was named CEO in 1993. That year Seneca Foods divested itself of all nonfood operations except for its tiny charter airline. In 1995 it purchased six vegetable processing plants from Grand Metropolitan's Pillsbury unit and entered into a 20-year agreement to supply its Green Giant line of canned and frozen vegetables.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company acquired Grand Met's Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen unit and the private-label canned vegetable business of Curtice-Burns. After three years of losses, Seneca Foods sold most of its juice operations (TreeSweet and Awake brands and the Seneca brand license) to
   <company id="14277">
    Northland Cranberries
   </company>
   for about $30 million in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm sold its nonbranded specialty fruit concentrate business and Seneca applesauce license to
   <company id="58876">
    Tree Top Inc.
   </company>
   in 1999 for about $29 million. Seneca Foods also bought a private-label canned vegetable business in the Midwest from
   <company id="42633">
    Pro-Fac Cooperative
   </company>
   that year for about $48 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new private-label business, combined with better prices and Y2K-induced hoarding, helped boost Seneca's sales in 2000. That year the company obtained the rights to sell the Libby brand of products internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales in 2001 were weaker, despite its introduction of raspberry-flavored pickled beets. The company moved its headquarters to Marion, New York, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Seneca purchased Chiquita Processed Foods (CPF), the vegetable canning subsidiary of
   <company id="11551">
    Chiquita Brands International
   </company>
   , for $110 million in cash, stock, and debt assumption. The sale involved 12 US processing plants in the upper Midwest and West. Later that year Seneca sold off four of the former Chiquita canning plants to
   <company id="111938">
    Lakeside Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Seneca Foods' 20-year alliance agreement with General Mills (begun in 1995) prompted it to shift its focus to vegetable production. (The company divested its juice, applesauce, and flavorings businesses.) However, it still continues to expand its fruit product lines. In 2006 Seneca acquired Signature Fruit, a producer of shelf-stable fruit products, for $20 million in cash and $25 million in stock.
