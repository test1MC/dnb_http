   No pulp fiction here -- the story of Clearwater Paper is clearly fact. The company produces solid bleach sulfate paperboard, consumer tissue products, lumber, and hardwood and softwood pulp. Business is divided into two primary divisions: Its Pulp and Paperboard segment manufactures paperboard (used to make packaging for foods, liquids, pharmaceuticals, and toiletries) and pulp (consumed internally to make paperboard and tissues). A Consumer Products arm produces a private label tissue, largely for grocery chains. Most of Clearwater sales are made in the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Clearwater has about 15 manufacturing locations and about 10 converting facilities spanning the US and Canada. The US accounted for 94% of its total revenues in 2014.

  <p>
   Clearwater's operations are divided into two primary segments: Consumer Products (around 60% of total sales) sells its line of at-home and away-from-home tissue products and Pulp and Paperboard (40%) makes its bleached paperboard used in packaging products.
  </p>

  <p>
   Clearwater's paperboard is sold to packaging converters domestically through sales offices located throughout the country, with a smaller percentage channeled through distribution to commercial printers. International paperboard sales are conducted via sales agents.

  <p>
   In 2014 Clearwater achieved a historic milestone when it posted $1.97 billion in total revenue. The historic growth was fueled by a 6% spike in Pulp and Paperboard sales and a 3% bump in Consumer Products sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Clearwater in 2014 posted its first net loss in ten years of $2 million primarily due to a $40 million loss on divested assets and other expenses. The company also recorded an income tax provision during 2014 as opposed to an income tax benefit the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clearwater's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the last five years with continuous declines in 2010 and 2011 followed by growth in 2012 and another drop in 2013. Cash flow remained relatively flat in 2014 due to a decrease in cash flows used for working capital driven by a year-end increase in inventories beyond its normal cyclical amounts, which resulted from labor slowdowns at West Coast shipping ports.

  <p>
   Clearwater is continuing to grow its business and streamline its operations through business acquisitions, capital investments, and plant closings. In 2014 it shut down a tissue converting and distribution facility in Long Island, New York. The year before, it closed its Thomaston, Georgia, tissue converting and distribution facility. The closings are part of its strategy to consolidate regional plants to achieve short-term and long-term cost savings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014 the company sold its specialty business and mills for $108 million to Dunn Paper. It is reinvesting the money into capital projects within its Consumer Products division. The transaction included the sale of five Clearwater Paper subsidiaries.
