   Orexigen Therapeutics thinks it has the skinny on how to stay trim. The company is developing drugs, under the names Contrave and Empatic (formerly Excalia), intended for use by obese people who are trying to get a grip on the urge to over-eat. The products are designed to control appetite from the central nervous system; they contain some of the same chemicals used in drugs approved for the treatment of smoking, alcoholism, and opiate addiction. The development-stage company is conducting late-stage clinical trials on its top two drug candidates. Orexigen was formed in 2002 and went public in 2012.

  <p>
   Orexigen Therapeutics is using the $50 million in IPO proceeds to fund its clinical trials for Contrave and Empatic.

  <p>
   The company uses
   <company id="59997">
    Patheon Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for its manufacturing needs during trials and will use the company for at least part of its commercial production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orexigen also has drug candidates in earlier stages of development for ailments including obsessive-compulsive disorder and weight gain associated with taking antipsychotic drugs.

  <p>
   The company has an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company to commercialize Contrave in North America. It retains the other rights to Contrave and all rights to Empatic. Upon FDA approval, the company intends to market its products to primary care doctors and some specialty physicians either through direct sales or through a collaboration agreement with a larger pharmaceutical company.

  <p>
   While Orexigen does receive some funds from its agreement with Takeda, it spends far more on R&amp;D than it takes in. Since it doesn't have a marketed product yet, the company believes this situation could continue for years. It has an accumulated deficit of $437 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Along with working to get its two candidates approved, Orexigen is seeking a development partner to help it commercialize Empatic. It also intends to develop additional drugs either through in-licensing, partnerships, or acquisitions.
