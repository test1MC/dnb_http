   Jetta, the company has been working to give its Sonata a more nipped and tucked look. Its design center added more curves to the model, its head and tail lamps were designed to be reminiscent of jewelry cases, and its chrome grill was improved with special metal surfacing for a more refined look.

   As US regulations for energy conservation and efficiency get tighter, automakers are looking to incorporate additional design features that will reduce both the size and weight and emissions of their vehicles. Hyundai is the first to publicly announce its plans to achieve a targeted 10% weight reduction across its vehicle line by the end of 2015. It is working on a concept car known as the Blue-Will, an all-electric vehicle built using lighter-weight carbon fiber and engineered plastics. It will run on a lithium polymer battery built by Korean-based

   . Such development is intended to help HMA become the #1 fuel-efficient carmaker in North America.
  </p>

   In 2015 the company introduced the innovative Santa Cruz Crossover Truck Concept. In 2014 HMA partnered with the powertrain expert Bisimoto Engineering to create a 708 horsepower version of its popular Sonata vehicle.

  <p>
   In the largest investment in an office building ever made in the US by Hyundai, in 2014 HMA completed the construction and moved into, its new $200 million headquarters in Fountain Valley, California.
