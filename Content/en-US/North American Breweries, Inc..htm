   NAB's flagship brewery, the Genesee Brewery in Rochester, New York, is one of the largest and longest continually-operating breweries in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   With a production capacity of some 3 million barrels a year, the Genesee brewery acts as the contract brewer for dozens of beers, malt beverages, and non-alcoholic beverages for other companies, including Boston Beer's Sam Adams. Besides Labatt's and Imperial, it also imports and distributes (within a 500-mile radius of Rochester) Steinlager from New Zealand, Toohey's New from Australia, and Thwaites from the UK.

   In creating North American Breweries, KPS Capital Partners worked to assemble a complete portfolio of drinks brands, from the blue collar appeal of Genny beer to the craft beers of Magic Hat, Pyramid, and MacTarnahan's; while Seagram's Escapes is primarily marketed to women. Each beer brand is sold regionally, except for Labatt, which is sold across the US. KPS picked up Labatt's US operations when antitrust regulators forced the sale before they would approve the

        <p>
   Craft beers are a bright spot in the otherwise declining beer market. NAB's sale to Cerveceria Costa Rica came amid of flurry of deals for craft breweries.
