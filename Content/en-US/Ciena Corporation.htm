   Ciena's telecom equipment gathers a thousand points of light and hurtles them down fiber optic cables at the same time. By transmitting multiple light signals simultaneously the company's transport and switching equipment increases the capacity of long-distance fiber-optic networks. It also sells optical transport systems for metro and enterprise wide-area networks, as well as broadband access products that enable communications companies to deliver internet protocol (IP) services, such as VoIP, IP video, and DSL. Ciena serves telecommunications service providers, cable companies, large enterprises, and government entities.

  <p>
   Ciena operates in three segments: Networking Platforms, Global Services, and Software and Software-Related Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Networking Platforms is the company's money generator, accounting for about 80% of sales. It supplies hardware and software that includes the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform and the 5430 Reconfigurable Switching System. The segment also sells operating system software.
  </p>
  <p>
   Global Services, about 15% of sales, provides services such as consulting, network design, installation and deployment, maintenance support, and training.
  </p>
  <p>
   The small but growing Software and Software-Related Services segment, about 5% of sales, includes network virtualization, management, control and orchestration software, and software-related services such as subscription, installation, support, and consulting services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ciena has operations in North America, the Caribbean and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific. About 60% of its sales come from customers in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   To produce its hardware, the company relies on contract manufacturers with plants in Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and the US.

  <p>
   The company counts more than 1,300 customers such as
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54834">
    NASA

   in the US and
   <company id="43307">
    Orange

   (France),
   <company id="41846">
    Telefonica

    Vodafone
   </company>
   (UK) overseas. It uses a direct sales force as well as resellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   AT&amp;T accounts for about a fifth of Ciena's revenue. Another nine customers account for about 30% of revenue.

  <p>
   Ciena's revenue ramped up 6% to $2.6 billion in 2016 (ended October) with rising sales in its three segments. The company's Networking Platforms business led the increase with higher sales of its 6500 Packet-Optical Platform and the 3000 and 5000 family of service delivery and aggregation switches. Software sales were boosted by an increase in subscription services. Initial sales of the company's Blue Planet software platform also pushed revenue higher. While sales rose in North America and the Asia/Pacific region, they slumped in Europe and Central and Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income jumped 520% to $73 million in 2016 from $12 million in 2015. Besides more revenue, Ciena had lower expenses in several areas including acquisitions and restructuring. The company posted its second straight year of profit in 2016, after six years of losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow generated by operations rose to $290 million in 2016 from about $262 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Ciena intends to build on its current offerings to extend its product lines. Technologies it aims to expand are the WaveLogic coherent optical processor and the high-speed indium phosphide and silicon photonics lineup acquired from TeraXion in 2016. The technologies are designed to help network operators increase performance and power and reduce costs. Ciena also invests in developing the Blue Planet software platform and integrating it across the company's portfolio. It estimates that revenue from Blue Planet could increase by $25 million in the company's 2017 fiscal year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Playing to its strengths, the company focuses on adding new customers that operate in its base of communications service providers. It's making a strong push in high-growth markets such as the Asia-Pacific region, where its sales rose 12%, including India.

  <p>
   In 2016 Ciena bought TeraXion Inc., which makes high-speed photonics components (HSPC), for $32 million in cash. The acquisition gives Ciena a bigger footprint in Canada, which is home to most of its research and development team.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Ciena acquired Cyan Inc., a provider of software and platforms for software-defined networks, for about $400 million. The addition of Cyan helps Ciena offer more comprehensive virtualized networks and on-demand services.

  <p>
   David Huber founded CIENA in 1992 after
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   (which later became part of Motorola) shut the optical research lab he managed. He licensed technology from the company and began looking for funding. Two years later he had the backing of
   <company id="54479">
    Sevin Rosen Funds
   </company>
   and lined up an experienced manager, Patrick Nettles, to head the company. In 1995 CIENA (a name that Nettles thought up while taking a shower) won its first customer --
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   . Sales to Sprint accounted for all of CIENA's revenues the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   CIENA went public in 1997, and that year it developed a second-generation product, MultiWave Sentry, which interfaced with more communications equipment and required fewer transmission terminals. CIENA also diversified into short-distance optical transport with MultiWave Firefly. Huber took his stock profits (a reported $300 million) in 1997 and left over disagreements with Nettles concerning the company's research strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 CIENA bought ATI Telecom International, an optical networking systems installer. Severe price pressure, brought on by several new competitors, led to a drop in profits that year. Telecom equipment maker
   <company id="14899">
    Tellabs
   </company>
   agreed to acquire CIENA in 1998, but the deal fell through after CIENA lost several key contracts. The next year CIENA spent more than $1 billion on fiber-optic equipment makers Omnia and Lightera. The related charges caused losses for fiscal 1999. In 2000 the company signed up

   spinoff
   <company id="100634">
    Genuity
