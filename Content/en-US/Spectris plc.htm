   Spectris groups its activities into four businesses: Materials Analysis, Test and Measurement, In-Line Instrumentation, and Industrial Controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Materials Analysis segment, the largest at over 30% of net sales, makes products that determine structure, composition, quantity and quality of particles and materials. The products have uses at research and product development stages, when assessing materials before production, or during the manufacturing process.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Test and Measurement segment, responsible for some 30% of sales, supplies test, measurement and analysis equipment, software and services for product design optimization, manufacturing control, microseismic monitoring, and environmental noise monitoring.
  </p>
  <p>
   In-Line Instrumentation, worth over 20% of total sales, deals in process analytical measurement, asset monitoring and on-line controls. It also consumables and services for both primary processing and the converting industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Industrial Controls segment, the smallest of the four at under 20% of sales, makes products that measure, monitor, control, inform, track, and trace.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Spectris offers aftermarket support for its products and systems, including maintenance, training, and consultancy support.

  <p>
   In 2015, sales grew a slim 1% on prior year to £1.2 billion after contributions from acquisitions pushed up revenue in the Materials Analysis and Test and Measurement segments, and increases in North America and Europe further aided Materials Analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income of £113.8 was 16% lower than the figure recorded in prior year, due to an increase in amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible asset costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities fell 2% to £153.4 million as a result of changes in trade and other receivables.

  <p>
   Spectris' approach to improving the productivity of its customers is changing to encompass the provision of services, software and related activities in addition to the supply of equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also engaging in a series of acquisitions intended to boost its testing capabilities. In 2016, it purchased two test facilities: the Millbrook test track in Bedfordshire, which is used to test civilian vehicles as well as equipment in the defense, security and petrochem industries; and a winter test facility within the Arctic Circle in Finland. It also made a series of bolt on acquisitions worth £30 million.

  <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired Millbrook testing facility in Bedfordshire, which houses a renowned test track, for £122 million. The facility is used by customers in the automotive, tyre, petrochemicals, defense and security sectors. Similarly, it acquired Test World, a winter vehicle test track in Finland within the Arctic Circle.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spectris also made a series acquisitions of software companies, including US-based ReliaSoft Corporation, an engineering reliability software provider, for £30m; and Capstone Technology Corporation, which makes process control optimization software for pulp and paper, chemicals and utilities industries (among others), for $22.5 million

  <p>
   Sir Richard Fairey formed Fairey Aviation Company Ltd. in 1915. The company's earliest planes included the Fox (one of the first metal airplanes), the Battle, and the Swordfish. The Swordfish gained fame during WWII when it crippled the
   <i>
    Bismarck
   </i>
   . Launched in 1941, the 50,000-ton
   <i>
    Bismarck
   </i>
   soon sank the HMS
   <i>
    Hood,
   </i>
   killing all but three of the more than 1,400 men on board. Days later Swordfish biplanes unleashed torpedoes that disabled the German behemoth's rudder, leaving it running in circles. British ships then closed on the crippled
   <i>
    Bismarck
   </i>
   and finished the job.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Fairey's planes included the Gannet, the Rotodyne vertical takeoff passenger plane, and the hinged-nose Delta, a forerunner of the Concorde. In 1960 Fairey announced that its aircraft and helicopter operations were being merged with Westland Aircraft. This move left Fairey with only aerospace component operations, and it soon diversified.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was acquired by Pearson in 1980 and separated from the conglomerate in a management buyout led by Derek Kingsbury in 1987. Within two years of joining Fairey, Kingsbury bought Red Lion, a US-based maker of machinery controls and displays, in 1982. Red Lion grew about 20% a year, leading to Kingsbury's decision to expand in the industrial electronics arena. Fairey went public in 1988; in 1991 it bought LaserMike (laser measurement equipment, US). The next year Fairey acquired Arcom (industrial computer components, UK); Infrared Engineering (infrared-gauges, UK); and Ircon (infrared measuring equipment, US).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1993 two-thirds of Fairey's profits came from sensing equipment, counters, and timers. Between 1991 and 1997 Fairey acquired 14 companies, focusing on firms with established niche markets and leading market shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fairey sold subsidiary Allied Insulators (electric insulation materials) in 1997, and the next year it sold its lone remaining aerospace segment, Fairey Hydraulics (airplane flaps and rudders). In 1999 Fairey acquired UK-based Servomex, a maker of industrial instrumentation systems and in 2000, Spectris AG, a Germany-based maker of measuring equipment, from AGIV-AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's name was changed from Fairey to Spectris in 2001. A weakened economy in the US that year challenged the company, although its diverse base helped mitigate the impact. Spectris utilized a strategy of restructuring its sales platform and management during that time. The company acquired several businesses in 2001, including IST, Lumitron, and Mustek. It also disposed of several operations during the year and into 2002, including three filtration businesses and its Fairey Nuclear business, with added plans to divest its Luxtron Corporation subsidiary and the coating systems division of its BTG subsidiary. Late in 2002 Spectris acquired Philips Analytical, a maker of instruments for x-ray systems, and renamed the unit
   <company id="129649">
    PANalytical
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Spectris sold its infrared measurement systems to
   <company id="12071">
    Fluke
   </company>
   for $33 million. The following year it acquired the LDS Test and Measurement (T&amp;M) business unit of
   <company id="11307">
    SPX Corp.
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   Machine Vision Business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like most players in the industrial industry, the company experienced diminished sales during the global economic downturn. It responded by consolidating production facilities, streamlining sales operations, combining engineering and development functions, as well as increasing the pace of product deliverables.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing to expand its business, even in the wake of the stagnating economy, the company invested approximately $40 million in two companies in 2009: Lochard, a provider of environmental noise and air quality monitoring services based in Australia, and MicroSafe, a supplier of microbial detection and monitoring equipment in Italy. Spectris' Particle Measuring Systems subsidiary (part of its Materials Analysis business segment) also opened a technology center in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keeping an established market like the US in mind for expansion, Spectris bought Alabama-based N-TRON, a manufacturer of rugged industrial networking components for about $50 million in 2010. N-TRON's operations became part of Spectris' Industrial Controls segment that will operate in conjunction with Red Lion controls.
