   Those who fear not knowing their place in the world should Trimble. Trimble Navigation makes systems and software that combine global positioning technology with wireless communications to provide location and position data and make it actionable. Using GPS, laser, optical, and other technologies, the company's products target areas such as surveying, construction site project management, mapping, mobile personnel management, and mobile and fixed asset management. They are offered to end users, such as government entities, farmers, engineering firms, and public safety workers, as well as equipment manufacturers (OEMs). About half of sales are made outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To establish certain operational advantages, Trimble divides its business into four segments: engineering and construction, field solutions, mobile solutions, and advanced devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineering and construction products command more than half of sales and include, among a wide range of others, construction machine guidance systems and robotic optical surveying instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mobile solutions (about 25% of sales) start where field solutions end: at the mass workforce level. It makes hardware and software used to handle scheduling for field service technicians and other mobile personnel. It also provides in-vehicle GPS receivers and other systems for tracking mobile assets. Mobile products are sold under the brands Trimble, PeopleNet, TMW, and ALK Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Field solutions (15% of sales) get used right where the name suggests - out in the field. Trimble markets such products to the agricultural and geographic information system (GIS) sectors. Agricultural offerings include systems that provide navigation guidance for farm equipment. It also sells handheld data collection units designed to work with GIS databases. Utility companies use such systems to gather information about transmission poles and have the data automatically stored.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Devices (about 6% of sales) encompasses Applanix (mobile mapping), embedded technologies (boards, modules, chipsets, licenses), military and advanced systems (aircraft navigation), Military and Advanced Systems, and ThingMagic (UHF and radio frequency identification (RFID) reader modules and services). Most of these products are hardware focused and are typically marketed to OEMs, system integrators, or service providers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Trimble has principal facilities in Canada, China, India, New Zealand, a handful of European countries, in addition to its North American locations. The US is its largest single market, accounting for 50% of sales in 2016 (ended January). Customers in Europe made up another quarter of sales, while Asia followed with 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contract electronics manufacturers, principally
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics International
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13094">
    Benchmark Electronics
   </company>
   , make some of Trimble's products at factories in China and Mexico.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Trimble pitches its products to customers via dealer partnerships on all products except advanced devices and mobile solutions products. It also uses representatives, joint ventures, and other sales channels, supported by offices in 43 countries. Trimble sees its existing markets as underpenetrated, offering opportunities to expand adoption of its products as replacements for lingering traditional methods. In that regard, product development is also a key strategic component for both maintaining and broadening the company's ability to serve its target markets. It ramped up advertising spending by about $5 million to $39 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 revenue decreased 4% to $2.3 billion after several years of increases. A 16% decrease in sales from Field Solutions was blamed on softness in agriculture markets, particularly in the OEM channels. Revenue from Advanced Devices also declined 5% in 2016. The mobile unit, however, posted a 7% increase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped 43% to $121 million in 2016 due to lower revenue and an increase in research and development and restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations in 2016 was $354.9 million, compared to $407 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Charles Trimble founded Trimble Navigation in 1978 to design navigation products for recreational boating. In 1982 the company began developing devices using the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite network; in 1984 Trimble introduced its first GPS product. The company went public in 1990, 10 days before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Trimble gained worldwide recognition when allied troops used its GPS devices during the Persian Gulf War.
  </p>
  <p>
   The war left Trimble expanding too quickly and overproducing. In 1992 Trimble rebounded after reorganizing to focus on nonmilitary products. Two years later it introduced a low-cost, handheld unit that helped with utilities fieldwork. In 1998 Trimble ceased manufacturing products for general aviation and allied with Siemens to develop GPS products. That year Charles Trimble was named vice chairman after he stepped down as the company's CEO. The company in 1998 also launched a cost reduction plan that cut its workforce by 8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Trimble sold its Sunnyvale, California, manufacturing operations to contract manufacturer
   <company id="14296">
    Solectron
   </company>
   , which agreed to make Trimble's GPS and radio-frequency products for three years. Also in 1999 Steven Berglund, a former president of a
   <company id="54968">
    Spectra-Physics
   </company>
   subsidiary, was named CEO of Trimble.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Trimble acquired the Spectra Precision businesses of Thermo Electron (which later became
   <company id="11473">
    Thermo Fisher Scientific
   </company>
   ) for about $294 million. That year the US government stopped scrambling GPS signals, opening the door for more precise devices. In 2001 the company formed a subsidiary, Trimble Information Services, to expand the company's wireless location-based services, including fleet management.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Trimble and
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   formed a joint venture, Caterpillar Trimble Control Technologies, to develop advanced electronic guidance and control technologies for earth-moving construction and mining machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Eleven Technology, a mobile application software developer focused on the consumer packaged goods market, in 2006. The company also expanded its laser scanning business by acquiring the assets -- including software for engineering and construction plant design -- of BitWyse Solutions. Later in 2006 it purchased Visual Statement, a developer of crime and collision incident investigation software, and XYZ Solutions, a 3-D intelligence software provider. It also acquired Meridian Systems, a provider of enterprise project management and lifecycle software. Still later in 2006 Trimble bought Spacient Technologies, a privately held provider of field service management and mobile mapping software used by municipalities and utilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trimble's buying spree continued in 2007, when it purchased @Road, a developer of mobile resource management systems, for about $493 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its ability to serve the farming industry when it acquired NTech Industries in 2009. NTech developed optical crop-sensing technology that helps farmers reduce costs by managing the application of nitrogen, herbicides, and other crop inputs. Also that year Trimble purchased Accutest Engineering Solutions, a UK-based maker of mobile resource management applications for trucking fleets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Trimble acquired Punch Telematix from majority shareholder Punch International for nearly €14 million ($18 million) in cash and rebranded it as Trimble Transport and Logistics. Punch Telematix made onboard computers for trucks. That year the company also bought ThingMagic, a developer of radio frequency identification (RFID) products and RFID integration services for commercial clients in the construction and transportation industries, and Cengea, a provider of operations and supply chain management software for the forestry, agriculture, and natural resource industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Trimble bought Mumbai-based Tata AutoComp Mobility Telematics (TMT) in a move to expand its mobile resource management services business in India. TMT provided vehicle tracking and other telematics services to such customers as Bharat Petroleum and Tata Motors. Also that year, expanding its engineering and construction portfolio for electrical and mechanical contractors, Trimble bought the assets of Accubid, a provider of estimating, project management and service management software.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trimble bought 3D modeling software maker Tekla in 2011 in a deal valued at nearly €340 million ($485 million) to better equip building contractors and engineers to manage construction projects. The follow-up investment came in 2012 when Trimble completed the acquisition of the StruCad and StruEngineer business from AceCad Software. StruCad offers 3D structural detailing, while StruEngineer provides engineering companies with 3D steelwork modeling and construction management.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired a line of software products in 2011 from Norway-based Mesta Entreprenør, a subsidiary of road and highway construction contractor Mesta Konsern. The deal added office and field data collection applications and improved the company's ability to provide customized systems to construction clients, particularly in the area of managing local application requirements compliance. Also in 2011 Trimble strengthened its portfolio and Asia presence with the purchase of China-based Yamei Electronics, a manufacturer of electronic automotive products, including anti-theft GPS monitoring and tracking systems, RFID smart keys, and diagnostics systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Trimble acquired the OmniSTAR satellite system assets of Dutch geological engineering company Fugro. The company was interested in OmniSTAR's GPS signal correction technology (used to improve the accuracy of satellite navigation devices), which it is using to expand the functionality of its mapping systems for agricultural and construction purposes, among others. It also acquired France-based Ashtech to expand Garmin's selection of survey products, including the flagship application Spectra Precision, for construction clients. Ashtech became part of Trimble's engineering and construction division.
