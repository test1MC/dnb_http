   Nypro is a real pro when it comes to injection molding. The company makes plastic parts used in devices that range from cell phones and electric razors to inkjet printer cartridges and personal computers. Nypro's three global units include Consumer &amp; Electronics, Packaging, and Healthcare (medical devices such as single-use fluid and drug management components). Although custom-precision plastic-injection molding is Nypro's core business, the company also offers assembly services to other manufacturers. Major customers include

   In 1962 chairman Gordon Lankton joined Nypro (then known as Nylon Products, Inc.) as general manager and co-owner. In 1969 he acquired the remainder of the company he didn't already own. In 1998 Lankton sold the firm to Nypro's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
