   Immersion wants to immerse people in digital experiences with its haptics technology. The company develops touch feedback technology, called haptics, that simulates tactile experiences -- such as the feel of an object or the jolt of an explosion during a video game -- in order to improve how people interact with digital devices. Immersion licenses its TouchSense technology to companies such as
   <company id="161979">
    Motorola
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   for use in mobile phones, and to
   <company id="42459">
    Logitech
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   , which use TouchSense in joysticks, mice, steering wheels, and other peripherals. Its technology, backed by more than 2,000 issued and pending patents, is also used in automotive, consumer electronics, and medical products.

   Immersion's products for the mobile, wearables, and consumer market generate 60% of its revenue. Gaming devices bring in 27% with medical and automotive accounting for 8% and 5%, respectively.

  <p>
   Headquartered in California, the company operates offices in Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In 2014 South Korea (home to its largest customer, Samsung) accounted for more than 50% of sales, followed by the US more than 25%. The remainder came from Japan and other countries.

  <p>
   Immersion uses a direct sales force in Asia, Europe, and the US to license its software and patents, as well as partnerships and licensing agreements with component suppliers and system integrators. Samsung is its largest customer, accounting for about 40% of all sales in 2014.

  <p>
   Immersion followed a 48% revenue gain in 2013 with a 11.5% increase in 2014 to about $53 million. The company recorded higher royalty and licensing revenues from gaming licenses and the sale of gaming console products, including the Sony PlayStation 4. A new contract with a European automaker boosted automotive revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Immersion's net income dropped a whopping 89% in 2014 to $4 million. Still, it was the company's third profit in the past decade. The company increased spending on sales and marketing and research and development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The drop in net income helped reduce Immersion's cash flow from operations to $291,000 in 2014 from $21 million in 2013. Cash flow was also affected by non-cash charges of $5.9 million, including $5.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation and $567,000 in depreciation and amortization.

  <p>
   Immersion doesn't face a lot of competition in the market for licensing haptics IP except from the customers themselves, who may choose to develop their own haptics technology. Still, it owns so many of the patents for the technology that Immersion has had to take some users to court.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses on market penetration through working with hardware component suppliers as well as the ecosystem of designers and content creators. It also wants to extend its technologies into newer markets, such as wearables and networked devices, as well as new form factors. The company intends to continue to expand its international activities, including continued investment in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company extended existing licenses and secured new licenses with mobile OEMs, including

    LG
   </company>
   in Korea,
   <company id="185340">
    Huawei
   </company>
   in China, and
   <company id="149927">
    HTC
   </company>
   in Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also focuses on product portfolio expansion. In 2015, the company launched the TouchSense Engage software for mobile games. The software provides tools plus creative design support and services to adding custom tactile effects to products.
