   Stupp Bros. stated it generated $630 million in net revenue for 2012, a 20% increase from the previous year. It was helped by higher demand for pipe products within the energy market. Both Stupp Bridge and Hammert's Iron Works experienced year-over-year revenue growth for 2012.

   In 2013 the company reported continued growth, though not as rapid, with tight margins due to growing competition from Asian, European, and US rivals.
