   NuPathe hopes to find a new route to neuro relief, and profits. The drug company, which focuses on neurological and psychiatric treatments, has several candidates in its pipeline. The most advanced drug -- Zecuity, a single-use patch for treating migraines -- was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2013. Since migraine sufferers experience nausea that makes it difficult to take oral medications, the company believes there is a large market for a transdermal treatment. Other candidates in NuPathe's R&amp;D pipeline have targeted conditions including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. NuPathe is being acquired by
   <company id="100352">
    Endo International
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   In late 2013 Endo Health Solutions (renamed Endo International in 2014) agreed to acquire NuPathe for some $105 million. The purchase will expand Endo's pain management franchise; Endo plans to launch NuPathe's Zecuity product in 2014.

  <p>
   NuPathe was formed in 2005 and filed to go public in 2010. IPO proceeds were used towards the continued development of Zecuity (originally branded as Zelrix) and development and trials of its other candidates.

  <p>
   While the delivery method of Zecuity is new, the drug is sumatriptan, the generic equivalent of
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline's
   </company>
   popular migraine mitigator Imitrex. GSK and its pharma brethren sell tablet, nasal spray, and injectable forms of the drug, but NuPathe's is the first transdermal application.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company planned to hire sales, marketing, and distribution staff once Zecuity gained FDA approval. However, its acquisition by Endo will negate the need for its own sales force. It anticipates the drug will be marketed in the US to neurologists and headache specialists.
