  <p>
   Hearth &amp; Home's strategy is to build on its position as a leading manufacturer of office furniture and hearth products in North America and pursue select global markets where opportunities exist to create shareholder value. The components of this growth strategy are to introduce new products, build brand equity, provide outstanding customer satisfaction by focusing on the end-user, strengthen the distribution network, respond to global competition, pursue complementary strategic acquisitions, enter markets not currently served and continually reduce costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   A key component to this growth strategy is Hearth &amp; Home's commitment to environmentally friendly building. Not only does it tout the fact that a wide range of its products are energy-efficient and promote indoor air quality, but the company has gone a step further by educating designers and builders on national green building standards in relation to fireplace and stove design, types of fuel, and venting systems.
