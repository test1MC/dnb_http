   EnteroMedics is trying to quiet those grumbling hunger pangs. The medical device company uses neuroblocking technology called VBLOC therapy to combat obesity and metabolic diseases. Its initial product, the Maestro Rechargable System, is a device laparoscopically implanted near the diaphragm that uses electrical impulses to limit the expansion of the stomach, thereby producing a feeling of prolonged fullness. The Maestro System received

   approval in 2015; it also has CE marking for sale in the European Economic Area and is approved by the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. EnteroMedics plans to build a sales force to market the product to bariatric surgeons and weight management specialists in the US.

  <p>
   The Maestro System is designed to help control hunger between meals. It intermittently blocks the vagus nerves with high-frequency, low-energy electrical impulses during the user's waking hours.

  <p>
   Since its inception in 2002, the company has incurred losses each year. It has focused on the research, development, and approval of its Maestro System, and as such has had no revenue (with the exception of 2012, which marked the firm's first and only year to recognize product revenue). With an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, its net loss in 2015 increased 1% to $26 million. Operating cash outflow increased 5% to $19 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of December 31, 2015, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $0.3 million.

  <p>
   EnteroMedics also continues its research and development work, investigating ways to apply its VBLOC technology to treat not just obesity but certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as Type 2 diabetes, pancreatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome.
