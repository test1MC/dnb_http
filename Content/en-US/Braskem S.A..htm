   Much like the Amazon, Braskem is a South American giant, the continent's largest petrochemical company. Braskem's chemical plants are located mostly in Brazil. The company produces olefins like ethylene and propylene that are then used to make polyolefins like polyethylene, polypropylene, and PVC. That latter group of chemicals are then used to make all manner of plastic materials and fibers. Braskem also makes aromatics like benzene and intermediate chemicals like caprolactam, which are used to make nylon. In 2014 Basic Petrochemicals accounted for 45% of its total sales.

  <p>
   In 2014 Braskem's net revenues increased by 12% (in local currency) as a result of higher net sales revenue in the Polyolefins segment, an increase in USA and Europe segment, and a growth in Basic Petrochemicals sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the Basic Petrochemicals segment increased primarily as a result of higher sales of basic petrochemicals (excluding condensate, fuels, intermediates and utilities) to third parties, and a rise in net sales revenues generated by the sales of basic petrochemicals to other business units.
  </p>
  <p>
   Polyolefins sales increased primarily as a result of higher sales of polyethylene and polypropylene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from the USA and Europe segment increased primarily due to higher prices of sales due to the translation of the currencies of the countries in the USA and Europe segment into reais resulting in foreign exchange gains attributable to fluctuations in the relative value of these currencies against the real, rather than operational gains, and an increase in the spot prices of the Northeast Asian market of polypropylene. Sales volume of polypropylene by the USA and Europe Unit increased due to stronger demand from US and European economies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Braksem's net income increased by 43% due to higher net sales and other operating income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities grew by 54%.
