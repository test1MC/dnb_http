   Home Meridian International is the group home for furniture companies Pulaski Furniture and SLF (formerly Samuel Lawrence Furniture). Pulaski Furniture is known for its high-end curio cabinets, but both companies sell wood furniture for the bedroom and dining room. They also market occasional pieces, including credenzas, chests, home entertainment centers, desks, and bookcases. Pulaski and SLF both import furniture from Asia. The companies merged to form Home Meridian, which was majority owned by an affiliate of

  <p>
   Pulaski Furniture was founded in 1955 by Bradfute Davenport and Colin Richardson. Bernard Wampler joined the company that year and became CEO in 1967. The firm began operating a plant in Dublin, Virginia, in 1973. Wampler's son John joined seven years later. In 1983 Pulaski acquired Coleman Furniture and joined forces with three other companies to form Triwood, a joint venture focused on the manufacture of chip core material for their own furniture products (sold 1995). Pulaski purchased Gravely Furniture (renamed Ridgeway Clock) in 1985. Two years later it went public.

   In 1988 Pulaski upgraded its original plant (adding finishing facilities) and acquired Craftique (upscale mahogany and cherry furniture). It moved into the upholstery business in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced a line of NASCAR-themed furniture at Heilig-Meyers furniture stores in 1996. This 15-item line of furniture, unveiled in Daytona Beach, Florida (home of the Daytona 500), featured black-and-white checkered armchairs and toolbox end tables. Sales were down that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   John became CEO in 1997. That year the company restructured, selling its Craftique unit and its upholstered seating business in order to concentrate on its core business of clocks, curio cabinets, bedroom furniture, and imports. Also in 1997 Pulaski suffered a $2.4 million loss in part caused by a $6 million charge related to the restructuring. Pulaski began manufacturing contract furniture for hotels and motels in 1998. The next year it bought Missouri-based furniture manufacturer Dawson Furniture, which specializes in display cabinets and other oak and pine furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   John and other executives of the company led a buyout of the company in 2000 with the help of investment company Quad-C Management. A few months later, because of soft sales of curio cabinets and an excess inventory, Pulaski closed its Martinsville, Virginia, plant. It also sold its plant in Dublin, Virginia, to Ethan Allen. The company implemented more layoffs in early 2001.

   Although sales of Pulaski's bedroom and dining room furniture made in Asia have increased, the slowing economy has affected the sale of luxury items such as the clocks and curio cabinets (which can cost several thousand dollars). This has resulted in the closing of one plant and more than 300 layoffs. In an effort to concentrate on its core businesses, Pulaski sold its Ridgeway Clocks division to

   in 2004. The 2007 closing of Pulaski's Virginia curios plant affected 260 employees.
