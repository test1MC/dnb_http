   The global manufacturer of plastic packaging containers and preforms serves some the world's largest consumer products companies. Plastipak has benefited from a diverse range of proprietary bottling relationships. Its bottles are used for high-profile waters, such as
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi
   </company>
   's Aquafina. The company supplies wide-mouth containers for
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   's liquid laundry detergents like Tide, and household products such as Bounce. Plastipak's packaging for
   <company id="55825">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   has improved the products' shelf visibility. Automotive customers are another key market. Plastipak also caters to the container needs of companies such as
   <company id="41841">
    Shell Oil
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103877">
    Chevron
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Not only does the company benefit from its business relationships, but also through its technology. Plastipak believes that the shape of an object should be based on its intended function or purpose. Its ThermoShape Lightweight Hot-Fill Technology is an example. The technology allows for the packaging of non-refrigerated, high-acid content beverages and foods without the use of preservatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bottle is almost 30% lighter than the typical PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle, uses 30% less PET, and offers extended shelf life without deformation because the bottle walls do not lose as much oxygen as typical PET bottles. The technology also allows existing glass and plastic hot-fill lines to be converted fairly easily to the ThermoShape system.
