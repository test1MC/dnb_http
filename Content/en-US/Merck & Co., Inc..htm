   Merck makes medicines for a number of maladies, from stuffy noses and asthma to hypertension and arthritis. The pharmaceutical giant's top prescription drugs include diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, anti-inflammatory Remicade, cholesterol combatants Vytorin and Zetia, and hypertension fighters Cozaar and Hyzaar. In addition, Merck makes childhood and adult vaccines for such diseases as measles, mumps, pneumonia, and shingles, as well as veterinary pharmaceuticals through
   <company id="138726">
    Merck Animal Health
   </company>
   . The company sold its OTC drug and personal care offerings, including Claritin allergy pills and Dr. Scholl's foot care products, to
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer AG
   </company>
   in 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Merck has a broad portfolio of marketed and development-stage pharmaceuticals in areas including respiratory health, metabolism, infectious disease, cardiovascular, vaccines, immunology, women's health, endocrinology, and oncology. In addition to the pharmaceutical unit, which accounts for the majority (about 85%) of revenues, the company's structure includes the animal health operating segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Best-selling drugs in the pharma segment include type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, which brought in about $4 billion in revenues in 2015. Additional bestsellers earning more than $2 billion include diabetes drug Janumet and cholesterol medication Zetia, while $1 billion top sellers include cholesterol medication Vytorin, skin antibiotic treatment Cubicin, HIV therapy Isentress, inflammatory treatment Remicade, and HPV vaccine Gardasil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its blockbuster successes, Merck is subject to the same threat to its bottom line as all pharmaceutical companies large and small: patent expiration. To offset the financial impact of patent losses, the company works to release new drugs to replace the aging products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's product pipeline includes MK-3475 Ketruda, which is under review for the treatment of cancer; MK-8237 for the treatment of allergies; and letermovir for the treatment of CMV infection in transplant patients.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Merck markets its products in over 140 countries, with its largest market -- the US -- accounting for 45% of revenues. Some international products are marketed under the MSD (short for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme) brand. The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) segment accounts for about 30% of sales, and Japan accounts for nearly 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates principal research facilities in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Nebraska. Outside of the US, it has research facilities in China and Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merck also has production facilities at some 10 locations in the US and Puerto Rico. Outside of the US, it owns or has interests in manufacturing sites and other properties in Japan, Singapore, South Africa, and other countries in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.

  <p>
   Merck markets its products through direct sales forces and international distributors. Customers include drug wholesalers, retailers, pharmacies, government agencies, and health care providers. Animal health products are sold to veterinarians, animal producers, as well as distributors. Some of Merck's products are sold through partnerships or joint ventures with other drugmakers. For instance,
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   markets anti-inflammatory drugs Remicade and Simponi in the US, while Merck has marketing rights in Europe, Russia, and Turkey. Vaccine sales are made directly and through the
   <company id="103654">
    Sanofi Pasteur MSD
   </company>
   partnership.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $2.1 billion on advertising and promotion in 2015, down from $2.3 billion in 2014 and $2.5 billion in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Merck's revenues have been falling for the past few years, largely due to the patent expiration of Singulair and other products as well as divestitures made. In 2015, revenue fell 6% to $39 billion (it was $46 billion in 2010) as sales of such products as PegIntron, RemicadePneumovax 23, Vytorin, and Victrelis declined. The 2014 sales of Merck Consumer Care (MCC) and certain ophthalmic products also took their toll on earnings. On the other hand, sales of Keytruda grew in 2015, as did sales of Januvia, Janumet, Gardasil, and others. Animal health products also rose, and that year's acquisition of antibiotics maker Cubist contributed some $1.3 billion in sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has fluctuated over the past five years. In 2015, dropped 63% to $4.4 billion; this was due both to lower sales of some products as well as an absence of gains related to the MCC, Sirna, and opthalmic products divestitures. Cash flow from operations rose 58% to $12 billion, partly due to an increase in inventory.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the midst of massive big pharma consolidation, Merck in 2014 sold its consumer business to German conglomerate
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   for $14.2 billion. Merck got to shed a line where it didn't dominate and use the funds to support its oncology R&amp;D. As part of the deal, the two companies are collaborating on Bayer's hypertension candidates; Merck paid Bayer $1 billion to participate. Profits will be split 50/50.
  </p>
  <p>
   The increasing threats of generic competition on top blockbusters require Merck to push new products through its development pipeline, with a focus on bringing its most promising late-stage development candidates to market to replace its aging blockbusters. Focus areas of growth include biologics, vaccines, and emerging markets; it also conducts research for new animal health medicines. Biotech R&amp;D includes programs in areas such as monoclonal antibodies (single-source proteins) as well as the development of follow-on (generic) biologics. Research and development expenses were $6.7 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2014 and $7.5 billion in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to creating new medicines, Merck also works to gain approval for new indications on existing drugs. In 2015 it received several product approvals such as expanded indications for Keytruda. It is increasingly seeking out collaboration, licensing, and outsourcing agreements in the R&amp;D arena to cut costs. Also in 2015, the company signed an agreement with the privately held NGM Biopharmaceuticals to research, discover, develop, and commercialize novel biologic therapies across a wide variety of areas. Merck teamed with Medicines Patent Pool to license its pediatric formulations of raltegravir for treating HIV-1 infection in infants and children in developing countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also targeting international markets, including emerging and developed nations, by partnering with others. Brazil, China, and Japan are target markets, as are nations in the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company received FDA approval for its Bravecto chewable tablets for dogs to treat fleas and ticks. It also gained approval for Belsomra for insomnia, HPV vaccine Gardasil 9, allergy treatments Grastek and Ragwitek, and Zontivity for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in susceptible patients. The following year, Zontivity was approved for the European market. Other recent product approvals include Bridion to reverse the effects of adult anesthetics and Zepatier for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of an ongoing assessment of Merck's portfolio, the company sold the US marketing rights for antipsychotic drug Saphris in 2014. It also sold its Sirna Therapeutics subsidiary and related assets to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for some $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2014 sold to Santen Pharmaceutical certain opthalmic products (including Cosopt, Trusopt, and Saflutan) in Japan and key markets in Europe and the Asia/Pacific. The following year, it divested its 51% stake in its Simcere MSD (Shanghai) joint venture with

  <p>
   Merck is increasing its M&amp;A activities to further protect itself against competitive market challenges. Expansion measures taken in 2014 include the $3.9 billion acquisition of biopharmaceutical company Idenix, which develops treatments for viral diseases. It plans to combine the two companies' existing drugs to develop an improved therapy for hepatitis C. In early 2015, the company bought antibiotic maker
   <company id="51620">
    Cubist
   </company>
   for $9.5 billion. Merck gained a stronger foothold in the hospital acute care and antibiotic resistance market though the acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2015, the company bought OncoEthix, a privately held biotechnology firm specializing in oncology treatments, for $153 million. It acquired private biopharmaceutical cCAM, which specializes in developing novel cancer immunotherapies, for $201 million. And it bought IOmet, a UK drug discovery firm with a focus on cancer immunotherapy and cancer metabolism, for $150 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merck acquired Afferent Pharmaceuticals in mid-2016 for $500 million in cash plus milestone payments of up to another $750 million. Afferent is developing a couple of treatments for chronic cough.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Merck traces its roots to the formation of Schering-Plough in 1851 and the founding of the original Merck entity in 1887. (The two companies merged in 2009.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Schering-Plough dates back to 1851, when Berlin chemist Ernst Schering began to sell chemicals to apothecary shops. By 1880 Schering's business (which eventually became
   <company id="91276">
    Bayer Schering Pharma
   </company>
   ) was exporting pharmaceuticals to the US, where a subsidiary (the predecessor to Schering-Plough) was established in 1928.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the outbreak of WWII, the US government seized the US Schering subsidiary, severing links with its German parent. The company went on to develop such new drugs as Chlor-Trimeton, one of the first antihistamines, and the cold medicine Coricidin. The US government sold Schering in 1952 to
   <company id="10990">
    Merrill Lynch
   </company>
   , which took it public. Schering bought White Labs (which made Coppertone sunscreen) in 1957. In the 1960s the company introduced Garamycin (antibiotic, 1964), Tinactin (antifungal, 1965), and Afrin (decongestant, 1967).
  </p>
  <p>
   Schering's 1971 merger with Memphis-based Plough expanded the product line to include such cosmetics and consumer items as Coppertone and Di-Gel. Plough's founder, Abe Plough, had borrowed $125 from his father to found the company in 1908. Abe remained chairman at Schering-Plough until 1976. Schering-Plough introduced many products after the merger, including Lotrimin AF (antifungal, 1975), antibiotic Netromycin (1980), and Drixoral (a cold remedy made nonprescription in 1982).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was one of the first drug giants to make significant investments in biotechnology: It bought DNAX Research Institute of Palo Alto, California, in 1982. Acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s included Scholl (foot care, 1979), Key Pharmaceuticals (cardiovascular drugs, 1986), and Cooper Companies (eye care, 1988).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Schering-Plough began marketing its non-sedating antihistamine, Claritin, in the US. (Claritin became an OTC drug in 2002.) The next year it gained FDA approval to market the first colored disposable contact lenses, only to sell its contact lens business later in the year. In 1996 Schering-Plough bought Canji to strengthen its gene therapy research program. It strengthened its veterinary medicine segment in 1997 when it bought
   <company id="10798">
    Mallinckrodt
   </company>
   's animal health operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm bought the marketing rights to
   <company id="12923">
    Centocor
   </company>
   's treatment for Crohn's disease in 1998. In 1999 the FDA approved the company's Temodar, a chemotherapy treatment for brain tumors, and it bought the US rights to
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's Bain de Soleil sun care product line. In 2000 Schering-Plough formed its first collaboration with Merck. In 2002 the company paid a $500 million fine to the FDA over manufacturing concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Schering-Plough's revenues started to decline in 2003, the company brought in several executives from
   <company id="11010">
    Pharmacia
   </company>
   , including CEO Fred Hassan (who retired following the 2009 merger with Plough) to help streamline its operations and expand its R&amp;D programs and product offerings. The firm gave itself a major boost by acquiring
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel's
   </company>
   <company id="107472">
    Organon
   </company>
   unit in 2007 growing in the areas of women's health care, neurology, vaccines, animal health (
   <company id="138726">
    Intervet
   </company>
   ), and third-party biologics manufacturing (through
   <company id="139406">
    Diosynth
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The original Merck was started in 1887 when German chemist Theodore Weicker came to the US to set up a branch of German firm E. Merck AG (which was founded in 1668 and later became
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   ). George Merck (grandson of the German company's founder) came in 1889 and formed a partnership with Weicker, and eventually bought out Weicker's shares. At first the firm imported and sold drugs and chemicals from Germany, but in 1903 it began manufacturing its own products. During WWI, Merck gave the US government the 80% of the US Merck unit's stock owned by the family in Germany (George kept his shares). After the war, the stock was sold to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm acquired Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten of Philadelphia (a producer of antimalarial quinine) in 1927. Merck opened its first research lab in 1933; Merck scientists there developed the first steroid, cortisone, in 1944. Five Merck scientists received Nobel Prizes in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1953 Merck bought drugmaker Sharp &amp; Dohme of Philadelphia, which brought with it a strong sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1958 introduction of Diuril (antihypertensive) and several other drugs (including the first measles vaccine) in the early 1960s was followed by a dry spell. In the 1970s an accelerated R&amp;D organization created new products including Clinoril (antiarthritic), Flexeril (muscle relaxant), and Timoptic (for glaucoma). Merck introduced 10 major new drugs in the 1980s, including Mevacor (high cholesterol) and Vasotec (high blood pressure).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company bought the nonprescription drug segment of ICI Americas; products from the purchase were contributed to a
   <company id="103986">
    Consumer Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   joint venture with
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . Merck bought pharmacy benefits manager
   <company id="54400">
    Medco Containment Services
   </company>
   in 1993. New drug launches in 1995 and 1996 included Cozaar (for reducing hypertension) and Pepcid AC (antacid). Also in 1996 Merck expanded its pharmacy benefit management operations with the purchase of Systemed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Merck and Rhône-Poulenc (now part of
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi-Aventis
   </company>
   ) merged their animal health units to form
   <company id="112833">
    Merial
   </company>
   . Merck also sold its insecticide and fungicide business to Novartis that year. In 1998
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   bought out Merck's 50% stake in a drug-marketing joint venture formed by the two firms in 1991. In 1999 the FDA approved Merck's preservative-free hepatitis B vaccine, Recombivax HB.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Merck acquired biotech firm
   <company id="100429">
    Rosetta Inpharmatics
   </company>
   . The company spun off its highly successful
   <company id="105515">
    Medco Health Solutions
   </company>
   drug distribution subsidiary in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Merck pulled its blockbuster pain medication Vioxx off the market after studies linked the drug to increased risks of strokes and heart attacks. (Merck settled thousands of class-action and personal-injury lawsuits related to Vioxx in 2007 for $4.85 billion.) The Vioxx safety scandal, along with the pending loss of patent protection on some of its biggest sellers like Zocor (which began facing competition in 2006), sent the company into recovery mode. Merck announced restructuring plans to make the company's operations leaner and more cost-effective in 2005 under new CEO Richard (Dick) Clark, a longtime Merck executive. Between 2005 and 2008 the company eliminated more than 10,000 jobs and closed a handful of manufacturing plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2006 to 2009 Merck worked aggressively to expand its biotech operations through the acquisition of companies including
   <company id="132026">
    GlycoFi
   </company>
   (biologic drug molecules), Abmaxis (monoclonal antibodies),
   <company id="51693">
    Sirna Therapeutics
   </company>
   (RNA interference or RNAi), and
   <company id="156281">
    NovaCardia
   </company>
   (cardiology drugs), as well as the follow-on (generic) biologic assets of
   <company id="99318">
    Insmed
   </company>
   . New drug launches included HIV drug Isentress and diabetes therapy Janumet in 2007 and blockbuster HPV vaccine Gardasil, the world's first anti-cancer vaccine, which was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Merck sold off the assets of its Rosetta Inpharmatics subsidiary to
   <company id="53172">
    Covance
   </company>
   (gene expression laboratory assets) and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   (expression analysis software assets). It also sold another research lab to
   <company id="47793">
    PPD
   </company>
   and contracted out certain lab functions to the buyer. Merck launched a new product, Emend, for chemotherapy side-effects that year. New drug launches in 2009 included Saphris, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Simponi, the next-generation version of top-selling drug Remicade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cholesterol drug Vytorin -- a combination of Schering-Plough's Zetia and Merck's Zocor -- began facing controversy in 2008 when study results were released questioning the drug's effectiveness compared to Merck's older medication Zocor. Controversy over Vytorin, along with some other pipeline setbacks (including the FDA's rejection of a Merck/Schering-Plough combo asthma drug and Merck's Cordaptive cholesterol candidate) led both predecessors Merck and Schering-Plough to announce layoffs and restructuring measures in 2008. Each company reduced its workforce by around 10% that year, with their respective US sales teams bearing the brunt of the cuts. The companies' troubles with Vytorin came to a head in 2009 when they agreed to pay about $42 million to settle class-action lawsuits filed by consumers and health plans over Vytorin's efficacy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, Merck and Schering-Plough decided to merge, taking the logical step of marriage to strengthen their defenses against future troubles (especially in light of increasing competitive challenges in the market), as well as to create cost savings opportunities and expanded avenues for revenue growth. The $41 billion transaction was conducted through a reverse-merger transaction in which the legacy Schering-Plough entity acquired the legacy Merck entity and took on the Merck name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the merger, Merck began simplifying its global branding under the Merck and MSD names, gradually phasing out the Schering-Plough moniker. The purchase expanded Merck's offerings in areas including inflammation, allergy, and cancer treatment, as well as biotech drugs. The acquisition also greatly expanded Merck's operations in the animal health and consumer health arenas.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, to gain Schering-Plough's animal health unit, Intervet (later renamed
   <company id="138726">
    Merck Animal Health
   </company>
   ), Merck had to sell its stake in veterinary joint venture
   <company id="112833">
    Merial
   </company>
   to partner
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi-Aventis
   </company>
   for about $4 billion later that year to avoid anti-trust issues. (Merck and Sanofi-Aventis later explored options to strike a fresh veterinary medicine joint venture by combining Merial with Intervet; however, after a year of planning, the two companies called off the deal in 2011 due to concerns over further anti-trust issues.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company experienced a sharp gain in profits in 2009 (reporting net income of $12.9 billion) due to gains on the sale of the Merial stake and on recognized equity from assets previously owned jointly with Schering-Plough.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Merck/Schering-Plough merger closed, the existing Merck CEO, Dick Clark, took the helm at the new Merck. Once the dust from the merger settled, however, Clark retired from the CEO post at the end of 2010, while remaining as chairman. President Kenneth Frazier stepped into the CEO role.
