   A leader in the California rice business, Farmers' Rice Cooperative (FRC) is a grower-owned cooperative that processes and markets about one quarter of all the rice grown in California. The co-op operates rice milling and processing facilities and markets and distributes its 700 grower-members' rice crops. It manufactures packaged rice for the consumer food industry, as well as bulk rice for cereal and other food manufacturers and brewers. In addition to packaged and bulk rice and ingredients, Farmers' also offers rice seed. It sells California rice to customers in the North America, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region. The US accounts for the majority of its sales.

The coop exports about 40% of its rice to Turkey, Japan, and Jordan. Other important markets include Hawaii, Guam, and the mid-Pacific Island region where FRC-branded products are market leaders.
