   Known for clothes both classic and comfortable, Donna Karan International (DKI) defines the metropolitan flair that bridges the difference between stylishly casual and conventional. The firm designs and sells men's and women's clothes, including suits, sportswear, accessories, and shoes, under the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, DKNY Jeans, and DKNY Active labels. DKI sells to upscale department and specialty stores and through its own retail stores. It also licenses third parties to run most of its international stores. Fashion leviathan

  <p>
   DKI has logged sales gains in the US and overseas, post-recession. The label attributes the positive momentum to fashion shows and its image makeover in recent years. Indeed, DKI concentrates on best-sellers and its concept of designing a collection that transitions well from day to evening.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy, DKI repositioned its 25-year-old Donna Karan Collection to expand its customer base and target a high-growth market segment, adding its own store in Las Vegas. In international markets, the LVMH apparel firm has seen traction in Asia for its New York line DKNY. Specifically, it's tapping new and emerging markets, namely China and India, for their growth potential.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a joint venture that currently extends through 2015, DKI partners with menswear maker S. Kumars Nationwide. With S. Kumars as 80% owner in the SKNL UK Ltd. entity, the company sources, designs, and distributes DKNY-branded men's apparel worldwide. The move allows womenswear expert DKI to concentrate on its core competencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also extensively licenses its name to the likes of

  <p>
   The former head designer for Anne Klein, Donna Karan founded Donna Karan International in 1984 to provide women with a seven-easy-pieces basic wardrobe, consisting of bodysuits and tights, dresses, skirts, blouses, jackets, pants, and accessories. Women loved it because Karan's styles were comfortable at work or on the town. The company expanded its product lines, moving into men's apparel (1991), beauty products (1992), and children's apparel (1995), among others. Donna Karan went public in 1996 (an attempt three years earlier had been a victim of bad timing) as one of several high-profile fashion IPOs. However, Karan was an artist, not a businesswoman, and her insistence on costly fabrics, high-profile fashion shows, and expensive marketing gimmicks -- combined with rapid expansion -- hurt the company's bottom line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Karan turned over CEO responsibilities to ex-Polo Ralph Lauren executive John Idol. Idol snipped away at costs by cutting 15% of the workforce and reducing the marketing budget. Partnerships were introduced the following year to raise licensing income. Agreements included Esprit de Corp. (children's clothes), Liz Claiborne (DKNY jeans), PVH (men's shirts), and Swank (jewelry). Frustrated by uninspired baby wear, Karan introduced infant fashions in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further clamp down on costs, the company announced in November 1999 that it would cut 160 jobs, largely by consolidating its women's divisions and closing a handful of outlet stores. The company also signed a licensing deal with Liz Claiborne to produce a new women's career and casual line. Donna Karan attributed the rebound of its profits in 1999 to its retail stores and licensed lines, and the company vowed to continue expanding on both fronts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2000 French luxury goods giant LVMH agreed to buy all of Donna Karan's trademarks from owners Donna Karan and Stephan Weiss for $450 million. LVMH later bought the entire company for $243 million. Weiss, Vice Chairman and husband of Donna Karan, died in June 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2003, Fred Wilson was installed as the latest CEO (following the departure of Idol and the interim tenure of chairman Brusone). Donna Karan still remains in creative control of the company's products. In November, CEO Wilson announced he was leaving the struggling company to become head of

   <company id="114088">
    Marc Jacobs International
   </company>
   , was named CEO later that month. Mark Weber, from PVH, replaced him in October 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   After buying the company in late 2001, LVMH in 2004 increased its share in DKI from 89% to 98%. The purchase brought with it a fresh cash infusion for DKI, which is part of its parent company's fashion and leather goods group.
