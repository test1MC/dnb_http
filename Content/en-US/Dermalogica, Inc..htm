   Whoever said beauty is only skin deep had the right idea, as far as Dermalogica is concerned. The personal care products company makes cleansers, toners, masques, exfoliants, and creams, as well as more specialized items, such as acne and under-eye treatments. Dermalogica's products are sold online and through International Dermal Institute-trained skin care professionals in more than 40 countries worldwide. These vendors can provide clients with Dermalogica's Face Mapping consultation, thermal back treatment, and touch therapies. Dermalogica was founded in 1986 by Jane Wurwand, who ceded control of operations in 2007. Dermalogica celebrated 25 years in business in 2011.

   Dermalogica targets both skin care professionals and consumers worldwide. The company's main focus is producing a product line free of common irritants and ingredients -- such as lanolin, mineral oil, artificial colors and fragrances, and SD (or denatured) alcohol -- that could cause breakouts.

  <p>
   Dermalogica is working to expand its business and boost its brand, as the skin care company had been growing at 20% a year prior to the recession. In 2013 the beauty firm developed and launched the BioActive chemical peel that's exclusively formulated for use in skin care centers, spas, and salons. Without post-peel redness or downtown, the four-step system addresses a diverse array of conditions, such as reducing skin roughness and the appearance of fine lines, treating pseudofolliculitis (razor bumps), and helping to clear acneic inflammation.

  <p>
   Looking to extend its reach into China, where the company is banking on growth, Dermalogica inked a deal with EIG Global China, a unit of Esthetics International Group, through which it gave EIG exclusive rights to distribute Dermalogica products in southern China through 2012.
