   Some media are accused of tilting to the left or to the right, but some like to stick strictly to the middle, the middle of the UK, that is. The Midland News Association (MNA) is a regional newspaper publisher. Its titles include the
   <i>
    Express &amp; Star
   </i>
   (Wolverhampton), and the
   <i>
    Shropshire Star
   </i>
   evening newspapers, as well as weekly papers (free and paid) in the Herefordshire, mid-Wales, Shropshire, and West Midlands regions. MNA, which is known for its newspaper survey covering the Midlands, has also branched out into radio and online (including mobile) media.
