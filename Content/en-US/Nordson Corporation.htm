   Nordson is all about adhesion, coating, and spraying. Its adhesive dispensing systems are used on a range of packaging, paperboard, and nonwoven products. A line of sealant systems bond and seal plastic, metal, and wood products. Nordson's spray systems apply powder paints and coatings to appliances and auto parts. The company also produces inspection systems for high-tech manufacturing. Nordson sells to the appliance, automotive, medical, solar energy, and semiconductor markets, among others. Nordson was established in 1909 as the U.S. Automatic Company.

  <p>
   Adhesive dispensing systems, about 50% of revenue, are used to decrease consumption, create more production efficiency, and to make products stronger and more durable as well optimize their brand presence and appearance. The segment's products are divided between four families: nonwovens (equipment for such products as diapers, feminine hygiene products, surgical gowns, shoe covers, and face masks); packaging (systems for food packages, wrappers, and beverage containers); product assembly (for building and construction materials, electronics, bags, sacks, books, and envelopes); and polymer processing (for flexible packaging, electronics, medical, building and construction, transportation and aerospace, and general consumer goods).
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced technology systems, more than 35% of revenue, serves the electronics, medical and high-tech markets with technologies that help accomplish surface preparation (contact lenses, electronics, medical instruments, printed circuit boards); dispensing materials on surfaces (piezoelectric and motionless two-component mixing dispensing systems for cell phones, liquid crystal displays, micro hard drives, among other products); bond testing and X-ray inspection (for the semiconductor and printed circuit board industries' manufacturing related to desktop computers, digital music players, mobile phones, and other products).
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial coating systems, roughly 15% of revenue, provides equipment for applying coatings, paint, finishes, sealants and for curing and drying applied material. The segment is divided between automotive (powertrain components, body assembly, final trim); container coating (beverage containers and food cans); liquid finishing (automotive components, construction, metal shelving, drums); and powder coating (agriculture and construction equipment, appliances, automotive components, metal shelving). Its curing and drying systems are used for electronics, containers, and durable goods.

  <p>
   The company has production facilities in more than 10 US states and in Belgium, China, Germany, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, and the UK.

  <p>
   Nordson has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues jumping 7% from $1.69 billion in 2015 to peak at a record-setting $1.81 billion in 2016. Profits climbed 29% from $211 million to $272 million over that same time period. In addition, operating cash flow increased from $262 million to $231 million mainly due to the additional net income that was fueled by favorable changes in accounts payable and inventories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2016 was fueled by a rise in organic sales and additional revenue from acquisitions. Advanced technology systems sales climbed 14% due to increases across all regions (especially Japan and the Asia/Pacific regions), fueled by acquisitions and strong organic growth in all product lines. In addition, adhesive dispensing systems sales jumped 5% in 2016 resulting from mostly organic growth that was driven by product lines serving the consumer non-durable, disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging,and polymer processing end markets.

  <p>
   Nordson's strategy includes expanding its international footprint, which already covers more than 30 countries through direct operations. The company focuses on its existing products, nurturing them along with engineering and research and development, while also seeking growth markets through such methods as the acquisition of companies active in the multinational market.

  <p>
   Nordson has achieved milestone revenue numbers through the help of acquisitions. In early 2017, the company acquired Washington-based ACE Production Technologies, a designer and manufacturer of selective soldering systems used in a variety of automotive and industrial electronics assembly applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Nordson picked up California-based LinkTech Quick Couplings, a manufacturer and distributor of highly engineered precision couplings and fittings, for $43 million. The deal broadened the company's offerings within the fittings and connectors product line and filled a strategic gap in the company's growing portfolio of single use, highly engineered components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nordson expanded internationally in 2015 through the purchase of MatriX Technologies GmbH, a Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of automated X-ray inspection (AXI) equipment, for $54 million. The transaction enabled Nordson to offer its customers a full range of automated and manual, in-line and batch X-ray inspection products (AXI and MXI), automated optical inspection systems (AOI), and bond testers.

  <p>
   Nordson was founded in 1909 as the U.S. Automatic Company, a maker of low-cost screw machine parts for the auto industry. After the company went bankrupt in 1929, Walter Nord bought the company and reorganized it in 1935 as U.S. Automatic Corp. Following WWII Walter and sons Eric and Evan developed high-pressure paint-spraying equipment. In 1954 Evan formed the Nordson Division to make airless spray equipment; the division moved into thermoplastic adhesion in the 1960s. The division absorbed the parent company in 1966. In 1979 Nordson went public. Eric, who became president and chairman, brought in 20-year Standard Oil veteran William Madar as CEO in 1986. During Madar's tenure, Nordson's sales quadrupled to $600 million annually.
