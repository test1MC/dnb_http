   Photowatt's products are used in both on-grid and off-grid applications. They can be used in solar energy systems connected to a utility grid to provide additional power to homes and businesses. Grid-connected applications continue to experience rapid growth due to government incentive programs around the world and favorable cost savings on monthly utility bills for consumers. Photowatt's solar products are also applied to standalone systems in places where utility-generated power is unavailable or too costly. Off-grid solar power is used in everything from charging boat batteries to supplying electricity to lights or water pumps in rural areas.
