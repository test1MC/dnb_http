   Cohu makes equipment that puts semiconductors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs)through their paces when they are tested. It makes pick-and-place equipment and instruments called test handlers that usher semiconductors through the trials of testing to make sure they're in working order. Top customers are
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   (18% of sales) and
   <company id="103883">
    NXP Semiconductors
   </company>
   (11% of sales). The company operates through subsidiaries Delta Design, Rasco, and Ismeca. Cohu has jettisoned two businesses -- video cameras for surveillance and microwave communications systems -- to concentrate on chip testing.

  <p>
   Cohu's Delta Design unit offers pick-and-place test handlers, thermal subsystems, and environmental chambers to semicondcutor makers. The Rasco unit sells gravity feed, test-in-strip handlers, and micro-electro mechanical system(MEMS) test units. Ismeca offers turret-based test handling and back-end finishing equipment for integrated circuits and LEDs.

  <p>
   Semiconductor testing is often done is low-cost markets, which helps explain why Malaysia accounts for Cohu's biggest chunk of revenue, 23%. The company generates another 20% in China and claims 19% of sales from chip maker facilities in the US. Another 6% is from the Philippines with the rest of the world accounting for 32% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cohu makes its equipment at facilities in California, the Philippines, Germany, Malaysia, and China.

  <p>
   Cohu commits its salespeople to geographic markets where it believes the sales potential is the greatest. Otherwise it works through independent sales reps.

   Cohu's revenue slid about 15% in 2015 to some $270 million from 2014 with demand for testing equipment experiencing a down year in the cyclical market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a profit of $250,000 for 2015, a 97% drop from 2014's $8.7 million profit on the lower revenue. It continued to show losses from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cohu managed to generate a $21 million stream of cash in 2015, $1.8 million more than 2014.

   Cohu has become more lean and focused in the past two years. It sold the Broadcast Microwave Services business in 2015 for $5 million in cash and its video camera business, Cohu Electronics, in 2014 for $10.3 million. The sales of the extraneous businesses put Cohu whole hog in the test-equipment business, which is dependent on the notoriously up-and-down market of the semiconductor industry.

  <p>
   Kalbfell Laboratories was incorporated in 1947, an outgrowth of a research and development partnership founded in 1945. The company originally made electronic devices for government agencies. It shifted its emphasis to power supply units in 1952 and a year later expanded into closed-circuit television (CCTV) equipment. The company was renamed Kay Lab in 1954 and Cohu Electronics (after chairman La Motte Cohu) in 1957. It became Cohu Inc. in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s CEO James Barnes directed Cohu's entry into semiconductor test handling equipment. The company acquired microwave equipment maker
   <company id="139907">
    Broadcast Microwave Services
   </company>
   in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chip handling gear became Cohu's primary business during the chip boom of the early 1990s. The company established its Singapore subsidiary in 1993. The next year it acquired Daymarc, a maker of gravity-feed semiconductor handling equipment, to complement its Delta Design pick-and-place machines.
