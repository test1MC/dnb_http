   While it can't turn you into the bionic man, hearing technology firm Advanced Bionics can help restore hearing to the deaf. A leading provider of cochlear hearing devices, Advanced Bionics (also known as AB) makes the HiResolution (HiRes) Bionic Ear System, which includes a cochlear implant, sound processor, and other equipment that together can help severe-to-profound hearing loss to hear. The implants are compatible with several processing systems (sold under the Auria, Neptune, and Platinum Series brand) and T-Mic microphone system. The company provides mentoring and support services to implant customers worldwide. Advanced Bionics is a subsidiary of global hearing aid manufacturer

  <p>
   As a subsidiary of Sonova -- maker of the Phonak and Lyric hearing aids -- Advanced Bionics operates independently, while benefiting from access to Sonova's technologies and distribution network. It is also strengthening its existing product development relationship with Sonova's Phonak division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key Advanced Bionics offerings include the Harmony processor and Fidelity 120 software, which support the HiRes system. The company was founded in 1993, and its implant system was first marketed in 1996.

   Through its history, the company has conducted R&amp;D programs to produce newer, improved versions of its ear implants and related equipment. In 2013 it introduced the Naida CI sound processor in partnership with Phonak. It also launched two iPad applications to help hearing professionals and patients with rehabilitation and learning processes that year. In addition to product growth, Advanced Bionics is working to expand sales in key growth regions, such as China. In 2014 it established subsidiaries in New Zealand and Vietnam, further strengthening its position in the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   Advanced Bionics was acquired by global hearing aid manufacturer
   <company id="154140">
    Sonova
   </company>
   for $489 million in early 2010. Founder and co-CEO Alfred Mann retired upon the acquisition's closure; Mann owned about 60% of Advanced Bionics prior to the sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Bionics' acquisition by Sonova came only a couple of years after the company parted ways with former parent
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   . The medical device giant had acquired Advanced Bionics in 2004; however, after a rocky post-acquisition process, the marriage was terminated through a reverse merger transaction in early 2008.
