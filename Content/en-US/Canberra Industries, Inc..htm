   The threat of radiological weapons may trigger a high alert, but it translates into business for Canberra Industries, which specializes in making radiation-detection and analysis instrumentation. A unit of

   , the nuclear-power generation and electricity transmission and distribution giant, Canberra supplies integrated nuclear gamma and alpha spectroscopy devices to the nuclear power industry and the

   . The high-tech firm also helps industries engaged in fissile material production, state, and federal radioactive material repositories, and environmental agencies with its nuclear watchdog devices. Canberra has production and engineering sites in Europe and North America.

   Canberra in 2012 rolled out next-generation products, including two electric Cryo-coolers, to expand its portfolio of products. The Cryo-Pulse 5 Plus is a wholly electrically-powered cryostat for use with High Purity Germanium (HPGe) radiation detectors while the Cryo-Cycle II is considered to be a hybrid cryostat, as it combines the advantages of electric cooling with the reliability of liquid nitrogen.

   Founded in 1965 to serve the nuclear power industry, the company began building measurement and control devices for nuclear reactors and industrial processes. Through acquisitions, Canberra has expanded into nuclear-related areas, such as health physics, computer-based spectroscopy, and neutron counting instrumentation. In 2011, in response to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the company made a speedy shipment of radiation-measuring equipment used to scan a person's body for radiation and radiation detection devices used to determine if an area is safe.

   Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, Canberra has secured several contracts. The Homeland Security Department pushed to install its Advanced Spectroscopic Portal monitor, which detects the presence and type of radiation. The device ramps up cargo screening for terrorists' weapons at ports and border posts. (Funding was later tabled pending an audit by the

   tapped Canberra for its high-purity germanium detectors and software, and the

   for radiation detectors. Helping to stem worldwide nuclear proliferation, a subsidiary, Canberra Albuquerque (formerly Aquila, Inc.), has cooperated with

   to develop and market instruments that determine whether nuclear material is missing from storage areas.

   In 2008 a Canberra subsidiary collaboratively produced a range of detectors to be used in an experiment to understand how matter was formed after the "Big Bang."
