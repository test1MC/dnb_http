  <p>
   When GM filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in mid-2009, the federal Canadian government and the provincial government of Ontario supported GM and its Canadian subsidiary with loans of more than C$10 billion (about $10 billion), in exchange for an equity stake of nearly 12% in the restructured "New GM" that emerged from bankruptcy reorganization. GMCL did not seek protection from creditors under Canadian bankruptcy law.

  <p>
   In 2013 GM announced it was investing $250 million in its CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario. The investment will be used to install flexible body shop equipment and tooling and will transform the manufacturing facility to support future vehicle production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manufacturing flexibility is a key priority for the car maker, and the investment will give CAMI the ability to build a higher variety of differentiated products on multiple platforms at much lower costs. It also allows GM to deliver products to the market at a faster pace.

  <p>
   The company began in 1908 as a partnership between the family-owned McLaughlin Carriage Company and Buick Motor Company; GM bought McLaughlin in 1918 and made it the center of its Canadian operations.
