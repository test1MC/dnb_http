   Curis's cancer patients and
   <company id="42010">
    Sega's
   </company>
   gamers might one day have an unlikely hero in common: Sonic the Hedgehog. Drug development firm Curis is studying hedgehog signaling pathways (including the sonic hedgehog pathway, named after the Sega mascot) to find treatments for oncology ailments and other conditions. Such signaling pathways regulate tissue growth and repair, and the company is looking for ways to either stimulate them or slow them down as a means of treating disease. Curis is collaborating with
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   to develop cancer drugs using hedgehog pathways. The company also has internal development programs for cancer treatments using other signaling pathways.

  <p>
   The development stage company relies heavily on collaborations to help it take products through trials in hopes of gaining FDA approval. Its main partnership with Genentech (and Genentech's parent, Roche) is focused on commercializing Erivedge, which was approved in late 2012. It is the first and only approved treatment for basal cell carcinoma. The drug is also being tested for other oncology applications including breast, lung, and prostate cancers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Curis is also working with DebioPharm on candidates to cure advanced liver and kidney cancer.

  <p>
   The company is headquartered in the US and Erivedge is approved in the US and EU and in Australia.

  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Curis relies on funding from its collaborations with larger firms to take its candidates into clinical trials. In 2013 revenue dropped 12% as payments from Genentech dropped since Erivedge was approved. The company did make slightly more from royalties but not enough to move the revenue total upward. Though Curis still showed a net loss for 2013, the number improved from $16 million to $12 million, a 25% move, as the company paid out based on the commercialization of Erivedge. Cash flow improved by about $6 million due to the first sales of Erivedge. Curis had an accumulated deficit of $760 million as of the end of 2013.

  <p>
   As a result, the company is pursuing additional collaborative agreements, primarily for its cancer programs. It also intends to develop its own clinical capabilities in order to retain more rights to the candidates it discovers. In addition, Curis licenses out its technologies to third parties for use in their independent development efforts.
