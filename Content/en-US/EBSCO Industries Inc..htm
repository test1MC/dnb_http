   Few portfolios are more diverse than that of EBSCO Industries (short for Elton B. Stephens Company). Among the conglomerate's more than 50 information services, manufacturing, and sales subsidiaries are magazine subscription and fulfillment firms, a fishing lure manufacturer (the world's largest), a rifle manufacturer, a specialty office and computer furniture retailer, and real estate holdings. Its main businesses revolve around the publishing industry: EBSCO operates a subscription management agency and is one of the largest publishers of digital information. It offers about 375,000 articles from more than 95,000 publishers worldwide. The family of founder Elton B. Stephens, Sr. owns the company.

  <p>
   During the 1930s Elton B. Stephens Sr. put himself through college selling magazine subscriptions. Although he later earned a law degree, Stephens thought he could make more money selling magazines. Stephens and his wife, Alys, formed Military Service Co. in 1944 to sell magazines, binders, and display racks to the US military.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in his career Stephens suggested that he'd like to own five companies so that he'd have a fallback if one failed. He set about fulfilling his wish, forming Metal Fabricators and Finishers (now Vulcan Industries) in 1946, Vulcan Binder &amp; Cover (now Vulcan Information Packaging) in 1947, and Vulcan Enterprises (now Directional Advertising Services) in 1954. In 1958 the Stephens' businesses were combined under the name EBSCO Industries, Inc. (the name is an acronym for Elton B. Stephens Company). In 1960 EBSCO acquired Chicago's Hanson-Bennett Magazine Agency, and in 1967 it bought Los Angeles' National Publications and binder manufacturer The Burkhardt Co. of Detroit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stephens retired as president of the company in 1971, and his son James took over. The following year EBSCO bought the Franklin Square Agency and Ziff-Davis' subscription service, doubling the volume of EBSCO Subscription Services. EBSCO started its Publisher Promotion and Fulfillment service and added operations in Europe in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   EBSCO acquired Valley Joist (metal construction products) in 1976 and H. Wilson Co. (audiovisual and computer furniture) in 1977. EBSCO Curriculum Materials and EBSCO Reception Room Subscription Services were formed in 1979 and 1980, respectively. Purchases in 1980 included Metro Press (now EBSCO Graphics), National Billiard, and PRADCO (fishing lures).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Elton began a second career at age 70 when he founded Alabama Bancorp.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under James's direction, EBSCO continued to grow through acquisitions and startups. It bought Four Seasons (promotional clothing and other items, 1983) and NSC International (binding and laminating products, 1984). The company formed electronic database publisher EBSCO Electronic Information (now EBSCO Publishing, 1986) and bought Bomber Bait (1988).
  </p>
  <p>
   After a short breather, the company acquired Luxor (school and library furniture) in 1992. That year the various Vulcan operations were combined in a new facility in Moody, Alabama. The company acquired Dynamic Information (later EBSCO Document Services) in 1994. The following year it bought Northeast Looseleaf (now part of Vulcan Information Packaging), and in 1996 it formed EBSCO Magazine Express.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year EBSCO bought Fred Arbogast, maker of the Jitterbug and Hula Popper fishing lures, and hunting game-call maker Knight &amp; Hale. In 1998 the company bought Network Support, a Canadian maker of document imaging and management software, and closed down its document delivery unit. That year EBSCO Development Company was formed, beginning plans for Mount Laurel -- a traditional neighborhood development. In 1999 EBSCO Publishing revealed Searchasaurus, an online search engine for children. The following year EBSCO formed EBSCOPrint.com to sell promotional products via the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to handle all its insurance needs in-house, in 2001 EBSCO acquired insurance firm S.S. Nesbitt &amp; Co. In 2003 EBSCO acquired the European operations of RoweCom, a company that provided libraries with an online service giving subscribers access to more than 240,000 periodicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   James Stephens announced in 2004 that he would step down as CEO in 2005 and appointed company executive Dixon Brooke Jr. (James's brother-in-law) as his replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 EBSCO expanded its medicine and consumer health data with the acquisition of the assets of
   <company id="59667">
    HealthGate Data's
   </company>
   patient content repository business for $8.1 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 EBSCO acquired Salem Press, a publisher of health, literature, and history reference books and databases. Salem is complementary to existing content from EBSCOhost. The following year EBSCO acquired NetLibrary and launched its EBSCO Discovery Service research platform.
