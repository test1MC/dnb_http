   Savencia (formerly Bongrain) makes a variety of commodity and specialty cheeses and other dairy foods, including yogurt and butter. Its several hundred brand names include Caprice des Dieux, Elle &amp; Vire, Fine Bouche, Saint Albray, and Tartare. Bongrain's North American brands include Alouette, Chavrie, and Ile de France. Processing 4.2 billion liters of milk a year, Bongrain's products are sold in 120 countries worldwide. The company was founded by Jean-Noël Bongrain, who took over his family's cheese-making business in the small French village of Illoud in 1944.

  <p>
   Jean-Noël Bongrain took over his family's cheese making business in 1944 in the small French village of Illoud. In 1956 he launched the company's first big brand, a pasteurized soft cheese he called Caprice des Dieux ("caprice of the gods").
  </p>
  <p>
   Bongrain began acquiring other French regional dairies, including ones in Dordogne (1959), in the Atlantic Pyrenees (1967), and in Haute Loire (1968). It expanded into Germany (1962); Austria, Switzerland, and the US (1968); and Belgium (1969). Bongrain supplemented its growth with the launch of new brands such as Tartar in 1965.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began exporting its cheeses to Japan in the 1960s and entered Brazil when it bought Polenghi in 1976. Bongrain bought US cheese and yogurt maker Zausner Foods (Alouette and Fleur de Lait cheese, Colombo brand yogurt) in 1977. The company strengthened control over its milk supplies with the purchases of additional dairies in France during this period. The company went public in 1980 and headed down under a year later when it bought Australia's LACTOS.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bongrain moved into the UK in 1987 and in 1989 bought eight dairies in the Americas and Europe, including California-based Alta Dena Certified Dairy (through its Zauser Foods subsidiary) and the UK's Millway Foods. The next year it moved into Argentina with the purchase of Santa Rosa. Bongrain's aggressiveness wasn't limited to acquisitions as it also introduced eight new brands in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including Carré Finesse, P'tit Louis, and Saint Amour. During this time it also diversified into cheese-based desserts and bought a catering company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company allied itself with the French cooperative l'Union Laitière Normande to create the Compagnie Laitière Européenne (European Dairy Company) in 1992; Bongrain owned 10% of the new company (increased to 34% in 1999). With the end of the Cold War, Bongrain became the first French cheese company to move into markets in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia, in the early 1990s. In 1993 the firm sold its US yogurt company, Colombo, to General Mills. It also expanded into other South American companies and into India, where it created Dabon International Private through a joint venture with Dabur India Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company moved its headquarters to Viroflay and built its first plant in China. That year Bernard Lacan replaced founder Jean-Noël Bongrain as chairman. In 1999 Bongrain sold Alta Dena to US dairy giant Dean Foods and sold Millway Foods (UK) to Dairy Crest. In 2000 the company announced plans to diversify by developing industrial butter and animal feed operations. In 2001 it formed a joint venture with Land O' Lakes to produce sterile-packaged cheese sauces in the US.

   With a presence already in Spain, in 2003 the company acquired the Andalusian dairy products maker Angulo. In late Bongrain tucked more into its hamper of German cheeses when it completed the purchase of two major brands from
