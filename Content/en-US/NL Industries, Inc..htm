  <p>
   NL Industries' revenues increased by 11% in 2013 thanks to higher demand for high security pin tumbler locks within the Security Products business, and from a growth in Marine Component sales (outside of the high-performance boat market) through gains in market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth of its Security Products' sales was supported by the company's ongoing push to diversify products and customers. Marine Components' net sales increased as a result of higher sales in the ski/wakeboard boat market and other non-high performance marine markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has incurred a net loss of $55 million in 2013 compared to a net income of $75 million in 2012 due to higher corporate expenses and other costs, and an equity loss from its Kronos operations.

  <p>
   NL Industries' routinely compares its liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows it expects to receive from its subsidiaries and affiliates. It uses this process to raise additional capital, incur debt, repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise modify its dividend policies, consider the sale of its interests in its subsidiaries, affiliates, business, marketable securities or other assets, (or any combination of these actions) in order to increase liquidity, reduce indebtedness, and fund future activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash to pay down debt, in 2012 the company sold CompX's Furniture Components operations to a competitor for $58 million.
