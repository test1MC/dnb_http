   The company continues to focus on its core products. Watkins still sells its first product -- Original Liniment -- which soothes muscle aches. To build on its expertise in making spices, soaps, and perfumes, Watkins in recent years has expanded its products portfolio.

   To provide its customers with a healthier alternative to iodized salt, the company sells a coarse sea salt grinder. It also serves the natural home cleaning products market with its J.R. Watkins Natural Home Care line, named after the founder of the company. This is a key product niche as the company chases after an increased share in the more lucrative natural cleaners market.
