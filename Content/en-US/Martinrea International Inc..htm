  <p>
   Based in Ontario, Canada, Martinrea has about 40 facilities in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Europe, China, and the US. It has over 7 million sq. ft. of manufacturing space. The company makes the majority of its revenues from the US (39% of net sales), Canada (21%), and Mexico (20%).

  <p>
   Martinrea's revenues increased 7% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to favorable foreign currency rates and the launching of new programs. The company in 2015 was also helped by a spike in production sales from its new fluids systems plant in China and an additional uptick in tooling sales. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Martinrea's net income also increased from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to gains made on the disposals of plants and other properties. The company's operating cash flow, however, decreased during that time mainly due to changes in working capital as a result of an increase in trade and other receivables, an increase in inventories, and an uptick in prepaid expenses and deposits.

  <p>
   Martinrea is growing its presence in the market segments in which it competes through targeted acquisitions. In 2014 it acquired the 45% of interest it didn't already own of Honsel AG, a Germany-based light-metal component supplier. The deal gave it a significant presence in Europe and the Americas in the aluminum automotive parts market, and it broadened its metal forming product capabilities and offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward Martinrea also wishes to exploit additional opportunities in key non-automotive areas, including transit, agriculture, air conditioning systems, recreational vehicles, and the military supply base.
