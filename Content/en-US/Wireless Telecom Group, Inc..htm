   In an industry that prefers signal over noise, Wireless Telecom Group sure makes a lot of racket. The company, which markets products under the brand name Noisecom, makes electronic noise generators for wireless telecommunications systems. Its products are used to test whether such systems can receive transmitted information. Its noise emulator products also operate in radar and satellite systems to continually monitor and test receivers or to jam signals. Wireless Telecom's Boonton Electronics subsidiary makes radio-frequency (RF) and microwave test equipment. Its Microlab subsidiary makes high-power, passive microwave components. Wireless Telecom Group gets one-quarter of sales from outside the Americas region.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Wireless Telecom Group's largest segment is Microlab, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. nThe unit makes neutral host distributed antenna system (DAS) and co-siting combiner instruments, hybrid couplers and hybrid matrices, cross band couplers, attenuators, RF terminations, RF power splitter and diplexers, as well as RF combiners and broadband combiner boxes for in-building DAS deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rest comes from sales of the test and measurement segment -- the Boonton and Noisecom operations. Products measure the power of RF and microwave systems used by the military and telecommunications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also offers a line of broadband test sources for cable TV and cable modems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company handles some of its manufacturing, including assembly and testing. Other parts of the production processes are outsourced to third-party contractors.
  </p>

  <p>
   Wireless Telecom Group gets 75% of its revenue from customers in the Americas, followed by Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), 18%, and the Asia/Pacific region, 7%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's channel partners account for 90% of sales, although no one partner is responsible for 10% or more of sales. About 89% of sales go to commercial customers, most of them communications companies. The other 11% of sales were to US government agencies made mainly through defense contractors.

  <p>
   Wireless Telecom Group posted lower revenue, profit, and cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue dropped 18% to $33.1 million in 2015 from $40.3 million in 2014. Sales of its passive microwave components suffered from reductions in capital spending by wireless operators in the US. Defense contractors also reduced orders for test and measurement equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   After several years of profit in the $2 million-$3 million range, Wireless Telecom Group's 2015 net income was $376,000. That was a slide of 84% from 2014's $2.4 million profit. The company blamed the revenue reduction for the diminished revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow generated by operations fell to $1 million in 2015 from $4 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Throughout 2015 Wireless Telecom Group reduced costs, cutting headcount 15% as well as knocking down operating expenses. The headcount reduction cut $500,000 in spending for the year and should cut $1.5 million on an annualized basis. The company also reinvested to strengthen management and develop new products.

  <p>
   Founded in Paramus, New Jersey, in 1985 by Karabet (Gary) Simonyan, Noise Com began providing noise sources and systems testing for the military. Its products determined whether sophisticated communications devices were receiving and understanding the information being transmitted. Until 1992, the majority of sales continued to come from government and military contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the wake of defense cutbacks, in 1993 the company expanded its commercial product lines to include signal testing devices for the commercial telecommunications market, which by 1997 accounted for 95% of sales. In 1994 the company changed its name to Wireless Telecom; it continued to market its noise source products under the name of Noise Com, and distributed test systems under its new name. Simonyan stepped away from day-to-day responsibilities in 1996, and was replaced by president Dale Sydnor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company began providing test systems for ICO Global Communications' satellite network. Lowered sales in its wireless and satellite test emulator line caused a drop in profits for 1998. In 1999 longtime Wireless Telecom employee Edward Garcia replaced Sydnor as chairman and CEO. As part of a reorganization around noise generators, the company that year sold its wireless and satellite communications test equipment business to Telecom Analysis Systems (TAS), a subsidiary of electronics company Bowthorpe (now
   <company id="90064">
    Spirent Communications
   </company>
   ). As part of the deal, Wireless Telecom gained TAS's noise generation product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company acquired test equipment maker Boonton Electronics to expand its line of products for measuring wireless signal power. Wireless Telecom added passive components to its catalog in 2002 with the purchase of Microlab/FXR. Later that year Wireless Telecom relocated its corporate headquarters and other offices in the former HQ of Boonton Electronics in Parsippany, New Jersey. Boonton Electronics took its name from the New Jersey town just north of Parsippany, where it was located for many years. Boonton Electronics was established in nearby Morris Plains in 1947.
  </p>
  <p>
   Edward Garcia resigned as president and CEO in 2004, becoming an engineering consultant to the company. Terence McCoy, a

   executive, was named to succeed Garcia as CEO, while CFO Paul Genova took on the additional post of president. McCoy quit after just three months as CEO, however. Founder and chairman Gary Simonyan stepped in as interim CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wireless Telecom greatly grew in size with its 2005 acquisition of Willtek Communications, a German test and measurement firm. Sales increased in all geographic regions of the world, especially in Europe, as a result of the acquisition. The acquisition more than doubled Wireless Telecom's headcount.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cyrille Damany, the CEO and GM of Willtek Communications, took over as CEO of Wireless Telecom following the acquisition. He lasted only two months before resigning. Paul Genova, the president and CFO, became interim CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gary Simonyan became vice chairman of the board upon closing of the Willtek transaction in 2005; Savio Tung was appointed chairman. Simonyan resigned from the board three months later, finally leaving the company he founded 20 years earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Wireless Telecom named

   executive James (Monty) Johnson Jr. as vice chairman and CEO of the company. In 2008 Wireless Telecom rebranded its subsidiaries, making their logos and Web sites look similar to each other.
