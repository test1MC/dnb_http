  <p>
   T.D. Williamson leverages its leading market position by offering a broad spectrum of technical experience and a continuously refined portfolio of customized services and state-of-the-art equipment. Its support personnel includes engineers, project managers, and technicians, who are accessible to clients on a 24/7 basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its operations in the Middle East, in 2014 the company opened a new maintenance center in Abu Dhabi to complement its existing hot tap and STOPPLE plugging service center. The expansion is in keeping with T.D. Williamson's plans to strengthen its inspection business in the Gulf region and to provide turnkey facilities and back-up for the preparation, maintenance, and mobilization of inline inspection equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its geographic network, in 2013 T.D. Williamson opened a service center in Abu Dhabi, and in 2012 an office in Kazakhstan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company puts a strong emphasis on innovation and product development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 TDW Offshore Services signed a deal with
   <company id="53103">
    Centrica
   </company>
   Storage Limited to provide pipeline isolation services using its SmartPlug Technology. The tool makes allows operators to gain significant benefits in the form of reduced downtime and associated costs by safely isolating pressure in an active pipeline, and maintaining production while maintenance is carried out.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   It conducted a successful pipeline intervention in 2012 using the SmartPlug pressure isolation tool. Carried out for Talisman Malaysia Limited, the operation allowed the safe replacement of a shutdown valve on a key section of a gas export pipeline without having to bleed down the line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, the company developed and deployed a new proprietary inline inspection reporting software -- Interactive Report 2013 --  a data visualization tool that makes it easy for users to filter and view their pipeline inspection data.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company unveiled its Subsea 1200RC Tapping Machine, a compact remote-controlled subsea machine that allows hot tapping (tying in to a pressurized system while under full operating conditions) to be carried out with increased safety from a diving support vessel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its project contract portfolio, in 2012 T.D. Williamson signed a three-year global pipeline intervention and isolation services contract with
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
   (one of only four such contracts awarded worldwide by BP).
  </p>
  <p>
   T.D. Williamson has expanded internationally in the last two decades. With opening of service centers in Dubai, Jamnagar (India), Moscow, Rayong (Thailand), and Warsaw in 2007 it had locations in every continent except Antarctica. It opened a facility in India in 2010 in order to respond to the growing pipeline business in that country (which is expected to double from 25,000 km. by 2015).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 it created the Global Pipeline Integrity Center in Salt Lake City, Utah to combine the TDW inline inspection engineering, manufacturing, operations, service center, and data analysis functions in one location.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded by T.D. Williamson Sr. in 1920 as The Petroleum Electric Company, an electrical contracting firm to supply electric motors for gas booster stations, oil well drilling equipment, and electric generator stations, used by the local oil and gas industry in the US. It adopted the T.D. Williamson name in 1933.
