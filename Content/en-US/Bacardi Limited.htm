   You want proof? The people at Bacardi pour their business into it. One of the world's leading premium spirits makers, Bacardi produces 10 varieties of its namesake rum (of which it sells some 20 million cases every year). In addition to rum, the company's portfolio counts more than 200 brands and labels, such as Bombay Sapphire gin, Martini vermouth, Dewar's Scotch whisky, Cazadores tequila, Grey Goose vodka. Other spirits in its portfolio include liquors, cognac, brandy, and sparkling wine. Founded in 1862 in Cuba, the company, through its affiliates, operates nearly 30 production sites worldwide and sells in more than 150 countries. Descendants of founder Facundo Bacardi y Massó own Bacardi.

  <p>
   Facundo Bacardi y Massó immigrated to Cuba from Spain in 1830. He started in the liquor business as a rum salesman for John Nunes, an Englishman who owned a small distillery in Santiago, Cuba. In 1862 Facundo, his brother José, and a French wine merchant bought Nunes' distillery and began producing a smoother rum from a formula created by Facundo after years of trial and error. The more mixable quality of Bacardi's rum proved to be a key to its success. In 1877 Facundo passed company leadership to his sons; the eldest, Emilio, took over running the company (and spent some of his spare time in jail for his anti-Spanish activities).
  </p>
  <p>
   Bacardi Limited struggled during the 1890s as Cuba's economy foundered. The business was thrown into even greater turmoil when revolutionary leader José Marti began what would be the final fight for Cuban independence. One of Marti's biggest supporters was Emilio, who earned another stay in jail and then exile for his sympathies. After Cuba gained its independence in 1902, Bacardi grew rapidly, getting a further boost from Prohibition as Havana became "the unofficial US saloon." (Prohibition did, however, end a venture in the US.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company moved into brewing in the 1920s and expanded its rum operations in the 1930s, opening a distillery in Mexico (1931) and another in Puerto Rico (1935). In 1944 it opened Bacardi Imports in the US and built up its overseas operations during the 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid all its success, Bacardi again became embroiled in Cuban politics during the late 1950s. Although some company leaders showed open opposition to Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista and support for Fidel Castro, others opposed Castro. As a result of the 1959 revolution, the Bacardi family was forced into exile, fleeing to the US and Europe. Castro seized Bacardi's assets in 1960. However, the expropriation was not a fatal blow since both the Mexican and Puerto Rican operations had been out-earning the Cuban operations since the 1940s. Bacardi continued to enjoy explosive growth during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1977 some family members sold about 12% of the Bacardi empire to Hiram Walker.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1980 Bacardi was the #1 liquor brand in the US, but family squabbles and bad decisions threatened the company. Bacardi Capital, set up to manage the empire's money, lost $50 million in 1986. That year the empire's leadership started to buy up shares in Bacardi companies, including those sold to Hiram Walker and the 10% of Bacardi Corporation that had been sold to the public in 1962.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to diversify and to increase its European markets, the company bought a majority stake in Martini &amp; Rossi in 1993. Two years later it launched Bacardi Limon, a citrus-flavored rum, and Hatuey (pronounced "ah-tway") beer. In 1996 family lawyer George Reid became president and CEO, the first nonfamily member to head the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bacardi acquired the rights to the Havana Club trademark in 1997 from the Arechabala family. The move exacerbated a dispute with France's Pernod Ricard, which had partnered with the Cuban government to use the Havana Club name. Bacardi bought the Dewar's Scotch whisky and Bombay gin brands from Diageo in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Reid resigned and Ruben Rodriguez was appointed president and CEO. Rodriguez added chairman to his titles when Manuel Jorge Cutillas retired later in the year. In 2000 Bacardi (along with partner

   ) also lost the bidding war for Seagram's alcoholic drinks business (Glenlivet, Sterling Vineyards, Martell Cognac) to rival bidding duo

   and

   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Bacardi acquired Tequila Cazadores, a leader in Mexico's Agave Reposado segment. Javier Ferran, an 18-year company veteran, left Bacardi in 2004 after serving as CEO for only about 18 months. Ferran was replaced by Andreas Gembler, a

    Philip Morris
   </company>
   veteran.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004 Bacardi topped off its liquor offerings with the purchase of premium vodka brand, Grey Goose. Rodriguez retired in 2005 as the company's chairman. Bacardi named Facundo Bacardi, a great-grandson of the company's founder, as chairman. Rodriguez remained a board member. In 2006 the company acquired New Zealand spirits company 42 BELOW, known for its vodka, for approximately $91 million.
