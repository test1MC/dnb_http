  <p>
   Anton Rupert started a tobacco company in the late 1940s that eventually became the Rembrandt Group, a tobacco and liquor giant in South Africa with other diverse holdings. To avoid possible antiapartheid sanctions, in 1988 Rupert and his son, Johann, spun off Rembrandt's non-South African holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those holdings included 33% of UK-based tobacco firm Rothmans International (Benson &amp; Hedges). Rothmans had a controlling stake in Dunhill Holdings (tobacco and accessories), and it had acquired piecemeal a major stake in jeweler Cartier in the 1970s and 1980s. The Rembrandt spin off, based in Zug, Switzerland, and named Compagnie Financière Richemont, went public in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Richemont increased its stake in Rothmans in 1990 to about 63% by purchasing Philip Morris' shares. The next year Richemont expanded into new areas, buying South African pay-TV station M-Net and, through a joint venture, acquiring 49% of Horn &amp; Hardart (which became Hanover Direct in 1993). Dunhill acquired the Karl Lagerfeld fashion house in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   In part to shelter the company from UK taxes, in 1993 Richemont's assets were split into two publicly traded companies: Rothmans International (tobacco) and Vendôme Luxury Group, which combined Dunhill's fashion holdings and Cartier. (Vendôme is a square in Paris where many expensive Cartier items are sold.) Richemont retained majority interests in both firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Richemont acquired the shares of Rothmans it didn't already own and merged it with Rembrandt's South African tobacco holdings. Richemont also merged M-Net with two other television companies to form Network Holdings (NetHold) in exchange for a 50% stake in that firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Richemont bought Swiss luxury watchmaker Vacheron Constantin, and it sold most of NetHold to French pay-TV operator Canal+ in exchange for 15% of Canal+ (now owned by Vivendi Universal). (It sold that stake in 1999.) The company in 1997 bought French leather goods company Lancel and sold Karl Lagerfeld SA to the designer. Richemont increased its stake in Hanover Direct that year by purchasing the shares of its joint venture it didn't own. It also bought out Vendôme's minority shareholders in 1997, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Richemont exited tobacco in 1999 by merging its tobacco holdings with British American Tobacco (BAT), the world's #2 cigarette company, in exchange for a 35% stake in BAT (including the shares owned by Remgro, formerly Rembrandt). That year Richemont also purchased 60% of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, a manufacturer and retailer of watches and jewelry with over 40 stores. It wrapped up the year by taking a 20% stake in online jewelry retailer Adornis.com (which shut down in late 2000).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Richemont bought Swiss luxury watch dial manufacturer Stern Group and later, Mannesmann AG's Les Manufactures Horlogeres SA luxury watch unit. Beating a host of rivals (including LVMH), Richemont acquired the Jaeger-LeCoultre, IWC, and A. Lange &amp; Söhne luxury watch brands; the purchase positioned the company to control the market for watches costing more than $1,500.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chloé designer Stella McCartney left the company in 2001 to launch her own label with Gucci. Also in 2001 the company purchased an additional 20% of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, raising its stake in the company to 80%. Additionally that year Richemont wrote down to zero its investment in catalog marketer
   <company id="16846">
    Hanover Direct
   </company>
   's (Domestications, Silhouettes) common stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spun off its jointly held 30% stake in BAT in October 2008. The spinoff was timed to coincide with a potentially penalizing change in Luxembourg tax law that would have left Richemont vulnerable to the ebbs and flows in upscale purchasing.
  </p>
  <p>
   After five years at the helm, CEO Norbert Platt retired at the end of 2009. He cited health concerns as the reason for his retirement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2010 Richemont completed its acquisition of more than 93% of the shares in Net-A-Porter Limited.  NET-A-PORTER operates as an independent entity alongside Richemont's other luxury goods businesses.
