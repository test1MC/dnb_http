   AngioDynamics makes therapeutic and diagnostic medical devices for veins that have become a pain. Doctors use its array of devices in minimally invasive procedures to treat cancer; peripheral vascular disease (PVD), in which arteries or veins in the arms, legs, or kidneys become blocked or restricted by plaque; and other non-coronary diseases. Products include laser systems that ablate varicose veins, angiographic catheters that deliver drugs and contrast agents for imaging, dialysis catheters for those with renal failure, abscess drainage devices, and radiofrequency ablation devices that help destroy tumors. AngioDynamics markets and sells directly in the US and through distributors and directly internationally.

  <p>
   AngioDynamics operates through a single segment which works to develop, manufacture, and sell medical devices for vascular access, surgery, peripheral vascular disease, and cancer treatment. Its products fall into three categories: peripheral vascular (including fluid management and venous products, this category represents more than half of total revenues), vascular access (including image-guided equipment used to deliver drug therapies into the central venous system), and oncology/surgery (including microwave ablation products and the NanoKnife product line).

   Geographic Reach
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has manufacturing facilities in the US and the UK; it has research and development facilities in the US. Although the US is by far its largest market, global markets have grown to account for about 20% of AngioDynamic's sales. The company has recently opened an international headquarters in Amsterdam, as well as sales offices in Hong Kong and Canada.

  <p>
   AngioDynamics sells its medical products through a direct sales force in the US and internationally through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships.

  <p>
   The medical device company's sales increased by nearly 3% in fiscal 2012 (ends May) and then by 54% in fiscal 2013; that boost was largely due to the acquisition of Navilyst late in the fiscal year, as well as higher sales of microwave products. Since then, revenues have remained fairly steady. In fiscal 2015, revenue slipped less than 1%, despite growth around the firm's peripheral vascular products (primarily AngioVac and fluid management products). The vascular access lines benefited from growing sales of the BioFlo line of products, while NanoKnife product sales helped the oncology/surgery line overall. Unfavorable currency exchange rates significantly offset the company's sales increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting a $3.1 million profit in fiscal 2014, AngioDynamics had a net loss of $3 million in 2015 as expenses around acquisitions, restructuring, litigation, and other items increased.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 6% to $26 million in 2015, largely due to changes in accounts receivable.

  <p>
   Part of the company's growth strategy is to acquire businesses and technologies that are complementary to its own. Through its own research and development, as well as licensing and strategic alliances with other organizations, the company's goal is to continue introducing new and enhanced medical devices. Its R&amp;D teams work closely with its sales force to incorporate physician feedback into its design processes.

  <p>
   In 2014 AngioDynamics received FDA clearance for its Celerity Tip Location System to help in positioning Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters in adults. The following year, it gained clearance for the BioFlo Midline catheter for short-term intravenous therapies. Also in 2015 it re-entered the embolization market when it signed a licensing agreement with EmboMedics, a developer of injectable and resorbable microspheres.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013 the company announced a three-year restructuring program, including the consolidation of certain plants, designed to save between $15 million and $18 million.

   In 2013 AngioDynamics exercised its option to acquire substantially all of the assets of UK ablation technology firm

   .  to boost sales within its flagging ablation operations. The $16 million acquisition gave it full marketing and manufacturing rights to Microsulis' microwave ablation system.
