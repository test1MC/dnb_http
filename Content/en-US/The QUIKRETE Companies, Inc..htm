   QUIKRETE makes and markets products under four categories: core products, commercial grade products, specialty products, and repair products. The company's subsidiaries include SPEC MIX, Pavestone, Custom Building Products, Target Technologies, Daubois, and QPR.

   Residential products allow homeowners to design their own exterior landscapes by laying their own bricks and stepping stones, creating walls, fences, walkways, and trellises, or repairing chipped concrete surfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to home use, QUIKRETE's concrete products have been used in building and renovating a variety of large projects, including the National Museum of the American Indian and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Its structural repair products are used by government agencies, such as the

   QUIKRETE works to keep its product mix fresh by finding ways to incorporate recycled materials into its concrete. The 2016 launch of  QUIKRETE's Form and Pour product, for example, expanded its line of structural repair products. Its "green concrete" product, which contains recycled aggregates, fly ash, and slag cement, helped the company reach new markets along the West Coast.
  </p>
  <p>
   QUIKRETE has also been focused on its professional products. In 2013 QUIKRETE rolled out an enhanced line of professional concrete coatings, as well as extensions to its suite of Zip &amp; Mix and stucco items, to provide professionals and consumers with repeatable coating application and design.
