  <p>
   Amkor's packaging services account for the majority of annual revenues, while testing products and services account for the remainder of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue is split 50-50 from its advanced products, flip chip, wafer-level processing, and related test services and its mainstream products, wirebond packaging and related test services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amkor gets its critical production materials - leadframes, laminate substrate, and gold wire - from a limited number of suppliers. The company's primary packaging equipment are wirebonders and die bonders, but it also uses various others, such as mold, die attach, and wafer bumping. Much of its equipment can be retooled for use in a variety of packaging, though advanced equipment is harder to adapt than traditional equipment. Amkor's testing equipment is usually the more capital intensive, so the company focuses on standardized tester platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company owns J-Devices, a packaging and test company based in Japan with customers that include
   <company id="159600">
    Fujitsu Semiconductor
   </company>
   and
   <company id="161701">
    Renesas Electronics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Amkor maintains a geographically diversified business, with facilities in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US that cover sales, R&amp;D, engineering, and production. Its production facilities cover more than 8 million square feet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers in the US comprise about 32% of sales. The company's two largest sales regions outside the US are Singapore, accounting for 16% of revenues in 2014, and China, 9%. Asia-based customers account for at least 46% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Amkor's sales and marketing offices in Asia, Europe, and North America are responsible for product promotion efforts. The company also employs extensive support teams who provide direct guidance and promote additional packaging and testing services to existing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Amkor's top 10 customers bring in 63% of sales, with the top 25 representing nearly 85%.
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41888">

   each accounted for more than 10% in 2014. Other customers include:

    Micron Technology

   , and
   <company id="11462">

   . Fabless customers include

    Altera
   </company>
   and
   <company id="53815">
    Broadcom
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Amkor also has to compete with some of its clients, as they maintain some of their own packaging capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   Amkor's revenue fell 8% in 2015 to $2.8 billion from 2014. The company blamed a lack of compelling new smartphones releases in 2015 and soft economic conditions. Revenue was lower in advanced and mainstream services. Geographically, the company saw gains in China (up 11%), Ireland (up 3%), Malaysia (up 130%), and Singapore (up 4%). Sales to all other geographic markets dropped year-to-year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income tumbled 56% to $57 million in 2015 from $130 million in 2014. The impact of lower revenue was compounded by a loss from the acquisition of remaining shares of J-Devices and losses stemming from early repayment of debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $578 million in 2015, compared to $614 million in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   Amkor's strategy includes leveraging its advanced technologies, improving the use of existing assets, and selectively growing its scale and scope through strategic investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a company that helped pioneer the chip packaging industry, Amkor follows a strategy of being a leading technology innovator. It employs about 475 R&amp;D personnel to design and develop cutting-edge packaging formats and technologies to help the company stay among the leaders. R&amp;D spending has increased each year to reach $82 million in 2015 compared to $77 million in 2014, and $64 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other Amkor strategies include establishing long-standing customer relationships, as well as collaborative partnerships, with other semiconductor companies. The company also aims to diversify by offering a broad range of products and services and by establishing operations across multiple geographies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amkor operates in a naturally competitive, cyclical industry. Its business is established largely on high-volume manufacturing processes and in developing new, broad, and tailored packaging and test technologies. Its production is typically heavier in the second half of the year, in response to end-of-year consumer buying trends in the US and abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced new products in chips fabricated at 20 nanometer geometries, fingerprint sensors, and radio frequency (RF) system-in-package devices -- areas of growth in the electronics industry. Amkor also is developing 2.5D and 3D interconnect processes that stack multiple active chips in a single package, which would reduce costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developing products and processes for mobile electronics is an area Amkor has targeted and it is working to increase sales to Chinese and Taiwanese fabless chip companies. Its sales to China and Taiwan are 16% of revenue and growing.

  <p>
   Kim Joo-Jin (James Kim), the oldest of seven children, came to the US from South Korea in 1955 to study business. A year later his father started electronics firm Anam Industrial, and in 1968 James Kim (chairman and CEO) founded Amkor (short for "American-Korean") Electronics as its US marketing agent.
  </p>
  <p>
   To lessen its dependence on the volatile semiconductor market, Anam Industrial began diversifying in 1975, first into watch making, and eventually into banking, construction, environmental services, and electronics. (James Kim's wife, Agnes, began selling electronic watches and calculators from a kiosk near the family home in Pennsylvania; the business grew into the
   <company id="43399">
    Electronics Boutique
   </company>
   chain, now part of
   <company id="12716">
    GameStop
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   James Kim joined the board of California semiconductor maker VLSI Technology (now part of
   <company id="103883">
    NXP
   </company>
   , formerly Philips Semiconductors) in 1982, leading the company into the application-specific integrated circuit market. Anam Industrial, meanwhile, continued to grow along with the semiconductor industry. By 1990 it had 50% of the world's semiconductor package assembly business, and was only one unit of South Korean
   <em>
    chaebol
   </em>
   (family-run, non-legal conglomerate) Anam Group. That year the group took over a plant in Manila from
   <company id="10037">
    Advanced Micro Devices
   </company>
   and established Amkor/Anam Pilipinas on that site. It also acquired Scotland-based ITEQ Europe Ltd., Europe's leading semiconductor assembly contractor.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1990s Anam Industrial developed the tape-automated bonding manufacturing process. When the senior Kim retired in 1992, James Kim also became head of the Anam Group.
