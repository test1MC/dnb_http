   Precor has been concentrating on its commercial business -- consisting of clubs and institutions -- as it generates 88% of revenue. The consumer channel comprises the rest of its revenue. Also, Precor's looking to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as the Asia Pacific region.

  <p>
   To help set itself apart from the competition, the equipment manufacturer has been focused on catering to customers who want a more personal workout experience and one that keeps exercisers motivated. For instance, Precor's 880 line allows users to store their age, weight, and workout history to suggest the next workout. Also, in 2014 the company launched its Experience Series of commercial treadmills, complete with updated features and the latest technology. The company works to leverage the latest technology to provide reliability, ease-of-use, and solid construction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Precor's also seeing gains in the hotel market through an agreement with

   and it's making strides in home-gym equipment. Sales of Precor products in the consumer market rose in 2007, with new elliptical crosstrainers and treadmills selling more swiftly for people who work out at home.
