   This Pandora's box is filled with music. The Internet radio station generates playlists based on a user's favorite artist or song. As part of the company's Music Genome Project, songs are analyzed according to musical features -- including details of instrumentation, harmony, lyrics, melody, rhythm, and vocals. Users enter the name of a song, and Pandora creates a playlist of songs with similar characteristics. Pandora's service, free to its more than 175 million registered users and available only in the US, is supported by local and national advertising. Chief strategy officer Tim Westergren founded the company in 2000; Pandora went public in 2011.

  <p>
   Pandora raised about $235 million through its initial public offering. The Internet radio service took advantage of the momentum in the capital markets for digital media and online networking websites.

   Although Pandora offers a subscription service that allow customers to skip ads and skip through more songs per hour, the company used the bulk of the IPO proceeds to invest in improving the user experience of its free service. Like the traditional radio station model, Pandora gets the majority of its revenue from advertising and the number of loyal listeners it claims translates directly to the advertising rates it can charge. Even in a struggling economy, Pandora's ad revenue has been growing as companies look for ways to save money by targeting specific groups of users and the company expects mobile advertising to continue to grow.

   In addition to its traditional Internet service, Pandora's reach has broadened through applications for users of mobile devices including

   's Android operating software. Pandora uses display ads on its landing pages, and launched a program that lets advertisers sponsor free streaming of new albums before they are released -- with custom landing pages, banner ads, and an advertiser-branded radio station.

   The company is constantly updating its advertising platforms to keep pace with the dynamic online and mobile advertising market. So more and more car radios will be equipped to access Pandora, the company has also developed partnerships with automotive manufacturers such as

  <p>
   Pandora's revenue increased in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous fiscal period mainly due to an increase in advertising revenue. Advertising revenue increased primarily because of an increase in the total number of ads delivered as a result of an increase in total listener hours.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported revenue of $427.1 million in fiscal 2013, up 56% from the $274.3 million it reported for fiscal 2012. Despite the spike in revenue, Pandora's net loss increased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior period. It reported a net loss of $38 million for fiscal 2013 after claiming a net loss of $16 million for fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even more alarming than the increased net loss, Pandora's cash on hand decreased from positive $5 million to negative territory in fiscal 2014.

  <p>
   Pandora has not been immune to the same headaches that have affected all new music distribution technologies. The company has been involved in a protracted battle over how much Internet radio services pay in royalties and continues to negotiate with artists and record companies. Because of this licensing dispute and the even more complex foreign royalty system, Pandora is actively blocking users from outside the US or Canada.
