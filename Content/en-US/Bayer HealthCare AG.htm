   If you're sick, just grin and Bayer it. The health care products subsidiary of
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer AG
   </company>
   , Bayer HealthCare develops and manufactures products for humans and animals. Bayer HealthCare operates through three divisions:
   <company id="91276">
    Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="141240">
    Animal Health
   </company>
   (veterinary drugs), and Medical Care (diagnostic equipment makers including
   <company id="141341">
    Diabetes Care
   </company>
   and Bayer Radiology and Interventional). Bayer HealthCare's better-known products include YAZ birth control pills, multiple sclerosis drug Betaseron, and erectile dysfunction treatment Levitra, as well as Bayer Aspirin, Alka-Seltzer, One-A-Day vitamins, and the flea preventative Advantage.

  <p>
   Bayer HealthCare makes up the largest segment of the Bayer family of companies, accounting for about half of its parent's sales. Within Bayer HealthCare, the Pharmaceuticals division accounts for about two-thirds of revenues; the division specializes in developing and marketing prescription drugs in fields that include women's health, cardiology, hemophilia, neurology, cancer treatment, and diagnostics. Its biggest seller in both 2010 and 2011 was Betaseron (also marketed as Betaferon)  -- with annual sales of about €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) and €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion), respectively -- surpassing YAZ, which was the top seller in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep better tabs on its vast operations, Bayer HealthCare has been working to control costs through restructuring measures, and in late 2010 it launched an effort to streamline administrative functions in both the German and US-based divisions. As part of the program, the firm moved to strengthen the use of the Bayer brand within the Pharmaceuticals division by phasing out use of the Schering name (which originated from the 2006 purchase of German drugmaker Schering AG). As a result, the name of its primary pharma unit changed from Bayer Schering Pharma to Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bayer HealthCare is also consolidating some US facilities (including the East Coast centers of US-based
   <company id="57526">
    Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc.
   </company>
   and other US HealthCare units) to improve operational efficiencies, as well as to strengthen its R&amp;D infrastructure. Additional restructuring measures include the 2009 creation of the Medical Care Division to hold the
   <company id="115463">
    MEDRAD
   </company>
   and Diabetes Care operations. In 2012 Bayer HealthCare further combined MEDRAD (imaging equipment) with the contrast agent operations of the Pharmaceuticals division to form the new Bayer Radiology and Interventional unit (under the Medical Care Division).

  <p>
   The Bayer organization has been making medicines for over 100 years, and over time Bayer HealthCare has continued to build up its offerings through acquisitions, research and development, and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting the R&amp;D pipeline is key to the success of the Pharmaceuticals division, which (like other global drugmakers) must consistently come up with new products to prepare for patent losses on existing top sellers. Recent launches included several new birth control pills (Qlaria, Beyaz, and Safyral) in 2009 and 2010; it also introduced clot prevention drug Xarelto to the US market in 2011. Bayer HealthCare often develops new products alongside external development partners, such as
   <company id="51415">
    Onyx Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   (oncology) and
   <company id="13560">
    Genzyme
   </company>
   (multiple sclerosis); it formed a new partnership with
   <company id="105208">
    Micromet
   </company>
   in 2009 to develop protein-based cancer drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   R&amp;D efforts are also ongoing throughout the non-pharma Bayer HealthCare businesses. The Consumer Care division focuses on developing new technologies to support its current brands, as well as by introducing new products, often through licensing or collaboration agreements. The Medical Care division looks to expand into new market segments while strengthening its current product lines using cooperative partners, while the company generally performs its own research in the Animal Health segment.

  <p>
   Bayer strengthened its position in the consumer care market, and grabbed the global #2 spot, when in 2014 it purchased the consumer products division of Merck &amp; Co. The $14.2 billion deal brought well know names including Coppertone, Claritin, and Dr. Scholl's into the house of Bayer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Bayer acquired
   <company id="47807">
    Conceptus
   </company>
   through a public share tender offer worth some $1.1 billion. The purchase expands Bayer HealthCare's women's health offerings in both the US and select international markets through the addition of Conceptus' core product, Essure, a permanant, non-surgical birth control method. The deal also will allow for further growth in new markets.
