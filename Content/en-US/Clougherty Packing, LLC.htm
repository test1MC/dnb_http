   Amid the concession game fare of peanuts and Cracker Jack, there is Clougherty Packing. The company sponsors the
   <company id="46715">
    Los Angeles Dodgers
   </company>
   professional baseball team and makes the Dodger Dog, a hot dog favorite of fans. For the home, it processes and packages pork products, such as fresh-cut loin, lunch meat, breakfast sausage, bacon, and boneless and bone-in cooked ham. The company sells its meat under the FARMER JOHN brand name to retailers, including
   <company id="17060">
    Costco

   ,
   <company id="11308">
    Safeway

   ,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

    Food 4 Less
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40447">
    Stater Bros.
   </company>
   Its online media efforts feature recipes, and cooking and serving tips for Clougherty products. Founded by the Clougherty family in 1931, the company had operated as a subsidiary of
   <company id="11977">
    Hormel Foods
   </company>
   from 2004 to 2017, when pork producer
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   acquired the company for $145 million.

  <p>
   Clougherty's operations contribute to Hormel's largest business -- refrigerated foods. The segment accounted for 49% of the parent company's 2013 revenues.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While parent Hormel does not break out separate financials for Clougherty, the Refrigerated Foods segment's sales rose less than 1% in fiscal 2013 from 2011. The rising sales are attributed to its pork business, specifically operating improvements and retail bacon pricing actions.

  <p>
   Within Hormel's Refrigerated Foods segment, global retailing behemoth
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   contributed about 14% of 2013 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Partnering with sports teams has given Clougherty an extended reach. It serves the Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim Ducks, and the Los Angeles Galaxy. Its products are a staple at the
   <company id="14790">
    Staples
   </company>
   Center, a downtown Los Angeles venue.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Aligning with Hormel's valued-added growth strategy, Clougherty has focused on expanding the application of its Farmer John brand products to snacks and gatherings around the grill or tailgate. The hot dog is its mainstay offering. The suggested use of its meat in pork skewers, seasoned carnitas, and bacon-wrapped sausage underscores how far Clougherty has come since it first opened its doors to Californians.
