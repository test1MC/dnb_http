   Stora Enso's roots reach back more than 700 years. The forest products company is among the largest producers of newsprint and sawn softwood timber in Europe. It plays a major role in meeting the needs of publishers, advertisers, office suppliers, and packagers of consumer and industrial goods for a range of paper products, from magazine paper to newsprint and book paper, fine papers, and packaging board. Stora Enso's wood-based lines serve the construction and biofuel industries. The consumer board and fine paper lines are Stora Enso's main interests, followed by magazine paper. The company has a presence in more than 35 countries.

  <p>
   The company has operations in more than 35 countries worldwide. The biomaterials division has a global presence with operations in Brazil, Finland, Laos, Sweden, the US, and Uruguay. The building and living division operates globally and has more than 20 production units in Europe. Printing and reading mills are located predominantly in Europe, as well as in Brazil and China.

  <p>
   Stora Enso operates through four divisions: renewable packaging (26% of net sales), biomaterials (9%), building and living (14%), and printing and reading (31%).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, however, Stora Enso announced changes to its divisional structure and reportable segments. The renewable packaging division will be split into two separate divisions and reporting segments: consumer board and packaging solutions. In addition, the name of the building and living division will be changed to wood products, and the name of printing and reading division to paper.

  <p>
   Stora Enso's revenue dipped from 2013 to 2014 due to structural declines in paper demand resulting from lower paper prices in local currencies and lower paper delivery volumes. Printing and reading sales were down by 9% due to permanent shutdowns of paper machines, weaker demand, and lower average prices in local currencies. In addition, building and living sales declined by 5% in 2014 mainly due to increased production curtailments resulting from lower delivery volumes.

  <p>
   Stora Enso's corporate ancestors were mining Kopparberg Mountain in Sweden as long ago as 1288. The mountain housed a copper mine that Swedish nobles and German merchants managed as a cooperative. By the 17th century King Karl IX instituted German mining methods to increase production. Copper became Sweden's largest export, at one point accounting for 60% of the country's gross national product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Copper production slowed after two cave-ins in 1655 and 1687, and exploitation of the region's timber and iron ore resources began. By the early 1800s the company was producing pig and bar iron. In 1862 all of the company's activities were combined to form Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag. The role of copper became less important as the company consolidated its iron works and ventured into forest products. The firm reorganized as a limited liability company in 1888.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1915 Stora Kopparbergs had firmly established pulp and paper mills, as well as iron and steel works concentrated along the Dalalven River Basin. The company's activities revolved around these facilities for the next 60 years.
