  <p>
   Since its acquisition by
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   in 1981, the company has gained momentum by moving into developing markets. In addition, overhaul and field repair services provide it with recurring revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's supplier strategy is to optimize the number of suppliers by basing selection on core competencies, value added skills, and a dedication to continuous improvement. Solar Turbines' Supplier Quality Management System provides suppliers with monthly status of their delivery and quality performance. The company hosts supplier symposiums and training events to strengthen relationships and has special practices in place to manage and protect its small, disadvantaged suppliers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company renewed a 10-year agreement with turbine equipment service company
   <company id="112660">
    Chromalloy
   </company>
   for that company to provide component repairs and new production support for Solar Turbines' leading power systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its network, in 2013 Solar Turbines signed an agreement with REP Holding to build a production site in St. Petersburg, Russia, to produce 22 MW gas turbine units.

  <p>
   In 2010 Solar Turbines established a repair and assembly plant in the Czech Republic to focus on repairing industrial gas turbines and gas and diesel engines as part of a project to repair industrial turbines across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was acquired by International Harvester in 1960 and exited the aerospace industry in 1973 to focus on gas turbines, making it an attractive acquisition for Caterpillar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 1927 as the Prudden-San Diego Airplane Company, Solar Turbines transitioned to the Solar Aircraft Company in 1929 and began making metal components for other manufacturers.
