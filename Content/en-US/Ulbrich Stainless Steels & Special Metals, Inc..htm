  <p>
   In 2012 Ulbrich relocated its North Haven, Connecticut corporate headquarters (which suffered heavy damage from Hurricane Irene) to a new and more modern facility offering improved amenities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its Asian portfolio, in 2011 the company opened a new Precision Coil Center in Malaysia specializing in light gauge stainless steel and special metals strip. It offers more than 170 types of strips, many not readily available in Asia. Alloys used range from Austenitic, Ferritic, Martensitic to Precipitation Hardening Grade Stainless Steels.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also opened Ulbrich Precision Metals Asia in Hong Kong, a flat wire manufacturing facility providing solarcell tabbing and string interconnect for the solar industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Asia is not the only growth area for the company. Growing its North American capacity, in 2011 Ulrich opened a 65,000 sq. ft. facility in Canada to allow it to add aluminum sheets to its stainless steel products and other customer offerings.

   The Ulbrich company was established in 1924 as a cutlery manufacturer by Fred Ulbrich, Sr.
