   Handy &amp; Harman (HNH) is certainly handy when it comes to producing precious metals, tubing, and engineered materials in the US and Canada. The company makes 40% of its sales from its Building Materials segment, which makes fasteners and systems for building roofs. Other units make and supply brazing alloys, steel tubing, and meat-room products, used in construction, electronics, telecommunications, medical, and aviation, transportation, appliance, semiconductor, signage, and food industries. HNH operates through 30 locations in North America, China, and Europe.

   HNH's companies are organized into four businesses: Joining Materials (28% of sales), Tubing (12%), Building Materials (41%), Kasco Blades and Route Repair Services (10%), and Performance Materials (9%). In 2015 it sold its former Arlon Electronic Material segment, which produced components for the printed circuit board industry, as well as rubber-based insulation materials used by industrial, military, and aerospace customers.

  <p>
   HNH's revenues climbed 6% from $600 million in 2014 to $649 million in 2015, and its profits skyrocketed by more than 300% from $25 million to $106 million during that same time period. The surge in profits was attributed to a major gain on the disposal of its former Arlon segment. In addition, its operating cash flow spiked by 15% from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2015 was driven by its Performance Materials segment driven by additional sales from a previous acquisition. In addition, sales of both roofing and FastenMaster products under its Building Materials segment were higher due to growth from its company branded and roof edge roofing products and stronger demand from home centers and lumberyards for its FastenMaster products.
