   AZZ's products act as a shield for steel. The company has two business segments: galvanizing services and energy. To protect steel from environmental corrosion, galvanizing services dip steel products into baths of molten zinc. The process is vital for steel fabricators who serve highway construction, electrical utility, transportation, and water-treatment firms. Through subsidiaries, AZZ makes electrical power distribution systems, industrial lighting, switchgear, motor control centers, bus duct systems, and tubular goods. Industrial, petrochemical, and power generation and transmission companies use the company's products.

  <p>
   AZZ's energy segment (around 55% of total sales) is a manufacturer of specialty equipment focusing on the safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers. Products include custom switchgear, electrical enclosures, medium and high voltage bus ducts, explosion proof and hazardous duty lighting, and tubular products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also a third party supplier of safety related equipment for the nuclear industry. The galvanizing services segment (45%) provides hot dip galvanizing to the steel fabrication industry through facilities located throughout Canada and the US.

  <p>
   AZZ operates 45 galvanizing plants across the US and Canada. The company earned over 80% of its revenue from the US.

  <p>
   The company sells energy products through manufacturers' representatives, distributors, agents, and its own sales force. Its galvanizing products serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide services to the electrical and telecommunications, bridge and highway, petrochemical and general industrial markets, along with numerous original equipment manufacturers.

  <p>
   AZZ has achieved dramatic growth over the last few years. Revenues surged 11% from $817 million in 2015 to peak at $903 million in 2016, a historic milestone for the company. In 2016 its profits jumped 18% to $77 million, due to the increased revenue. Cash flow from operations followed suit in 2016, jumping from $118 million to $144 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth in 2016 was driven by a 9% spike in energy sales and a 12% bump in galvanizing services. Both segments generated additional revenue from strategic acquisitions made during 2015 and 2016. The growth was also attributed to greater penetration and project scope expansion in specialty welding services for petroleum refining, both domestically and internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the introduction of new technology continued to deliver positive results and drive growth within the energy segment. For the galvanizing segment, the solar and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) markets added to a spike in sales and steel processed volumes during the year.

  <p>
   AZZ has achieved explosive revenue growth over the years mainly through the use of acquisitions. In 2016 it picked up Maryland-based Power Electronics, a manufacturer and integrator of electrical enclosure systems, serving the utility and industrial markets. The acquisition expanded AZZ's electrical power enclosure portfolio, manufacturing capacity, and geographical reach along the East Coast of North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in mid-2015 acquired US Galvanizing, a Texas-based provider of galvanizing services, welding services, specialty electrical equipment, and highly engineered services. The deal fortified the company's network of galvanizing plants and expanded its penetration in the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
