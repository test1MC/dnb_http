        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Geographically, Freedom Group caters primarily to the US firearm and ammunition market (92% of sales). Revenues from outside of the US are generated largely from customers in Canada, with the remainder from 80-plus countries around the world. FGI has a firearm accessory manufacturing plant in Lawrenceville, Georgia and a firearm component making facility in Lexington, Missouri. The company operates three facilities that make ammunition and ammunition components in Arkansas, South Dakota, and Utah.

        <p>
   FGI divides its business among three segments: firearms, ammunition, and all other (accessories, other gun-related products, licensed products, and apparel). Activities comprise the design, manufacture, assembly, import, and marketing of products within its three segments. The group runs five dedicated firearms manufacturing facilities, three facilities that manufacture ammunition and ammunition components, and one facility for accessory manufacture. FGI's research and development property in Kentucky is believed to be the industry's sole domestic freestanding and dedicated facility.

   . FGI' lineup is distributed by Sport South and AcuSport. The company estimates that the military, law enforcement, and international markets generate about 14% of sales. Customers include the California Highway Patrol, the DOD, and foreign governments, such as Mexico, Columbia, Italy, Poland, and Oman.

        <p>
   FGI's net sales increased 20% and net income rose 228% in 2012 compared with 2011. Net cash inflow increased by $60 million in 2012 versus the prior year. The double-digit gain was primarily due to a 29% increase in sales in the firearms segment.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Cerberus, which first invested in FGI in 2006, filed to take the gun maker public in 2009, but scrapped its plans in 2011. Grooming FGI for its public debut, Cerberus had rolled a handful of US gun and ammunition makers into the group over a three-year period. FGI appeared on pace to generate almost $1 billion in sales. The group's expectations failed to materialize as the economic downturn slowed consumer spending. Now with FGI's Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle implicated in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, Cerberus is looking to distance itself from FGI.
  </p>
        <p>
   FGI's strategy aims to strengthen and broaden its commercial market position across its core product lines. To that end, it has invested in its sales force, building it by more than 60% over the past five years. The group also focuses on research and development of its global military products in anticipation of formal contract bids solicited by the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   (DOD), and the interests specific to international governments.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   FGI continues, as well, to grow through acquisitions and investments. The group in 2012 took over
   <company id="114761">
    Para USA
   </company>
   (a maker and marketer of mid-priced semi-automatic handguns). In 2010, FGI created a venture with Mountain Khakis, a designer and marketer of outdoor sport apparel.
