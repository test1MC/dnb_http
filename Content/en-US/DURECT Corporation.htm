   DURECT wants your medicine to go DURECTly where it's needed. The company is developing drug delivery systems to provide long-term therapy for such conditions as chronic pain, heart disease, cancer, and neurological disorders. Drug delivery technologies provided by DURECT include TRANSDUR and ELADUR, transdermal patches; ORADUR, a sustained release oral gel-cap; SABER and MICRODUR, injectable delivery systems; Remoxy, an extended release capsule of oxycodone; and the DURIN biodegradable implant. DURECT conducts R&amp;D efforts independently and collaboratively. The firm also sells biodegradable polymers (LACTEL) and osmotic pumps (ALZET) to pharmaceutical and medical research firms.

   After a banner 2012 that saw a huge revenue increase due to collaboration payouts, DURECT reported a 71% drop in revenue in 2013. The company did report higher product revenue as sales picked up across the product lines. R&amp;D costs continue to outstrip revenue and the company has reported several years of operating losses, excluding 2012. As of the end of 2013, DURECT had a total accumulated deficit of $360.8 million. Cash flow also dropped in 2013 due to increases in accounts payable and prepaid expenses.

  <p>
   To deliver on its strategy of developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems that address significant medical needs and improve quality of life for patients, the company has set several key initiatives. These include focusing on chronic debilitating medical conditions and certain local pain conditions; minimizing risks in product development; enabling the development of pharmaceutical systems based on biotechnology and other new compounds; diversifying risk by pursuing multiple programs in development; enabling product development through strategic collaborations; and building its own commercial organization.
