   Yes, it is curdled milk with bacteria and some fruit, but yogurt by Dannon has risen from health-food obscurity to become a supermarket staple. The Dannon Company vies with
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   , maker of dairy label Yoplait, and relative-newcomer Chobani for the #1 spot as the best-selling yogurt brand in the US. Dannon supplies a staggering 200 flavors, styles, and sizes of yogurts, in regular, low-fat, and nonfat varieties, as well as in liquid, "drinkable" and smoothie forms. Dannon also makes Danimals yogurt in kid-friendly packaging; and for moms (and Mr. Moms), it launches a slew of flavorful, nutritious lines, such as Activia, a pro-biotic-infused low-fat yogurt for digestion. Dannon is owned by

   White Plains, New York-based Dannon has production plants in Minster, Ohio; Fort Worth, Texas; West Jordan, Utah; and Portland, Oregon. The Ohio plant is the largest yogurt factory in the world, producing 3 million cups of yogurt a day. The company distributes its yogurt throughout the US and Puerto Rico.

   Yogurt is a hot item in refrigerated dairy cases, especially now that Greek-style yogurt has taken the category by storm. To maintain a leading position and compete with Chobani and Yoplait, Dannon in late 2011 opened the doors to a new research and development facility, the Dannon Discovery &amp; Innovation Center, built within its headquarters. The $9 million facility is anticipated to accelerate the time between product development and market debut, raising consumer enthusiasm for its innovations. Recent introductions include a French style yogurt in 2011 and a Greek-style yogurt (Oikos) in 2010. Concurrently, Danone has kept pace with growing yogurt consumption in the US by increasing production at three of its five plants. Also, in 2012 Dannon opened a retail store at New York's Grand Central Station to explore new ways for Americans to eat yogurt the way they want to - made to order for each customer.

   On a richer note, the yogurt maker in June 2014 launched Dannon Creamery, a line of pudding- and cheesecake-inspired diary desserts, a new category for the company. Its first new brand launch since Oikos in 2010, Creamery dairy desserts extend the consumption of Dannon products to the evening hours.

   Dannon is also facing increasing competition from European yogurt makers, such as Ehrmann and
   <company id="162815">
    FAGE
   </company>
   , which view the relatively-low consumption of yogurt in the US compared with Europe as a huge growth opportunity. Indeed, per capita yogurt consumption in America, while growing, is still half of that in Europe.
