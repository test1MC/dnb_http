   For applications in which plain silicon would get the ax, AXT offers fancier fare. AXT makes semiconductor substrates from compounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), and from single elements such as germanium. Manufacturers use AXT's substrates to make high-performance semiconductors for products -- including fiber-optic devices, satellite solar cells, and wireless handsets -- for which standard silicon microchips are not adequate. Most of its customers -- and its employees -- are in China. International customers include

   of France and

   </company>
   of the UK.

  <p>
   AXT manufactures its semiconductor substrates from 10 manufacturing plants in China. The vertically integrated company also uses five joint ventures to supply its raw materials and give it price and volume stability.

  <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force in China and the US, and independent sales representatives in Europe and other parts of Asia. About 60% of sales come from Asia; Europe accounts for a quarter of sales and the US, 15%.

  <p>
   The company has a limited number of customers, with the top five representing about 30% of sales. Chinese customers include Guangxi Debang Technology, Nan Da Guang Dang, and TianJin Sanan Optoelectronic.

  <p>
   AXT's revenues have been up and down over the years as its business is dependent on semiconductor designers and manufacturers, who are then dependent on market demand for electronics. Overall sales fell 3% to $85 million in 2013 after the company experienced some fluctuation in demand for semi-insulating GaAs substrates used in wireless products and the semi-conducting GaAs substrate used in the LED market. In addition, the company recorded a net loss of -$7.9 million due to higher operating expenses and cost of sales.

   The company touts its proprietary vertical gradient freeze manufacturing technology, which is said to promote fewer defects and greater uniformity in growing crystals, compared with the traditional Czochralski technique used in manufacturing crystalline materials such as silicon.
