   Concept Packaging Group packages a lot more than original ideas. It manufactures corrugated paperboard, corrugated plastic, wood packaging, and other packaging materials. The company's thermoformed trays can be made to precisely fit customers' products while its corrugated products provide disposable and reusable packaging options. For products that fall outside the box, Concept Packaging's wood packaging and metal racks accommodate bulkier items, ranging from heavy equipment to motors. The company also provides contract packaging, logistics services, and inventory management.

  <p>
   Concept Packaging began operations as Southland Container Corp. in 1983 with 12 employees and a 20,000 sq. ft. plant in Inman, South Carolina. The company moved to establish a competitive position by acquiring several packaging companies and subsequently changed its name to reflect its broader service capabilities in 1993.
