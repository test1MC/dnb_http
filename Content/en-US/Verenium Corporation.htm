   Verenium has a lot of bacteria and fungus, but it's really a good thing. The company uses microbial DNA to manufacture enzymes to supply businesses involved in animal health and nutrition, grain processing, and oilfield services. It markets commercial brands of enzyme products, either independently or with partners. It focuses on developing specialty enzyme products to convert biomass into fuel, making industrial processing more efficient, and developing feedstocks for animals and therapeutic proteins for humans. The company's key development partners include

        <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 18% in 2011 primarily due to increased market share of its Fuelzyme® alpha-amylase enzyme in the fuel ethanol market, as well as a growth in sales of Purifine® PLC enzyme for soybean oil processing. Verenium also reported a 19% increase in grain processing, as result of sn increase in Purifine® PLC sales and 4% boost in animal health and nutrition product sales. Its Phyzyme® XP product (an enzyme designed to improve the availability of phosphorus from plant sources) accounted for 54% of the company's product revenues in 2011.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income increased by 196% in 2011 thanks to higher revenues, a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Expenses went down due to the reimbursement of legal fees of $1.1 million received in 2011 for expenses incurred during 2010, a reduction of facilities-related costs as a result of
   <company id="58872">
    BP
   </company>
   assuming the company's San Diego building leases, and an increase in 2010 expensed as the company paid and expensed bonus payments of $1.4 million. Additionally, the decrease is attributed to Verenium's initiatives to cut overall general and administrative expenses; and a decrease in interest expense from 2010 was primarily attributed to the drop  in the outstanding convertible notes principal from repurchases.
  </p>
        <p>
   Except for a revenue slump in 2009 the company has seen an upward trend in revenues from 2007 to 2011. The slump in 2009 was primarily attributable to the presence of royalty component on operating profit for Phyzyme sales.
