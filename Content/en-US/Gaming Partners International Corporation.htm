  <p>
   Paul Endy Sr. distributed cards to legal gaming establishments in California in the 1940s and 1950s. His son, Paul Jr., struck out on his own in 1963 when he bought a bankrupt dice factory in Las Vegas. Over time the company's offerings expanded, and Paul-Son (the name originally differentiated Paul Jr.'s business from his father's) became the big fish in its small market. The business received a big boost when New Jersey legalized gambling (other states soon followed suit), and when Native Americans entered the business to boost tribal income and employment. Paul-Son was able to solidify its hold on the market. Paul Jr.'s son Eric, an audiologist by training, joined the company in 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul-Son went public in 1994, but took a beating the next year when gambling operations that bought equipment from the company on credit folded. With DeBartolo Entertainment the company formed Brand One Marketing in 1997 to market Paul-Son collectible and commemorative chips and playing cards. It bought out DeBartolo's share in 1998. Founder Paul Endy Jr. died the following year, and his son Eric took over the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Paul-Son won major accounts to provide playing cards to Harrah's Louisiana casino and gambling chips to Trump Casinos-Atlantic City. The following year the company filed a letter of intent to acquire US competitor Bud Jones Co. and its French parent Bourgogne et Grasset (B&amp;G), manufacturers and suppliers of gaming equipment. When the deadline passed, Paul-Son demanded a $1 million termination fee. Arbitration had begun before both companies agreed to reenter talks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Paul-Son and B&amp;G reached a definitive agreement to combine the companies whereby B&amp;G and Bud Jones became wholly owned subsidiaries of Paul-Son. As a result of the combination, Endy stepped down as chairman and CEO and became EVP. B&amp;G director Francois Carretté became chairman, and Gerard Charlier assumed the roles of president and CEO. The following year Paul-Son merged Bud Jones with Paul-Son Gaming Supplies, consolidating the two gaming supply manufacturing units into a single facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Paul-Son changed its name to Gaming Partners International Corporation to reflect the significant changes the company had undergone since merging with B&amp;G. Gregory Gronau was promoted to CEO after Charlier retired in 2009.
