   How sweet it is: Snapple Beverage produces more than 40 varieties of sweetened and diet ready-to-drink teas, juice drinks, and waters. Marketed as "the Best Stuff on Earth," the Snapple brand lineup is flavored with familiar fruits (apple and lemon), as well as the exotic (pomegranate and papaya). Drinks are sold directly to food/beverage retailers, mass merchandisers, and foodservice venues, such as school cafeterias in the US and some 80 other countries. Snapple was formerly part of the UK's

   An innovative marketer, Snapple in 2012 partnered with the television program
   <em>
    America's Got Talent.
   </em>
   The promotion featured an under-the-bottle-cap code, which customers could register online for a chance to win prizes and tickets to
   <em>
    America's Got Talent.
   </em>
   The company says the program contributed to an 11% volume increase for all flavors of Snapple 16-oz., single-serve bottles during the promotion. In 2013, the Snapple 'Win Nothing Instantly' promotion gave consumers opportunities to win prizes such as 'no bills' and 'no airfare' while introducing new consumers to Snapple products.

   Snapple Beverage Corp. is part of its parent company's Packaged Beverages segment. The segment, which also includes Hawaiian Punch and
   <company id="111655">
    Mott's

   , accounted for 72% of
   <company id="103458">

   's 2013 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   While there are no separate financials for Snapple Beverage Corp., Dr Pepper Snapple Group reports that its net sales for the Packaged Beverages segment dropped some 52% in fiscal 2013 due to sales volume declines. An unfavorable comparison of trade adjustments was offset in part by a favorable mix and net pricing rises led by Mott's.

   Concern over soda and other sweetened beverages sold in school cafeterias and school vending machines is driving drink-makers like Snapple to further develop their bottled offerings. Most state laws that ban soda in schools have not included Snapple, Gatorade (made by PepsiCo), and various energy/sport drinks. Moreover, removing soda in 2011 has spurred student consumption of Snapple and other sweetened drinks, perceived as a healthy alternative. New brand extensions and product launches include Snapple value teas based on non-traditional fruit blends.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snapple also looks to pursue new growth categories by securing agreements with makers of other brands that would benefit from its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. To respond to sugar concerns, in 2012 Snapple launched new Lightly Sweetened Teas, all natural white teas with less sugar than its other beverages. To grow sales, Snapple is also providing more package sizes, such as SnapTea gallons under the Snapple brand.

   Part of the culture of Snapple is promoted to consumers through its Real Facts, snippets of information which first appeared on the underside of Snapple bottle caps during the 1990s. The company retired the practice briefly, but has since reintroduced Real Facts, along with contests, its own Real Facts website,

   profiles, and yes, facts on the underside of the caps. (Example of a Snapple Real Fact: Flamingos can only eat with their heads upside down.)

   Snapple was founded in 1972 by three childhood friends, Snapple got its start in Greenwich Village, New York. The company was known as Unadulterated Food Corp. and changed its name to Snapple Beverage Corp. in 1993.

   Snapple negotiated an innovative, five-year, multi-million-dollar marketing deal to sell its beverages in the City of New York in 2004. The contract held for city-agency buildings and about 1,200 schools. Snapple paid $106 million for the rights and an additional $60 million to market New York as a tourist destination. At the time, critics said that they were not happy with the juice drinks that Snapple would supply New York. They pointed out that the drinks have more calories and more sugar than traditional caffeine-free sodas. But despite criticism, in 2006 New York City renegotiated the Snapple contract and Snapple remained the "Official Drink of NYC."

   Nelson Peltz's Triarc Companies (later
   <company id="11863">
    Wendy's/Arby's Group
   </company>
   ) bought underachieving Snapple from
   <company id="11237">
    Quaker Oats
   </company>
   in 1997 for $300 million and turned the firm around by repairing distributor relationships and appealing to young drinkers. In 2000 Triarc sold Snapple to Cadbury Schweppes, for $1.45 billion.
