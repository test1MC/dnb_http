   Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals knows you have to jump through more than one hoop to have a medication approved for use in the US. The company is developing a powerful antibiotic to treat life-threatening bacterial infections that are resistant to all other antibiotics currently on the market. Its drug candidate, eravacycline, is a synthetic tetracycline derivative that can be taken orally or intravenously to combat multi-drug resistant bacterial infections, which are considered growing threats to public health. Eravacycline is gearing up for Phase III trials. To fund it, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals became a publicly traded comany in early 2013.

   The company hoped to raise $86 million from its IPO, but managed to walk away with almost $75 million from investors. It plans to use the proceeds to fund Phase III trials for eravacycline, specifically to test its efficacy in treating complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Any remainder will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

   In February 2012 the company teamed up with CUBRC, a not-for-profit research organization, to develop the antibiotic using chemistry technology licensed from Harvard University. CUBRC was awarded a five-year, $67 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and chose Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals as its partner to carry out the clinical studies, including chemistry and manufacturing. As a subcontractor, Tetraphase may receive about $53 million for its role in developing eravacycline. If the drug is approved, the company will need additional funding for commercialization and marketing activities.
