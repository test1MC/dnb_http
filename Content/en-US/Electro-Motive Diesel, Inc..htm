   EMD is looking to benefit from its parent's name and reputation, allowing it to compete better against bigger companies like

   's transportation business, its main rival in North American locomotive manufacturing. In hopes of taking some market share from GE, EMD is pushing installation of upgrade packages on older locomotives. Replacing the original diesel engine, the package features a microprocessor-controlled locomotive engine technology that is designed to reduce emissions and maintenance costs, improve fuel efficiency and reliability, and extend the service life of the unit. In recent times EMD has introduced the upgrade on

   In 2013 the company delivered three SD70ACe demonstrator locomotives to the

   EMD is also looking to expand globally. In 2013 EMD partnered with Indian Railways to design and manufacture the WDG5 locomotive, which provides the highest horsepower in India. (EMD has worked with Indian Railways for more than 50 years).

   In 2012 the company opened a locomotive manufacturing facility in Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the first EMD locomotive assembly plant to open in Brazil in more than two decades.

   EMD was acquired by Caterpillar from Greenbriar Equity and Berkshire Partners for about $820 million in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1922 as Electro-Motive Engineering. EMD's acquisition by Caterpillar was part of the larger company's plan to grow its presence in the rail industry by providing rail and transit customers with a greater slew of locomotives, engines, and replacement parts, as well as support services.
