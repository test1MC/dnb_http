   If you've got a taste for the sweet and a nose for a scent, then International Flavors &amp; Fragrances (IFF) is your kind of company. One of the world's leading creators and manufacturers of artificial and natural aromas and flavors, IFF produces fragrances used in the manufacture of perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and other personal care and household products. The company is among the top four companies in its industry. IFF sells its flavors principally to makers of prepared foods, dairy foods, beverages, confections, and pharmaceuticals. The company sells its fragrances and flavors in solid and liquid forms in amounts that range from a few pounds to several tons.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has manufacturing, sales, and distribution facilities in 35 countries, with sales outside North America accounting for 76% of revenues in 2014. IFF operates 33 fragrance and flavor laboratories, called Creative Centers, worldwide. Primary locations are in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America accounted for 24% of IFF's revenues in 2015; Europe, Mildde East,and Africa (EMEA), 31%; Asia, 28%; and Latin America, 17%. The company has 34 manufacturing sites. Its major plants are in the US, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, China, India, and Singapore.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   IFF is organized into two operating segments: Fragrances and Flavors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fragrances is comprised of Fragrance Compounds, which are used by customers in functional fragrances, including fragrance compounds for personal care (e.g., soaps) and household products (e.g., detergents and cleaning agents) and fine fragrance and beauty care, including perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and Fragrance Ingredients, consisting of synthetic and natural ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as in savory foods, beverages, dairy, and sweet products.
  </p>
  <p>
   IFF makes more than 38,000 products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the Fragrances business represented 52% of sales; the Flavors business, 48%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   IFF's major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry (perfume and toiletries manufacturers) and the household products industry (manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners). Flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as in savory foods, beverages, dairy, and sweet products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company's 25 largest customers accounted for 52% of total sales. Sales to its largest customer accounted for 12%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 IFF's net revenues decreased by 2%  due to volume erosion on existing businesses principally driven by its customers' product line rationalization and inventory management efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income increased by 1% as the result of lower research and development expenses, principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense in 2015 and a decrease in selling and administrative expenses, related to acquisition-related costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 IFF's operating cash inflows decreased by 16% due to a change in working capital as a result of increase in trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable.
  </p>

  <p>
   IFF continues to introduce new products and to invest heavily in product development, targeting growth markets in emerging economies. R&amp;D spending at IFF amounts to about 8% of annual sales, but pays off handsomely. Emerging markets will represent more than half of its annual sales in 2015, and that growth potential in these markets will outpace the expected growth in the developed markets. The supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies, while within their more mature markets tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company continued to invest in its facilities. It expanded its flavors facility in Isando, South Africa, to cater to the company's expanded customer base in the rapidly growing Sub-Saharan Africa region. The company also opened new facilities in Indonesia, and Chile. It opened a new flavors plant near Chicago, and a new creative center and expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Gebze, Turkey.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its new Vision 2020 strategy, the company is looking to add between $500 million and $1 billion of sales growth through acquisitions within the flavors and fragrances industries and related business areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of growth strategy, the company increased its presence in emerging markets by expanding its manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and expects to continue to focus on expanding its business in these markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a cost savings move, in 2014 IFF closed its Fragrances Ingredients manufacturing plant in Augusta, Georgia and consolidated its production into other IFF Ingredients facilities.

  <p>
   Growing its position in the specialty fine fragrances space, in 2017 IFF acquired Fragrance Resources, a privately-held, family-owned fragrance company.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its North American flavors business, in 2016 IFF acquired
   <company id="116835">
    David Michael
   </company>
   . David Michael added to IFF its expertise in vanilla flavoring and serving companies in the daily and beverage industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its portfolio, in 2015 IFF acquired Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, a business of Unipex Group. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, headquartered in Quebec City, Canada, with operations in France and Australia, develops, manufactures and markets innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year IFF bought
   <company id="124357">
    Henry H. Ottens Manufacturing Co., Inc.
   </company>
   Well-known for its diverse flavors technologies and outstanding customer service, Otten's customer base includes a strong portfolio of key US-based accounts, which complements IFF's portfolio well.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 IFF acquired Aromor Flavors and Fragrances Ltd., a privately held manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients that are used in fragrances and flavors. The Aromor operations (which would have represented $35 million of incremental sales to IFF's results in 2013) became part of the IFF Fragrances Ingredients segment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   International Flavors &amp; Fragrances (IFF) began in 1929 when Dutch immigrant and perfumer A. L. van Ameringen (who originally came to the US to work for an agent of the Dutch firm Polak &amp; Schwarz, later leaving to form his own business) and William Haebler formed a fragrance company, van Ameringen-Haebler, in New York City.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company produced the fragrance for Youth Dew,
   <company id="40148">
    Estée Lauder
   </company>
   's first big cosmetics hit, in 1953. One biographer of Estée Lauder linked her romantically with van Ameringen after her 1939 divorce (she later remarried Joseph Lauder). The business association with van Ameringen's company endured, and by the late 1980s it had produced an estimated 90% of Estée Lauder's fragrances.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1958 the company changed its name to International Flavors &amp; Fragrances after it bought Polak &amp; Schwarz. The US market for fragrances grew as consumers bought items such as air fresheners, and manufacturers began adding fragrances to household cleaning items.
  </p>
  <p>
   Henry Walter, who became CEO when van Ameringen retired in 1963, expanded IFF's presence overseas. Walter boasted, "Most of the great soap fragrances have been ours." So have many famous French perfumes, but most perfume companies wanted to cultivate product mystique, preventing IFF from taking credit for its scents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of IFF's products were made for manufacturers of consumer goods. But under Walter's direction in the 1970s, IFF's R&amp;D team experimented to find scents for museum exhibits and participated in Masters &amp; Johnson research on the connection between sex and smell. Said Walter, "Our business is sex and hunger."
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1980s IFF conducted fragrance research for relieving stress, lowering blood pressure, and alleviating depression. In 1982 IFF researchers developed a way to bind odors to plastic, a process used by makers of garbage bags and toys.
  </p>
  <p>
   Walter retired in 1985 and Eugene Grisanti became CEO. After a three-year slump in new creations, IFF developed fragrances for several prestigious perfumes (Eternity and Halston) in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   IFF enhanced its position in dairy flavors with its 1991 purchase of Wisconsin-based Auro Tech. In 1993 IFF's Living Flower process successfully synthesized the fragrance of growing flowers for perfumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   IFF inaugurated its flavor and fragrance facility in China (Guangzhou) and formed a joint venture with China's Hangzhou Xin'anjiang Perfumery Factory. The company reasserted its leadership in the US fragrance market in 1996 with the launch of two IFF-developed fragrances: Elizabeth Taylor's Black Pearls and Escada's Jardin de Soleil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales and profits dipped in 1997, prompting IFF to consolidate production. Asia's economic crisis and turmoil in Russia continued to hurt profits in 1998, and in 1999 IFF was hit by the devaluation of Brazil's currency, weak demand for aroma chemicals, and the US dollar's strength against the euro.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   executive Richard Goldstein was appointed chairman and CEO. Boosting its natural ingredients operations, IFF bought Laboratoire Monique Remy (France). The same year, IFF acquired rival fragrance and flavor maker
   <company id="20039">
    Bush Boake Allen
   </company>
   in a deal worth about $1 billion. The acquisition led to a companywide reorganization, including the closing of some manufacturing, distribution, and sales facilities worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company sold its US and Brazilian formulated fruit and vegetable preparation businesses and its aroma chemicals business in the UK. Continuing its product development strategy, in 2003 IFF launched a high-intensity cooling technology (CoolTek) for use in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries that does not use the traditional mint-based technology. The following year it opened a new culinary and baking center to support customers' product development programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   IFF sold its fruit preparations operations in Switzerland and Germany in August 2004 to Israel's
   <company id="133263">
    Frutarom
   </company>
   . The deal was for $36.5 million. Later that year it sold the remainder of its fruit preparations business (located in France) to Frutarom. It also closed its Canadian manufacturing facility and its plant in Dijon, France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and CEO Goldstein retired in 2006. Former
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   chairman and CEO Arthur Martinez, an IFF director, took over on an interim basis until
   <company id="10800">
    International Paper
   </company>
   's Robert Amen was named chairman and CEO. He left in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Douglas Tough was named IFF's CEO in 2010. Tough was formerly the CEO of
   <company id="42395">
    Ansell Limited
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to bolster its sales in the Asia/Pacific region, IFF announced plans in 2011 to invest more than $100 million to expand there over a three-year period. The company is building new manufacturing facilities in Guangzhou, China, and in Singapore, positioning itself strategically to take advantage of the two emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not neglecting the growth markets in the Middle East and India, that year IFF opened a state-of-the-art flavor and fragrance facility in Dubai, and in 2012 a new facility for its flavors unit in Delhi.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen the company's global go-to-market capabilities and improve profitability, in 2012 the company reorganized its Functional Fragrances group to align with the global category approach used for Fine Fragrance &amp; Beauty Care and Fragrance Ingredients. The company also continues to reallocate a portion of its Functional Fragrance resources from the developed markets to the emerging markets, increasing emphasis on its Singapore and Mexico creative centers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an innovative move to grow a new market niche, in 2013 IFF teamed up with leading renewable products company Amyris, to develop and commercialize a specific set of renewable fragrance ingredients.
