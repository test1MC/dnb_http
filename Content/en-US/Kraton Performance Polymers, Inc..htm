   If you brushed your teeth or shaved this morning, you probably touched a Kraton (formerly Kraton Performance Polymers) product. Through
   <company id="106545">
    Kraton Polymers
   </company>
   , the company makes styrenic block copolymers (SBCs), a material it invented in the 1960s, and other engineered polymers. SBCs are used in adhesives, coatings, sealants, lubricants, packaging, and other applications across a range of industries such as paving and roofing, automotive, and personal care products (the rubbery grip on your toothbrush or razor handle, for example). Under its Caroflex brand it sells isoprene rubber latex products (synthetic substitutes for rubber latex). In 2016 the company sold its compounding business to
   <company id="102179">
    PolyOne
   </company>
   for $72 million.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company manufactures its polymer products (which include 250 core commercial grades of SBCs) at five facilities across the globe: its flagship site in Ohio and plants in Brazil, France, Germany, and Japan. Some 61% of its 2013 US revenues came from outside the US.

   Kraton conducts its business through
   <company id="106545">
    Kraton Polymers
   </company>
   and its consolidated subsidiaries. Kraton splits its commercial activities into four main end-use markets: Adhesives, Sealants, and Coatings; Advanced Materials; Paving and Roofing; and Cariflex, used in making isopene rubber and isopene rubber latex. The company also uses its polymers in high styrenics packaging, footwear, and other applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhesives, Sealants, and Coatings comprises the company's largest segment (37% of sales in 2013) and includes polymers used in tapes and labels, nonwoven and industrial adhesives, clear sealants, and lubricant additives. The segment sells hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer (HSBC) and unhydrogenated styrenic block copolymer (USBC) products, used in a diversity of applications that range from adhesives for diapers and hygiene products to white roof coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Paving and Roofing segment (27%) includes polymers used in asphalt modification for bridges, roadways, and airports, as well as for roofing felts and shingles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's most diverse segment, Advanced Materials (27%), includes customized formulations used to address specific customer needs, such as better resilience characteristics in elastic film. The segment includes polymers used in various applications and products, including consumer disposable and durable soft touch products, personal care products, disposable food packaging, skin care products, and automotive interior and exterior products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cariflex segment (9%) includes its non-SBC isoprene rubber and isoprene rubber products, used primarily in surgical gloves and condoms. The products are increasingly used as an alternative to natural rubber latex products that may have allergy risks for consumers.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a number of channels including a direct sales force (the bulk of its sales), marketing representatives, and distributors. Its customers are diversified by industry and geography with more than 800 customers in more than 60 countries.

  <p>
   Kraton's revenues decreased by 9% in 2013 due to lower sales prices associated with lower average raw material costs of $110.4 million and a $10.3 million negative effect associated with the sales mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it posted a net loss of $618 million (compared to a net loss of $16.2 million in 2012) as the result of an increase in selling, general and administrative costs (due to a $9.2 million of professional fees regarding a proposes business combination with
   <company id="173750">
    LCY Chemical
   </company>
   , a $1.1 million increase in costs associated with the joint venture with FPCC and a $1 million increase in other professional fees. Research and development expenses decreased due to higher employee related costs partially offset by decreased lease expense for research and development facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Kraton's operating cash inflow decreased to $105.5 million (from $146.3 million in 2012) due to an increase in the change in the working capital and a decrease in cash flows associated with inventories of products, materials and supplies (largely due to changes in the quantity of raw material and finished goods inventories and the costs of raw materials and finished goods inventories).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Kraton Performance Polymers changed its name to Kraton Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kraton's strategy for growth includes pricing flexibility to manage the volatility of raw materials, using innovation to drive growth, and investing in increasing its HSBC production capacity in Asia. The company also looks for other applications and markets for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it opened its new Kraton Innovation Center in Belpre, Ohio. This pilot facility allows Kraton to make a wide range of SBC-type materials in quantities ranging from 25 kilograms to 50 metric tons. The facility and its high-technology process equipment broadens the company's abilities in polymeric chemistry by leveraging unique, less traditional monomers and building blocks to meet customer needs and create innovative applications. This new ability to generate developmental polymer and processing technologies also opens the door to applications and industries where traditional SBCs were unable to participate.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 LCY Chemical terminated a proposed deal with Kraton to combine their SBC operations.
