   MorphoTrust has enjoyed growth from its US federal government activities, primarily its FBI products and services involving universal enrollment and weapons permits. However, like most companies servicing the public sector, it is at the mercy of its clients' budgetary cuts and restrictions.

   In 2014 the company won new contracts to provide fingerprint-based background checks for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, the New Jersey Department of Public Safety, the Division of State Police, and fingerprint channeling services in Nevada for the Department of Public Safety. It believes these agreements could yield up to $25 million in revenue over the next six years.
