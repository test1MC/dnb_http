   Crane makes a slew of engineered industrial products. Its largest segment, Fluid Handling, makes a variety of valves and pumps. Other segments manufacture sensing and control systems, plastic composites, substrates, and vending and coin dispensing machines. Its products are used in the aerospace, military and defense, recreational vehicle, construction, transportation, automated merchandising, petrochemical, chemical, and power generation industries. Crane operates in more than two dozen countries and traces its roots to 1855.

   Crane divides its operations across four primary segments: Fluid Handling (40% of sales),
   <company id="130923">
    Aerospace and Electronics
   </company>
   (25%), Payment and Merchandising Technologies (26%), and
   <company id="109136">
    Engineered Materials

   (9%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Crane operates in more than 150 locations in 26 countries. About 60% of its sales are made in the US. Europe accounts for nearly 25%, while Canada and other countries account for the remainder.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Crane caters to the chemicals, power, oil and gas, aerospace and defense, and general industrial sectors. Its primary customers include vending operators and food and beverage companies, primarily in the US and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The commercial market and military market accounted for 70% and 30% of total segment sales, respectively, in 2015. Sales to original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers were 73% and 27% in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $2.92 billion in 2014, Crane saw its revenues decline by 6% to $2.74 billion in 2015. Its profits, however, climbed by 19% in 2015 due to a decrease in selling, administrative, and restructuring expenses. Its operating cash flow decreased by 13% in 2015 due to higher working capital requirements and higher environmental payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fluid Handling sales dipped by 14% in 2015, mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency translations, a core sales decline of $78 million, and the impact of its Crane Water divestiture. In addition, its Aerospace and Electronics sales dropped slightly in 2015, due to decrease in commercial original equipment driven by lower shipments to regional aircraft customers, lower engineering sales, and lower sales for other commercial applications.
  </p>

  <p>
   Crane is focused on growing organically and through strategic acquisitions. The company has completed two acquisitions in the past five years. In 2014, it sold Crane Water, which was formerly part of their Fluid Handling segment, for $2.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fluid Handling continues to expand its product portfolio, with recent new product additions across the nuclear, chemical, municipal, and oil and gas markets. Its new SH-32 Frame pump increased its served market for municipal pumps by 33%, and its 2015 introduction of a new low-pressure gate, globe, and check valve platform expanded its process valve portfolio. The segment has also continued to invest in its global footprint, including an investment in Ningjin, China, for localization of its Xomox-lined products.
  </p>
  <p>
   New product plans for 2016 include a line of triple-offset butterfly valves to improve its product portfolio within the power markets.

  <p>
   Crane was founded in 1855 by Richard Teller Crane as a small foundry in a lumberyard owned by his uncle, Martin Ryerson. Crane grew along with Chicago and its railroads. Its first big order was to supply parts to a maker of railroad cars. In 1872 the company began making passenger elevators through the Crane Elevator Company, which was sold in 1895 to a joint venture that became the Otis Elevator Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it had made plumbing materials since 1886, Crane developed a broader line during the 1920s and became a household name. The company remained under the leadership of the Crane family until Thomas Mellon Evans was elected as chief executive in 1959. Evans diversified the company through acquisitions that included Huttig Sash &amp; Door (1968) and CF&amp;I Steel (1969). Crane also added basic materials with its purchase of Medusa (cement and aggregates) in 1979.
