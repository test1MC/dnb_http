   The Essar Group is as strong as steel, as slick as oil, and on the go over sea and the airwaves. One of the largest corporations in India, the conglomerate's holdings include the country's first independent power plant and its first private steel plant. Other operations include construction, oil and gas production, and telecommunications. Controlled byÂ the Ruia family, which has been in business since the 1800s, the Essar Group was founded by Nand Kishore Ruia and passed to his sons Shashi and Ravi after his death in 1969. Its primary unit, Essar Steel, has manufacturing facilities in India, Indonesia, Canada, and the US, with an annual production capacity of 14 million tons.
