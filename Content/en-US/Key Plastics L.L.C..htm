  <p>
   Key Plastics in 2012 sold a portion of its European operations in a management buy-out. The newly-formed Innovative Components Technologies GmbH (ICT) of Germany became the owner and operator of three facilities in Germany and others in Spain and the Czech Republic. The move allowed Key Plastics to focus on its global core products, where it is recording growth across all regions. (Innovative Components Technologies GmbH is an entity formed by the company management team for the purpose of acquiring former Key Plastics facilities.)
