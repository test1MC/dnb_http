   ALTANA is a highly acquisitive company and is looking for purchase opportunities in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific to expand its sales and product portfolio. In the US market, ALTANA is busy scooping up production sites. In 2012 it agreed to acquire US manufacturer for specialty wax additives Chemical Corporation of America (ChemCor). ALTANA will gain ChemCor's New York-based production site and staff, and the business will be integrated into BYK USA Inc., a subsidiary within ALTANA's additives and instruments division.

   ALTANA division ECKART bought the US-based production of Metalure pigments from

    Avery Dennison
   </company>
   in 2011. ECKART had previously been the worldwide distributor of aluminum pigments made by Avery Dennison for more than 20 years. The Metalure pigments are used in coatings, cosmetics, and graphic arts applications.

   In Europe, key acquisitions include ALTANA's purchase of Germany's Color Chemie Group in mid-2011, a deal that helped push its ACTEGA division's sales up by 14% in fiscal 2011. Color Chemie is a producer of environmentally friendly, water-based specialty printing inks used on paper and packaging with plants in Germany, Austria, France, and Poland. The business is now known as ACTEGA Colorchemie.
