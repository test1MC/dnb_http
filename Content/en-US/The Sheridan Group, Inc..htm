   According to The Sheridan Group, commercial printing (through both traditional and digital printing) still can hold its own in a rapidly changing business environment. Through its five specialized printing businesses, The Sheridan Group prints books, catalogs, journals, and magazines. Its Sheridan Press and Dartmouth Journal Services units print short- and medium-run scholarly and technical journals. The Dingley Press prints catalogs, while Sheridan Books manufactures and distributes custom books, and Dartmouth Printing specializes in magazine, journal, and catalog printing.

   Along with the rest of the printing and publishing world, The Sheridan Group has taken steps to boost its digital operations by investing in new technologies across its businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 The Rockefeller University Press (the Press) enlisted Sheridan Books, Inc. and the Sheridan Technology Lab to develop an eCommerce solution to help the Press reach more readers with their book list.  The challenge was to make the content easily accessible from a single web page in a variety of formats.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition LinguiSystems, a publisher serving speech language pathologists throughout North America, partnered with Sheridan Books for the technology that would enable them to sell eBooks from the existing eCommerce platform on their website expanding the format options available to their consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the addition of several new pieces of printing equipment, in 2012 Sheridan Books, Inc. rounded out its print service offering to include digital inkjet capabilities as well as offset, and digital toner based printing.  Each piece of equipment installed brings new capabilities to Sheridan Books and ultimately more efficient print solutions to publishers.
