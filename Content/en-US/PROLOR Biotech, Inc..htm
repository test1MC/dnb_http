   PROLOR Biotech is working to make longer-lasting pharmaceuticals. The biopharmaceutical company is in the early stages of developing therapeutic proteins that are enhanced with Carboxyl Terminal Peptide (CTP), an amino acid that can help render drugs longer lasting. The company licenses certain rights to the peptide from

   </company>
   with the goal of commercializing improved versions of already-approved therapeutic proteins. Projects include a human growth hormone product that can be injected twice a month instead of daily. Incorporated in the US, PROLOR Biotech has offices and research and development facilities in Israel. In 2013 PROLOR agreed to be acquired by

   .

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2013 OPKO Health agreed to acquire PROLOR to expand its operations in specialty fields. OPKO will purchase PROLOR through an all-stock transaction worth some $480 million.

        <p>
   In addition to long-acting versions of human growth hormone for adult hormone deficiency, the company's product development programs have included work on an anti-obesity peptide, Factor IX proteins for hemophilia, and multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis therapies. Adding CTP to therapeutic proteins is thought to extend the lifespan of those proteins in the body without increasing toxicity or causing adverse effects.
  </p>
        <p>
   PROLOR Biotech has the advantage of an already large knowledge base on the original products, so it should have an easier, faster time pushing its own candidates through preclinical and clinical development and regulatory approval processes. It also believes that CTP is applicable to most therapeutic proteins, including some of the best-selling ones on the market.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Strategically, as it moves candidates towards commercialization, the company has sought co-development and licensing partnerships with biotechnology companies to generate revenues in the form of license fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales to help subsidize its ongoing R&amp;D costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the company relocated its corporate office and R&amp;D facility to a new, significantly larger building not far from its former site in Nes Ziona, Israel that will allow it to produce a variety of therapeutic proteins with better control, lower costs, and faster production cycles.
