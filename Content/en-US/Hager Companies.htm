  <p>
   The manufacturer traces its roots to a St. Louis blacksmith shop that hired German immigrant Charles Hager as an apprentice locksmith in 1849. The original owner was lured away by the California Gold Rush, and the company fell into the hands of Hager, who ran the business making metal wheel rims and hinges for the Conestoga wagons heading west. Charles Hager eventually revolutionized the hinge industry by developing compact butt type hinges in the early 1900s. This strong hinge formed the basis for Hager Companies' diverse stock.
