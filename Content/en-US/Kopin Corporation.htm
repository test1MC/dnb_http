   A pioneer of wearable technology, Kopin Corp. makes headset computers for hands-free, mobile computing based on its proprietary Golden-i technology. The company's newest GEN 3.8D headset enables wearers -- typically workers in light industry -- to control the devices with their voices and movements. The company's other wearable technology products are based on CyberDisplay, transmissive LCDs that use high-quality single-crystal silicon transistors. Kopin's display devices used in consumer electronics, eyewear, and military products. Kopin was founded in 1984 by engineers from the
   <company id="40300">

   </company>
   's Electronic Materials Group, including co-founder and CEO John Fan.

   The Americas is Massachusetts-based Kopin's largest market, representing more than 62% of its total sales. The Asia-Pacific Region is also an important market for the company, generating more than a quarter of sales. It also sells products in Europe.

   Military customers, including defense contractors and the US Government, represented 45% of sales in 2014. The company's single largest customer is
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon

   Kopin's revenue rebounded in 2014, rising to about $32 million from about $23 million in 2013. But that's still a far cry from 2011 when it brought in $131 million -- and before it sold its III-V product line. In 2014 it posted increases in sales of applications for the military, industrial, and wearable markets. A 66% increase in the military market came from strong demand from the U.S. government. Wearable applications revenue rose 44%. The biggest percentage increase came in the company's research and development business, in which sales rose 109%. Consumer Applications revenue dropped as sales for digital still cameras diminished the wake of the increasing capability of smartphone cameras.

   Still, Kopin lost even more money in 2014, with its net loss sinking to $28 million from about $5 million in 2013. Expenses for funded R&amp;D rose to $5.2 million in 2014 from $1.5 million in 2013. The company also had less income from investments than it did in 2013.

   The 2013 sale of its III-V product line of specialized gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers with heterojunction bipolar transistors, cost Kopin about 50% of its sales at the time. In 2015, Kopin sold its stake in Recon Instruments to
   <company id="139705">
    Intel Corp.
   </company>
   for some $6 million in cash. Since then the company has focused on developing products to support mobile computing. The company's business model is to generate revenue by licensing its Golden-i and CyberDisplay technologies to partners, such as

   Kopin sells components to eyewear manufacturers as part of an effort to develop a commercial market for eyewear incorporating CyberDisplays for viewing video images. The company has developed a process for making better displays. The NanoJet process for its liquid crystal cell assembly releases tiny drops of liquid crystal material with greater precision (the variation is within a few nano grams). It provides a purer, better controlled, and uniform layering of the liquid crystal material in the fabrication of displays, resulting in superior image quality and higher brightness.

   Although Kopin has been an active acquisitor, it was quiet on that front in 2014.
