   Huber is looking to strategically invest in a few core specialty products businesses and expand geographically. In this regard, in 2016 Huber expanded its CP Kelco facility in Dubai to better serve markets in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey. That year, Huber Engineered Woods announced that it will reopen its Spring City (Tennessee) oriented strand board plant in 2018 to meet increased demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once a global leader in silica production, to raise cash, in 2016 the company agreed to sell the silica business of Huber Engineered Materials to
   <company id="158909">
    Evonik
   </company>
   for $630 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it sold its Demica business (consulting, advisory, and technology services) to a consortium led by the JRJ Group, a financial services company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to the growing global demand of pectin, in 2014 CP Kelco expanded its Limeira, Brazil based manufacturing plant. That year it also expanded its CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose, aka cellulose gum) manufacturing capacity at its Äänekoski plant, in Finland by 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company also opened sales and technical support locations in Singapore and Dubai, to serve customers in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the rest of southeast Asia, and Australasia, as well as India.

  <p>
   In 2013 CP Kelco appointed Azelis as its exclusive distributor in China, to represent its entire product portfolio for Food, Beverage, Consumer and Industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support the growing demand for broad range of high quality dental, food, and industrial grade silicas and silicates, in 2013 Huber Engineered Materials increased capacity at its precipitated silica plant in Etowah, Tennessee, adding 14,000 metric tons annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Huber Engineered Materials completed the expansion of its silica plant in Jhagadia, India, doubling the facility's capacity to 33,000 metric tons per year. This expansion, coupled with the earlier building of dental silica plant in Qingdao, China, allowed the company to better serve the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market.
