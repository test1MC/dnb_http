   Meredith is a diversified media firm. The company publishes magazines, special interest publications, and books. Meredith's portfolio of more than 20 subscription magazines includes flagship title

   <i>
    Family Circle
   </i>
   ,
   <i>

   </i>
   , and
   <em>
    More
   </em>
   . The company is also active in broadcasting with about a dozen network-affiliated TV stations across the US. Meredith additionally operates about 50 websites and some 50 mobile apps, offers integrated marketing services, and has a large consumer database.

  <p>
   Meredith currently operates through two main business segments. Its national media group (66% of sales) consists of magazine publishing, interactive media, integrated marketing, brand licensing, database-related activities, and other related operations. Its local media group consists of its TV and radio stations, related interactive media operations, and video-related operations.

  <p>
   The company reported revenue of $1.59 billion for fiscal 2015. That was a 9% increase compared to the prior fiscal period. Its net income was $192.3 million for fiscal 2014. That was an increase of about 20% compared to the company's fiscal 2014 net income. Meredith's cash flow from operations remained strong during fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   Around the turn of the century, Edwin Thomas (E. T.) Meredith's grandfather eschewed traditional gifts and gave his grandson a unique wedding present -- a handful of $20 gold pieces, enough to buy the grandfather's controlling interest in the
   <i>
    Farmer's Tribune
   </i>
   , and a note instructing his grandson to "Sink or Swim" with the financially troubled publication. Meredith proceeded to revive the
   <i>
    Farmer's Tribune,
   </i>
   and after he sold it in 1902, he used the profits to found Meredith Corporation and launch
   <i>
    Successful Farming
   </i>
   magazine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following a stint as Secretary of Agriculture under President Woodrow Wilson, E. T. Meredith extended the company's publishing reach, introducing
   <i>
    Fruit, Garden and Home
   </i>
   in 1922. Two years later the publication became
   <i>
    Better Homes and Gardens.
   </i>
   E.T. Meredith died in 1928, but his company forged ahead, moving into book publishing in 1930 with the first issue of
   <i>
    Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book,
   </i>
   and branching into special interest publications in 1937.
  </p>
  <p>
   After going public in 1946, Meredith wasted no time diversifying into the fledgling TV industry. It bought its first TV station (Syracuse, New York's WHEN-TV) in 1948, followed by KPHO (Phoenix) in 1952 and Kansas City's KCTV in 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meredith launched a commercial printing business in 1957 and expanded its printing activities in 1969 by teaming with West Germany's Burda family to operate several US printing plants. With decades of home and family experience under its belt, the company entered the real estate market in 1978, launching its Better Homes and Gardens franchised real estate business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Accelerated expansion was the essence of Meredith's story in the 1980s. In addition to buying two more TV stations, the company acquired
   <i>
    Ladies' Home Journal
   </i>
   from Family Media in 1986 and introduced
   <i>
    Midwest Living
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Traditional Home
   </i>
   in 1987 and 1989, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meredith reacted to an advertising slump in the early 1990s by paring down its holdings. Among its divestitures were its printing business (1990), two television stations (1993), a book club (1995), and its cable TV interests (1996). In 1997 it launched its syndicated
   <i>
    Better Homes and Gardens
   </i>
   TV show, the same year William Kerr became CEO. Focusing on its core assets, the company sold its Better Homes and Gardens real estate business to General Motors' GMAC Home Services in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Meredith expanded its profile in cyberspace, securing a deal with America Online (later
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   ) to provide a variety of content to the Internet service. The company's 1999 purchase of Atlanta's TV station WGNX (changed to WGCL in a 2000 restructuring) brought the number of TV stations in its stable to one dozen. Meredith discontinued several publications (
   <i>
    Family Money, Antiques Extra, Mature Outlook
   </i>
   ) and sold
   <i>
    Golf for Women
   </i>
   magazine in 2001. An advertising slump resulted in job reductions at the company. In mid-2001 the company hired a marketing company to better leverage its magazine brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company swapped its TV stations in Orlando (WOFL) and Ocala, Florida (WOGX) for
   <company id="103359">
    FOX Broadcasting
   </company>
   's KPTV in Portland, Oregon. It also added to its magazine collection with its purchase of
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   's American Baby magazine group (
   <em>
    American Baby
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Childbirth
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Espera
   </em>
   ) for $115 million. Executive committee chairman E. T. Meredith III -- grandson of the company's founder -- died in early 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Michigan radio station WKNX-AM in 2004, with plans to change the call letters to WNEM-AM. In 2005 Meredith purchased the
   <em>
    Parents
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Child
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Fitness
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Family Circle
   </em>
   magazines from
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann's
   </company>
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner + Jahr
   </company>
   for $350 million. In 2006 president and COO Stephen Lacy succeeded Kerr as CEO. Later that year Meredith acquired the
   <em>
    ReadyMade
   </em>
   do-it-yourself lifestyle magazine. (It divested that title in 2011.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed the print edition of
   <em>
    Child
   </em>
   in 2007; the brand continues to exist online. Also in 2007 Meredith acquired four companies: online customer relationship marketing firm Genex, interactive word-of-mouth marketing company New Media Strategies, consumer health information search engine Healiea, and Directive Corporation, a provider of database strategy, analytics, and customer asset management services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it purchased Big Communications, a healthcare marketing communications firm. The company also beefed up Meredith Integrated Marketing in 2008 with the acquisitions of Directive Corporation, a specialized customer intelligence firm, and Big Communications, a healthcare marketing communications firm. Also that year the company sold WFLI, a CW affiliate serving Chattanooga, Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year it closed its
   <em>
    Country Home
   </em>
   magazine. Meredith made the divestitures in order to cut costs and focus on growth areas such as digital and markerting activities. Also in 2009 the firm expanded its licensing operations through forming agreement with
   <company id="13868">
    John Wiley &amp; Sons
   </company>
   to publish and distribute more books based on the Better Homes and Gardens imprint. Under the agreement, Meredith creates book content while Wiley is responsible for publishing services such as layout and design, printing, sales and marketing, distribution, and inventory management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company acquired mobile marketing firm The Hyperfactory in order to help develop mobile applications. Another digital acquisition in 2010 was Meredith's purchase of the Real Girls Media Network (RGM), a social content hub for women online. In 2011 it closed down its struggling home shelter title
   <em>
    ReadyMade
   </em>
   .  Also that year it rebranded its Meredith Integrated Marketing business, which became Meredith Xcelerated Marketing. In 2012 Meredith acquired AllRecipes.com from Reader's Digest for $175 million.
