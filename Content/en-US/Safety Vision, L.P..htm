   If Safety Vision has its way, rear-view mirrors will soon go the way of rumble seats. The company is a distributor and manufacturer of vehicle-mounted cameras and digital video recorders (DVRs) used for rear-vision, side-vision, and mobile surveillance. Safety Vision started out as a distributor of Clarion rear-vision camera systems and has since grown to offer several additional products such as the SafeDrive MiniDVR and a personal flashlight DVR. The company's rear vision and side-vision camera systems are used for safer backing by the trucking and delivery industries as well as by government vehicles. Safety Vision's mobile surveillance cameras are used by mass transit, rail, and law enforcement.
