   Endo International, formerly Endo Pharmaceuticals and then Endo Health Solutions, wants the pain to end, preferably through the drugs it acquires and markets. The company has a portfolio of both branded and generic prescription products for pain management and other health conditions. Its best-selling drug is Lidoderm, a lidocaine patch that treats nerve pain caused by shingles. Endo also sells pain medications Percocet and Opana ER, migraine therapy Frova, and cancer drug Valstar. Its generics include morphine and oxycodone tablets. In addition, the firm provides related medical services. The company changed its name in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2014 Endo spent $1.6 billion acquiring Canadian pharmaceuticals firm
   <company id="116597">
    Paladin Labs
   </company>
   to expand its specialty drug operations in fields including cancer therapies and men's and women's health. Through the transaction, Endo created an Ireland-based holding company; Paladin shareholders gained 22% ownership of the new holding entity. Paladin operates as an independent subsidiary of Endo following the deal.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   When Endo acquired Paladin, it changed the names of its four reportable segments (US Branded Pharmaceuticals, 33% of sales; US Generic Pharmaceuticals, 40% of sales; Devices, 18% of sales; and International Pharmaceuticals, 9% of sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   The US Branded Pharmaceuticals segment (33% of sales) makes pain treatments as well as urology, enocrinology and cancer products; brand names include Lidoderm, Opana ER, Percocet, Fortesta Gel, Supprelin LA, XIAFLEX, and Testim. Endo's top-selling drug was Lidoderm, but has been surpassed by Opana as generic versions of Lidoderm hit the market in late 2013. In early 2015 the company acquired
   <company id="108854">
    Auxilium
   </company>
   , which develops, markets, and sells products containing
   <company id="15530">
    Biospecifics Technologies
   </company>
   ' XIAFLEX enzyme.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US Generic Pharmaceuticals segment makes products in the areas of pain management, urology, CNS disorders, immunosuppression, cancer, women's health, hypertension, and others. In 2014 it launched a generic lidocaine patch.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company agreed to sell
   <company id="101018">
    American Medical Systems
   </company>
   (AMS), which represented its former Devices segment. It sold AMS' men's health and prostate health operations to
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   . It sold urology services unit
   <company id="99256">
    HealthTronics
   </company>
   to investment firm Altaris Capital Partners in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new International Pharmaceuticals segment comprises the operations of Paladain and Mexico's Somar (also acquired in 2014) and represents a variety of products and services in the areas of ADHD, pain, and urology.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company maintains its own sales and marketing teams, it outsources most of its drug manufacturing operations (largely to Novartis Consumer Health and Teikoku Seiyaku) and warehouse and distribution activities (to
   <company id="107174">
    UPS Supply Chain Solutions
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Endo has locations across the US, including facilities in Pennsylvania (headquarters and shared services); New Jersey (US Branded Pharmaceuticals); Alabama, Florida, New York, and North Carolina (US Generic Pharmaceuticals); and Canada, South Africa, and Mexico (International Pharmaceuticals).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its branded drugs and medical devices in the US and select international markets through its own specialized sales forces. The company's products are marketed to physicians in fields including anesthesiology, neurology, oncology, urology, pain management, primary care, and surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endo primarily distributes products through wholesalers -- including
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   (17%),
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (26%), and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   (14%) -- though also sells directly to retail pharmacies and health entities throughout the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endo has a direct sales force of approximately 600 sales representatives who specialize in either pain products, bladder and prostate cancer products, medical devices, or represent medical centers. About 100 of those salespersons are located abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $35.6 million in advertising costs in 2014, down 8% from $38.3 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Organic and acquisitive growth measures has created a stretch of revenue growth for Endo over the past few years. In 2013, though, the company's revenues declined 13% to $2.6 billion as sales of Lidoderm declined. (A patent litigation settlement agreement with generics manufacturer Watson Pharmaceuticals called for Endo to supply Watson's wholesale distributor with Lidoderm at no cost from January through August that year.) However, revenue recovered in 2014, growing 10% to $2.8 billion due to successes in the US Generics segment, which launched a generic version of Lidoderm and acquired specialty generics manufacturers Boca and DAVA. The acquisitions of Somar and Paladin also contributed to the overall increase in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell in 2010 and 2011, primarily due to acquisition costs, but then plummeted in 2012 as a result of asset impairment and patent litigation expenses. Endo reported a loss that year of $740.3 million. In 2013 Endo saw a modest recovery, reporting a loss of $685.3 million (a 7% improvement), largely due to the absence of litigation expenses as well as lower research and development spending. Net losses again increased in 2014, rising 5% to $721 million due to higher litigation-related and other contingencies expenses. (That year, it agreed to pay nearly $1.3 billion to resolve lawsuits surrounding AMS' vaginal-mesh implants.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased 13% to $338 million in 2014 due to change in inventories and a decline in cash used in accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company focuses on organic growth by expanding its product pipeline and launching new products. It has also expanded through a number of strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endo changed its name from Endo Pharmaceuticals to Endo Health Solutions in 2012 as part of a diversification strategy. The name change accompanied the company's newly adopted business model in which it aims to deliver fully-integrated, end-to-end solutions mainly in pain management and urology for the benefit of providers, payers, and patients by aggregating its four operating businesses into one enterprise. Endo International came about when the company purchased Canada-based Paladin Labs in early 2014 and converted to an Ireland-based firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expands its drug offerings by licensing or acquiring drug candidates in various research and development stages, as well as through its internal and collaborative R&amp;D programs. The company spends some 5% of annual revenue on R&amp;D programs. The company is focusing on the pain management market and reducing its dependence on sales of Lidoderm (5% of total revenues in 2014), which has seen smaller sales as a result of the launch of its generic counterpart.
  </p>
  <p>
   To help offset the reduction in pharma sales, in 2013 Endo Health Solutions announced a strategic restructuring plan that included a 15% workforce reduction (eliminating nearly 700 jobs). It began exploring options for its HealthTronics urology division and its branded drug development platform unit (eventually divested). It plans to focus its operations around generic drug division, as well as R&amp;D efforts for revenue-generating products such as generic drugs and low-risk products. Endo aims to reduce annual spending by some $325 million through the plan.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the restructuring, Endo sold the HealthTronics Laboratory Solutions unit to Metamark Genetics later that year. Early the following year, Endo sold all of what remained of HealthTronics to Altaris Capital Partners for $130 million. The move allows Endo to focus on its generic drug business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Towards that end, in 2013 generics unit Qualitest launched 10 new generic products and devoted energies to building its pipeline, which includes more than 50 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs). In 2014 the unit began producing generic versions of Valcyte and AVEED. Other recent launches includes AMS' new bladder slings RetroArc and MiniArc Pro and Paladin's introduction of traveler's diarrhea treatment Travelan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, R&amp;D efforts have been refocusing on progressing late-stage pipeline and marketed products. In 2014 it sold its branded pharmaceutical drug-discovery platform (including candidates in the areas of oncology, pain, and inflammation) to Asana Biosciences. It also sold most of the assets and intellectual property  (excluding Vantas and Supprelin) of its second-generation implantable drug technology to Braeburn Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the company's continuing restructuring efforts, the company plans to sell subsidiary American Medical Systems' urology portfolio, which includes the men's health and prostate health operations, to Boston Scientific for $1.6 billion (plus a potential $50 million based on 2016 sales). It is evaluating possibilities for the unit's women's health business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Endo acquired global rights to sumatriptan delivery system Sumavel DosePro; it also secured rights to testosterone nasal gel Natesto.

  <p>
   In addition to the $1.6 billion Paladin Labs deal, the company acquired specialty generics manufacturer Boca Pharmacal for some $225 million in 2013 to expand its range of generic drug offerings. Also that year, Endo agreed to acquire migraine pain patch maker
   <company id="161755">
    NuPathe
   </company>
   for some $105 million. In 2014 Endo purchased Mexico-based Grupo Farmaceutico Somar (SOMAR) and generic drug maker DAVA Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is continuing its search for acquisitions to ignite sales growth. In 2015 the company acquired biopharmaceutical Auxilium, a specialist in men's health care that develops, markets, and sells products containing Biospecifics Technologies' XIAFLEX enzyme. Endo also bought the privately held
   <company id="11152">
    Par Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   in an $8.05 billion transaction. That purchase made it one of the US' largest generic drug producers, adding generic versions of Ambien and Aricept, among others.
