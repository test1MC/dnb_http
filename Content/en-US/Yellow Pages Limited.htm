   Yellow Pages Limited owns and operates some of the country's leading publications and websites, including Yellow Pages print directories, YellowPages.ca, and RedFlagDeals.com. Together, its properties serve about one-third of all Canadian businesses and reach millions of visitors monthly. Through Mediative, it provides digital advertising and marketing services for national agencies and advertisers.

   Yellow Pages serves about one-third of all Canadian businesses. Of those, two-thirds are online. The company sells to advertisers via a direct sales force in Canada. Most of its customers are small and medium-sized businesses.

  <p>
   In addition to improving its financial flexibility, Yellow Pages' ongoing strategy is to grow in the digital space. This is being driven by changes in consumer search behavior; consumers are increasingly looking for information and shopping through online channels. Digital revenue accounted for more than 50% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2014.

  <p>
   Yellow Pages published its first directory in 1908 as part of a division of Bell Canada. Formerly Yellow Pages Income Fund, the company converted from an income trust to a traditional corporate structure toward the end of 2010. It restructured in response to legislative changes to the business income trust market, and it hopes the conversion proves to be a more favorable environment for the company's securities, while it broadened its potential investor base.
