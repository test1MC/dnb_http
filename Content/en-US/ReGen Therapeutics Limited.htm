   Who would have thought that cow's milk could help your brain? ReGen Therapeutics did. Its main product is Colostrinin, a polypeptide nutraceutical derived from ovine and bovine colostrums (the first milk produced after the birth of an offspring) that has been shown to have neurological benefits for sufferers of ailments such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, and multiple sclerosis. The supplement is marketed as CogniSure by licensee

    Metagenics
   </company>
   in North America. ReGen is working to expand sales of Colostrinin into new markets.

  <p>
   The company has collaborated with other organizations, including University of Texas Medical Branch and
   <company id="117072">

   </company>
   , to further develop Colostrinin. Research is being done on the use of Colostrinin in veterinary applications. ReGen is also researching alternative uses for existing hypnotic/sedative zolpidem (Stilnox, Ambien), which treats secondary brain dormancy in humans who have suffered significant head trauma.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through distributors. Colostrinin, which is sold under the brand CogniSure, is sold to health care professionals in North America by Metagenics.

  <p>
   Sales have been poor for the company, especially in 2012 and 2013. A significant contributor to slipping revenues was the loss of ReGen's marketing and distribution partners in the nations of Turkey, India, and Cyprus. (The company is still seeking replacement licensees.) Due to that loss, sales of Colostrinin took a dip in 2013 -- falling 20% from the previous year. To cut administrative costs, ReGen directors and consultants took no fees during the year and other operating costs were kept to a minimum.

  <p>
   The struggling company has been searching for new markets for its products, as well as seeking industry partners to continue development of a veterinary application of Colostrinin for companion animals. However, with finances tight, ReGen has also been on the lookout for viable opportunities to sell itself to a buyer that has the resources to realize Colostrinin's sales potential.
