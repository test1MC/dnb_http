   Simple Health &amp; Beauty's takeover by Unilever in 2011 followed an agreement to license the Simple and other soap brands to rival manufacturers to assuage competition concerns. Nonetheless, Simple has sustained its position as one of the UK's top facial skincare brands in terms of number of packs sold. All told, Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes are among the biggest-selling facial skincare products in England and Ireland.
