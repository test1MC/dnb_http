   Epocrates is taking the desk reference off the desk and putting it on a PDA. The firm provides clinical information and tools to healthcare professionals via iPhones, BlackBerrys, and other smartphones. Epocrates offers drug information through its free subscription service. It also offers marketing and interactive services such as DocAlert clinical messages (product news and alerts to healthcare professionals) and Virtual Representative Services (drug detailing and sampling, patient literature delivery, and tools to contact drug manufacturers, for pharmaceutical sales reps). Epocrates also conducts market research programs to survey healthcare professionals. The company was bought by

   Epocrates is pursuing growth primarily in its interactive services segment. Specifically, the company is working on the development of its EHR (electronic health records) product geared towards solo and small group practices. EHR is designed to help Epocrates' efforts to become further integrated into the daily work practices of physicians.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also growing its interactive services segment by maintaining its network of healthcare professionals.  All total, Epocrates has more than one million users, including about 45% of US physicians. Its clinical network also includes medical students, pharmacists, and physician assistants.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it focuses on interactive services, Epocrates expects the number of premium subscribers to decline. The company generates about a quarter of its total revenue from premium subscriptions. The majority of its subscribers rely on the company's free clinical products.
