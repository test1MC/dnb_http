   ClearSpeed Technology hopes customers find a clear advantage in its chips. The fabless semiconductor company offers specialized microprocessors designed to handle math-intensive computing functions more rapidly -- and with less energy consumption -- than standard processors. Its chips are programmable and process data in parallel; the company also offers related development tools. The company touts its products for heavy-duty number-crunching chores in areas such as biomedical research and sonar equipment. ClearSpeed sells directly and through resellers and distributors.
