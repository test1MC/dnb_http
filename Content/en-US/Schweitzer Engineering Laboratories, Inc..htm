   Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) designs, manufactures, and supports a full line of products that keep electric power systems running safely and reliably. With offices around the world, it produces generator and transmission protection systems, as well as distribution automation and control systems. SEL's engineering services division is capable of system design, construction, and commissioning for customers that include utilities, municipalities, rural electric cooperatives, airports, universities, refineries, and water treatment plants. Its government services division focuses on military bases and ships.

  <p>
   SEL's microprocessor-based protective relays, fault indicators, voltage controls, sensors, and portfolio of other products help to minimize the damage of blackouts and quickly restore power after an electrical outage. The company also continues to expand into different industries, as its products are finding application in lighting control, security, telecommunications, and industrial process control.

  <p>
   The company's growth strategy involves expanding into new markets and industries and continually inventing new and improved products and services. In late 2013, SEL released its new rotary switch product family and integrated its technology and design standards into the new product line to create the next generation of rotary switches. This investment in new manufacturing and testing equipment allowed SEL to offer more versatile and durable switches; it also enabled the company to further expand into new areas of manufacturing.

  <p>
   Founded in 1982 by Edmund O. Schweitzer, the company introduced the world's first digital protective relay to the electric power industry in 1984.
