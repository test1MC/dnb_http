   F5's revenue is split about 50-50 between products and services. The company outsources manufacturing of its hardware products to
   <company id="46895">
    Flex LTD.
   </company>
   , which handles everything from sourcing materials to warranty repairs.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Americas accounts for nearly 60% of F5's sales with more than 50% of sales from the US alone. Overseas, Europe generates about a quarter of F5's revenue and the Asia/Pacific region supplies less than a fifth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's software developers are in Seattle (headquarters), San Jose, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel. Hardware engineers are in Spokane, Washington, San Jose, and Tel Aviv. F5 also operates a product testing and quality control facility in Warsaw, Poland.

   The company sells primarily through distributors, systems integrators, and resellers, although it also maintains a direct sales force for major enterprise accounts. Distribution giants

   F5 spends about $4 million a year on advertising.

  <p>
   F5's revenue bumped up 4% to about $2 billion in 2016 (ended September) buoyed by a 13% increase in service revenue. Working from a bigger installed base of products, customers bought and renewed more maintenance contracts in 2016 from 2015, and contracted for more consulting services. Product revenue fell about 5% in 2016 from 2015, because of lower sales of application delivery networking (ADN) products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits for 2016 and 2015 were virtually the same at about $365 million. Revenue rose enough to cover increased spending on sales and marketing (up 4%) and research and development (up 13%) and keep profit steady.
  </p>
  <p>
   F5's operating cash flow increased to $710 million in 2016 from about $680 million in 2015 because of positive accounts receivable and a lower level of inventory.
