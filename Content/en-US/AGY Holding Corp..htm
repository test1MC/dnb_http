   You may think of yarn as a soft textile but AGY Holding will make you think again. The company produces glass yarns (thin filaments of glass twisted together to form advanced fiber), which are used in myriad aerospace, automotive, construction, defense, electronics, industrial, and recreational applications. The US military, for example, reinforces Humvees and other armored vehicles with AGY's proprietary glass fiber. AGY products are differentiated by glass chemistry, coating technology, and form; brands include L Glass, S-2 Glass, and S-1 HM Glass. It makes glass fibers at two plants in the US and one in Hong Kong. Private equity firm
   <company id="131641">
    Kohlberg &amp; Co.
   </company>
   owns AGY.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company reports its operations in two segments, AGY US and AGY Asia (though it is seeking a buyer for its Hong Kong-based business). It divides its glass fiber products into E Glass and advanced materials (consisting mostly of S-2 Glass). Aerospace and industrial end markets each account for about a third of total sales. Electronics, construction, and defense round out the market segments in order of sales contribution.
  </p>
        <p>
   In mid-2012 AGY expanded its S-2 Glass production by 20%. Shortly thereafter, it AGY announced plans to sell its continuous filament mat (CFM) business. The company says selling both AGY Asia and the CFM business will allow it to refocus on its core products and improve it financial position.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company divides its product sales based on origination (US and Asia). AGY US accounts for about 85% of sales and serves every one of AGY's end-market applications. AGY Asia's products account for 15% of net sales and are only used in circuit boards.
  </p>
        <p>
   Customers in North and South America account for about half of sales with Europe and Asia splitting the other half about evenly.

        <p>
   AGY sells directly to high-end weavers and domestic and international commercial and industrial fiber users. In Asia, it weaves fibers and sells them directly to electronics makers.

        <p>
   Sales dropped about 6% in 2012 due to lower sales volume. Aerospace revenues were up but defense, electronics, and industrial lagged due to the sluggish economy. The Asia market also struggled amid pricing pressure. Manufacturing improvements, cost control initiatives, and lower costs helped the company turn a modest profit in spite of reduced revenue. Add in restructuring and impairment costs and AGY reported a $40 net loss for 2012. But that was still better than the $54.5 million loss in 2011.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   As AGY has experienced decreased demand in some markets and reduced US military spending has offset any demand uptick, the company has focused it strategic planning on developing new applications for its products, improving its manufacturing efficiency, and improving its cash flow and liquidity. Divesting its non-core CFM and Asian business lines are part of this strategy.

   . As Advanced Glass Fiber Yarns, AGY was established in 1998 as a joint venture by Owens Corning to enable the fiberglass giant to capture the glass fiber reinforcements and yarns markets.
