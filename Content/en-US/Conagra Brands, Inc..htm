   Conagra Brands (formerly known as ConAgra Foods) fills the refrigerators, freezers, and pantries of most households. The company makes and markets name-brand packaged and frozen foods that are sold in most retail outlets. Conagra's cornucopia of America's best-known brands includes Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender. It is also one of the biggest producers of seasoning and grain ingredients for the US food service, food manufacturing, and industrial markets. ConAgra Foods sold its private-label food business to
   <company id="139161">
    TreeHouse Foods
   </company>
   for $2.7 billion in early 2016. ConAgra Foods changed its name to Conagra Brands in late 2016 after separating from Lamb Weston Holdings.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Conagra separated from Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., which consisted of frozen potato and vegetable products and related licensed and private label brands. Conagra Brands maintained its Consumer Foods and Foodservice businesses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Conagra's operations are divided into two reporting segments: Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumer Foods segment, which generated 62% of fiscal 2016 sales, consists of branded, private-label, and custom-made food products. The lineup ranges from meals to side dishes, snacks, and desserts (found frozen, refrigerated, or at shelf-stable temperature), and is sold by a variety of retailers and some food service operators, mainly in North America. Brands include Hunt's, Orville Redenbacher's, PAM, Peter Pan, Reddi-Wip, Slim Jim, Snack Pack, and Van Camp's.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conagra's Commercial Foods segment (38%) comprises commercially branded food products and ingredients used in the kitchens of food manufacturers, as well as food service and industrial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra Foods sold its Private Brands segment to
   <company id="139161">
    TreeHouse Foods
   </company>
   for $2.7 billion in February 2016.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Conagra operates mainly in the US from 27 manufacturing facilities across states mostly in the Midwestern, Sunbelt, and New England regions. It has international manufacturing facilities in Argentina, Austria, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the UK. ConAgra also operates general offices in China, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Singapore.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , ConAgra's largest customer, accounted for 16% of sales during fiscal 2016 (ended May). It promotes its products with advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions, and sells them in various retail channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra's advertising and promotion expenses totaled $371.4 million, $330 million, and $395.7 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 net sales of the company decreased by $4.1 billion compared to the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The primary reason was due to decreased consumer foods revenues. Results reflected a 5% drop in volumes, primarily due to the exclusion of an additional week of results that occurred in fiscal 2015, as well as the negative impact on volume from pricing actions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss of the company increased by $424 million due to increased selling, general and administrative expenses and decreased sales, partially offset by lower interest expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a charge of $348.5 million reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of its pension liability; charges of $232.8 million in connection with its SCAE Plan; and an increase in incentive compensation expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 ConAgra's net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $273 million compared to the previous year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ConAgra has been known to revamp or sell less-profitable lines of business, with particular focus on its Private Brands business in recent years. With a focus on recovery and stabilization during  fiscal 2015, for example, the company announced its plans to exit the Private Brands business after disappointing results from the restructuring of its Ralcorp operations through its Supply Chain and Administrative Efficiency Plan (SCAE Plan), which aimed to optimize supply chain networks and slash costs across its selling, general, and administrative operations and through productivity improvements. Indeed, by February 2016, fellow food company
   <company id="139161">
    TreeHouse Foods
   </company>
   paid $2.7 billion cash for its Private Brands business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016 ConAgra separated into two companies: ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston. ConAgra Brands hung on to Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice, ROTEL, Hunt's, PAM, Slim Jim, and Marie Callender's as well as other brands and businesses like the seasoning and ingredients lines. Lamb Weston took the frozen potato, sweet potato, appetizer, and vegetable products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid 2016, ConAgra sold off some of its food ingredients assets, including its Spicetec Flavors &amp; Seasonings business to flavors and fragrances company
   <company id="92846">
    Givaudan
   </company>
   for $340 million and food ingredient sourcing company
   <company id="112591">
    J.M. Swank
   </company>
   to investment firm
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company often enters joint venture partnerships to efficiently expand its product lines and geographic market reach. In 2014, ConAgra partnered with Cargill to distribute its ACT II microwave popcorn and Hunt's condiments products across Brazil. That year ConAgra also formed a joint flour-milling venture with
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   and farmer-owned cooperative
   <company id="57218">
    CHS
   </company>
   . The three partners combined their flour-milling operations to form Ardent Mills, the largest flour miller in North America, with annual sales of more than $4 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In May 2015, ConAgra expanded its Consumer Foods product line with the purchase of family-owned Blake's All Natural Foods, which specialized in natural and organic frozen meals such as pot pies, casseroles, and pasta dishes. The deal also positioned ConAgra to seize the fast-growing organic and natural foods consumer markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2014, the company further broadened its Consumer Foods line with its acquisition of China-based TaiMei Potato Industry Limited, which processed frozen potato products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Alva Kinney founded Nebraska Consolidated Mills in 1919 by combining the operations of four Nebraska grain mills. It did not expand outside Nebraska until it opened a mill and feed processing plant in Alabama in 1942.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consolidated Mills developed Duncan Hines cake mix in the 1950s. But Duncan Hines failed to raise a large enough market share, and the company sold it to
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   in 1956. Consolidated Mills used the proceeds to expand, opening a flour and feed mill in Puerto Rico the next year. In the 1960s, while competitors were moving into prepared foods, the firm expanded into animal feeds and poultry processing. By 1970 it had poultry processing plants in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. In 1971 the company changed its name to ConAgra (Latin for "in partnership with the land"). During the 1970s it expanded into the fertilizer, catfish, and pet accessory businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Poorly performing subsidiaries and commodity speculation caused ConAgra severe financial problems until 1974, when Mike Harper, a former
   <company id="44318">
    Pillsbury
   </company>
   executive, took over. Harper trimmed properties to reduce debt and had the company back on its feet by 1976. ConAgra stayed focused on the commodities side of the business, but was thus tied to volatile price cycles. In 1978 it bought United Agri Products (agricultural chemicals).
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra moved into consumer food products in the 1980s. It bought Banquet (frozen food, 1980) and within six years had introduced almost 90 new products under that label. Other purchases included Singleton Seafood (1981), Armour Food Company (meats, dairy products, frozen food; 1983), and RJR Nabisco's frozen food business (1986). ConAgra became a major player in the red meat market with the 1987 purchases of E.A. Miller (boxed beef), Monfort (beef and lamb), and Swift Independent Packing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Confident it had found the right path, ConAgra continued with acquisitions of consumer food makers, including Beatrice Foods (Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, Hunt's tomato products) in 1991. In 1997 the company agreed to pay $8.3 million to settle federal charges of wire fraud and watering down grain. That year ConAgra named vice chairman and president Bruce Rohde as CEO; he became chairman in 1998. Also in 1998 the company bought GoodMark Foods, maker of Slim Jim, and Nabisco's Egg Beaters and table spread unit(Parkay). ConAgra bought Holly Ridge Foods (pastries) in 1999 and announced a major restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra bought Emerge, an agricultural and land-use information software provider, from
   <company id="10902">
    Litton Industries
   </company>
   in 2000. It also acquired Seaboard's poultry division and refrigerated meat alternatives maker Lightlife (Tofu pups, Smart Dogs), before buying major brand holder International Home Foods from
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (known as Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst at the time) for about $2.9 billion. The company then became ConAgra Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2001 the company drew
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   attention and was forced to restate earnings for the previous three years due to accounting no-no's in its United Agri Products division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the
   <company id="129948">
    USDA
   </company>
   forced ConAgra to recall 19 million pounds of ground beef because of possible
   <em>
    E. coli
   </em>
   contamination, making it the second-largest food recall in US history. (The largest recall occurred in 1997 when Hudson Foods, later purchased by
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   , withdrew 35 million pounds of beef.) Later in 2002 ConAgra sold its fresh beef and pork processing business -- one of the largest in the US -- to Booth Creek Management and HM Capital Partners, and it was renamed Swift &amp; Company
   <company id="106028">
    Swift &amp; Company
   </company>
   . (Swift  was acquired by Brazilian beef giant,
   <company id="157322">
    JBS
   </company>
   in 2007.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company began supplying packaged meat products for grilling to George Foreman Foods, which sells them via its Web site. That year it sold its
   <company id="107692">
    Bumble Bee
   </company>
   canned seafood business to members of Bumble Bee management and private investment firm Centre Partners Management, and its blue cheese brands (Treasure Cave, Nauvoo) to Canada's
   <company id="55259">
    Saputo, Inc.
   </company>
   for undisclosed prices. It also sold its chicken processing business to
   <company id="11187">
    Pilgrim's Pride
   </company>
   for a stock and cash deal worth about $550 million in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2003 ConAgra agreed to pay $1.5 million in cash and job offers to settle an
   <company id="127614">
    EEOC
   </company>
   lawsuit charging bias against disabled workers at the company's California-based Gilroy Foods plant. The agreement involves the largest disability settlement in the agriculture industry. The dispute dated back to 1999, when Gilroy Foods, then owned by Basic Vegetable Products (ConAgra bought the facility in 2000), after a strike failed to recall disabled workers who were on leaves of absence due to illness or pregnancy or who had a history of illness or injury.
  </p>
  <p>
   In keeping with its strategy to focus on its branded and value-added food business, in 2003 ConAgra sold United Agri Products to Apollo Management for stock and securities. The deal was worth about $600 million. In 2004 it sold its minority interest in the beef and pork processing operations of Swift Foods to HM Capital Partners. The deal was worth $194 million. ConAgra also sold Swift's feedlot operations to Smithfield Foods for an undisclosed amount.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra sold its turkey hatchery and breeding business to Ag Forte in 2004. It sold its Canadian and US crop inputs businesses and its Spanish feed and Portuguese poultry businesses that year as well. In addition it sold
   <company id="132468">
    Casa de Oro Foods
   </company>
   (the US's third-largest tortilla maker) to the Plaza Belmont Fund II. Also that year ConAgra introduced Golden Cuisine, a line of frozen meals designed for seniors. The company began manufacturing and supplying Golden Cuisine to
   <company id="106422">
    Meals On Wheels
   </company>
   , which distributes the meals, which are formulated for seniors, to the homebound elderly. That year ConAgra also introduced a high-fiber flour, called Ultragrain, that has the taste and texture of refined flour but the nutrition of whole grain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 ConAgra sold its remaining 15 million shares of
   <company id="11187">
    Pilgrim's Pride
   </company>
   to that company for about $480 million. That year CEO Bruce Rhode retired. His replacement was former chairman and CEO of
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo Beverages and Foods North America
   </company>
   , Gary Rodkin, who began a company-wide restructuring. The company reorganized its business structure from three channels to two: Foodservice was merged with Food Ingredients and became
   <company id="111042">
    ConAgra Foods Commercial
   </company>
   ; the ConAgra Retail channel remained the same.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra agreed to pay a $14 million shareholder settlement in 2005 regarding a lawsuit claiming fictitious sales and mis-reported earnings at its former subsidiary United Agri Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to demonstrate its commitment to the humane treatment of animals, in 2006 ConAgra urged its poultry suppliers to consider slaughtering chickens in a more humane manner called controlled-atmosphere killing. The process, which ConAgra has only suggested to its suppliers, is approved by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rodkin continued the company redo, focusing on portfolio trimming, when, in early 2006, he announced plans to sell a large part of ConAgra's refrigerated-meats business. The brands involved in the sale include some of the company's best-known: Armour,
   <company id="113933">
    Butterball
   </company>
   , and Eckrich. (The Brown 'N Serve, Healthy Choice, Hebrew National, Pemmican, and Slim Jim brands were not included in the portfolio reduction.)  It sold its Cook's ham business to
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   for $260 million that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not long after that, it agreed to sell of the rest of its refrigerated meats business that it had for sale to Smithfield as well. The deal, which became final in October 2006, cost Smithfield $571 million in cash. That same month, it sold its Butterball Turkey unit to Carolina Turkeys for $325 million. (Carolina subsequently changed its company name to
   <company id="113933">
    Butterball, LLC
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   Divesting almost faster than one can keep track of, one day after the Butterball deal was completed, ConAgra sold its MaMa Rosa's Pizza operations to investment firm, the Plaza Belmont Management Group. (MaMa Rosa's is refrigerated -- not frozen, pizza -- and competes in a different market than other pizzas, albeit frozen, powerhouses such as
   <company id="103392">
    Di Giorno, Tombstone
   </company>
   , or
   <company id="40416">
    Tony's
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In another move to improve long-term operating performance, ConAgra announced its intention to sell off its seafood and domestic and imported cheese businesses. To that end, the company sold its surimi business, including the Louis Kemp brand, to
   <company id="105938">
    Trident Seafoods
   </company>
   and its Singleton Seafood and Meridian Seafood to Singleton Fisheries. It sold its specialty and imported cheese operation Swissrose International to investment company, Fairmount Food Group. Late in 2006, the company sold its oat-milling business to investment companies Sequel Holdings and Falcon Investment Advisors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to its Lamb Weston branded potato products with the 2008 acquisition of Watts Brothers. With operations in Washington and Oregon, Watts is a vegetable-processing company that has annual sales of some $100 million. It has retail, foodservice, and industrial customers throughout the US, as well as in Mexico, Japan, China, and other Far East countries. The deal also included Watts' organic dairy, fertilizer, cold storage, packaging, and agricultural farming businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2007 salmonella was found in some of the company's Peter Pan and Great Value (a
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   product) brands of peanut butter, forcing a nationwide recall of the peanut butter bearing the product code involved. Salmonella food poisoning was linked to some 600 people in 47 states. No deaths related to the peanut better were confirmed. The recall eventually included products made as far back as October 2004. ConAgra shut down the Sylvester, Georgia, plant that was involved in the outbreak and reopened it in Auguts 2007, having spent $15 million on renovation, which included repairing the roof, installing new equipment, and creating a manufacturing process that better separated raw materials from the finished peanut butter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just two months later, the company voluntarily stopped production at the Missouri plant that makes its Banquet and generic brands of frozen turkey and chicken pot pies after learning that the were linked to some 140 cases of salmonella in 30 states. ConAgra did not recall the pies but offered mail-in refunds and store returns. The
   <company id="129948">
    USDA
   </company>
   began an investigation and advised consumers not to eat the pies.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to add to its brand-name offerings, in 2007 ConAgra acquired
   <company id="113742">
    Alexia Foods
   </company>
   , a maker of natural frozen potatoes, appetizers, and artisan breads for about $50 million in cash. Later that year the company paid a penalty of $45 million in the wake of
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   charges that alleged the company had misreported its profits for the fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="46584">
    Lincoln Snacks Company
   </company>
   in 2007. Lincoln's  well-known brands, such as Fiddle Faddle and Poppycock, extended ConAgra's name-brand lineup, which is in line with company strategy. That year it also announced the removal of the chemicals from its microwave popcorn products that are suspected of causing lung ailments in popcorn-plant workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   ConAgra sold its trading and merchandising operations (ConAgra Trade Group) in 2008 to a group of investors that included the Ospraie Special Opportunities Fund for $2.8 billion. The sale was part of the company's long-term strategy to exit the commodities business and concentrate on its consumer food products. Saying it couldn't give the brand the attention it needs, in 2008 the company sold its Knott's Berry Farm jam and jelly business to
   <company id="10811">
    J. M. Smucker
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In a tragedy that made the evening news, three ConAgra workers were killed and some 40 were injured in an explosion and fire at a company Slim Jim manufacturing plant in Garner, North Carolina, in June 2009. It was later determined that the blast was caused by a natural-gas leak. ConAgra partnered with the
   <company id="40484">
    United Way
   </company>
   , forming the Garner Plant Fund that raised money to assist the victims and their families. The company also continued to pay workers salaries while the plant remained closed for investigation. ConAgra was fined $106,000 by the government in 2010 and the plant was eventually closed.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2010 ConAgra unloaded its Gilroy Foods &amp; Flavors business-to-business unit to
   <company id="155940">
    Olam International
   </company>
   for $250 million. The sale excluded Gilroy's seasonings and flavors businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 ConAgra Foods made an unsolicited takeover bid to buy
   <company id="41956">
    Ralcorp Holdings
   </company>
   , a leading maker of private-label snack foods, cereals, and condiments. After proffering an initial bid of $82 per share, ConAgra ultimately offered $94 (valuing Ralcorp at more than $5 billion). However, Ralcorp spurned all bids, saying they were not in the best interests of shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2012 the company completed the acquisition of Odom's Tennessee Pride, the #2 producer of frozen breakfast sandwiches in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2013 ConAgra completed its $6.8 billion purchase of Ralcorp Holdings. That September it purchased the frozen dessert producer business of Harlan Bakeries, which made frozen fruit pies, cream pies, pastry shells, and loaf cakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2013 ConAgra acquired Ralcorp, the nation's #1 maker of private-label food, in a deal valued at about $6.8 billion (including debt). The combined company was expected to generate $18 billion in sales, and made ConAgra the largest private-brand packaged foods business in North America, with annual private brand sales of about $4.5 billion a year. The private brands segment makes private-label ready-to-eat cereals, cereal bars, snack mixes, cookies, crackers, and other products for retailers under their own brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 ConAgra separated from Lamb Weston Holdings, which consisted of frozen potato and vegetable products and related licensed and private-label brands. ConAgra Food changed its name to Conagra Brands and continued operating its Consumer Foods and Foodservice businesses.
