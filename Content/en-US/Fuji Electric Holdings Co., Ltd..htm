   Turbines, refrigerators, and power modules may not be flashy, but modern society depends on them. Fuji Electric provides these through its three main segments: Energy &amp; Electric Systems, Electronic Devices, and Retail Systems. Its Energy &amp; Electric Systems segment makes components and instruments used in automation, electric power, industrial plant, and facility construction applications. The unit also makes power semiconductors, sensors, and photoconductive drums. Its Electronic Devices group makes magnetic disks. The Retail Systems group makes vending machines, currency handling devices, and refrigerated display cases. Other Fuji Electric operations include insurance, travel, and real estate.

  <p>
   Fuji Electric Co. was founded by the Furukawa financial combine in 1923 to facilitate technology transfer with Germany's
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   . Early products included electric motors, transformers, and telephones. By the late 1930s the company had added electric fans, mercury-arc rectifiers, porcelain-clad circuit breakers, watt-hour meters, and industrial measuring equipment to its product line. (Fuji Electric's telephone division was incorporated as
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu, Ltd.
   </company>
   in 1935.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Like the rest of Japan's industrial base, Fuji Electric was enlisted to make war-related products during WWII. When the war ended, the company -- and its heavily-bombed factories -- were put under government custody. Back on its proverbial feet in the 1950s, Fuji Electric's new products included selenium rectifiers, static frequency converters, and, in 1959, silicon diodes. Fuji Electric also helped build Japan's first nuclear power plant, which opened in 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Fuji Electric continued to build small components, but added bigger equipment such as large transformers and propulsion equipment to its product list. The company also consolidated its research efforts, establishing Central Research Laboratory (Fuji Electric Corporate Research and Development Ltd.) in 1964. Fuji Electric began making vending machines in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   As electronics got more high-tech, so did Fuji Electric. The company began making process computers and selenium photoconductor drums in 1973 and added pattern recognition equipment and photovoltaic cells before the end of the decade. Fuji Electric opened its eighth factory in 1974. The decade's larger-scale operations included the construction of 40-ton crucible-induction furnaces, as well as power turbines and generators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s and 1990s Fuji Electric's turbines and generators got larger and more powerful while its electronic components moved apace with the computer age. In 1984, for example, the company produced 495MW hydroelectric turbines and generators for Canadian customers; nine years later it produced a 600MW thermal power unit for the Noshiro Thermal Power Plant. On a smaller scale, the company began producing chips for auto-focus cameras (1987), 5.25-inch magneto-optical disk drives (1990), inkjet heads (1991), power transistors for use in space (1993), and semiconductor acceleration/deceleration sensors (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji Electric produced its 200 millionth magnetic contactor in 1998. The same year it delivered a geothermal power plant to Hachijo-Jima Geothermal Power Station. While relocating its head office to Gate City Ohsaki, Fuji Electric delivered Japan's largest transformer to the Tachibana Bay Thermal Power Station in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 Fuji Electric signed an agreement to distribute Baan's new iBaan suite of Internet-enabled enterprise software throughout Japan. The same year Fuji Electric,
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="55821">
    MEIDENSHA
   </company>
   announced that they would cooperate and create a joint venture, AE Power Systems Corporation, in the realm of electricity transmission and distribution -- from R&amp;D through services; the following year Fuji Electric announced its intentions to spin off AE Power.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji Electric reorganized in late 2003 in order to give its operating segments more autonomy. At the same time the company officially transitioned to a holding company structure.
