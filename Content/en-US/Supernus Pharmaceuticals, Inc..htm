   Supernus Pharmaceuticals wouldn't mind being a drug-maker superhero of sorts to epileptics. As a specialty pharmaceutical company, Supernus develops treatments for epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders. It has two marketed products for treating epilepsy: Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. In addition, it is developing a number of candidates to treat such ailments as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsive aggression in patients with ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, and dementia. The company utilizes third-party commercial manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for all of its manufacturing.

  <p>
   The company began earning product revenue in 2013 when it launched Oxtellar XR. The 2014 launch of Trokendi led to further gains in revenues. In 2015, revenue increased 18% to $144 million as more prescriptions of its two medications were issued.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income spiked in 2014 but declined 29% to $14 million the following year. This drop was related to increased sales and marketing spend for its two products, as well as higher R&amp;D costs for additional pre-clinical and clinical trials. Additionally, Supernus was hit with tax expenses for the first time in 2015, which further cut into the bottom line. As of the end of 2015, the company had an accumulated deficit of some $144.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has risen sharply over the past couple of years. In 2015 it increased 315% to $32 million due to several factors including changes in accounts payable and an increase in cash provided by accrued sales deductions.
