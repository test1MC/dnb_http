   Rogers lives in a material world, and it is a materials company. The company's specialty materials are used in a variety of electronic and consumer products. Its products include printed circuit board laminates and polyester-based industrial laminates, which are used in wireless communications systems, including hand-held devices, GPS, and direct broadcast TV. Rogers' high-performance foams include urethane and silicone foams used for making vehicle gaskets and seals, communication devices, computers, and footwear insoles. It also makes high-performance elastomer components sold to OEMs in various markets, including ground transportation, office equipment, and consumer industries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A global player, Rogers has operations in the US (Arizona, Connecticut, and Illinois), Europe (Belgium and Germany), and Asia (China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan). In 2013, non-US based customers accounted for 78% of the company's total sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in three segments: High Performance Foams (polyurethane and silicone foam products, sold to fabricators and OEMs); Printed Circuit Materials (circuit board laminate products for high frequency, high performance applications to meet the demands of increasing speed, complexity, and power in analog, digital, and microwave equipment); and Power Electronics Solutions (Curamik Electronics Solutions and Power Distribution Systems). Curamik Electronics Solutions makes direct copper bonded ceramic substrate products used in the design of intelligent power management devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistor modules. Power Distribution Systems makes busbar power distribution products for manufacturers of high power electrical inverter and converter systems for use in mass transit and clean technology applications (such as electric vehicles, solar farms, and wind turbines).
  </p>

  <p>
   Rogers sells through direct channels. It sold its products to 3,000 customers worldwide in 2013. The company's largest customer accounted for 4% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After experiencing a revenue dip in 2012 due to a drop in Curamik Electronics Solutions and Power Distribution Systems' revenues, in fiscal 2013 Rogers' revenues grew by 8% due to the significantly improved performance of the restructured Power Electronics Solutions operating segment (20% up on 2012 as the result of higher sales of technology applications across a number of markets, including hybrid and electric vehicles, solar and wind applications, and industrial motor drives). The Printed Circuit Materials segment was up by 14%. These increases were partially offset by a 6% drop in High Performance Foams net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company's net income dropped by 45% due to higher operating expenses and higher income tax expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company's operating cash inflow increased to $78.01 million (from $40.04 million in 2012) due to a change in working capital as a result of cash generated from accounts payable and other accrued expenses and inventories.

  <p>
   The company focuses on offering advanced, high-tech products at competitive prices in markets around the globe. It also seeks to be close to its customers, marketing its products through direct sales channels in concentrated areas within its three major geographic regions. Rogers pursues growth organically by expanding its product line and market share, as well as growth through acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its current strategy for growth focuses on developing high-tech products for industries involved in the Internet, mass transit, and clean technology. The growth of mobile devices, for example, has driven sales of one of the company's latest product brand lines, its PORON molded components. In addition to being used in mobile devices such as iPADs and iPhones, the shock-absorbing material is also used in sports apparel to protect athletes from crashes. The company's busbar products are used primarily in power distribution systems for mass transit and clean technology. It manufactures these components under the RO-LINX brand name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the Advanced Circuit Materials Division launched ROG Mobile, a free mobile app for Apple and Android devices. The new app allows users to access Rogers' calculators, literature, technical papers and the ability to order samples. That unit launched COOLSPAN Thermally &amp; Electrically Conductive Adhesive Film, a thermosetting, epoxy based, silver filled adhesive film used to bond circuit boards to heavy metal backplanes, heat sink coins and RF module housings.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of company's long-term strategy, in 2014, Rogers and Northeastern University established the Rogers Innovation Center at Northeastern's George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security in Burlington, Massachusetts. The center conducts complementary research and development initiatives in advanced materials with a focus on early stage technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To improve operational efficiency, in 2013 the management of the Curamik Electronic Solutions and Power Distribution Systems operations were combined under one segment (Power Electronics Solutions) and the former operating segments became product lines.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company agreed to acquire Arlon, LLC, from
   <company id="11631">
    Handy &amp; Harman Ltd.
   </company>
   for $157 million. The deal adds Arlon's complementary capabilities and technologies in circuit materials and engineered silicones.

  <p>
   In Asia it formed a strategic alliance with Hitachi Chemical in 2011 to provide high-speed digital printed circuit materials. The materials produced help meet the growing demand for increased speed in Internet data and video transmission.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Rogers acquired Curamik Electronics, a manufacturer of power electronic substrate products in Eschenbach, Germany, for $153 million. Curamik Electronics is a global leader for the development of direct copper bonded ceramic substrate products, which are used in industrial motor drives, wind and solar energy converters, and hybrid electric vehicle drive systems. The acquisition enhanced Rogers' existing power electronic products portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2011 Rogers ceased operations at its underperforming Thermal Management Solutions segment after failing to gain traction in the market and having problems with the manufacturing process. With the acquisition of Curamik Electronics in 2011, Rogers restructured its business segments to add Power Electronics Solutions as one of its three core strategic units, along with High Performance Foams and Printed Circuit Materials. Curamik Electronic Solutions and Power Distribution Systems comprise the Power Electronics Solutions business segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rogers was founded in 1832 as a materials manufacturer for the textile industry by Peter Rogers.
