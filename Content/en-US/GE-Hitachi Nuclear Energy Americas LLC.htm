   GEH makes and supplies steam turbines, refurbished parts, and plant performance software; and instrumentation, such as in-core and ex-core sensors, gamma thermometers, probes, and radiation monitors. It also provides services to the operators of boiling water rector nuclear power plants to improve reactor performance and power output.

   The company will aims to extend its products and services across research, design, manufacturing, construction, and maintenance in the fields of light water reactors, fast reactors, and the nuclear fuel cycle.

  <p>
   In 2014 GEH won a contract from Kernkraftwerk Leibstadt AG to provide 40 GEH Ultra Control Rod Blades for the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. That year it was also awarded a 4-year integrated outage contract for Entergy's entire fleet of BWR nuclear energy facilities. In addition, the agreement extends a nuclear fuel services contract for six Exelon reactors. The contracts totaled about $300 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is looking toward China, India, and other emerging industrial nations for new projects.

   . Parent company GE is a member of the nine-member consortium NuStart Energy Development. NuStart was one of three consortia that responded to a solicitation from the

   (DOE) to test the

   's streamlined process for obtaining a combined construction and operating license (COL) for new nuclear plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   GEH is also addressing one of the more troublesome issues facing the nuclear power industry: what to do with the spent nuclear fuel. The company is developing Power Reactor Innovative Small Module (PRISM), a reactor that would use recycled spent nuclear fuel instead of creating new fuel.
