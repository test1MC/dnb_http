   Evonik Industries believes that life is better when there is good chemistry. The company primarily produces specialty chemicals for applications in the consumer goods, animal nutrition and healthcare sectors; inorganic materials and coatings and additives; and polymer materials and advanced intermediates. Its product include polymers, plastic additives, photovoltaics, and lithium-ion batteries. About 80% of Evonik's sales come from chemical products in which it holds market-leading positions. Evonik was formed when former parent company
   <company id="92224">
    RAG AG
   </company>
   spun off its non-mining interests. A government-owned offshoot of that firm, the RAG Foundation, owns 75% of Evonik;
   <company id="60139">
    CVC Capital Partners
   </company>
   holds the rest.

  <p>
   Evonik has operations in more than 100 countries.

   Evonik operates in three segments: Consumer, Health &amp; Nutrition (specialty chemicals, principally for applications in the consumer goods, animal nutrition and healthcare sectors); Resource Efficiency (inorganic materials and coatings and additives); and Specialty Materials (polymer materials and advanced intermediates, mainly for the rubber and plastics industries).

  <p>
   In 2013 Evonik posted a 4% decline in revenues due to an organic decline of 1%, and a 2% drop due to other effects (primarily the deconsolidation of the colorants business and the cyanuric chloride business in China, both divested in 2012). Adverse currency effects accounted for a further 1% drop.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income increased by 76% in 2013 due to higher income from discontinued operations.

  <p>
   Evonik is looking to strengthen its leading market positions and develop attractive growth businesses and expand in emerging markets. It is also pursuing growth through acquisitions and innovations while controlling costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Evonik opened its expanded production plant for precipitated silica in Rayong, Thailand and announced plans to build a new plant for its polymethacrylimide structural foam product in Shanghai, China. That year it also announced an expansion of its specialty silica capacities in Ako, Japan through its 51% holding in DSL Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the distribution front, in 2014 Evonik was appointed by Shell MDS (Malaysia) as the new distribution partner for Gas-to-Liquid Hardwaxes (GTL Hardwaxes) for Southern Asian, Middle East and North African countries. That year, Evonik Corporation's Inorganic Materials Business Unit signed new agreements with The Cary Company and Dorsett &amp; Jackson, to broaden the distribution of its silica products in the US Midwest and Western regions, respectively.

  <p>
   In early 2017 the company bought a specialized unit of US-based
   <company id="10042">
    Air Products and Chemicals
   </company>
   for $3.8 billion. In 2016 it agreed to purchase the silica business of
   <company id="40244">
    J.M. Huber
   </company>
   for $630 million
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The RAG Foundation planned an IPO for Evonik in 2011, but decided to postpone the launch until 2012 because of uncertainty in financial markets. A dip in the blue-chip DAX index has delayed other IPOs, but Evonik's listing was expected to be one of Germany's largest. The company could raise as much as $ 6.3 billion for its owners. However, in 2012 the company postponed its IPO plans again because of uncertainty in the markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Evonik divested 51% of its STEAG unit to a consortium of municipal utilities in Germany's Rhine-Ruhr region. The $900 million deal included an option for the consortium to acquire up to 100% of the shares by 2014. The company put STEAG on the chopping block in 2010 in a move to focus on
   <company id="91102">
    Degussa
   </company>
   , its specialty chemicals unit. STEAG operates power generation plants in Germany, as well as in Colombia, the Philippines, and Turkey.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its chemicals portfolio, the company decided to divest businesses that may have limited growth potential. Subsequently, Evonik exited the carbon blacks business in 2011, which generated more than $1.3 billion the previous year. The company has set a goal of achieving $650 million in cost savings each year, starting in 2012, and has started implementing measures to meet that goal. The company also divested the colorants operations of its Coatings and Additives unit in 2012, selling it to US-based private equity firm Arsenal Capital Partners, for an undisclosed price.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Evonik acquired the hanse chemie Group, a Hamburg-based firm that produces components and raw materials for sealants and adhesives, moldings, and casting compounds. Its products are used in the construction industry, automotive manufacturing, dental technology, wind-power, and photovoltaic plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year the company acquired the pharmaceuticals business (the polymer and formulation services) of US-based SurModics, which will widen Evonik's presence in North America. SurModics Pharmaceuticals, which was an affiliate of SurModics, Inc., develops injectable drug delivery systems. The acquisition further expands Evonik's Pharma Polymers business and its health care operations after its purchase of the Resomer business of
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH
   </company>
   . That deal, completed in March 2011, transferred the entire Resomer product portfolio, including standard and customer-specific polymers for medical applications and pharmaceutical formulations, to Evonik's Pharma Polymers, strengthening that business line.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its global growth strategy based on new technologies for its hydrogen peroxide operations, the company acquired the hydrogen peroxide unit of
   <company id="105062">
    Kemira Chemicals
   </company>
   Canada. The acquisition complements the company's hydrogen peroxide operations in China and bolsters Evonik's position as one of the leading suppliers of hydrogen peroxide to the North American market. It boosts its capacity for hydrogen peroxide production in North America to more than 200,000 metric tons per year. Evonik also operates hydrogen peroxide sites in Alberta, Canada, and in Alabama in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company made a couple of small acquisitions. Evonik bought the metals catalysts business of
   <company id="126397">
    H.C. Starck
   </company>
   , which serves the pharmaceutical, building materials, and automotive sectors. That year it acquired the UK company Membrane Extraction Technology Ltd., and Methacrylate Specialty Esters from Arkema, both of which will slot into Evonik's high performance polymers unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also been integrating the operations of its 2010 acquisition in the US, Tippecanoe Laboratories, with those of its global synthesis operations. The Indiana company produces active ingredients and intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its global growth strategy, in 2010 the company began operating a production plant at full capacity for high-quality polymers and coating systems in Shanghai in a project it calls MATCH (methacrylates to China).
  </p>
  <p>
   Evonik subsidiary SFW Energia bought a mine gas cogeneration plant in the Upper Silesia region of Poland in 2010. The acquisition of the plant, which produces 40 MW of thermal power and 5 MW of electricity, will bolster Evonik's position in the renewable energy market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Evonik was founded in 2007.
