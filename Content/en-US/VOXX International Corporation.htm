   VOXX International Corporation (formerly Audiovox) works to be the one-stop-shop for electronics. It sells consumer electronics for communications, mobile, and home use and acts as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for car makers. Its products include automotive security devices, digital picture frames, HD TV antennae, stereo and speaker systems, portable DVD players, two-way radios, and universal remotes. They are marketed under such names as Acoustic Research, Advent, Audiovox, Code-Alarm, Energizer, Invision, Jensen, Mac Audio, Schwaiger, and Terk. VOXX's distribution network comprises retailers, distributors, car dealers, and other OEMs. Founded by John Shalam in 1960, VOXX went public in 1987.

  <p>
   VOXX generates half of its revenue from the automotive market. The rest of the company's revenue -- in equal portions -- comes from premium auto and consumer accessories.

   VOXX markets its products to a variety of customers, including regional chain stores, mass merchants, power retailers, specialty and Internet retailers, new car dealers, distributors, the US military, cinema operators, and vehicle equipment manufacturers. VOXX's five largest customers generated some 29% of its 2014 sales and 28% in 2013. Its OEM customers, which include

  <p>
   In 2014 VOXX posted $12.1 million in advertising expenses, up from $9.5 million in 2013 and 2012's $7.8 million.

  <p>
   As an electronics maker and OEM, VOXX relies on consumer spending and vehicle sales. The US, which represents its largest market, has struggled in recent years with stalled car sales and concerned consumers. While revenues have improved slightly, VOXX's top line took a hit, spurring the company to exit the unprofitable and competitive LCD flat-panel TV and portable GPS markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, VOXX is investing heavily in research and development, significantly increasing these expenditures from $400,000 in 2012 to $15.9 million in 2013 and $21.3 million in 2014. The move has enabled VOXX to build a pipeline of new products across all three of its business lines. As part of this focus, VOXX in 2014 invested $3 million in EyeLock, which specializes in iris-based identity authentication, to leverage the firm's North American and European distribution channels and its myris line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company uses contract manufacturers in Asia, which enables VOXX to respond quickly to changes in technology and tastes, as well as keep costs low.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also partners with others to boost revenue. In 2014 VOXX and Steelmate Automotive entered an exclusive distribution agreement through which Steelmate supplies VOXX Electronics items alongside the company's full line of collision avoidance and advanced automotive accessories.

  <p>
   Aiming to rev up its revenue, VOXX has focused on expanding its products portfolio. To that end, it acquired Germany's Car Communication Holding, a maker and supplier of Hirschmann-brand in-car communications and entertainment systems, for â‚¬85 million ($112 million) in 2012. Its customers include Audi, BMW, and Volkswagen, among others. Hirschmann became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VOXX. Previously, VOXX bought high-end audio gear maker
   <company id="136040">
    Klipsch Group
   </company>
   for $166 million in 2011. Klipsch is renowned for its branded speakers, sound systems, headphones, and other audio equipment. Klipsch is now a subsidiary of VOXX and operates as a stand-alone entity headquartered in Indiana.

  <p>
   VOXX revenue fell 3% in fiscal 2014 (ended February) to $809.7 million from 2013. The company attributes the drop to an 8% decline in its consumer accessories revenue along with a 2% decrease in premium auto revenues and 1% slip in automotive revenue. VOXX suffered a net income loss of $26.6 million during the reporting period due to $57.6 million in impairment charges and $1.3 million in restructuring expenses. Rising operating expenses didn't help VOXX post positive net income gains. Cash flow from operations rose $41.3 million in 2014 to $66.8 million.

  <p>
   Egyptian-born John Shalam founded Custom Imports in 1960 to import Japanese goods into the US. After quickly selling out of car radios in 1965, Shalam refocused and renamed the company Audiovox. Depending solely on car stereos caused a loss in 1982, so Audiovox diversified into auto alarm systems, rust-proofing chemicals, radar detectors, cruise controls, and car phones. Between 1983 and 1987 (the year Audiovox went public) cellular phones rose to 43% of the company's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Audiovox closed two-thirds of its retail outlets in response to competitive pressure. The next year the company established a new subsidiary, Audiovox Communications, to deal exclusively with cellular phones and accessories. In 1997 Audiovox formed a joint venture with ASA Electronics to market audio, security, and video systems to the automotive and aviation industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instability in Asia led the company to withdraw from a planned distribution joint venture with Namsung (Korea) in 1998. Late that year it struck a deal with
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan
   </company>
   to provide entertainment systems (including TV, VCR, and video game jacks) for Quest minivans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Audiovox introduced its first Internet-related products in 1999: MP3 players and recorders and a Web-browsing phone. The next year it marketed different cellular handsets for all three wireless technologies (TDMA, GSM, and CDMA), leading North America in CDMA sales. In 2001 Audiovox and Toshiba began developing a personal digital assistant (PDA) combined with a cell phone for cellular carriers
   <company id="126039">
    Verizon Wireless
   </company>
   and
   <company id="52181">
    Sprint PCS
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2003 Audiovox acquired the audio operations of
   <company id="14549">
    Recoton
   </company>
   , including its Jensen, Advent, and Acoustic Research brands, as well as Recoton German Holdings GmbH, for about $40 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Audiovox sold a controlling interest in its wireless subsidiary, Audiovox Communications, to Curitel Communications in late 2004. Later that year, the company decided that it could not compete with larger cell phone manufacturers and exited the handset business entirely when it sold its wireless business to handset maker
   <company id="59791">
    UTStarcom
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2005 Audiovox appointed Patrick Lavelle as president and CEO of the company; Shalam remained as chairman of the board.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2007 the company's German subsidiary, Audiovox German Holdings, acquired OEHLBACH Kabel, for about $6.6 million. OEHLBACH makes accessories, primarily cables, for the consumer electronics industry. Later that year Audiovox bought certain assets of UK-based Incaar, which produces rear seat entertainment systems for the likes of
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   , to strengthen its European operations. It also acquired Technuity for its expertise in battery and power products. The deal made Audiovox the exclusive licensee of the Energizer brand in North America -- for rechargeable batteries and battery packs to be used with camcorders, digital cameras, DVD players, cordless phones, and other power supply devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2011 Audiovox acquired high-end audio gear maker Klipsch Group for $166 million. Klipsch is best known for its branded speakers, sound systems, headphones, and other audio equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because the company is known for more than just its Audiovox brand, the company changed its name to VOXX International Corporation in late 2011.
