  <p>
   The company was founded in 1924 by the Warehime family. Brothers John and Michael Warehime waged a protracted battled over Hanover's voting shares starting in 1994 when John, the company's largest shareholder, replaced family members with independent board directors and created a special stockholder class giving himself, his children, and the independent directors voting control of the company. Michael filed lawsuits contending that the majority of Hanover's common stockholders had no say in corporate decisions; however, a 2004 court decision ruled in favor of John. Following the court decision, John initiated a share offer to take the company private to avoid costs related to conforming to the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance law and Hanover took itself private in 2005.
