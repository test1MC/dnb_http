   This company's erotic wilderness is pleasing to some, but others might think New Frontier Media crosses the boundaries of good taste. The firm is an operator of adult entertainment pay-per-view (PPV) and video-on-demand (VOD) channels available to both cable and satellite subscribers. Its PPV and VOD services reach millions of network homes in the US, and many more millions of network homes internationally. New Frontier also produces and distributes original films and videos through its Film Production segment. In addition, the company generates revenue from its Direct-to-Consumer segment, which distributes content through its consumer websites.

   In 2012 Larry Flynt announced plans to acquire the company for some $33 million through the broadcasting arm of his company,

    LFP
   </company>
   . LFP's holdings include adult-entertainment television stations, magazines, websites, and nightclubs, as well as a casino outside Los Angeles. The deal will strengthen New Frontier's portfolio of media assets.

   New Frontier's pay TV operations (called Transactional TV) account for the majority of the company's revenue. Its leading customers include cable operator

   The company expanded into film production through the 2006 acquisition of MRG Entertainment for about $20 million. The purchase launched New Frontier into new territory by adding mainstream film titles to its content portfolio. Founded in 1997 by Marc Greenberg and Rich Goldberg, MRG has distributed several family dramas and thrillers, as well as such kids movies as
   <em>
    Big Brother Trouble
   </em>
   . It also produces films for third-party distributors on a contract basis.
