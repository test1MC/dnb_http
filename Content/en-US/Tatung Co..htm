   Tatung is a major home appliance manufacturer in Taiwan, but that's not the company's bread and butter. Tatung makes a number of electronics through four divisions -- digital consumer products (LCD monitors, DVD players), home appliances (air conditioners, refrigerators, medical devices), motors, and energy items (solar panels, fiber optic cable, copper wire, transformers). The digital consumer products business represent about half of its sales, and the company is focused on growing its renewable energy business through investing in subsidiaries. Its system integration division offers IT consulting. Tatung also sells its products (and competitors') through a chain of about 240 Tatung 3C stores in Taiwan.

   Shan-Chih Lin founded a construction company, the Shan-Chih Business Association, in 1918. Projects during its 30-year lifespan included the Taiwanese government's Building of the Executive Yuan, which houses the country's ministry offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered heavy industry in 1946 when it began repairing railway cars. It diversified into electric products in 1949 with fans, which it started exporting five years later. In 1950 the company changed its name to Tatung ("great harmony").
  </p>
  <p>
   Because he believed strongly in the importance of education, when Lin retired in 1942, he donated 80% of his assets to the Hsieh-Chih Association for the Development of Industry, which went on to administer scholarships, awards, the Tatung Institute of Technology, and the Hsieh-Chih Industrial Publishing Company. The philanthropist's bequest established the Tatung Schools-Company, made up of the Institute of Technology and Tatung High School. This education-industry cooperative provides hands-on training in Tatung factories and offices. The Institute of Technology was founded in 1956.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Tatung expanded further into home appliances and electronics, adding refrigerators (1961), air conditioners (1964), and televisions (1964) to its product line. Taiwan Telecommunication was formed in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lin died in 1971. In 1972 Lin's grandson, Lin Weishan (W. S.) was named president; he began expanding Tatung's operations overseas. Tatung established US subsidiary
   <company id="109761">
    Tatung Co. of America
   </company>
   that year, initially to make electric fans. In 1973 Tatung formed a joint venture with Japanese computer maker Fujitsu. Tatung would go on that decade to establish offices in Japan (1975) and Korea (1979).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's joint venture with
   <company id="56332">
    Otis Elevator
   </company>
   formed in 1983. Tatung continued to expand overseas during the 1980s, establishing subsidiaries in the UK (1981) and Germany (1985). During that period the company moved production overseas, shipping the finished goods back to Taiwan as imports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tatung's profits slipped in the early 1990s as Taiwan's economy slowed, but the company rebounded, signing a deal with Packard Bell (folded into NEC) in 1991 to supply the computer marketer with 100,000 PCs a month. In 1994 the company formed an alliance with telecommunications company QUALCOMM to develop cellular phone systems for Taiwan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year subsidiary Chunghwa Picture Tubes began making large picture tubes for Toshiba. Tatung started making computer motherboards in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep pace with Internet use, the company in 1997 introduced an Internet access set-top box. Sales were down that fiscal year as a result of the Asian economic crisis and falling cathode-ray tube prices. In 1998 Tatung unveiled a DVD player and its PC Cinema, a PC combining TV, computer, and telephone functions with Internet access.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Chunghwa Picture Tubes opened Taiwan's first factory to build thin-film transistor LCDs. The subsidiary's chairman was indicted later that year for allegedly investing foreign capital to manipulate parent Tatung's stock (Chunghwa itself went public on the Taipei exchange in 2001). In 2000 Tatung spun off its information and communications department as a separate company, Tatung System Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tatung jumped on the mobile computing bandwagon in 2001, introducing a tablet PC. Bucking the downsizing trend in the electronics industry, the company expanded its production capacity in China and Europe the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Tatung System Technologies won the build-operate-transfer contract for the National Taiwan Science Education Center. The next year saw new operating units. Tatung established SeQual Technologies (oxygen generators for therapeutic and home health care uses), Tatung Compressors (Zhongshan) of China, and Toes Opto-Mechatronics. In 2005 it set up another Chinese subsidiary, Tatung Wire &amp; Cable Technology (Wujiang) and combined its desktop PC business unit with
   <company id="149863">
    Elitegroup Computer Systems
   </company>
   (ECS), becoming the largest shareholder in ECS.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lin Weishan (W. S.) has been chairman of Tatung since 2006. In 2007 the company closed its plant in Panchiao, Taiwan, and shifted its production to  China and Vietnam. Tatung relocated production of home appliances from Panchiao to Vietnam, and of compressors to China.
