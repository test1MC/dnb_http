   Encision enables doctors to make the cut during surgery. The company makes instruments for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures, including electrodes, graspers, monitors, and scissor inserts. Encision's products, sold under the brand name AEM Surgical Instruments, work like conventional electrosurgical instruments but incorporate proprietary technology that reduces the risk of accidental damage to surrounding tissues caused by stray electrosurgical energy. The company has been working to expand its marketing and distribution network, using independent distributors and sales representatives, as well as agreements with group purchasing organizations such as

   and
   <company id="99294">
    Premier

   Encision's revenue dropped nearly 10% in 2013 as a strategic partner discontinued a design and development agreement (reported as service revenue). Net loss increased by 16% due to reduced service revenue and an increase in other expenses. Cash flow followed suit, dropping $883 million as cash from financing activities fell. As of 2013 the company was operating at a $17 million deficit.

   As the company works to continually expand its product line, it invests heavily in R&amp;D. At $1.8 million, the company's R&amp;D spend is about 15% of its annual revenue. Encision has also been working to expand its distribution network and commercialization of its products internationally. It has also signed an agreement to exclusively distribute laparoscopic organ retraction products from Virtual Ports.
