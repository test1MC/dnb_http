   K-tel International practically invented the commercial mix. The company produces and markets prerecorded albums (primarily compilations such as "Masters of Metal" and "Sound Explosion") that it creates with music from the approximately 6,000 titles in its catalog. K-tel sells its CDs and DVDs to wholesalers, retail stores, and and mass merchandisers; it also licenses music to other companies for a variety of uses, including soundtracks and TV commercials. In addition, K-tel distributes its music digitally through companies such as

    Napster
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12644">
    Apple's
   </company>
   iTunes. The "K" in K-tel International stands for chairman and CEO Philip Kives, who founded the company in the late 1960s.

   Philip Kives and his brother Ted founded Syndicate Product Lines in 1962. Early products included the oft-imitated Veg-O-Matic food slicer. In 1965, after Philip saw a country-and-western album advertised on TV, he cut a deal with the record's advertisers to sell the album in Canada. K-tel (short for Kives Television) started in the US in 1968. The next year it released a collection of polka classics that sold over a million copies. The record was followed by such hits as
   <i>
    Hooked on Classics,
   </i>
   which the company marketed primarily through late-night TV ads.

   K-tel went public in 1971. It filed for bankruptcy in 1984 after unprofitable ventures into oil exploration and shopping center development. Management then refocused the company on product marketing. The European recession in the early 1990s led to cutbacks of K-tel's overseas operations.

   In 1997 Platinum Entertainment agreed to buy K-tel's worldwide music business assets (excluding those in Europe), but the deal fell through. In 1998 K-tel launched an online music store offering 250,000 titles. The announcement of this venture caused K-Tel stock to increase tenfold, during which time Philip Kives sold about 2.6 million shares of his stock. Shares subsequently plummeted when K-Tel revealed it had been warned by Nasdaq that it might be delisted. A rash of stockholder lawsuits followed.

   K-tel entered the DVD market in 2000. Also that year the struggling company was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange and began outsourcing most of its e-commerce sales to Amazon.com.

   In 2001 it closed down its UK-based consumer products subsidiary. Also that year the company shuttered its U.S. music distribution subsidiary as well as its Web site. In 2002 it redeveloped the site to support sales of compilations and newly-developed CD and DVD products.
