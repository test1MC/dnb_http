   UK-listed R.E.A. Holdings holds palm oil profits in the palm of its hand. The company cultivates oil palms for the production of crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil in the province of East Kalimantan in Indonesia. The company owns about 71,000 hectares of land (roughly 175,000 acres), of which about 40% is in productive at any given time. The agricultural unit generates the bulk of R.E.A.'s sales and profits, but it also mines coal and stone from two concessions. R.E.A. generates all its sales in Indonesia.

  <p>
   R.E.A has two operations: the cultivation of oil palms and stone and coal mining. It produces crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil. The group also generates renewable energy through an ancillary methane operation, which powers the company's own operation and is sold to local villages as well.

  <p>
   In 2015, sales fell by 28% on prior year to $90.5 million, largely due to crude palm oil prices down around a quarter on 2014. R.E.A. recorded a net loss of $3.9 million due to a fall in sales, partially offset by a gain on changes in fair value of biological assets. Cash from operating activities fell $4.3 million on prior year to $20 million.
