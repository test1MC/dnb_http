   Not content with providing communication, KVH is intent on providing content to transmit through its products. Carriers throughout the telecommunications landscape (and seascape) are making similar moves to provide more than the communications infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   KVH began its content delivery service, IP-MobileCast in 2014. Using multicast technology content and data files are transmitted to vessels and vehicles equipped with TracPhone V series of V-IP series terminal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also began transmitting educational content for the maritime industry through its Videotel acquisition. Content includes certification and refresher courses required by international regulations. By the end of 2014, more than 100 million training hours of Videotel content had been delivered to more than 250,000 registered crew members.
  </p>
  <p>
   Examples of content delivered included safety training on the Ebola virus for crew members and the broadcast to ships at sea of the 2014 World Cup final.

   In mid-2013 KVH bought Headland Media Limited, a UK-based media and entertainment services company. Headland Media provides commercially licensed news, sports, movies, and music content sold to the maritime, hotel, and retail markets. The acquisition supports KVH's strategic vision of extending its maritime broadband service to include additional content.
