  <p>
   In 1946 engineer Pierre Burelle, taking experience gained working for Carbone Lorraine and Saint Gobain, created Plastic Omnium (Burelle's main subsidiary) on a whim that the auto industry would take interest in plastic exterior parts. At the time, plastic auto parts were considered inferior to the traditionally used wood and metal materials. Renault quickly warmed up to the idea of using plastic components and added Plastic Omnium to its list of suppliers.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s Burelle's Plastic Omnium had added Ford and Peugeot to its list of auto industry customers, and it was also making other plastic products such as hair brushes, lipstick cases, pacifiers, and toys. Its auto components included armrests, horn and headlight controls, speedometer needles, and steering column housings .
  </p>
  <p>
   With its headquarters in Levallois-Perret, the company moved its auto parts operations to a larger plant in Langres in 1963, which allowed Burelle to produce bigger components such as instrument panels and radiator grills. Two years later, looking to decrease its dependency on the auto industry, Burelle purchased Union Mutelle des Proprietaires Lyonnais, the municipal waste-bin business of Pierre's grandfather. Soon Burelle began providing plastic waste bins for municipalities in exchange for per-household rental fees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further diversification in 1968 brought the creation of Burelle's fluororesin products business. The company also began making Teflon products for the chemical and electronics industries. The business would later become Plastic Omnium's 3P subsidiary (Performance Plastic Products). Also in 1968, 3P built a plant in Spain and continued its geographic expansion with additional facilities in Germany (1972), the UK (1973), the US (1977), and Italy (1989). Burelle's auto business also expanded internationally with the opening of a plant in Spain in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   Burelle began producing playground equipment for its municipal customers in the 1980s. In addition, it expanded its auto business product line to include such parts as blow-molded tanks, fenders, front-ends, and fuel systems. In 1987 Burelle became a publicly traded company.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s Burelle organized its m√©lange of operations (the company had acquired some 30 businesses between 1986 and 1996). In 1991 Burelle created its Signature subsidiary to consolidate its road sign and traffic-management operations. The following year it formed Plastic Omnium Medical, a plastic medical products subsidiary that had formerly been a division, and in 1996 transformed its playground equipment division into subsidiary Ludoparc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its hostile takeover of Reydel Industries in 1995 and 1996, Burelle strengthened its interior auto parts product line and added Fiat and Nissan to its customer list. However, in 1999 the company sold its entire interior auto component division to Visteon to concentrate on its exterior components and fuel systems divisions. The following year Burelle created Inergy Automotive Systems, a joint venture between Plastic Omnium and Solvay, to produce automotive fuel systems. Inergy Automotive Systems will operate some 30 facilities in 15 countries.
