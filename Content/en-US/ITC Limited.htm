   The start of 2000 saw a more rapid diversification of the group's business. ITC's Packaging &amp; Printing business launched a line of greeting cards in 2000 under the brand name Expressions. The company also entered the apparel business with a line of clothing for men and women sold through the Wills Lifestyle chain of stores, and it spun off its information technology business into a wholly owned subsidiary,

   , to more aggressively pursue the technology sector. ITC Infotech has expanded its operations in recent years, opening a branch office in South Africa in 2009, and it teamed up with TipTop Technologies to launch a search engine under the TipTop name.
