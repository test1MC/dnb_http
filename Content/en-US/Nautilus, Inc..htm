   Nautilus wants to pump you up. The company makes and markets cardio and strength-building fitness equipment for home use. Its products include home gyms, free weights and benches, treadmills, exercise bikes, and elliptical machines that are sold under the popular brand names Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness, and Universal. Nautilus sells its fitness equipment directly to consumers through its variety of brand websites and catalogs, as well as through TV commercials. The company also markets its gear through specialty retailers in the US and Canada. Nautilus exited the commercial fitness category in recent years so that it could focus entirely on providing gear that consumers can use at home.

  <p>
   The company operates its fitness equipment business through a pair of reportable segments. Its Direct segment (64% of revenue) sells products directly to consumers through TV advertising, the Internet, and catalogs. As part of its Retail segment (34%), Nautilus sells products through a network of third-party retailers that operate websites and stores located in the US and internationally.

  <p>
   Nautilus operates in the US and Canada with warehouse and distribution facilities located in Oregon and Ohio in the US, and in  Manitoba in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for about 85% of revenue.

  <p>
   Nautilus sells its products to fitness enthusiasts and to those who want to work out regularly. It sells through two sales channels: direct and retail.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it spent about $42.6 million on advertising and expenses.

  <p>
   Revenue, which has been on a steady upward trajectory for five years, rose 25% to $274 million in 2014 on the strength of new products. But net income, which has fluctuated over the years, was hit by spending on selling and marketing and plummeted 61% to $18.8 million

  <p>
   Mostly because it had been largely unprofitable, Nautilus opted to exit its commercial fitness business to focus on its core consumer fitness segment and the direct marketing model, which have been key to its growth. The deep recession in the US had urged consumers to redirect spending to mostly essential goods and pushed commercial customers to cut back on equipment purchases.
