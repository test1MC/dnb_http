  <p>
   In 2014 Infineum opened a second manufacturing plant in Singapore. The new plant makes calcium salicylate, a critical component in its passenger car and heavy-duty oil formulations, as well as its marine oil additive products. Previously, calcium salicylate was manufactured only by Infineum's UK operations.

   Continuing its expansion in the Asia/Pacific region, that year the company opened a new Business and Technology Center in Jinqiao, Shanghai. In 2014 it also broke ground on a new blending plant at Zhangjiagang, China.

   The joint venture was formed in 1999 by

   and
   <company id="104713">
    Shell Chemicals
   </company>
   . The parent companies attempted to divest Infineum in 2008 but pulled back from the move when offers for the joint venture fell short of their expectations. The bidders were mostly big global private equity firms.
