   Say cheese, and Saputo Cheese USA smiles wide. The company produces and distributes a variety of cheeses for the retail, industrial, and food service markets. Saputo's fresh and aged Italian-style cheeses are sold under several brand names including Gardenia, Stella, and Dragone. Its Frigo line is the nation's #1 brand of string and stick cheese, with its kid-friendly Cheese Head mascots. The company's deli cheeses are sold under the Lorraine label, while blue, feta, gorgonzola, and parmesan varieties are marketed under Treasure Cave name. One of the largest cheese producers in the US, Saputo Cheese USA is a subsidiary of Canada's largest dairy processor

   Based in Illinois, Saputo USA operates its cheese-making business nationwide.

   Saputo USA operates 16 production facilities mostly in Wisconsin and California, but also in South Dakota and Maryland. It supports its business with distribution centers in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and California. In addition to cheeses, the company also makes and sells whey protein concentrate to manufacturers of food products.

  <p>
   While its Canadian parent company doesn't break out sales for Saputo Cheese USA, the US market (which includes both its cheese and diary foods divisions) contributed 49% of Saputo's C$9.2 billion ($8.4 billion) in fiscal 2014 (ended March) sales. Saputo's acquisition of Morningstar Foods in January 2013 (renamed Saputo Dairy Foods USA), contributed to revenue growth. Indeed, the purchase of Morningstar contributed to a 58% increase in sales in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year, as did a $0.15 increase in the average daily base price for cheese.

  <p>
   In its marketing campaigns, the cheese maker leverages its expertise in producing premium products and touts its heritage as a longtime dairy company.

  <p>
   New products are an important avenue for growth. In June 2014, the cheese maker launched seven new items, including Joan of Arc's new goat cheese trio with traditional, tomato basil, and wild honey flavors in a boxed set. Other new products launched in fiscal 2014 (ended March) include line extensions of the company's market leading Frigo  and Treasure Cave brands, including Cheese Heads Premium Snacking Cheeses, Frigo Cheese Heads Cheese &amp; Meat Combos, and Treasure Cave Flavored Blue Cheese. In fiscal 2015 the company is looking to recover lost volumes and continue to gain distribution and market share for its premium lines of snack cheeses and flavored blue cheese offerings.

   The company has extended its footprint to keep up with demand. Its parent has expanded US operations for manufacturing string cheese and its drying facilities for processing whey. Saputo has also invested in a California plant, enabling direct service to West Coast customers. However, in March 2014 the company announced plans to close its plants in New London, Wisconsin, and Hancock, Maryland in a bid to improve operational efficiency. The current production at the two plants will be integrated into other Saputo facilities.

  <p>
   Saputo USA has grown through acquisitions. Saputo took over Fairmount Cheese Holdings, which owns DCI Cheese Company, for $270 million, bringing on board the County Line cheese brand and strengthening its business in the specialty cheese market to retail stores. Its Canadian parent also acquired Italian- and American-style cheese maker Alto Dairy Cooperative, paying $160 million in cash for the Wisconsin-based co-op, which was also integrated into Saputo USA's operations.

   In 2007 Saputo USA purchased the international cheese and protein operations of

   (known as CPI) for about $216 million. The acquisition involved the manufacturing and cut-and-wrap operations of the Golden Valley Dairy Products brand. It also included a supply agreement, such that Land O'Lakes will be the sole milk supplier for CPI.
