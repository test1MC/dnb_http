   It's not "hipp" if your car lacks a wheel cover or has a rusty grille. Lacks Enterprises makes high-impact plated plastic (HIPP) alternatives to die-cast and stainless steel automotive products such as wheel covers and grilles. The company's HIPP parts, plated with copper nickel chrome, are lighter and cheaper than all-metal alternatives, as well as resistant to dents and rust. Other products include molding, rocker panels, and trim. Automotive OEM customers have included

   In addition to Plastic-Plate, Lacks operates Lacks Wheel Trim Systems, which uses the company's technology and electroplating and thermoplastic injection molding processes to make automotive interior and exterior molded, painted, and plated plastic trim and other ornamental components.

   While the company makes plastic trims for the appliance and telecommunications industries, as well as for computer and plumbing applications, the main thrust of Lacks business is in the automotive industry, which is trending toward vehicle designs that are lighter in weight for greater fuel efficiency, but still achieve and exceed safety standards. High-impact injection-molded plastics are being utilized to a greater extent due to their strength, durability, and non-corrosive properties; 20 years ago, approximately 190 lbs. of a car's weight was in plastic, currently the average is 330 lbs. Aluminum is being replaced by nylon, and structural plastics are taking the place of steel beams.

   Like most companies in the manufacturing sector, Lacks expands its manufacturing capacity to balance demand and widen its product output. In 2012 it announced it was building a new $32 million manufacturing plant in West Michigan to meet additional demand.

   Founded in 1961 by John Lacks and his son Richard, the company moved away from metal fabrication to injection molding in the 1970s. Four generations of Lacks have served at the helm of the company.
