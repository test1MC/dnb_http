   Charter International's products join, cleave, and blow. It operates through two leading engineering companies.
   <company id="130215">
    ESAB
   </company>
   makes light- to heavy-duty welding equipment and a range of consumables (electrodes, wire, and fluxes) for joining and cutting metals used in shipbuilding, oil and gas, and auto industries. ESAB's offerings include automation and oxy-fuel cutting machinery, along with welding and cutting services. Charter's Howden subsidiary designs and sells industrial fans, air and gas handling equipment, and compressors for power generation, petrochemical, steel, and mining activities. In early 2012 Charter was acquired by fluid handling products manufacturer
   <company id="58103">
    Colfax
   </company>
   for £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion).
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Charter's flowchart points back to the business empire of Germany's Oppenheimer family. The Oppenheimers wove an intricate web of business holdings and cross-holdings through their company, Anglo American Corporation of South Africa (now
   <company id="41809">
    Anglo American plc
   </company>
   ). Charter Consolidated formed in 1965 when Anglo American merged three of its mining interests: British South Africa, Central Mining &amp; Investment, and Consolidated Mines Selection.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company adopted a new strategy in 1979, when Charter Consolidated opted to emphasize industrial operations rather than mining. In an asset-swapping deal that was part of a rearrangement of the Anglo American group of companies, Charter Consolidated bought a stake in UK precious-metals group
   <company id="90230">
    Johnson Matthey
   </company>
   . In 1981 an Anglo American subsidiary, Minerals and Resources Corp. (Minorco), bought 36% of Charter Consolidated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983 Charter Consolidated bought Scottish mining-equipment maker Anderson Strathclyde (later renamed Anderson Group). The next year's strike by UK coal miners caused an industry downturn. Meanwhile, in 1986 the US voted to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for apartheid. The next year, in a protective move, Minorco set up shop in Luxembourg and took control of all of Anglo American's assets outside Africa (widely considered a measure to evade anti-apartheid sanctions).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hundreds of US workers sued Charter Consolidated's Cape Industries subsidiary in 1987, alleging asbestos-related deaths and health problems. (Cape Industries made building materials, mining and shipping asbestos.) In the early 1990s a number of courts ruled against Cape Industries, to the tune of more than $51 million, but the firm never paid up. It refused to appear in court, thereby invoking a quirky British law -- if domestic companies don't appear in court to defend themselves, British law does not recognize foreign judgments against those companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   After selling its interest in Johnson Matthey in 1993, Charter Consolidated reorganized by buying out Minorco's 36% stake and becoming simply Charter. In 1994 Charter bought Sweden's ESAB (welding products and cutting systems). The purchase included Nederman (acquired by ESAB in 1991), a maker of industrial workplace environmental control systems. Charter sold its remaining natural resources operations in 1995, including the Hargreaves Quarries and Anderson Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charter's profits dropped dramatically in 1996, partly as a result of disposing of its 65% interest in Cape Industries. In 1997 Charter bought Howden Group (air and gas handling equipment). The purchase included Howden Food Equipment, which made can- and jar-filling machines and controlled the US's Demaco Food Equipment unit (pasta-making machinery). In 1998 ESAB bought US firm AlcoTec Wire, and Howden formed a joint venture with
   <company id="99063">
    Carrier
   </company>
   . That year Charter sold Howden's European operations in packaging and processing equipment. Charter also disposed of its railway track maintenance business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold its Wirth drilling-equipment business to a management buyout group. Later in the year Charter relinquished its special engineering division -- which included aerospace and defense and environmental businesses -- to Fountainfrost Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the company agreed to be acquired by Ohio-based arc-welding and cutting machine maker
   <company id="42150">
    Lincoln Electric Holdings
   </company>
   in 2000, the negotiations ultimately stalled and the deal was terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charter brought David Gawler on board the following year as chairman and chief executive to replace the retiring Jeffrey Herbert. Also in 2001 ESAB increased its ownership in Fersab, a Polish joint venture making welding fluxes and flux-cored wire, to 74% from 51%. ESAB also took over full control of another Polish welding supplies JV, Elektrody Baildon, by buying out the 72% interest held by Huta Baildon.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Charter sold property in Hertfordshire and used the £20 million proceeds to reduce debt. The company disposed of other property, in central London and the Netherlands, for the same purpose the following year. Also in 2003 Charter sold its US defense businesses, Howden Airdynamics and Western Design Howden, to
   <company id="90276">
    Meggitt
   </company>
   for nearly £27 million (about $45 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   Charter sold its half-interest in GCE Gas Control Equipment AB to Triton for £14 million in 2004. While the various divestitures continued to whittle down the company's debt, Charter discovered later that year that an employee was apparently embezzling from the group, drawing out unauthorized payments of around £9.2 million. Also in 2004 Charter increased its ownership of its South African cutting and welding JV to 51%, from nearly 42%. In late 2004 the Charter employee suspected of siphoning funds was convicted of theft and sentenced in early 2005 to five years' imprisonment, plus financial restitution. The company's insurer paid £5 million on Charter's claim for the embezzlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charter bought out the other 49% of the South African cutting and welding JV in 2005 for £21 million ($38 million) in cash and stock. The assets of Demaco Food Equipment were sold to DHY Global Partners and the company was renamed Demaco Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2006 the company reached a settlement that brought restitution in the embezzlement case to some £9 million, with Charter on the hook for only its £200,000 fidelity insurance policy deductible. David Gawler stepped down as CEO in mid-2006 and remained chairman. During his five-year tenure as chief executive, Charter reduced its corporate debt by more than £200 million, to £6.5 million at the end of 2005. Michael Foster, who joined Charter at the beginning of 2005 as commercial director, succeeded Gawler as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008 Charter changed its name to Charter International and moved its head office from London to Dublin.
