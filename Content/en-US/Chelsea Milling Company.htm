   Old school is the new cool at Chelsea Milling. The company hasn't significantly changed its Jiffy-brand blue-and-white graphic boxes in more than 50 years. It produces more than 20 flour mixes of cake, muffin, crust, frosting, and other batter-based foods. Mixes are sold in grocery stores, as well as to foodservice and institutional customers nationwide. Vertical integration (the company mills its own grain and stamps its own boxes) and a word-of-mouth advertising practice helps keep prices low. Mabel White Holmes created the first Jiffy mix in 1930, claiming, "The mix is so simple, even a man can do it." The family-owned company is led by her grandson, Howdy Holmes, a former Indy race-car driver.

  <p>
   Based in Chelsea, Michigan, the milling company ships its products to all 50 US states and some foreign countries as part of its partnership with the US military.

   The flour-mix maker helps consumers make brownies, cakes, cookies, corn muffins, crusts, frosting, and muffins, among other items. It produces 18 different varieties of Jiffy Mix.

   The company is working to further expand its presence in its home city. In 2013 it began a $35-million capital project that involves installing several bulk ingredient silos, constructing small buildings, upgrading its flour-transfer systems, and adding a new mixing department. The project focuses at giving Chelsea access to the food service and institutional markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   To maintain its market share and keep customers coming back, the company in 2012 opened a new Research and Development building in Chelsea.
  </p>

   The company has grown through product development and market expansion. To support increasing demand, Chelsea Milling in 2011 invested approximately $3.5 million to build six new grain storage silos, with a combined capacity of 300,000 bushels. The expansion was the first and biggest grain storage project for the maker of Jiffy products since early 1960. More grain storage also enables Chelsea Milling to buy wheat under favorable market prices, such as harvest time, and to manage wheat blending better.

  <p>
   Chelsea Milling serves retail customers are its core customer base. It added two divisions to serve the institutional and foodservice industries. The company offers institutional customers more than a dozen products in 50-pound bags, and foodservice operators, cases containing 12 two-and-a-half-pound boxes. Boxes are considered easier to use in smaller restaurant operations than the industry standard case of six five-pound bags.

   The company also sells its products online.
