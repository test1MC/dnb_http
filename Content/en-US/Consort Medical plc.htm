   Consort Medical delivers medicine through the air you breathe. The company is a global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that makes drug inhalers, anesthesia equipment, ventilator and anesthesia products, and other drug delivery supplies. Its core Bespak division makes metered dose inhalers (MDIs), including dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and injection devices for drug companies. Its other core division, Aesica, is a pharmaceutical CDMO that provides drugmakers with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as well as finished dose formulation development and manufacturing services.

  <p>
   The company operates in the UK and Europe. It sells its products in China, India, Japan, and the Americas.

  <p>
   Consort Medical serves some of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms. Its two largest customers account for 16% and 13% of revenues, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
   Consort Medical's revenues have fluctuated over the past few years. In fiscal 2015 (ended April), revenue increased 85% to £184.8 million as both the Bespak and Aesica segments grew. This growth was largely due to increased sales of the Chiesi NEXThaler and Dr. Reddy's Sumatriptan auto-injector.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, net income fell 62% to £4.9 million in fiscal 2015 as expenses related to raw materials, consumables, and staffing rose. Cash flow from operations fell 12% to £12 million that year.

  <p>
   Consort Medical's growth efforts are focused on diversifying into adjacent markets and technologies. It is growing its franchise in injectables and nasal drug delivery, as well as point-of-care diagnostics consumables. Many of Consort Medical's R&amp;D efforts are conducted in partnership with major pharmaceutical companies. During fiscal 2015 the company added three new development contracts to its pipeline. In 2014, it completed development of a point-of-care device for rapid detection of infectious diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also seeks strategic acquisitions that can help harness its value chain. Its 2014 acquisition of Aesica, which was named a core division of the group, added oral dosage forms to its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also working to improve sales its existing product lines within both the Bespak and Aesica divisions. For instance, the Bespak unit is adding value-added services, such as drug handling.
