   Newsprint manufacturer Albert E. Reed &amp; Co. was named after its founder in 1894. It went public in 1903. For the next 50 years, Reed grew by buying UK pulp and paper mills. Reed began making packaging materials in the 1930s and added building products in 1954. The company expanded into New Zealand (1955), Australia (1960), and Norway (1962).
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman Sir Don Ryder radically altered the company in the 1960s and 1970s, leading Reed into other paper-related products and into the wallpaper, paint, and interior-decorating and do-it-yourself markets. Reed bought International Publishing, Mirror Group Newspapers, and 29% of Cahners Publishing in 1970 (buying the remaining 71% in 1977). By 1978 Ryder's strategy proved flawed. Coordinating so many companies was difficult, and, strapped for cash, Reed dumped most of its Australian businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold the Mirror Group to Robert Maxwell in 1984 and divested the remainder of its nonpaper and nonpublishing companies by 1987 to focus on publishing. It bought Octopus Publishing (1987), the UK's TV Times (1989), News Corp.'s Travel Information Group (1989), and Martindale-Hubbell (1990).
  </p>
  <p>
   Reed International merged its operations with those of Elsevier, the world's leading scholarly journal publisher, in 1993. Five Rotterdam booksellers and publishers founded Elsevier in 1880. It took its name from a famous Dutch family publishing company, which had operated from the late 16th century to the early 18th century.
  </p>
  <p>
   Elsevier entered the scientific publishing market in the 1930s, and following WWII diversified into trade journals and consumer manuals. The company made its first US acquisition, Congressional Information Service, in 1979. The company fended off a takeover bid by Maxwell in 1988 by planning a merger with UK publisher Pearson; Maxwell was thwarted, the merger ultimately failed, and Elsevier later sold its Pearson stock. Elsevier bought Maxwell's Pergamon Press in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reed and Elsevier were both listed on the NYSE in 1994. Reed Elsevier built its US presence that year with its purchase of Mead's LexisNexis online service. The company acquired Tolley, a UK tax and legal publisher, and a 50% interest in Shepard's, a US legal citation service in 1996. Reed Elsevier sold IPC Magazines (now IPC Media) for $1.4 billion in 1998 to an investment group led by venture capitalists Cinven. Later that year the company bought Matthew Bender and the remaining 50% of Shepard's from Times Mirror.
  </p>
  <p>
   Crispin Davis, the former head of Aegis Group, became CEO in 1999. The firm reorganized Cahners that year, laying off several hundred employees and consolidating magazine operations. It also boosted its scientific publishing profile by unveiling Web-based scientific information service ScienceDirect. Reed Elsevier purchased educational publisher Harcourt General in 2001 to boost its market share in the US. The company had to sell some of Harcourt's businesses (including the higher education and corporate training operations) to the former Thomson Corporation (now
   <company id="159650">
    Thomson Reuters
   </company>
   ) in order to ease antitrust concerns. Harcourt General later became Harcourt Education.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company's US Cahners Business Information unit changed its name to Reed Business Information-US. That year the company also changed its name to Reed Elsevier Group plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company next began boosting its units with acquisitions: risk management information provider Seisint for $775 million through its LexisNexis unit (2004) and the medical publishing business of MediMedia for nearly $340 million (2005). Its Elsevier unit acquired IT publisher
   <company id="122325">
    Syngress
   </company>
   in late 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of disappointing sales in its education division, in 2007 Reed Elsevier sold its Harcourt education unit, the only one of the company's main divisions that did not show revenue growth in 2006. Houghton Mifflin acquired the Harcourt Education, Harcourt Trade, and Greenwood-Heinemann divisions for some $4 billion in order to create
   <company id="10630">
    Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing
   </company>
   . In a separate deal, Reed Elsevier sold its international textbook publisher
   <company id="138807">
    Harcourt Education Ltd.
   </company>
   and the US-based testing company Harcourt Assessment to international education and information company
   <company id="41338">
    Pearson
   </company>
   for $950 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to expand its risk management and business services operations, in 2008 Reed Elsevier acquired credit risk firm
   <company id="54024">
    ChoicePoint
   </company>
   for $4.1 billion, including the assumption of $600 million in debt. The information collection giant was absorbed by LexisNexis (the company's largest revenue generator), giving the subsidiary new products for fraud prevention and credential verification.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also added pharmaceutical and medical device industries analyses to Elsevier's healthcare offerings in 2008 with the acquisition of healthcare business intelligence company
   <company id="138865">
    Windhover Information
   </company>
   . Later that year Ian Smith replaced Crispin Davis as CEO of the company. In 2009 Smith was replaced by new CEO Erik Engstrom.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company completed a major restructuring at its RBI unit, selling off several magazine titles, many of which were at its US operations. The following year LexisNexis was divided into the Risk Solutions and Legal &amp; Professional businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reed Elsevier Group in 2012 acquired Accuity Holdings, a US provider of online subscription-based data solutions for the financial services industry, for £343 million (some $563 million). Also that year it sold Hollywood trade journal
