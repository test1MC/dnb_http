   Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS) wants to bring aviation to a (hopefully not screeching) halt. MABS makes steel brakes, carbon brakes and electric brakes, brake control systems, landing gear computers, brake temperature sensors, main and nose wheels, and wheel speed transducers. MABS braking systems are used in commercial and business jets, military aircraft, helicopters, regional turboprops, and general aviation aircraft. Major customers include

   MABS has production facilities in Mexico, Singapore, the UK, and the US. Its distribution locations include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, India, and Italy.

   MABS brakes and brake control systems are installed on an estimated 34,000 in-service aircraft. Its main thrust is its aftermarket business, which represents the bulk of of its sales; the remainder is generated by its original equipment (OE) sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   MABS is the trade name of the two Meggitt businesses supplying aircraft wheels and brakes -- Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation and Dunlop Aerospace Braking Systems. More than 160 aircraft platforms use MABS wheels and brakes (which are involved in more than 15 million landings per year).

  <p>
   MABS provides aircraft braking systems through about 13 distributors (such as AAR Distribution, Aerospace Products International, Ansett Aircraft Spares &amp; Services,
   <company id="42087">
    Aviall
   </company>
   , Cosgrove Aircraft Services, GLOBAVIA SpA, and PT Pitman Nusantara) which distribute to a diverse group of customers like airline operators, aircraft constructors, private aircraft owners, and charter operators, governments and military operations, and other distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company serves a range of industries including the civilian aftermarket (64%); military (30%); and civilian OEMs (6%). It also serves the non-marginal energy industry.

   MABS generated 21% of its parent's revenues in 2014. That year MABS' grew by 3% due to organic growth in civil aftermarket and military sales. The regional aftermarket sales grew by 4% due to increases in fleet size and utilization, and business jet aftermarket grew by 7% (offset by a 9% decline in the large jet aftermarket). Military revenues increased by 8% as the aftermarket benefited from upgrade contracts for the US B1-B fleet and the Taiwanese Air Force which were completed in 2014.

   The company's growth strategy is banking on securing new contracts and expanding its landing gear sub-systems control and monitoring capability. It also believes that growth will be achieved by developing new technologies. To that end, MABS' all-electric brakes are breaking with tradition. The system, known as EBrake, replaces hydraulic systems with an all-electric brake-by-wire braking system. This new technology is in keeping with the industry evolution toward more electric aircraft, which will provide more fuel efficient, cleaner-burning aircraft and reduce the usage of toxic hydraulic fluids. Electric brakes increase dispatch reliability, eliminate hydraulic leaks and associated fire risk, simplify the manufacturing process, and reduce maintenance costs for airlines.

   The company is also focused on expanding its revenues from the maintenance, repair, and overhaul market.

   In 2014 MABS secured a multi-million dollar contract for an advanced wheel and braking system for
   <company id="40194">
    Gulfstream Aerospace
   </company>
   's new G500 and G600 business jets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company supplied the wheels and brakes to more than 1,000 new aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year,
   <company id="90718">
    Dassault
   </company>
   contracted MABS to supply the braking system and integrated control and monitoring unit for landing gear extension and retraction, nose wheel steering and aircraft hydraulic systems for the new Falcon 5X business jet.
