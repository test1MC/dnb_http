   At the core of your mass spectrometer, another Kore could be lurking. Kore Technology designs and manufactures custom mass spectrometers and other instrumentation based on its time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra-high vacuum devices. The company uses existing modules from previous instruments to design new instruments for specific client applications. Its standard product lines include portable and stationary mass spectrometers and vacuum analysis/processing systems. Formed as independent company in 1992, Kore is controlled by Beijing SDL Technology Company Ltd.
