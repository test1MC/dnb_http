   Ruiz Foods has risen to the top. The nation's largest producer of frozen Mexican dishes, Ruiz offers more than 200 frozen foods, including burritos, taquitos, quesadillas, and tamales, under the El Monterey and Tornados brand names. The prepared convenience lineup can be found in grocery stores or on the menu of foodservice operators nationwide. Ruiz Foods manufactures its products at its main 300,000-sq.-ft. facility in Dinuba, California. To meet demand in the eastern and midwestern US, the company runs two more facilities based in Texas. To provide healthier food alternatives, the company has removed all trans fats from its El Monterey brand products. Ruiz is a third-generation family-owned business.

   Besides its operations in California, the company has an additional location in Denison, Texas. Ruiz Foods is expanding its manufacturing and distribution facilities in Denison by 50,000 sq. ft. Due to be completed in early 2014, the expansion will boost its food production capabilities and meet demand from key markets and customers.

   Ruiz Foods sells across all food markets: retail, convenience store, clubs, vending, industrial, and foodservice. The Tornados brand, which is heated on a roller grill, caters to convenience stores and grocers who offer prepared foods. The El Monterey brand of frozen Mexican dishes serves both the retail and foodservice markets.

   The company's growth counts on keeping pace with evolving consumer food preferences and concerns. Ruiz Foods in 2011 joined the National Sodium Reduction Initiative, a public-private partnership between state and local health authorities and organizations and food manufactures and restaurants, committed to reduce Americans' sodium intake. The company highlighted that the line of El Monterey Family Pack Burritos and Chimichangas are within the 2012 guidelines.

   Ruiz Foods began operations in 1964. Fred Ruiz and his late father Louis  -- who owned a tortilla company at the time -- started out making and selling cheese enchiladas locally.
