   TiVo lets people watch entertainment they want to watch exactly when they want to watch it. The company is responsible for making several entertainment technology breakthroughs from the creation of the interactive TV program guide to the DVR. Instead of having to be in front of the screen at the time a broadcasted program, TiVo technology allows consumers to queue up and then serve up the television shows, movies, and music they want to enjoy at their own convenience. Like
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10856">
    Kleenex
   </company>
   , the company's name has become a word in the dictionary: to "TiVo" something essentially means "to tape it and watch it later".

   In 2016
   <company id="52934">
    Rovi
   </company>
   acquired
   <company id="59993">
    TiVo
   </company>
   for $1.1 billion. The company then changed it's name to TiVo. The TiVo brand name is much more familiar to consumers. Rovi makes technology to deliver video over multiple platforms and had much in common with TiVo.

   TiVo systems are now bundled as a built-in capability with standard cable television boxes and remote controls. Like
   <company id="100752">
    Netflix
   </company>
   , TiVo lets consumers binge-watch shows instead of having to wait for weekly episodes. TiVo sells itself to media producers by promising to enable a more meaningful relationships with their audiences.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   TiVo's sales increased 8% 2016 (ended January) versus the prior year, to $490 million. The company had a 9% revenue increase in its technology revenue, which accounts for 445% of the total. The hardware business's revenue rose 17%; it accounts for 36% of overall revenue. Hardware revenue fell 6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   TiVo recorded a profit of $21.7 million in 2016, but it was 30% lower than the 2015 earnings figure. The company barely generated positive cash flow in 2016 at $288,000, compared to $24 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   TiVo's revenue has been relatively consistent during the past several fiscal periods. The company reported $526 million in revenue for fiscal 2015 after bringing in $542 million in fiscal 2014 and $538 million in fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   While TiVo became synonymous with time-shifted viewing with its DVRs, the technology has been challenged by streaming services from over-the-top carriers such as
   <company id="100752">
    Netflix
   </company>
   and
   <company id="159434">
    Hulu
   </company>
   as well as content providers themselves such as CBS and HBO.
  </p>
  <p>
   TiVo is always innovating as it seeks to create the ultimate entertainment experience for consumers. The company is constantly trying to make its products and technology more user-friendly and more useful as part of its efforts to enhance consumers' abilities to shape the content they would like to consume. TiVo added $5.6 million to its research and development spending in 2016.
