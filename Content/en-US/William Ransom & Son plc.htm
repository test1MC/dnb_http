  <p>
   Faced with bank debt, in 2010 the company discontinued and/or sold several brand lines it deemed non-core. One such sale included the honey-based Medibee line of products which fetched Â£560,000 ($875,000). Following the sales, the company secured fresh financing from KBC Bank and withdrew from public trading in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 1846 by William Ransom, the company was controlled by the Ransom family until 2008.
