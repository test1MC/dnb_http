  <p>
   Steelcase sells three main product types: Systems and Storage, Seating, and Other. The Systems and Storage products generated 50% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2016 (ended February), while Seating and Other products contributed 31% and 19% of sales, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steelcase operates three main segments, mostly based on geography: The Americas, the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and Other. The America's segment, which makes up more than 70% of revenue, serves customers in the US, Canada, the Carribbean Islands, and Latin America. The EMEA segment, which serves customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, generates another 17% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's "Other" segment consists of its Asia Pacific, Designtex and PolyVision businesses, and made up 9% of sales in 2016 (ended February). The Asia/Pacific business sells the company's Steelcase-branded furniture products in Asia and Australia. Designtex provides design expertise and premium surface materials for seating areas, walls work stations, and floors for architects and interior designers. PolyVision makes ceramic steel for multiple uses, and designs and makes visual communication products, such as static and interactive electronic whiteboards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steelcase makes it own products in manufacturing plants in the US, Mexico, France, Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, China, Malaysia, and India).

  <p>
   The US is Steelcase's largest market, accounting for more than 70% of its sales. EMEA represents about 20% (most of which came from Western Europe). The office furniture maker operates manufacturing facilities throughout North America (US and Mexico), Europe (France, Germany, and Spain), and Asia (China and Malaysia).

  <p>
   Steelcase markets and distributes its products through more than 750 independent and company-owned dealers in more than 800 locations worldwide. Additionally, it sells directly to end-use customers. The company also markets some from its limited retail and web-based sales channels.

  <p>
   In 2016 (ended February), Steelcase's revenue was flat while profits and cash flow increased significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Americas Steelcase eked out a 3% revenue increase, but a 13% drop in EMEA resulted in $3 billion revenue for 2016, the same as 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose about 98% to $170 million in 2016 from $86 million in 2014. Most of the profit pop came from the sale of Steelcase's stake in

    IDEO
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $186 million in 2016, compared to $84 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Steelcase relies on its deep understanding of work patterns, workers, and workplaces accumulated over 100 years in business to drive its growth at home and abroad. The firm keeps abreast of workplace trends, including globalization, increased collaborations, and multiple generations at work, to design products to meet its clients' evolving needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steelcase has been busy building its presence in emerging markets in recent years as part of its overall growth strategy. In 2015, the company announced that continued overseas expansion and strong furniture sales under the Steelcase and Coalesse brands had made it among the market leaders in Germany, France, the UK, and Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the EMEA sales slump fresh in its mind, Steelcase is moving to improve its business model in the region. It closed two manufacturing facilities in France and Germany in 2016 and plans to open a new Greenfield factory in the Czech Republic, where costs are lower. It also plans a Learning + Innovation Center for Munich in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steelcase hopes to meet demands for emerging office structures with its Office Renaissance line, which includes open benching and desking areas. It includes VIA (Vertical Intelligent Architecture) architectural walls, which integrate technology for video and data conferencing. Another new line, Brody WorkLounge, is for workers who prefer to do individual work without distraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut operating costs and boost profitability, Steelcase reaffirmed in 2015 that it uses lean manufacturing principles, which enable efficiencies and cost savings by limiting the amount of costly inventory the company has on hand.

  <p>
   In the early 1900s, when wooden office furniture was the rule, sheet-metal designer Peter Wege began espousing the benefits of fireproof steel furniture. In 1912 Wege persuaded a group of investors, led by Grand Rapids, Michigan, banker Walter Idema, to create the Metal Office Furniture Company. Salesman David Dyer Hunting -- a onetime vaudeville press agent who is considered the company's third founder -- joined in 1914. Metal Office Furniture's first big hit was a metal wastepaper basket.
  </p>
  <p>
   Businesses were slow to switch from wood to the more expensive metal furniture, but US government architects, concerned with fire safety, began specifying metal furniture in their designs. Metal Office Furniture won its first government contract in 1915.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wege hired media consultant Jim Turner in 1921 to tout the benefits of metal furniture. Turner came up with a trademark to describe the indestructible nature of the company's products -- Steelcase. The company patented the suspension cabinet in 1934 and teamed with Frank Lloyd Wright in 1937 to create office furniture for the Johnson Wax headquarters building.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metal Office Furniture provided the US Navy with shipboard furniture during WWII and sold Navy-inspired modular furniture after the war. In 1954 the company changed its name to Steelcase. Five years later it introduced Convertibles and Convertiwalls, a system of frames, cabinets, and panels that could tailor a work area to an individual worker's needs. By 1968 Steelcase had become the world's #1 maker of metal office furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its presence overseas, the company signed deals with firms such as Strafor Facom (1974, France). Steelcase began a series of acquisitions in 1978, fueling growth that helped triple its sales during the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Steelcase positioned itself as a more design-oriented company by creating the Steelcase Design Partnership. The partnership, which was made up of seven companies, provided products for special market niches such as fabrics (DesignTex).
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm was hit hard by the recession of the early 1990s as many businesses postponed buying new furniture. Steelcase was forced to lay off hourly workers, but by 1992 it was able to recall them all.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Steelcase launched Turnstone, serving small businesses and home office workers. Turnstone president James Hackett was named president and CEO of Steelcase the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Steelcase joined with computer mouse pioneer IDEO to co-design furniture for computers. Steelcase went public in 1998 at the urging of the Wege and Hunting families; Peter Wege, son of one of the company's founders, gave nearly $140 million (of the $214 million he gained from the IPO) to his charity, the Wege Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in the late 1990s included Germany's wood office furniture maker Werndl BuroMobel; US company J.M. Lynne (wall coverings); and the remaining 50% stake of its French joint venture, Steelcase Strafor, from Strafor Facom.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Custom Cable Industries (data and voice cabling) and PolyVision (whiteboards) in 2002. In the face of declining office furniture sales, however, Steelcase was also laying off workers. More than 6,600 hourly, temporary, and salaried positions were eliminated between December 2000 and March 2002, or 27% of the workforce. After losing more than $15 million in 2002, the company temporarily closed its North American operations for one week in April 2003. The shutdown was the company's first in its 90-year history.
