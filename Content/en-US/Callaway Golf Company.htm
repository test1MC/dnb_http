   Big Bertha keeps Callaway Golf swinging. With its flagship driver named after a WWI cannon, Callaway makes premium-priced golf clubs that are popular with amateurs and professionals alike. The company's other drivers, as well as its fairway woods, irons, wedges, hybrids, and putters, are sold under the Callaway and Odyssey names. It also makes Callaway golf balls, golf bags, and uPro-branded GPS range finders. At the top of the golf market, Callaway designs apparel and shoes and licenses its name for travel gear, eyewear, and other golf accessories. Its products are sold through its websites and in more than 100 countries by golf pro shops, sporting goods retailers, and mass merchants.

  <p>
   Callaway operates its business through two segments: Golf Clubs (85% of net sales) and Golf Balls (15%). The Golf Clubs segment comprises Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, and putters, as well as Odyssey putters. The segment also includes other golf-related accessories and royalties from licensing the company's trademarks and service marks, as well as sales of pre-owned golf clubs. The Golf Balls segment consists primarily of Callaway Golf.

  <p>
   To sell its golf products, the manufacturer taps a network of full-time regional field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives. The company primarily sells to golf retailers located on golf courses and off. It also relies on sporting goods retailers who sell quality golf products and provide a high-touch level of customer service. Callaway also peddles some of its products through mass merchants.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US, Callaway leverages three types of advertising and promotional vehicles. It develops print ads for national magazines (such as Golf Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Golf Digest), produces television commercials (primarily on The Golf Channel,
   <company id="103583">
    ESPN
   </company>
   , and network television during golf telecasts), and creates Web-based advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   Callaway logs international sales through its wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Japan, Europe, Korea, Canada, Australia, China, Thailand, and India. In addition to sales through its subsidiaries, the company sells through its distribution network in more than 50 foreign countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and in numerous countries in Central and South America.

  <p>
   After posting net losses for five straight years, Callaway generated net income of $16 million in 2014 as its revenues climbed 5% from $843 million in 2013 to $887 million in 2014. Its positive net income for 2014 was attributed to the rise in revenue coupled with the absence of a loss from operations it experienced in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company attributes the increase for 2014 to 5% growth in golf clubs and 4% growth in golf balls. This resulted from continued brand momentum and a strong performance of its Big Bertha family of woods, APEX irons, Speed Regime, and Supersoft golf balls launched during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Callaway experienced two straight years of negative cash flow from operations during 2012 and 2013, but it posted $37 million in operating cash flow for 2014 due to the increase in net income and a positive change in inventories.

  <p>
   Callaway has achieved growth recently by introducing new products and by keeping a tighter lid on costs. In 2015 the company introduced a new line of golf clubs built for speed: the XR Drivers, XR Fairway Woods, XR Hybrids, and the XR Irons. In 2014 it reintroduced the Big Bertha brand in the form of new drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, and irons. The company also introduced Big Bertha iron, the first iron to feature Cup 360 technology.

  <p>
   In 1973 Ely Callaway, then president of
   <company id="15565">
    Burlington Industries, Inc.
   </company>
   , retired after failing to make chairman. He started a winery near San Diego and sold it eight years later for a hefty profit. Meanwhile, the longtime golfer found a hickory-shafted club he loved so much that in 1982 he bought the company that made it and renamed it Callaway Hickory Stick USA, Inc. The company produced hickory-shafted putters and wedges.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 the company changed its name to Callaway Golf as it introduced its S2H2 set of irons. By the end of 1990, the S2H2 driver had become the preferred driver on the Senior PGA tour. Sales didn't start to soar, however, until the 1991 introduction of the Big Bertha driver. The company had begun to build a reputation for producing forgiving clubs that helped improve players' scores. The company listed on the NYSE in 1992. Capitalizing on the driver's success, it introduced Big Bertha irons in 1994 and the Great Big Bertha driver in 1995.
