Products are sold under such names as JLG, SkyTrak, and Lull. The company supplies customers in the government, equipment leasing, construction, maintenance, agricultural, industrial, and military markets. Equipment manufacturer

  <p>
   The company was founded in 1969 by John L. Grove (hence JLG Industries) and Paul Shockey. The two purchased a small metal-fabrication shop to produce an alternative to ladders and construction scaffolding. The company pioneered elevating work platforms that use telescoping booms, called boom lifts -- its main product for two decades. In 1973 JLG began making scissor lifts, platforms that rise up to 50 feet on scissor-shaped supports. The firm established overseas offices in 1977.
