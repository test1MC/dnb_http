   With its 50 owned businesses spread across key regions of the globe, Weir Group need not be wary of even the biggest infrastructure project. The engineering company offers an array of industrial products and services used to build or run everything from mines to wastewater plants to oil pipelines to nuclear facilities. The company manufactures industrial pumps, valves, controls, and material handling equipment; it also provides maintenance and technical support and replacement parts. To keep its global operations organized, Weir divides its activities into three divisions: minerals, oil and gas, and power and industrial. North America is the group's leading region, with nearly 40% of sales.

  <p>
   Minerals, the largest segment at over 50% of sales, provides products for the mining mill circuit, the process of breaking down mined rock into usable ore. Its primary raw materials include copper, which requires significant process and thus supports Weir's aftermarket-focused business model.
  </p>
  <p>
   Power and Industrial, responsible for over 30% of revenue, serves the conventional, nuclear and renewables power generation markets with valves, pumps and turbines and specialist support services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oil &amp; Gas operates in the North American shale gas and tight oil sectors, supplying pressure pumping and pressure control products for use in fracking. The segment accounts for over 15% of revenue.

  <p>
   Weir is based in Glasgow, Scotland, and has a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide. The US is the company's biggest market, at around 30% of sales.

   In 2015, revenue fell a sharp 21% on prior year to £1.9 billion due to a severe fall in Oil &amp; Gas, relating to difficult current oil environment. Minerals and Power &amp; industrial both also conduct oil-related activities and saw declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income turned negative in fiscal 2015, with net income of £75 million falling to £-179 million. This primarily related to lower revenue. Cash from operating activities grew £4.1 million £310.1 million as a result of changes in trade and other receivables and construction contracts.

   Faced with an extremely disadvantageous oil market, Weir has sought to preserve market share while pivoting towards a more stable business mix. The Power &amp; Industrial division will be renamed Flow Control, and Weir's Floway and Gabbioneta businesses, part of Minerals and Oil &amp; Gas respectively, will be incorporated into the new segment.

  <p>
   In 2015, Weir acquired Delta Industrial Valves, a US-based manufacturer of knife-gate valves for use in mining, oil sands and other industrial markets, for around $47 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, it acquired Trio Engineered Products, a Sino-American crushing and separation equipment manufacturer working in mining and aggregate markets, for $220 million.

  <p>
   Soon after brothers George and James Weir set up a machine shop and foundry outside Glasgow, Scotland, in 1886, James emerged as a gifted inventor. The steamship industry was in its infancy at the time, and James' notable innovations for steamships included a direct-contact feed-water heater, a direct-acting feed pump, and a seawater distiller (to reduce boiler scaling and corrosion). As the steamship industry grew, so did the company, and in 1895 G. and J. Weir became a private limited company. The company also diversified, building machine tools and pumping stations for oil pipelines. It landed its first land-based desalination plant in 1912.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWI fueled demand for warships and led the company into the production of artillery shells and aircraft. All the company's profits were donated to the Red Cross and other relief organizations. By this time, James Weir's son, William Weir (later Lord Weir), was in charge. His effectiveness caught the UK government's eye and he soon became Secretary of State for Air. In that position, he was instrumental in combining the army and navy air forces into the Royal Air Force.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1920s, while the company toiled away at making pumps and auxiliary equipment, Lord Weir put people to work building inexpensive houses -- addressing two major problems at once -- but the project was doomed by opposition from the traditional building industry. In the early 1930s the company began work on the autogyro, but the advent of WWII turned it to more pressing matters, such as marine equipment, field guns, and gun cartridges.
  </p>
  <p>
   G. and J. Weir diversified in the 1950s and expanded its desalination operations. In 1958 G. and J. Weir Holdings (now The Weir Group plc) was formed and G. and J. Weir (now Weir Pumps Ltd.) was allowed to focus on pumps and auxiliary equipment. The company added UK pump companies Harland Engineering (1968) and Drysdale (1970). More UK pump, valve, and engineering services companies followed in the 1980s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the company made significant international acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   These acquisitions included Warman Water Pumps (Australia), Floway Pumps (US), Atwood and Morrill (US, valves) and Baton Rouge Machine Works (US, engineering services). In 1994 Weir Group entered the slurry and specialty pump market by acquiring Envirotech Pumpsystems, a US-based industrial and sewage sludge pump maker with operations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, and the UK. Weir Group further bolstered its international operations by adding Salweir (South Africa, pumps) in 1996, Entropie (France, desalination) in 1997, and Schabaver (France, pumps) and SEBIM (France, valves) in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Weir Group rejected a $984 million buy offer from US-based rival
   <company id="13241">
    Flowserve
   </company>
   , then paid $308 million for Warman International, the heavy-duty pumps unit of Australia's North Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   After only 13 months on the job, CEO Duncan Whyte was let go after he failed to help Weir Group dispose of non-core assets. Later in the year, Weir sold its Darchem Engineering division to a newly formed company owned by Royal Bank Private Equity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, after a search lasting nearly a year, Weir Group announced Mark Selway had come aboard as the company's CEO. Continuing its trend of divesting non-core operations, Weir sold Weir Systems (computer software and related services) in 2001 and began actively seeking buyers for its Tooling Products and G. Perry and Sons (automotive equipment supplier) divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's chairman, Ronald Garrick, retired in 2002; Sir Robert Smith, a director, was tabbed as Garrick's successor. In 2003 the company signed an agreement with Siemens Power Generation (now
   <company id="103975">
    Siemens Energy, Inc.
   </company>
   ) to perform maintenance services for oil, gas, water, and other utilities on a global scale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Weir sold its loss-making desalination and water treatment systems design businesses to Veolia Water Systems for nearly £28 million as part of ongoing efforts to rein in costs. It also found that shedding more of its non-core or unprofitable businesses would help it to remain competitive. In 2007, for example, the company sold its Weir Pumps Glasgow unit, which was underperforming. It also sold its interest in Devonport Royal Dockyard, which services the Royal Navy's submarine fleet, to
   <company id="90042">
    Babcock International Group
   </company>
   . The group owned a 25% stake in the dockyard, along with
   <company id="111095">
    KBR
   </company>
   and
   <company id="113430">
    Balfour Betty
   </company>
   , both of which also sold their shares to Babcock International. For Weir, the move was an attempt to reduce its exposure to the UK defense industry and open its resources up to its preferred strategy of seeking niches with high barriers to entry where it is capable of market leadership or already leads.
  </p>
  <p>
   It continued to offload its military-focused operations in 2008 when it sold its Weir Strachan &amp; Henshaw unit (again to Babcock International) for $100 million. Strachan &amp; Henshaw provided engineering, project management, and support services to the defense and nuclear industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a surprise move, chief executive Mark Selway resigned in September 2009 in order to take over leadership of
   <company id="54853">
    Boral
   </company>
   , a leading building and construction materials company in his native Australia. Weir named finance chief Keith Cochrane to succeed Selway. Cochrane previously led transportation services group
   <company id="58051">
    Stagecoach
   </company>
   ; he resigned his post in 2002 when that company's acquisition of
   <company id="51230">
    Coach USA
   </company>
   ran into trouble.
