   The comany's revenue base is made up of a diversified product mix with limited technology and the risk of product obsolescence. Many of the products it manufactures have been used in the medical device market for more than a decade, such as biopsy instruments, joint implants, pacemakers and surgical instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of Lake Region Medical's business comes from industrial customers outside the medical device industry. For those customers, the company supplies components used in fiber optics, motion sensors, high density discharge lamps, and other products.

  <p>
   The firm believes it can benefit from the growing demand for high-tech medical devices (driven by an aging population, globalization, and the development of minimally invasive technologies), as well as its clients' increasing reliance on outsourcing to reduce costs and increase focus on research, sales, and marketing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to growing revenue from new and existing customers, Lake Region Medical wants to increase manufacturing efficiencies (using Lean Sigma) and expand its service offering, particularly in the areas of design, prototyping, and supply chain services.
  </p>
  <p>
   To remain competitive, the company has to invest in research and development to introduce new and next-generation products to its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company rebranded itself after its 2014 acquisition of Lake Region Medical. As part of the combination of the two companies, it consolidated manufacturing operations in Galway, Ireland. It also shuttered a plant in Colorado.
