   That great sucking sound might be VacSax making money by sucking up waste materials. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of disposable suction products for medical wastes, for use in surgical and general hospital settings. Products include suction systems, aluminum collection canisters, liners, filters, tubes, vacuum devices, and gel (used to solidify liquid waste before suction). Brands include VacSax, PreGel, GelSax, and Advance. The company's liners are PVC-free and produce only carbon dioxide and water upon 100% combustion. It also makes disposable bedpans and surgical smoke suction devices. VacSax's products are sold directly and via distributors.
