   Bedfont Scientific manufactures, markets, and sells exhaled breath and gas-monitoring instruments for medical, scientific, and industrial markets worldwide. Its products include carbon monoxide monitors for use in smoking cessation programs and for use by emergency services for carbon monoxide poisoning. Its breath monitors include one that uses exhaled nitric oxide to analyze airway inflammation and another that uses hydrogen for detecting gastrointestinal disorders. Bedfont Scientific also makes a medical gas delivery system for use in inhaled nitric oxide therapy. Established as Bedfont Technical Instruments in 1976, the firm sells its products online and through a worldwide distributor network.

   Products include the line of Smokerlyzer breath carbon monoxide monitors, which helps smokers quit their habit. NOxBOX products deliver and monitor nitric oxide levels, while the Medi-Gas line verifies and validates the amount of medical gas administered to patients. The Gastrolyzer breath analysis device detects gastrointestinal disorders (such as lactose intolerance), while the ToxCO carbon monoxide monitor measures breath or ambient samples.

   Bedfont also produces consumables that include cardboard mouthpieces, infection control filters, alcohol-free cleansing wipes, and calibration gas for its monitors.

   To meet all kinds of gas monitoring needs, Bedfont has worked to broaden its product portfolio. In late 2014, the company established a new unit, NewMed, which distributes pulsed electromagnetic field therapy device MAGNETOVITAL for speedy recovery.
