Its products are components in cable TV, fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) networks, telecommunications and data centers, satellite communications, aerospace and defense, wireless networks, and broadcast audio/video systems.

  <p>
   EMCORE compared its 2015 (ended September) financials to the 2014 results that did not include the photovoltaics business, which was sold ni 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   By that reckoning, the company posted 2015 revenue of $81.6 million, up $26 million (47%) from 2014 increase. The company sold more of its TV products and chip-level devices to US customers. The company also expanded sales (up 95% on 2015 from 2014) to customers in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   EMCORE posted a profit of $63 million in 2015, a marked rise from$4.8 million in 2014. Increased sales contriobuted to the rise as did and income from discontinued operations ($61 million from the photovoltaics business).
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the full 2014 results (which included the photovoltaics operation), EMCORE's revenue fell to $81 million from $174 million in 2014. The profit picture, however, remained the same as the company reported.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had a negative cash flow of about $4 million in 2015, compared to a positive $1 million cash flow in 2014.

  <p>
   The company has generally tried to improve liquidity by reducing costs and selling assets, among other measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it agreed to sell its Space Photovoltaics Business to
   <company id="113412">
    Veritas Capital
   </company>
   for $150 million as the first major action resulting from EMCORE's review of strategic alternatives for the financially stressed company. The company also sold its digital products unit for about $17 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   By selling such assets, EMCORE is focused on its fiber operations and looks to expand them through strategic operations
