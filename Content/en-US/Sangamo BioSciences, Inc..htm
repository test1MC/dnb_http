   Sangamo BioSciences hopes zinc fingers have the Midas touch when it comes to regulating gene expression. The company's zinc finger DNA-binding proteins (ZFPs) control gene expression (activation) and cell function; the firm aims to develop gene-correcting therapeutics for a variety of indications, including human genetic disorders as well as genetic modifications in plants and animals. Sangamo BioSciences has candidates in clinical trials and research stages for conditions such as hemophilia, HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, blood disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Other ZFP development programs include research in the areas of lysosomal storage disorders.

   The company's research and development programs are conducted in collaboration with the

   , research organization

    City of Hope,

   , and other organizations and schools. Additionally, Sangamo has a Parkinson's disease research program with funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Its hemophilia and Huntington's disease treatments are being developed with pharma firm

    Shire plc

  <p>
   Although the company is focused mainly on developing human drug therapies, it hopes its ZFP technology can serve other commercial purposes as well. It has licensed the technology to
   <company id="59427">
    Dow AgroSciences
   </company>
   (DAS), for instance, for commercial crop plant engineering applications.
   <company id="14717">
    Sigma-Aldrich
   </company>
   has licensed ZFP technology to develop research reagents; and drug company
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   and others have used ZFP technology to enhance their protein production capabilities. Biotech firm Open Monoclonal Technologies licenses the company's technologies to create and sell genetically altered mice for research purposes.

  <p>
   In 2013 Sangamo reported an 11% increase in revenue as it collected more collaboration payments from Shire though it did get slightly less from DAS. The two companies accounted for 68% and 12%, respectively, of revenue. Its net loss increased by 19% as it paid more for R&amp;D related to its pre-clinical ZFP candidates. The company has yet to make make any money from its products, which are in the development stage.

  <p>
   Sangamo's strategy is to continue development of its ZFP technology through clinical testing and then partner with a biopharmaceutical company to take the candidate through late-stage testing and commercialization.
