   With instant coffee, baby food, and bottled water in the mix, Nestlé crunches more than just chocolate. The world's #1 food and drinks company in terms of sales, Nestlé is also the world leader in coffee (Nescafé). It also makes coffee for the home-brewing system, Nespresso. Nestlé is one of the world's top bottled water makers (
   <company id="103387">
    Nestlé Waters
   </company>
   ), one of the biggest frozen pizza makers (DiGiorno), and a big player in the pet food business (Friskies, Purina). Its most well-known global food brands include Buitoni, Dreyer's, Maggi, Milkmaid, Carnation, and Kit Kat. The company also owns
   <company id="113369">
    Gerber Products.
   </company>
   North America is Nestlé's most important market.

  <p>
   The Americas (particularly North America) is Nestlé's largest market, accounting for nearly 45% of sales. Europe contributes nearly 30%, while the company's fast-growing business in Asia, Oceania &amp; Africa accounts for just over 25%. China is delivering the strongest sales growth. The Swiss-based food giant has operations in 194 countries worldwide and factories in about 85 countries.

   In addition to being the world's biggest food company, Nestlé operates several joint ventures, including Cereal Partners Worldwide with

    General Mills
   </company>
   and Beverage Partners Worldwide with
   <company id="10359">
    Coke

  <p>
   Despite a challenging year, particularly in Europe, Nestlé's sales topped $100 billion in 2012, an increase of 13.5% versus 2011. The increase was driven by organic growth, price increases, and favorable foreign exchange rates. The company posted a net profit of $11.6 billion over the same period. The maker of Nescafe, Perrier, Haagen Dazs, and Carnation reported broad-based growth across all product ranges and regions. In 2012 Asia, Oceania &amp; Africa outperformed the Americas and Europe, posting an organic growth rate of 10% versus 6% and 2% for the Americas and Europe, respectively. Among Nestlé's vast product portfolio the best sellers were powdered and liquid beverages and pet care. For the year, developed markets contributed 57% of Nestlé's sales, with the rest originating in emerging markets, such as Brazil and China.

  <p>
   Nestlé is attempting to reposition itself away from reliance on processed foods toward higher-margin products with a "nutrition, health and wellness" profile. The company operates according to a strategic roadmap that leverages its huge product and brand portfolio, strong R&amp;D and product launch capabilities, and an expansive geographic presence. It uses these strengths to build its nutrition and health and wellness businesses and position products in emerging markets. In late 2012, for instance, Nestlé boosted its infant nutrition portfolio by purchasing
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   's nutrition business for about $11.8 billion in cash. About 85% of Pfizer's nutrition sales come from emerging markets, such as Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoping to repeat the considerable success of its Nespresso coffee machines business, Nestlé in 2011 launched a spinoff product for baby formula called BabyNes. The new system, initially available only in Switzerland, features powdered milk capsules that are fed into a machine, which heats and adds water, preparing a bottle is less than 30 seconds. The cost of the formula capsules is about four times that of a Nespresso coffee capsule. Nespresso, launched in 1986, has become one of Nestlé's biggest and most profitable brands with 2010 sales exceeding $3.4 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to rid its portfolio of underperforming businesses, Nestlé in late 2013 sold the
   <company id="15441">
    Jenny Craig
   </company>
   weight-control business to the Connecticut-based private equity firm
   <company id="103502">
    North Castle Partners
   </company>
   .

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Nestlé's $11.8 billion acquisition of Pfizer's nutrition business in 2012 is one of several key deals the company has made in recent times. To boost its presence in China, it acquired a 60% stake in Chinese food maker Yinlu Foods Group, expanding its instant food offering in a key growth market. Family-owned Yinlu is a major distributor of ready-to-drink peanut milk and instant canned rice pudding. The deal extends cooperation between the two companies, as Yinlu is a co-producer of Nestlé's Nescafe coffee in China. In late 2011 Nestlé paid $2.1 billion for a 60% interest in China-based confectionery Hsu Fu Chi. The deal put Nestlé at the helm of China's second-largest confectionery. The purchase ranked as one of the largest foreign takeovers of a Chinese company.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the health and wellness side, Nestlé is embracing the concept of science-based nutrition, which emphasizes using food to treat chronic conditions and diseases. In early 2011 Nestlé acquired CM&amp;D Pharma, a London-based firm that has formulated Fostrap chewing gum to aid kidney disease sufferers and Eviendep dietary fiber mix to slow the development of colon polyps. Many of CM&amp;D's "medical foods" are in trial stages, but none have been introduced to the public. CM&amp;D is the first addition to Nestlé Health Science (NHS), a subsidiary created at the start of 2011 to affirm Nestlé's interest in science-based nutrition.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Henri Nestlé purchased a factory in Vevey, Switzerland, in 1843 that made products ranging from nut oils to rum. In 1867 he developed a powder made from cow's milk and wheat flour as a substitute for mother's milk. A year earlier Americans Charles and George Page had founded the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham, Switzerland, using Gail Borden's milk-canning technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1875 Nestlé sold his eponymous company, then doing business in 16 countries. When Anglo-Swiss launched a milk-based infant food in 1878, Nestlé's new owners responded by introducing a condensed-milk product. In 1905, a year after Nestlé began selling chocolate, the companies ended their rivalry by merging under the Nestlé name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hampered by limited milk supplies during WWI, the company expanded into regions less affected by the war, such as the US. In 1929 it acquired Cailler, the first company to mass-produce chocolate bars, and Swiss General, inventor of milk chocolate.
  </p>
  <p>
   An investment in a Brazilian condensed-milk factory during the 1920s paid an unexpected dividend when Brazilian coffee growers suggested the company develop a water-soluble "coffee cube." Released in 1938, Nescafé instant coffee quickly became popular.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other new products included Nestlé's Crunch bar (1938), Quik drink mix (1948), and Taster's Choice instant coffee (1966). Nestlé expanded during the 1970s with acquisitions such as Beringer Brothers wines (sold in 1995), Stouffer's, and Libby's.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moving beyond foods in 1974, Nestlé acquired a 49% stake in Gesparal, a holding company that controls the French cosmetics company L'Oréal. It acquired pharmaceutical firm Alcon Laboratories three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Helmut Maucher was named chairman and CEO in 1981. He began beefing up Nestlé's global presence. Boycotters had long accused Nestlé of harming children in developing countries through the unethical promotion of infant formula, and Maucher acknowledged the ongoing boycott by meeting with the critics and setting up a commission to police adherence to
   <company id="100397">
    World Health Organization
   </company>
   guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nestlé bought Carnation in 1985. Maucher doubled the company's chocolate business in 1988 with the purchase of UK chocolate maker Rowntree (Kit Kat). Also in the 1980s Nestlé acquired Buitoni pastas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded in the 1990s with the purchases of Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candies, Source Perrier water, Alpo pet food, and Ortega Mexican foods. Company veteran Peter Brabeck-Letmathe succeeded Maucher as CEO in 1997. He cleaned out Nestlé's pantry by selling non-core businesses (Contadina tomato products, Libby's canned meat products) but restocked with San Pellegrino (mineral water) and Dalgety's Spillers (pet food) in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 the company started rolling out its Nestlé Pure Life bottled water. It also sold its Findus brand (fish, vegetables) and its non-instant US coffee brands. That year Nestlé merged its US novelty ice-cream unit with operations of Pillsbury's Häagen-Dazs to form Ice Cream Partners USA. In 2000 Nestlé purchased snack maker
   <company id="42848">
    PowerBar
   </company>
   . In 2001 it bought Ralston Purina for $10.3 billion, making it the world's largest pet food maker. To win FTC approval, the companies agreed to sell Meow Mix and Alley Cat dry cat food brands to Hartz Mountain. In a deal that gives Nestlé a 99-year license to use the Häagen-Dazs brand in the US, the company agreed to pay $641 million to
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   (which has bought Pillsbury from Britain's Diageo) for the other half of Ice Cream Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Nestlé acquired German ice-cream maker Schoeller Holding Group, as well as US food company Chef America, maker of Hot Pockets and Lean Pockets. That same year Nestlé also spun off eyecare subsidairy Alcon Laboratories, but retained about 75% ownership of it. The company renamed its water unit from Perrier Vittel SA to Nestlé Waters and bought Russian bottled water company Saint Springs. The company sold its savory flavor business, Food Ingredients Specialties (FIS), to Swiss flavoring company
   <company id="92846">
    Givaudan
   </company>
   , and its UK and Ireland ambient foods business to
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (then named Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst). It also formed a joint venture with New Zealand dairy co-op
   <company id="56483">
    Fonterra
   </company>
   to produce and distribute dairy products in the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nestlé and Cadbury Schweppes (now Cadbury) made a joint $10.5 billion bid for The Hershey Company in 2002 but Hershey called the sale off later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Nestlé already owned 30% of US ice cream powerhouse Dreyer's, in 2002 it proposed a merger of its US ice cream businesses. After months of antitrust scrutiny, the final deal gave Nestlé 67% of Dreyer's.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to further strengthen its position in the worldwide ice cream market, Nestlé acquired the ice cream and related products of
   <company id="102873">
    Mövenpick
   </company>
   , a Swiss food company 2003. The acquisition brought Nestlé licensing agreements with companies in Egypt, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other transactions in 2003 included the Nestlé USA unit selling its Ortega brand Mexican food products to B&amp;G Foods and the parent company selling Mont Blanc, France's leading dessert brand, to French investment firm Activa Capital. Also that year the company added to its bottled-water business by acquiring
   <company id="42418">
    Hutchison Whampoa
   </company>
   's Powwow, which operates in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the UK. In addition, it acquired Clear Water, a bottled-water home-and-office delivery company located in Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In line with its strategy to concentrate on value-added products, in 2004 Nestlé sold its cocoa-processing facilities in Germany and the UK to
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   . Also in 2004 the company acquired Finnish dairy company Valid's Valiojäätelö ice cream business and increased its stake in Israeli bakery company Osem to 53%. In addition, Nestlé sold its German frozen food distributor Eastman that year and Nestlé España bought Nestlé Portugal for about $682 million. Nestlé was ordered by the Brazilian government to sell its Chocolates Garoto in 2004 on the grounds that ownership of Garoto presented unfair market competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that same year, CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe announced he was considering reducing the number of outside directorships that he held because of increased demands as the leader of Nestlé. At the time Brabeck-Letmathe sat on the boards of Alcon,
   <company id="40794">
    Credit Suisse
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13233">
    Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream
   </company>
   , L'Oréal,
   <company id="41787">
    Roche Holding
   </company>
   , and "Winterthur" Swiss Insurance Company. (He has since left the "Winterthur" board.) And that year, in a tangle with a French union over retirement benefits, Nestlé threatened to sell Perrier or produce its popular water from another source. However, the company reached a settlement with the union and the production of Perrier continued.
  </p>
  <p>
   Long-time chairman Rainer Gut retired in 2005 and Brabeck-Letmathe replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 it became a 90% owner of Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. The next year, Nestlé became the owner of more than 90% of Dreyer's as the result of an exercise of a Put Right whereby Nestlé was required to purchase certain shareholders' Class A Callable Puttable Common Stock (or Class A shares). As a result of this "short form merger," Dreyer's ceased trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In keeping with its strategy to concentrate on value-added products, during 2006 Nestlé sold its cocoa processing facilities in Germany and the UK to Cargill. Adding to its dominance in the European ice cream sector, the company acquired Finnish dairy company Valid's Valiojäätelö's ice cream business and Greece's Delta Ice cream, which has operations in Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia. Later that year, Nestlé bought the Australian breakfast cereal, snack, and soup operations of Uncle Tobys from Burns Philp for $670 million. The cereal portion was integrated into Cereal Partners Worldwide. In another streamlining move, the company agreed to sell its canned liquid milk businesses in Southeast Asia to Singapore-based
   <company id="56788">
    Fraser and Neave
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Hedging its bets, considering its food products (candy bars, ice cream) are on the opposite end of the waistline wars, Nestlé acquired
   <company id="15441">
    Jenny Craig
   </company>
   for $600 million in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company purchased the medical-nutrition business of Novartis for €1.88 billion ($2.5 billion). The business, which has operations in 40 countries worldwide, makes food for hospital patients. The purchase was seen as a move by Nestlé to concentrate on higher-margin products. Brands in the acquisition included Boost and Resource nutritional supplements, and Optifast dieting products. Nestle divested some operations in France and Spain in order to settle competitive concerns surrounding the deal voiced by the European Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the food front, Nestlé subsidiary Dreyer's purchased the Eskimo Pie and Chipwich brands from Canadian ice cream maker,
   <company id="56504">
    CoolBrands
   </company>
   , in 2007 for almost $19 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nestlé spooned out $5.5 billion in cash to purchase
   <company id="113369">
    Gerber Products
   </company>
   from Novartis in 2007. The deal made Nestlé the world's largest baby food company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to the increased workload as chairman, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe stepped down as CEO in 2008; he remained in an active role as board chairman. Paul Bulcke, former head of Zone Americas for Nestlé, replaced Brabeck-Letmathe as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company it added to its "out of home food and beverage" operations (i.e., foodservice) in 2009 with the purchase of Tampa-based
   <company id="99273">
    Vitality Foodservice
   </company>
   . Vitality provides commercial and non-commercial beverage services worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2010 Nestlé acquired Liverpool-based Vitaflo, a maker of clinical nutrition products for people with metabolic disorders. Also in August it completed the sale of Alcon to Novartis. The pharmaceutical maker acquired Nestlé's stake in Alcon in two steps, beginning with the sale of a 25% stake for $11 billion in July 2008. Novartis exercised its option to buy Nestlé's remaining percentage of Alcon for $28 billion in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2011, Nestlé acquired the Oscar stocks and sauces business from Paulig Group, building Nestlé Professional's presence in the culinary flavors sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2014, Nestlé acquired L'Oreal's 50% stake in
   <company id="110453">
    Galderma
   </company>
   , a joint venture formed by the two companies in 1981. Going forward, Galderma will operate as the pharmaceutical arm of Nestlé Skin Health S.A., established in June 2014 as a fully-owned Nestlé subsidiary.
