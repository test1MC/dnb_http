   healthy foods, and other grocery brands. The company also offers food service and private-label services. Its product lines, sold predominantly through major US retailers like

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and top grocery-store chains, hold top market-share positions across several food product categories. Pinnacle Foods went public in 2013.

  <p>
   Pinnacle manages three main business segments grouped by product: the Birds Eye Frozen segment, the Duncan Hines Grocery segment, and the Specialty Foods segment. Its Birds Eye Frozen segment, which generated 46% of the company's total sales during 2015, owns brands including: Birds Eye, Gardein, C&amp;W, McKenzie's, and Freshlike frozen vegetables, Hungry-Man frozen dinners, Aunt Jemima frozen breakfasts, Van de Kamp's and Mrs. Paul's frozen prepared seafood, Lender's frozen and refrigerated bagels, and Celeste frozen pizza.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Duncan Hines Grocery segment (41% of sales), boasts a variety of products including: Duncan Hines baking mixes, pies, pastries, and frostings, Vlasic pickles, Wish-Bone and Western salad dressings, Mrs. Butterworth's and Log Cabin table syrups, Armour canned meats, Brooks and Nalley chili, and Open Pit barbecue sauces.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Specialty Foods segment (13% of sales) brings in the remainder of revenue, and manages brands including: Erin's popcorn, Tim's Cascade Snacks, Hawaiian kettle chips, Snyder of Berlin and Husman's snacks. It also manages the company's food service and private label businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distributes its products throughout the US and Canada, mainly through a national broker to supermarkets and other retail food operations. Operations are supported by a product-development center, 12 US manufacturing and warehouse facilities, and more than 40 US and Canadian distribution centers.

  <p>
   The US is Pinnacle Foods' largest market, accounting for 96% of sales during 2015. The rest of its sales came from Canada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The food giant's customers include convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, and club stores, as well as private-label, military, and food service channels. Its top ten customers made up 60% of its net sales in 2015, with its largest,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , continuing to account for more than 25% of its total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinnacle promotes its consumer brands via television, radio, and print advertising, consumer and trade promotions, direct marketing, and mobile and social marketing channels. The company puts most of its ad dollars behind its leadership brands (Duncan Hines, Birds Eye). The company spent $177 million on marketing and selling costs in 2015, compared to $177 million and $175 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Its advertising costs trended down to $28 million in 2015, down from $36 million and $34 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   Pinnacle's sales have slowly risen over the past few years as the food giant has expanded its brand lines largely by acquiring specialty food companies. Its profits have been growing faster as the company has kept a lid on rising operating costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net sales climbed 2% to $2.65 billion in 2015, mostly thanks to double-digit sales growth from the Birds Eye Frozen segment driven by the Garden Protein brand acquisition, rising volume/mix, and higher price realizations. Sales on the Birds Eye frozen vegetable and Birds Eye Voila! prepared bag meals rose thanks to distribution expansion measures and newly launched products such as the
   <em>
    Birds Eye Steamfresh Flavor Full, Protein Blends, Disney
   </em>
   -themed side dishes for kids and
   <em>
    Birds Eye Voila!
   </em>
   Non-chicken varieties. Duncan Hines Grocery segment sales fell 3.4% on less favorable volume/mix, though Log Cabin syrups and Vlasic pickles sales grew. Its Specialty Foods segment sales declined 2.4% on lower sales volumes mostly on its private label canned meat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite rising sales in 2015, Pinnacle's net income tumbled 14% to $212 million mostly because in 2014 it received a non-recurring windfall -- a $163 million termination fee from
   <company id="14965">
    Tyson Foods
   </company>
   related to the cancellation of
   <company id="162837">
    Hillshire Brand
   </company>
   's attempted acquisition of Pinnacle that year. Excluding this item, gross profits actually grew by 9%. The food giant's operating cash levels dropped 32% to $373 million as it used more cash toward building its inventories to take advantage of favorable crop yields and to increase its innovation-related products and because its accounts receivables balances grew from the timing of sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   Pinnacle's growth strategy includes putting most of its resources behind its leadership brands -- including Birds Eye, Duncan Hines and others -- defined as brands that hold the #1 or #2 spot in their categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The food giant also looks to make strategic acquisitions to add diversity to its brand lines, especially in the healthy foods category judging by its more recent acquisitions of Boulder Brands and Garden Protein International made in 2016 and 2014.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In January 2016, Pinnacle Foods acquired healthy food maker
   <company id="160814">
    Boulder Brands
   </company>
   for $982 million. The acquired brands included gluten-free snacks Glutino and Udi's, as well as EVOL frozen foods and Smart Balance spreads. With the continued growth of "healthy brands", the move gave Pinnacle a great entree into that space.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2014, Pinnacle purchased Canada-based Garden Protein International, the manufacturer of the plant-based protein Gardein brand, for $153.8 million to broaden its Birds Eye Frozen segment product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2013 Pinnacle acquired the Wish-Bone salad dressings business from
   <company id="55275">
    Unilever plc
   </company>
   for $575 million to expand its range of branded food products. The deal includes a broad range of liquid and dry-mix salad dressing flavors under the Wish-Bone and Western brand names.

   Before it went public in 2013, Pinnacle Foods was owned by

    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   and its affiliates, which acquired operating subsidiary
   <company id="53702">
