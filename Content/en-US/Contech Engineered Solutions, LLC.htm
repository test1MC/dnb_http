  <p>
   Contech's products are used in construction and civil engineering projects worldwide, as well as ones focused on green building and construction. The company is a leader in precast modular bridges under the CON/SPAN name. With more than 7,000 CON/SPAN installations since 1983, Contech claims this design is used by more state departments of transportation than any other bridge system on the market. Its range of bridge designs and structures can be used to create everything from canal enclosures and tunnels to skywalks and stream crossings.

  <p>
   Contech has traditionally grown its US business and expanded its product lines through strategic acquisitions, purchasing more than 20 companies since 1999. In 2014, Contech purchased Filterra Bioretention Systems along with the company's advanced Filterra storm water treatment technology that uses biorentention to remove pollutants (such as total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients, hydrocarbons, and metals) from storm water.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing increased raw materials costs, the company has also not been opposed to raising its product prices. In late 2014, for example, the company increased its concrete product prices by 3%, its steel product prices by 5%, and its plastic and geotextile product prices by 8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contech has also formed alliances in recent years to broaden its product lines. By partnering with Tokyo-based SEKISUI SPR Group in late 2012, Contech secured a 20-year exclusive license (covering the US and Canada) to make, promote, and sell the SPR PE product, a spiral-wound HDPE (High-density polyethylene) product used to make structural pipeline rehabilitation systems (used to rehabilitate mostly gravity pipelines) in a joint-less fashion without excessive site disruption.

  <p>
   In May 2013, to broaden its storm water product line, Contech acquired Imbrium Systems Group from Monteco Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, to extend its geographic reach into the South and Midwest and bolster its material product lines, Contech purchased corrugated metal pipe assets maker Titan Construction Products in New Mexico and Kahn Culvert in Kansas.

  <p>
   Contech's management changed hands in 2012 when a consortium of equity firms, including Anchorage Capital, Farallon Capital,
   <company id="111384">
    Littlejohn &amp; Co.
   </company>
   , and Tennenbaum Capital, acquired control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contech had been previously owned by Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners (2010-2012), and Apax Partners before that (pre-2010). With housing and commercial construction markets weakened by the economic downturn, Contech in late 2010 had completed a balance sheet restructuring that reduced its debt by approximately $240 million. Soon after, Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners took over as Contech's majority owner from investment firm

    Apax Partners
   </company>
   , which retained an equity stake in the business until 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contech traces its roots to 1900, when the American Rolling Mill Company (ARMCO) was founded.
