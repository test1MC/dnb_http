   Gerry Weber International is one of the world's best-known German fashion and lifestyle companies, boasting more than 700 Houses of Gerry Weber and mono-label shops around the globe. The clothing company sells several brands of women's apparel: Gerry Weber (mid-to-upper range), Taifun (junior), and Samoon (large sizes). Its wholesale segment sports some 2,800 shops-in-shops. Though most of its business comes from Germany, the company has distribution channels in 62 countries, mostly in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. The Gerry Weber brand was created in 1986; the company changed its name to its popular label in 1989.

  <p>
   Gerry Weber operates two main business segments: Wholesale and Retail.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Wholesale segment consists of retail partners and franchisees who order the company's garments and sell them through their own stores for their own account. This includes shop and shop areas, which are managed by wholesale partners, and multi-label businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Retail segment generates more than 45% of revenue, and consists of company managed Houses of Gerry Weber (which bring in three-fourths of the segment's sales) and mono label stores, along with concession stores, factory outlets, and national online shops.

  <p>
   Gerry Weber's sales have been steadily climbing in recent years, with revenue inching up by less than 1% to €852.1 million (about $1.07 billion) in fiscal 2014 (ended October). The past year's growth was mostly driven by 11% growth in the company's Retail business sales as the company expanded its network of stores and increased its e-commerce sales with new online outlets in four European countries. The Wholesale segment, however, declined by 8%, which offset much of the top-line growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income also grew by less than 1% to €71.4 million (about $90 million) in fiscal 2014, mostly because of higher revenue and positive changes in inventories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operations provided €68.3 million (roughly $86.1 million), or 26% more cash than in fiscal 2013, mostly as the company used more cash to build up its inventories.

  <p>
   Gerry Weber has been following a strategy of aggressive international expansion in recent years. In early 2015, the company announced its plans to add 65 to 75 of its Retail stores to its portfolio every year, focusing on openings in the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2014, the company introduced its Gerry Weber EU Online Shop to expand its e-commerce revenue in Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Sweden. That year it also acquired the retail outlet Hallhuber to expand its brands to younger women's fashion. It also purchased 17 Gerry Weber franchised shops in Norway for approximately €14 million.

   In 2014, the company purchased all shares of Hallhuber, a Munich-based fashion manufacturer and retailer that specializes in women's fashion and targets a younger clientele (mid-20s and older), from private equity firm Change Capital Partners LLP.
