   Depsite a name that means "little pine tree," Komatsu produces an evergreen lineup of big equipment. The company is the world's #2 construction equipment maker, behind

   . Komatsu builds and sells building and mining equipment, from bulldozers and wheel loaders to dump trucks and debris crushers. Komatsu also produces industrial machinery, such as laser-cutting tools, wire saws, and sheet-metal presses. Other lines include generators, light armored vehicles, and diesel engines. Its engineering and construction arm supplies prefabricated structures, contracting, real estate sales, and leasing services.

   Komatsu operates through almost 180 companies (among this total are some 140 subsidiaries). The company's core segment -- Construction, Mining and Utility Equipment --  generated 89% of total sales in 2015. Industrial Machinery and Others accounted for the remainder of revenue.

  <p>
   Komatsu's net sales increased 1% from 2014 to 2015 due to increased sales from its Construction, Mining and Utility Equipment (1%) and Industrial Machinery and Others (6%) segments. These segments were helped by additional sales of presses and other forging machines, centering on capital investment, especially in the automobile manufacturing industry.

  <p>
   In a more environmentally conscious world, Komatsu's blueprint for growth involves introducing products that feature lighter environmental impact. The Dantotsu line, for example, is touted as 25% more fuel efficiency with lower CO2 emissions than previous models. The hybrid hydraulic excavator, Komatsu's flagship product, promises to scoop up sales in China and other strategic international sectors. The company is also expanding its hybrid electric forklift truck line, and aims to combine its production with building compact construction equipment lines.

   Komatsu's future relies heavily on integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) with its products and parts. Its ICT focus led to the development of the Komatsu Machine Tracking System (KOMTRAX), now standard on its construction equipment. It also spurred introduction of the world's first Autonomous Haulage System (AHS); copper mining giant

   uses the remote-control system to run huge dump trucks at its copper mine in Chile. Komatsu's AHS is used at a mine in Australia, too. The company looks to further leverage other ICT applications to its portfolio.

  <p>
   Komatsu's roots reach back to the Takeuchi Mining Company, founded in Japan in 1894. The company grew during WWI, and in 1917 it created an in-house ironworks to make machine tools and mining equipment. The ironworks was separated in 1921 to create Komatsu Manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm grew into one of Japan's major makers of machine tools and pumps by adding new products to its line. Komatsu introduced its first metal press in 1924 and in 1931 made Japan's first crawler-type farm tractor. Komatsu began making high-grade casting and specialty steel materials in 1935.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Komatsu made munitions and bulldozers for the Japanese Navy. After the war it began making construction machinery and industrial vehicles as Japan rebuilt its infrastructure. The company began building diesel engines in 1948. Komatsu continued to expand during the 1950s. In 1952 it began producing motor graders, which became its first construction equipment to be exported (to Argentina) in 1955.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Komatsu entered joint ventures with US manufacturers, including Cummins Engine (1961), Bucyrus Erie (1963), and International Harvester (now
   <company id="11063">
    Navistar
   </company>
   , 1965). Komatsu established its first overseas subsidiary, Komatsu Europe, in Belgium in 1967 and introduced the world's first radio-controlled bulldozer. The company changed its name to Komatsu Limited in 1970.
