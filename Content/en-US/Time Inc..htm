   The economic recession in the US has had a significant impact on Time Inc, part of an industry that was already struggling to compete with the increasing amount of free or low-cost content made available by the explosion of digital publishing.

   Time Inc. is dealing with a massive shift of readers and marketers to the Internet and digital readers. The company launched versions of some of its magazines for Apple's iPad. The issues are available through Apple's iTunes App Store for download, a single issue at a time. At this point it offers all of US titles on multiple digital devices and platforms, allowing subscribers to the print edition free digital access.

   In 2014 the company acquired Cozi Inc., a Seattle-based maker of mobile and digital family organizing tools. In 2013 the company acquired
   <company id="107500">
    American Express Publishing Corporation
   </company>
   , the former publishing operations of
   <company id="10085">
    American Express
   </company>
   . The deal came after a 20-year partnership under which Time Inc. managed those publishing operations.

   Henry R. Luce founded Time Inc. with Briton Hadden in 1922. Its first magazines included
   <i>
    Time
   </i>
   (1923),
   <i>
    FORTUNE
   </i>
   (1930), and
   <i>
    LIFE
   </i>
   (1936).
   <i>
    Sports Illustrated
   </i>
   was launched in 1954. Time Life Books was created in 1961, and subsequent acquisitions included venerable Boston-based hardcover publisher Little, Brown and Company (1968), Book-of-the-Month Club (1977), and
   <i>
    Southern Living
   </i>
   publisher Southern Progress (1985).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company merged with Warner Communications, and Time Inc. became a subsidiary of the media giant. The subsequent acquisition of
   <i>
    Sunset
   </i>
   magazine publisher Lane Publishing and the launch of magazines such as
   <i>
    Entertainment Weekly
   </i>
   (1990) and
   <i>
    Martha Stewart Living
   </i>
   (1991) helped the company to continue on the expansion track. During the mid-1990s Time Inc. bought an interest in
   <company id="41416">
    Hoover's
   </company>
   (publisher of this profile; the company was sold to
   <company id="10483">
    D&amp;B
   </company>
   in 2003) and debuted
   <i>
    In Style
   </i>
   magazine. Time Warner also unveiled Pathfinder, a portal for online versions of Time Inc.'s magazines. Don Logan was named CEO of Time Inc. in 1994 and became chairman three years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Time sold
   <i>
    Martha Stewart Living
   </i>
   magazine and several other Martha Stewart properties back to the domesticity maven herself. Two years later Time Warner shuttered the unsuccessful Pathfinder. Also in 1999 magazine peddler American Family Publishers (50%-owned by Time Inc.) filed for bankruptcy and settled several class-action lawsuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   America Online agreed to buy Time Warner in early 2000. Time then announced that it would discontinue publishing
   <i>
    LIFE
   </i>
   magazine on a monthly basis and switch to issuing periodic special issues. Time's Book-of-the-Month Club also partnered with Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct book club to form BOOKSPAN, an enterprise that will combine book clubs' e-commerce and new products efforts (Doubleday and Book-of-the-Month Club continued to operate separate book clubs).
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2000 the company unveiled
   <i>
    eCompany Now,
   </i>
   a magazine and website focused on business and the Internet. Expanding its online publishing profile, Time Inc.'s Time Warner Trade Publishing unit introduced iPublish.com to distribute and sell fiction and nonfiction via the Web. (The company shut down iPublish.com by the end of 2001.) Time Inc. later bought Tribune Company's Times Mirror Magazines (
   <i>
    Popular Science, Field &amp; Stream
   </i>
   ) for $475 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 AOL (then called America Online) completed its acquisition of Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Subsequently, Time Inc. and Time Warner Trade Publishing became subsidiaries of AOL Time Warner. AOL Time Warner soon began streamlining, and 400 jobs were eliminated at Time. Later that year Times Mirror Magazines was renamed Time4 Media, and AOL Time Warner bought
   <i>
    Business 2.0
   </i>
   from Imagine Media for almost $70 million and merged the title with its
   <em>
    eCompany Now
   </em>
   title. It also completed a $1.6 billion acquisition of IPC Media, the UK's largest magazine publisher with more than 100 titles. In late 2001 the company shut down three titles (
   <i>
    Asiaweek, On, Family Life
   </i>
   ) blaming the bad advertising market. It also increased its stake in subscription marketing company Synapse from 25% to more than 80%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company's Time4Media division acquired the licensing and syndication rights to the public television series
   <i>
    This Old House
   </i>
   including its trademark and website. (Time Inc. already publishes the magazine associated with the program.) In 2002 Logan was promoted to an executive position within AOL Time Warner; he was replaced by Ann Moore, a longtime Time executive. That year, the company closed its struggling
   <i>
    Mutual Funds
   </i>
   magazine and its
   <i>
    Sports Illustrated Women
   </i>
   title.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 AOL Time Warner dropped the "AOL" from its name, making the name of Time's parent company
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   once again. (Time Warner eventually spun off
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   as an independent company in 2009, with Time Inc. remaining a subsidiary of the significantly slimmed down Time Warner.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, the company sold one of its direct marketing businesses, Time Life Inc., which sells "As Seen On TV" music collections such as
   <i>
    Sounds of the 80s
   </i>
   and
   <em>
    The Singers &amp; Songwriters Collection,
   </em>
   to Direct Holdings Worldwide, which also owns the
   <company id="12111">
    Lillian Vernon Corporation
   </company>
   . The company debuted lifestyle title
   <em>
    Cottage Living
   </em>
   in 2004 and car racing magazine
   <em>
    Racing Fan
   </em>
   in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time Inc. decided to make the content of about a dozen of its online magazine (
   <i>
    Entertainment Weekly, People
   </i>
   ) sites available only to magazine subscribers, AOL users, or newsstand buyers. The company reversed this decision in 2005, making the content available again to all visitors. Time Inc. expanded geographically into Latin America in 2005 with its purchase of Mexican publisher Grupo Editorial Expansion, which owns about 15 titles. Also in 2005 the company announced it would lay off some 100 employees as part of a reorganization.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company cut another approximately 70 positions in early 2006, as a result of consolidation of certain functions. Also in 2006 Time Inc. sold its Time Warner Book Group unit (now
   <company id="103158">
    Hatchette Book Group USA
   </company>
   ) to French media company
   <company id="41009">
    Lagardère
   </company>
   . That year Time Inc. picked up golf news site Golf.com to boost its golfing portfolio. It also sold its
   <em>
    Progressive Farmer
   </em>
   magazine to
   <company id="15373">
    DTN
   </company>
   in 2006. CEO Ann Moore said the sale allows the company to devote more resources to its biggest, most profitable titles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time Inc. stopped publishing the print version of
   <em>
    Life
   </em>
   magazine in 2007. Also that year close to 300 employees (2% of its total staff) at its magazines were let go. Time Inc. cited its "transformation into a multi-platform publisher" as the reason, as that year the company began focusing more on digital offerings. Later that year, in a big shakeup, Time Inc. sold 18 of its smaller titles, including its parenting magazines and most of its
   <company id="118951">
    Time4Media
   </company>
   unit (
   <em>
    Popular Science
   </em>
   and
   <i>
    Field &amp; Stream)
   </i>
   to
   <company id="99066">
    Bonnier AB
   </company>
   for some $220 million. In addition, after failing to sell it, the company ceased publication of
   <em>
    Business 2.0
   </em>
   with the October 2007 issue of the magazine. In 2008 Time Inc. cut about 600 jobs (some 6% of employees).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 it relaunched RealSimple.com and expanded People.com and Time.com.  The company saved the iconic photography magazine
   <em>
    Life
   </em>
   in 2009 by keeping it alive as an online-only brand. It did so through the launch of of Life.com, a joint venture with
   <company id="56083">
    Getty Images
   </company>
   that houses a collection of photos from the archives of Time and Getty. (Time Inc. had revived
   <em>
    Life
   </em>
   magazine for distribution in newspapers in 2004, only to stop publishing the print magazine in 2007.)
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of the down economy and its disasterous effect on the advertising industry, Time Inc. in 2009 cut $100 million in costs and made significant layoffs (between 400 and 500 people, mostly from the news division, which includes
   <em>
    Time
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Fortune
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Sports Illustrated
   </em>
   ).  Also in 2009 the company sold its Southern Living at Home, a direct sales company that operated through
   <company id="110139">
    Southern Progress Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Moore retired from the CEO position (she had been at the company for some 30 years) and was replaced by Jack Griffin.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company turned heads in 2011 when it fired Griffin after he had served less than six months on the job. Griffin was a former executive at
   <company id="10989">
    Meredith Corporation
   </company>
   , and was the first outsider named CEO in Time Inc.'s history. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes concluded that Griffin's "leadership style and approach did not mesh with Time Inc. and Time Warner".
