   Axion International Holdings surveyed the landscape and decided to shift into a new line of business. Formerly operating as Analytical Surveys, the company completed a reverse merger with Axion in 2008 and adopted that company's name and line of business. Axion is a licensee of technology regarding the manufacture of plasticÂ composites used for structural applications such as railroad crossties, bridge infrastructure, marine pilings. and bulk headings. While the company is initially targeting the railroad industry, it has yet to generate any significant revenues.

  <p>
   John Thorpe, a pioneer of geographic information systems technology, went to school in the Netherlands and South Africa. He owned an aerial survey company in Johannesburg for 12 years before founding Analytical Surveys, Inc. (ASI) in 1981. ASI went public in 1984. Business slumped in the late 1980s, and in 1990 Thorpe brought in electronics industry executive Sidney Corder as president. Corder was appointed CEO in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   ASI began acquiring rival and complementary companies in 1995, expanding its services and geographic reach. It acquired Westinghouse Landmark (now ASI Landmark), a provider of property mapping services, in 1996. It nearly doubled its revenues in 1997 when it acquired rival MSE (mapping for utilities). That year Thorpe retired as chairman and was succeeded by Corder.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 ASI increased its production capabilities by acquiring Cartotech and Cartographic Sciences (data conversion), as well as Measurement Science (global positioning data collection). Despite its acquisition-spurred growth, ASI sold its MSE division in 1999 to better focus on the spatial data market. The company's trouble integrating acquisitions led to a bungled accounting job for fiscal 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following a restatement of earnings, ASI cut its workforce by 18% in 2000. Shareholders responded with lawsuits and Corder retired from the company. James Rothe became chairman, and Sol Miller, co-founder and ex-chairman of MSE, was named interim CEO. Later that year Norman Rokosh (who came to the company from
   <company id="57443">
    PricewaterhouseCoopers
   </company>
   ) was named president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 ASI sold its Colorado Springs, Colorado-based mapping office to Sanborn Map Company for $10 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio, Texas. After cutting staff in 2005, ASI moved to a smaller building in San Antonio.
