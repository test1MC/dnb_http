   You'd call them red, yellow, and green. Kelly-Moore Paint Company might dub them Gatsby Brick, Sunlit Plaza, and Emerald Lights. By whatever hue, Kelly-Moore aims to show that the paint business isn't entirely run by multinational big brushes like
   <company id="11350">
    Sherwin-Williams
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   . The employee-owned company produces about 20 million gallons of paint per year and owns and operates more than 145 stores in seven states west of the Mississippi River. Kelly-Moore sells about 400 types of paints, finishes, and sundries to professional contractors and painters and to the do-it-yourself market.

  <p>
   The company owns and operates more than 145 retail stores in Arkansas, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas. It also has authorized dealers in Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, North Dakota, and Utah. Kelly-Moore has manufacturing plants in San Carlos, California, and Hurst, Texas. California is its largest market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kelly-Moore exports its paint products to Africa, Asia (China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam), Central Asia (the Russian Republics), and Europe (Greece).

   Kelly-Moore focuses on architectural and decorative paints, although it also produces industrial maintenance coatings. It bills itself as a leader of waterborne-coating technology and the first major paint company to offer recycled paints. The company's full range of paint products include zero volatile organic compound (zero-VOC) and low-odor paint lines.

  <p>
   Kelly-Moore is growing by expanding geographically. It added 13 stores in its lucrative Northern California market in 2014. In 2013 the firm also opened new stores in the Bay Area (San Francisco and Lafayette), boosting it total stores in the region to 63.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also grows through product innovation. In 2013 it introduced the ColorStudio Collection, inspired by the unique architecture, light, hues, neighborhoods, and lifestyles of the West. It features 1,700 new colors.

  <p>
   In 2012 Kelly-Moore teamed up with Miller Paint in a strategic alliance in the Puget Sound market that saw the transfer of ownership of a handful of Kelly-Moore outlets to Miller in exchange for Miller promoting Kelly-Moore's paints at its stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched a new zero-VOC paint in 2012. The non-toxic product is part of Kelly-Moore's strategy to meet California's stringent environmental regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 it launched Enviro Coat Reflective 1545, one of the industry's first commercially produced architectural coatings designed to reflect the sun's radiant heat. The acrylic paint also helps lower external wall temperature, which helps homeowners save on energy costs. The paint comes in six ready-mixed stock colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company opened a store in Paso Robles, Kelly-Moore's fourth store in California's Central Coast. It also has stores in stores in Atascadero, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Maria.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed by William Kelly and William Moore in 1946.
