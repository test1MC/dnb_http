   Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is out to prove that lightning
   <em>
    can
   </em>
   strike the same place twice. The company, one of several business segments of parent
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   , manufactures military aircraft such as the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics operates from three product divisions: Combat Aircraft, Air Mobility, and Other Aeronautics Programs (rapid prototype applications, unmanned aerial vehicles, and hybrid airships). Its sister company, Lockheed Martin AeroParts, supplies new production parts to other Lockheed Martin facilities for the F-16, C-130, U-2, and F-22 aircraft. The US government is the company's largest customer.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the company's facilities and offices are located in California, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Texas.

  <p>
   The Combat Aircraft division designs and manufactures systems support for fighter aircraft including the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the F-22 Raptor, and the F-16 Fighting Falcon (primarily sold to foreign governments). Lockheed Martin Aeronautics teamed up with Korea Aerospace Industries to develop the Korean T-50 supersonic jet trainer aircraft. Additionally, it is partnered with Japan in the production of the F-2 fighter aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's F-22 Raptor is another success story for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Like the F-35, the F-22 is considered a fifth-generation fighter, meaning it offers supersonic speeds, stealth capabilities, high levels of maneuverability, and sophisticated information transmittal capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lockheed Aeronautics' Air Mobility division designs and produces systems support for strategic and tactical airlift aircraft such as the C-130J Super Hercules and the C-5A/B/C/M Galaxy. The unit's Advanced Research and Development division creates new technology advancements for existing aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   Falling under the category of Other Aeronautics Programs, which includes advanced research and development, is Lockheed Aeronautics' Advanced Development Programs (ADP) organization. Also known as Skunk Works, ADP develops advanced technology and cutting-edge aircraft. Skunk Works, which got its name from the Li'l Abner comic strip, is focused on developing such systems as unmanned aircraft, and taking long-range strike, ISR (intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance), and situational awareness capabilities to the next generation.

   Lockheed became the undisputed king of US fighter makers when it bested long-time rival

   </company>
   for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) contract. The JSF is envisioned as becoming the primary fighter of the US and the UK militaries (for at least a couple of decades). Valued at more than $200 billion over the life of the deal, the contract specifies separate models for

    Navy

   , and

   applications: the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) version is designed for landing strips; the Navy version is strengthened for aircraft carrier usage (CV, carrier variant); and the Marines version is designed for short-takeoff/vertical-landing (STOVL).
  </p>
  <p>
   The F-35 program accounted for 14% of the company's total revenue in 2012. US government customers as a whole accounted for 78% of its total revenue in 2012, while international clients accounted for 22%.
