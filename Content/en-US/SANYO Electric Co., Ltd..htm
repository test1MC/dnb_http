   "Sanyo" means "three oceans" in Japanese, and when it comes to electronics, SANYO covers the waterfront. The manufacturing powerhouse has more than 200 subsidiaries worldwide. Its products and services are divided among four business segments: energy, electronics, ecology, and international. Its companies make a variety of electrical devices and appliances, including industrial and commercial equipment (refrigerated supermarket cases, biomedical equipment, and solar cells), audio and video equipment, communications equipment, lithium-ion batteries, and home appliances. As a subsidiary of
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic Corporation
   </company>
   , SANYO Electric has been moving into more eco-friendly products and services.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Toshio Iue, SANYO's first CEO, had the "three oceans" (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian) in mind -- he wanted to turn the company into an international enterprise. SANYO was formed after WWII when the Allies broke Matsushita Electric (now named
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic Corporation
   </company>
   ) into two companies. Toshio, brother-in-law to Matsushita founder Konosuke Matsushita, took charge of SANYO, which then made bicycle lamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1949 the company was producing radios, and in the 1950s it diversified into refrigerators, fans, and washing machines. In 1953 a Japanese household appliances rush began, and SANYO led washing machine sales. By the end of the decade, the company was Japan's leading exporter of transistor radios.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise money, in 1959 SANYO created Tokyo SANYO Electric, in which it took a 20% stake. The company established its first factory abroad, in Hong Kong, in 1961 and created Cadnica, a durable rechargeable battery.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1970s oil crisis drew SANYO into alternative energy development, and the company continued its energy research when the crisis had passed. In 1973 SANYO joined forces with
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   (US) to bail out Emerson's Fisher electronics subsidiary. (SANYO bought Fisher in 1978.) SANYO began shifting its focus from appliances to high-tech products in the mid-1970s. It started making color TVs in the US in 1976. Although sales slowed when SANYO initially opted to develop VCRs using the ill-fated Betamax format, they rose tremendously in the 1970s, from $71 million in 1972 to $855 million in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   SANYO and Tokyo SANYO Electric merged in 1986. A high yen forced the company to move much of its manufacturing outside Japan; that year it made more products abroad than any other Japanese company. By then the country's leading TV maker, SANYO formed a joint venture with
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   to manufacture TVs. SANYO also developed the world's first CFC-free refrigeration system, a version of which was installed in New York's Guggenheim Museum.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 SANYO set a world record for solar-energy conversion efficiency. The company strengthened its electronic components and solar businesses two years later by establishing SANYO Electronic Components and SANYO Solar Industries. In 1997 SANYO introduced the highest-output home-use solar cells, capable of producing 160 watts of electricity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company formed a pact with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   to make semiconductors using Big Blue's energy-saving copper-circuit technology. The next year SANYO allied with
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   to develop semiconductors and related products. Weakness in the Asian economy, a slowdown in US sales, and overall decreased demand hammered SANYO's earnings for fiscal 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999 SANYO teamed up with
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   to develop flat-panel displays based on next-generation organic electroluminescent technology. The company announced several product developments, including an advanced battery for hybrid-fuel vehicles and an air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor that uses carbon dioxide instead of Freon. It signed a deal with
   <company id="59400">
    Turbolinux
   </company>
   to equip 20,000 medical workstations with the company's version of the Linux operating system -- the largest enterprise deployment of Linux thus far.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid charges of knowingly selling defective solar cell systems, president Sadao Kondo resigned in 2000. He was replaced by Yukinori Kuwano. In 2001 SANYO acquired
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   's nickel metal hydride battery business, solidifying its position as one of the world's leading battery manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company formed an alliance with China's largest consumer electronics maker,
   <company id="105148">
    Haier Group
   </company>
   , whereby SANYO sells its products through Haier's outlets and service centers and, in turn, selected Haier goods are sold in Japan. (This alliance was dissolved in 2007 due to slow sales.)
  </p>
  <p>
   SANYO's three-year initiative (launched 2001) resulted in the sale of the troubled vending-machine manufacturing operations (2002). The initiative also led to the restructuring of the company's Home Appliances business, including shifting production of home-use air conditioners to China. In 2003 SANYO further reorganized, resulting in four business groups (Consumer, Commercial, Component, and Service), each corresponding to a customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year SANYO and
   <company id="10500">
    Eastman Kodak
   </company>
   agreed to jointly fund production of full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays; OLED displays feature full-motion images viewable from very wide angles. Also in 2003 SANYO turned wholly owned SANYO Electric Software Co. into a 50/50 joint venture with
   <company id="55721">
    NTT DATA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company shook up its management ranks in 2005, electing former newscaster Tomoyo Nonaka as chairman; the move made her one of only a few women to head major Japanese companies. Toshimasa Iue, the grandson of Sanyo's founder, became president.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2007 Nonaka resigned -- citing "personal reasons" -- amid an accounting scandal at the struggling company. Later that year Iue resigned, reportedly over company restructuring. He was replaced by Seiichiro Sano.
  </p>
  <p>
   After about a year of negotiating and navigating antitrust regulations, SANYO became more than 50%-owned by rival Panasonic. The move allows Panasonic to shift gears to become a top supplier of batteries for hybrid cars and breathe down the neck of competitor Sony for an increased share of the consumer electronics market.
  </p>
  <p>
   On April 1, 2011, SANYO Electric became a wholly owned subsidiary of Panasonic. Later in the year, Panasonic sold SANYO's home appliance business, which centers on washing machine and refrigerator manufacturing, to China's
   <company id="105148">
    Haier Group
   </company>
   .
