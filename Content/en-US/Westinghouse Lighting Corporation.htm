  <p>
   WLC traces its roots to entrepreneur and inventor George Westinghouse, the man who illuminated the 1893 World's Fair, and whose championing of alternating current (AC) (instead of direct current (DC) system) led to the electrification of US homes. Formerly known as Angelo Brothers, the company changed its name in 2003. Six years earlier, Stan Angelo, an executive for his family's lamp business, purchased the rights to the

   brand for lighting and ceiling fan products. Chairman Stan Angelo and his brother, president and CEO Raymond Angelo, lead Westinghouse Electric.
