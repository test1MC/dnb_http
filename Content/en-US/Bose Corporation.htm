   Bose has built a reputation for making high-quality products through its commitment to research in electronics and acoustical engineering. The audio company's research focus has taken it into new fields in recent years. Through its Bose Automotive Systems Division, it was chosen as the audio-components company to provide products for fuel-efficient and luxury cars alike. In 2015, bose launched the Bose Panaray Sound System -- its first Advanced Technology Series system -- for the Cadillac CT6. Bose also makes the Energy Efficient Series Sound System for the

   Volt, as well as the custom-engineered 5.1 surround sound system for the
   <company id="112983">
    Porsche
   </company>
   Panamera four-door sedan. The company provides a sound system specifically for truck drivers with its The Bose Ride system, which replaces conventional air-ride truck seats to provide over-the-road drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bose's commitment to product development is what enables the company to pump out new products for several niches of the industry. Bose has been developing an electromagnetic suspension system for automobiles since the 1980s and its acquisition of testing equipment maker EnduraTEC has built on that foundation. To this end, Bose has been nimble enough to take advantage of popular trends its sees, such as the debut of its SoundDock digital music system that was launched based on the continued success of
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's iPod. In 2013 Bose introduced the SoundTouch Wi-Fi music system, which lets users stream music wirelessly in any room.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus more on its core products, Bose sold its ElectroForce Systems Group, which offered advanced test instruments for materials research and product development, to TA Instruments in mid-2015.

  <p>
   Music and electronics struck a chord in Amar Bose, the son of an Indian emigrant from Calcutta. As a youngster he studied violin and liked fixing electronic gadgets. A teenaged Bose started a radio repair shop in his basement during WWII that turned out to be the family's main source of income when his father's import business faltered during the war. Bose's interest in electronics led him to college at MIT in 1947.
  </p>
  <p>
   His quest to develop a better sound system began nearly a decade later when the hi-fi stereo he bought as a reward for doing well in his graduate studies made his violin record sound shrill. MIT allowed Bose to research the topic while he taught there. He formed his namesake company in 1964 and hired as its first employee Sherwin Greenblatt, a former student who later became company president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bose discovered that most speaker systems funneled sound directly at the listener, while live concerts sent sound directly and indirectly by bouncing it off walls, floors, and ceilings. He designed a system in which only some speakers are aimed at the listener while others reflect the sounds around the room. Calling the concept "reflected sound," Bose began selling his 901 stereo speakers in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   A feud with
   <i>
    Consumer Reports
   </i>
   showed the arrogant side of the self-made entrepreneur. After the magazine concluded in a 1970 review that Bose speakers created a sound that tended to "wander around the room," Bose sued, claiming product disparagement. (The lawsuit was settled 13 years later when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of
   <i>

   </i>
   .) Bose began making professional loudspeakers in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   After trying and failing to gain market share in Japan throughout the 1970s, in 1978 Bose hired sales executive Sumi Sakura, who convinced 400 Japanese dealers to find space in their jam-packed stores for Bose products. Sales jumped within months. Bose also turned his attention to car stereos in the 1970s. After promising talks with
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   in 1979, he risked $13 million and four years developing a stereo that could be custom-designed for cars. The first one was offered in 1983 in a Cadillac Seville. Contracts with other major carmakers followed, usually for their top-of-the-line models.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s the company took its technology to TVs. With an agreeable guinea pig in
   <company id="11660">
    Zenith
   </company>
   , Bose developed a speaker tube that could coil inside the set without adding much bulk. The set was a hit, even with a price tag of more than $1,400 (in 1987). The firm's speakers were also used in several space shuttle flights, beginning in 1992 with

  <p>
   The critically acclaimed Wave radio was introduced in 1993 and has been a huge success ever since. A year later Bose acquired professional loudspeaker maker US Sound from Carver. In 1996 it teamed up with satellite TV firm PRIMESTAR to offer the home theater Companion systems. (The systems were discontinued in 1999, dissolving the partnership.) The next year Bose and
   <company id="10796">
    IBM

   paired up to upgrade the quality of PC sound systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bose upped the ante on its retail operations in 1997 when it began opening more upscale showcase stores where audiophiles could test sound systems at in-store music theaters. The company began making its sound systems for more mainstream cars, such as the Chevrolet Blazer, the following year. In 1999 Bose began selling its products online and introduced a new version of its popular Wave radio (with a CD player). In 2001 Bose introduced the Bose Wave/PC interactive system that provides one-touch access to Internet radio, digital audio files, AM/FM radio, and CDs through a personal computer.
