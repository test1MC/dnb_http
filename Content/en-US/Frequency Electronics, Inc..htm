   Frequency Electronics, Inc. (FEI) lets the good times roll. The company makes quartz-, rubidium-, and cesium-based time and frequency control products, such as oscillators and amplifiers, used to synchronize voice, data, and video transmissions in satellite and wireless communications. The US military uses its products for navigation, communications, surveillance, and timing systems in aircraft, satellites, radar, and missiles. Though FEI has diversified into commercial markets, nearly half of its sales still come from the US government. Other top clients include

    Lockheed Martin

   ,

   , and Thales Alenia Space. The company was formed in 1961 as a time and frequency control R&amp;D firm.

   FEI generates around two-thirds of sales from customers in the US. It maintains manufacturing facilities in Belgium, China, France, and the US. The company also outsources the manufacture of some components to third-parties.

   FEI operates through three segments: FEI-NY, Gillam-FEI, and FEI-Zyfer. Its largest segment, FEI-NY sells components used in satellite and ground-based communications systems to the US government (primarily the

    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   ), as well as to telecommunications and industrial customers. European subsidiary Gillam-FEI makes products used by international telecom, utility, and other distribution network clients in wireline network synchronization, network management, and specialized test equipment. Its customers hail from Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and include
   <company id="43307">
    Orange

   ,
   <company id="90610">
    Belgacom
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41846">
    Telef√≥nica
   </company>
   , and other service providers. FEI-Zyfer makes precision time and frequency products that include GPS (global positioning system) technology, which can then be integrated with products from the company's other units to provide a variety of timing functions in a broader range of embedded systems. The California-based segment derives a majority of sales from the US government.

   FEI saves money by acquiring lower-cost, high-precision quartz resonators and crystal oscillators from an affiliate, Russia-based Morion, which has been producing quartz devices since the 1930's. FEI also partners with Elcom Technologies, which makes radio-frequency (RF) products, to add the capabilities needed to pursue larger contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   FEI has also expanded by exploring new uses for its components in power grids, gas lines, and oil and gas exploration.
