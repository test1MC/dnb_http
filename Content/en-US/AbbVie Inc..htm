   AbbVie is vying for dominance in the world of medications. The firm discovers, develops, and commercializes both biopharmaceuticals and small molecule drugs, with a focus on autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C, HIV, and other ailments. Key products include arthritis and Crohn's disease treatment Humira; TriCor, Trilipix, and Niaspan for high cholesterol; HIV drugs Kaletra and Norvir; and low testosterone treatment AndroGel. Humira, best known as a rheumatoid arthritis drug, accounts for more than 60% of AbbVie's sales. The firm has seven facilities making products that are available in more than 170 countries. With Humira's patent protection expiring in 2016, the R&amp;D firm is looking for the next big thing.
  </p>

  <p>
   AbbVie's products focus on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease), hepatitis C, HIV, endometriosis, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, low testosterone, and complications from chronic kidney disease and cystic fibrosis. The company has a pipeline of promising new medications: It has more than 30 compounds in phase 2 or phase 3 development that cover such areas as immunology, liver disease, oncology, renal disease, neurological disease, and women's health.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a collaboration agreement with Ablynx NV to develop ALX-0061 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythemoatosus; it has a similar agreement with Galapagos NV to discover and develop commercialize cystic fibrosis therapies. With Alvine Pharmaceuticals, it has an agreement to develop an oral treatment (ALV003) for patients with celiac disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its portfolio of existing and developmental drugs, AbbVie's operations include its global R&amp;D apparatus focused on small molecule drugs and biologics and its sales, marketing, and distribution network delivering its products to more than 170 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AbbVie collects some 60% of sales outside the US. Key foreign markets include Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. The company also has R&amp;D facilities in Germany and China and has a stated goal of expanding in emerging markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has four R&amp;D facilities in the US (located in Abbott Park, Illinois; Chicago; Redwood City, California; and Worcester, Massachusetts).
  </p>

  <p>
   AbbVie markets its products to managed care providers including HMOs and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), hospitals, and government agencies (including the
   <company id="150661">
    US Department of Veterans Affairs
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   ). Its pharmaceutical products are primarily distributed in the US through independent wholesalers; to a lesser extent, it also sells them directly to pharmacies and patients. Internationally, AbbVie principally markets to payors, physicians, and state regulatory bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, three wholesale distributors --
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   -- accounted for practically all of the company's sales in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   AbbVie spent $704 million on advertising in 2015, up from $665 million in 2014 and $626 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Over the past five year, the company has seen steady growth. In 2016 revenue grew 15% to $22.9 billion as sales of Humira remained strong both in the US and abroad (thanks largely to its approval for new indications). Another drug, Viekira for the treatment of hepatitis C, launched in late 2014 and has topped $1 billion in sales. Other products that have performed well include Synthroid, Lupron, Creon, and Duodopa.
  </p>
  <p>
   After declining in 2013 and 2014, net income rebounded by 190% to $5.1 billion as expenses declined. A terminated $54 billion merger with
   <company id="56567">
    Shire
   </company>
   hurt AbbVie in 2014, as the firm ultimately paid a breakup fee of about $1.6 billion. With those charges out of the way, cash flow from operations also recovered, more than doubling to $7.5 billion in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As the company faces the patent expirations of many of its top sellers between 2011 and 2016 (Aluvia, TriCor, Niaspan, Humira), having a strong R&amp;D focus is key to AbbVie's continued success. It has more than 50 candidates in the pipeline, including treatments in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, hepatitis C, chronic kidney disease, and women's health. If any one of those reaches the market, the risky development process will pay off for the research pharmaceuticals company. The company plans to keep adding to its pipeline through strategic licensing deals and partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also considering acquisitions to boost its drug development stockpile. In a major move to boost its drug pipeline, AbbVie bought
   <company id="44556">
    Pharmacyclics
   </company>
   , which markets the promising cancer medication Imbruvica, for $21 billion in 2015. The purchase should help lighten AbbVie's dependence on Humira and other key treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company agreed to buy a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (or PRV, giving it the option to speed up the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   's review process) for $350 million from
   <company id="59611">
    United Therapeutics
   </company>
   . That hefty price speaks to AbbVie's need to get more blockbusters on the market soon.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also willing to collaborate to develop new drugs. To that end, in 2014 it teamed up with Calico Life Sciences to discover and develop therapies for age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Also that year it entered into a partnership with
   <company id="140227">
    Infinity Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to develop duvelisib for cancer treatment. In 2016, it collaborated with
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   to develop and commercialize a phase 3 psoriasis treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other new products include hepatitis C regimen Viekira Pak (launched in the US in late 2014) and Viekirax/Exviera (launched in Europe in early 2015).
  </p>
  <p>
   AbbVie is also concentrating on boosting sales of Humira by expanding its share of the market and its presence in underserved markets. In 2014 Humira was given US approval for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection. The following year, it was given European approval for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis for children and adolescents.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2015, AbbVie voluntarily discontinued its Advicor and Simcor products. These drugs from its lipid franchise had a drastic drop in sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To pump up its oncology pipeline, AbbVie paid $21 billion for
   <company id="44556">
    Pharmacyclics
   </company>
   (which makes cancer treatments including Imbruvica) in 2015. The following year, it announced plans to buy Stemcentrx, which has four early-stage cancer treatments and the late-stage Rova-T treatment for small-cell lung cancer in clinical testing, for $5.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company intends to invest in manufacturing operations in Asia. In 2014 AbbVie acquired a small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Singapore, its first manufacturing facility in Asia; the facility both expands its global operations and increases its capacity for compounds within its immunology and oncology pipelines.

   The biopharmaceutical research company was spun off from its former parent, health care products maker
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   , in 2013.
