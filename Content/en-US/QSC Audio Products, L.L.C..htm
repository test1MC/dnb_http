   Innovation and new product launches are key to the company's growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 QSC added three new loudspeaker models designed for fixed installation applications. The new AD-S6T and AD-S112sw surface-mount loudspeakers are additions to the popular AcousticDesign Series, while the new AC-C4T (part of the upcoming AcousticCoverage loudspeaker line) offers integrators a cost-effective, in-ceiling loudspeaker solution that is ideal for voice paging and light background music applications.

   The company also launched a new full-line Pro and Systems Product Catalog Application, designed for use on tablet computer platforms. A companion to the product pocket guides introduced earlier in 2014, this new interactive app allows users the ability to browse the entire QSC product portfolio and get detailed product information including descriptions, key features, specifications and images.
