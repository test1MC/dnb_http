   To Seventh Generation, green is good. The term means environmentally friendly and nontoxic. For the conscientious company, it also means money in the bank. It makes cleaning and laundry supplies, paper products, personal care items, and diapers and wipes under the Seventh Generation name, which is derived from the Iroquois practice of considering how decisions may affect the next seven generations. Suppliers make its products, which are sold in the US and Canada through such retailers as
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10952">
    Whole Foods
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   , from recycled or renewable materials using nontoxic ingredients. In business since 1988, the company was owned by its founder, Jeffrey Hollender, and other investors until 2016, when consumer products giant
   <company id="55275">
    Unilever
   </company>
   acquired the company for $700 million.

  <p>
   Seventh Generation has transformed itself from a niche player in the cleaning supplies business into a mainstream provider by expanding its product line and the distribution network for its products. (At first, its products were sold only via catalog.) After an initial vow only to do business with retailers that shared its eco-conscious creed, the company has become less selective about its business partners. (Or, more likely, mass retailers, including
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , have become more eco-conscious themselves.) By partnering with retail giant Wal-Mart, Seventh Generation overnight got its green staples into some 1,500 stores and its cleaners, diapers, and wipes online at Walmart.com. The move allowed Seventh Generation to compete for more shelf space alongside rivals
   <company id="10354">
    Clorox
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   , the world's largest consumer goods company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The green consumer products company has set sustainability goals including: directly sourcing a supply of 100% sustainable palm oil by 2012; identifying and eliminating all persistent and/or chronically toxic chemicals used in the making of its products by 2012; and reducing its virgin plastic use by 80% by 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, Seventh Generation maintains alliances with the American Sustainable Business Council, Business for Innovative Climate &amp; Energy Policy, and Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility.

   Representing its first purchase outside its namesake household cleaners and baby products, Seventh Generation in 2013 acquired bottle maker Bobble Brand from Move Collective LLC. Seventh Generation aims to leverage its existing relationship with retailers to push Bobble bottles into more prominent places in stores, and, in turn, boost sales. Indeed, more than 12 million Bobble water bottles have been sold in 30-plus countries.
