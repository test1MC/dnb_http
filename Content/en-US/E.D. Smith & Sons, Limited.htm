   , a major specialty foods manufacturer (pickles, cheese sauces, liquid egg substitutes), purchased E.D. Smith in 2007 for $220 million plus the assumption of $100 million in debt. The deal expanded the Canadian's product portfolio and gives it a presence in Canada.

   E.D. Smith, previously controlled through an income trust (E.D. Smith Income Fund), agreed to the buyout due to a heavy debt load, looming tax problems, and continuing poor stock performance. A new tax structure for income trusts announced by the federal government in 2006 led to a strategic review and a cut in payouts to shareholders. CEO Michael Burrows later left the company and was replaced by former ConAgra executive, F. Martin (Marty) Thrasher.
