  <p>
   The company says that its drinks are meant to provide an easy way for customers to do something healthy for themselves amid the hectic demands of modern life. Three college friends quit their jobs in 1998, bought Â£500 (about $800) worth of fruit, mixed up some smoothies, and sold them at a London music festival. They asked the people who bought them if they liked them or not. Most voted "yes" and, thus, innocent began.
