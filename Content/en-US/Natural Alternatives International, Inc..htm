   Natural Alternatives International (NAI) operates through three business segments. Private-label contract manufacturing is by far the largest, representing more than 85% of sales. Its Branded Products business (just 2% of sales) markets and distributes branded nutritional supplements through direct-to-consumer marketing programs. NAI's Patent and Trademark licensing business segment is engaged in the sale and licensing of beta-alanine (an amino acid used by bodybuilders) under the CarnoSyn trade name.
  </p>
        <p>
   NSA International and Mannatech are the company's biggest clients, accounting for about 45% and 20%, respectively, of the company's sales. In addition to manufacturing products for its private-label clients, NAI offers a range of complementary services, such as regulatory assistance and packaging design.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's net sales grew a robust 30% in fiscal 2012 (ends June) vs. the prior year, while net income fell by about 18% over the same period. Revenue from NAI's patent and trademark licensing business surged more than 350% in fiscal 2012 vs. 2011, driven by the increase in popularity of CarnoSyn as a sports nutrition supplement and expanded distribution of the product. The Private-label contract manufacturing segment saw its sales rise more than 20% due to increased sales to its two largest customers, NSA International and Mannatech. Branded products was the laggard, posting a 14% drop off in sales for the year, which NAI blamed on soft sales of the Pathway to Healing product line.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   A key element of NAI's growth strategy is the commercialization of its beta-alanine patent through contract manufacturing, royalty and licensing agreements, and the protection of its proprietary rights (by legal means where necessary). Indeed, the 350% surge in fiscal 2012 sales in the company's licensing business was credited to the CarnoSyn brand. To that end, NAI in 2011 expanded its beta-alanine licensing programs through a supply agreement with Nestle Nutrition and a license and supply agreement with
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   . While the Nestle agreement expired in mid-2012 and was not renewed, the agreement granting Abbott exclusive license for the use of beta-alanine in certain medical foods and medical nutritionals continues. Also, NAI is looking to growth the CarnoSyn beta-alanine business through accretive acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is also focusing on developing and growing its own line of branded products primarily through direct-to-consumer sales and distribution channels. To bolster is faltering Pathway to Healing line of branded products, NAI relaunched the product line and increased its marketing and advertising activities to support future sales.

        <p>
   Marie Le Doux and her son Mark founded Natural Alternatives International (NAI) with $25,000 in 1980. Mark, a lawyer and former premed student, had previously worked for a small, California-based vitamin company and was a firm believer in the virtues of vitamins. He studied the beneficial properties of nutrients and began making vitamins for health food retailers and drugstores.
  </p>
        <p>
   Finding the retail market too competitive for a small company, the Le Doux duo refocused on specialty direct markets. Mark ramped up their production facility, bringing in automated equipment from Italy. The company went public in 1986 and created private-label lines for several new customers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Trouble struck in 1989 when NAI was forced to recall its products containing L-tryptophan (an amino acid often marketed as a sleep aid) after the FDA linked it to the potentially fatal eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
  </p>
        <p>
   To help boost overseas sales, NAI in 1997 bought a tablet and chewables manufacturing plant, doubling its manufacturing capacity. In 1998 the firm acquired the rights to manufacture Glucotrol, a fat- and cholesterol-binding diet supplement used in Japan. The next year it established subsidiary Natural Alternatives International Europe in Switzerland and began manufacturing operations there.
  </p>
        <p>
   Faced with increased competition and decreased demand in 2000 (the company lost the business of
   <company id="52386">
    Nu Skin Enterprises
   </company>
   , which had accounted for some 20% of its revenues), NAI cut jobs to reduce operating costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   NAI&#160;expanded its branded products segment considerably with its 2005 Real Health Laboratories. The purchase brought in&#160;a line of products sold via mass retail outlets, as well as&#160;a mail-order catalog business (As We Change) that sold proprietary and third-party nutritional and personal care products aimed at women over 40. However, the lines did not meet the company's expectations and NAI first sold the catalog business to Miles Kimball Company in 2008 and then sold the remaining assets to PharmaCare in 2009.
