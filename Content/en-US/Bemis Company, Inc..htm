   Bemis makes a broad line of flexible packaging materials, including polymer films, barrier laminates, and paper-bag packaging used by the food industry to bundle a diversity of edibles. Flexible packaging accounts for about 90% of sales. In addition to the food industry, the company sells to the agricultural, chemical, medical, personal care, and printing industries. Bemis has sales offices and plants spanning North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific to serve its 30,000 customers.

   Bemis has sales offices and plants spanning North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific to serve its 30,000 customers. The company generates around 70% of its net sales from the US, while Brazil contributes almost 10%.

   Bemis in 2014 reorganized into two primary business segments: US Packaging (67% of net sales) and Global Packaging (33%). Bemis used to produce pressure-sensitive products, ranging from label paper and graphic films to thin-film adhesives; however, it sold these operations in 2014 to
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves 30,000 clients, with nearly 80% of clients within the food industry. Other markets include chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Bemis' major customers are themselves engaged in a fiercely competitive market where packaging can make the difference in consumer buying decisions. In 2015
   <company id="163380">
    Kraft Heinz
   </company>
   accounted for 12% of Bemis' net sales.

  <p>
   Bemis has seen its revenue fall for five consecutive years. Revenues declined 6% from $4.34 billion in 2014 to $4.07 billion in 2015. Profits, however, surged 25% from $191 million to peak at a record-setting $239 million during that same time period mainly due to decreases from a loss in discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by decreases in both segments: US Packaging (5%) and Global Packaging (12%). These segments suffered from unfavorable currency translations in Latin America, which led to a 24% drop in sales from Brazil. US Packaging sales also declined in 2015 due to the previous divestiture of its paper packaging division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bemis' cash flow from operations skyrocketed by more than 120% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to favorable changes in inventory and trade receivables.

  <p>
   Bemis' expansion is, in large part, driven by a series of strategic acquisitions that have broadened its manufacturing footprint. In 2015 the company acquired the rigid plastic packaging operations of Emplal Participações S.A. a privately owned Brazilian manufacturer of plastic packaging for food and consumer applications. The deal increased its penetration in one of its largest markets in Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also looking to grow by divesting non-core operations. In 2014 it sold its pressure-sensitive products operations (label paper, graphic films, and thin-film adhesives) to private equity firm
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   for $170 million. It also divested its paper packaging division to Hood Packaging Corporation, a privately-held company headquartered in Madison, Mississippi; and Burlington, Ontario.

  <p>
   Judson Moss Bemis founded J. M. Bemis and Company, Bag Manufacturers, in St. Louis in 1858. The 25-year-old received advice and equipment from cousin Simeon Farwell, who owned an established bag-making factory. St. Louis' role as a trading center supported by major railroads and the Mississippi River helped Bemis' business. The company introduced preprinted and machine-sewn flour sacks to the city's millers, and by the end of its first year it was making about 4,000 sacks a day. In its second year Edward Brown, a relative of Farwell's, became Bemis' partner, and the company was renamed Bemis and Brown.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the Civil War, Brown opened an office in Boston to make the most of fluctuating exchange rates. Bemis also began trading in raw cotton (priced sky-high because of the war), and it started recycling burlap shipping bags into gunnysacks. The company soon began producing its own burlap sacks from imported jute.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stephen Bemis, Judson's brother, became a partner in the firm in 1870 and took over its St. Louis operations. Judson joined Brown in Boston, where he could be involved in commodity purchases and financial operations. Soon after, he bought out Brown's share of the firm for an amount considered extravagant at the time - $300,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the early 1880s Bemis Bros. and Co. was the US's #2 bag maker. It opened a second factory in 1881 in Minneapolis, which was home to such companies as
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   and
   <company id="44318">
    Pillsbury
   </company>
   . During the late 1800s and the early 1900s, Bemis opened plants throughout the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Judson retired in 1909, but the company continued to be run by Bemis family members. In 1914 the company entered the emerging industry of paper milling and paper-bag making, but it continued to focus on textile packaging until WWII, when shortages of cotton and jute expanded the role of paper packaging and led to the development of polyethylene packaging. By the 1950s Bemis' core products were paper and plastic packaging. In 1959 the company opened its own R&amp;D facility. During the late 1950s and 1960s Bemis made several important acquisitions, including

   (packaging for medical products) and MACtac (pressure-sensitive materials). The company was renamed Bemis Company in 1965.
