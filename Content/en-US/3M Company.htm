   Loath to be stuck on one thing, 3M makes everything from tape to high-tech security gear. The diversified company makes products through five operating segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer. Well-known brands include Post-it notes, Scotch tapes, Scotchgard fabric protectors, Scotch-Brite scouring pads, and Filtrete home air filters. 3M sells products directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers, distributors, and dealers worldwide. Industrial, its largest segment, accounted for about 33% of 3M's total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has 88 manufacturing plants in about 30 US states and operates 127 manufacturing and converting facilities in about 40 other countries in Asia Pacific; Europe; Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and elsewhere in North America. Overall, 3M has operations in more than 70 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 3M generated 40% of its revenue from the US; 21% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa; 10% from Latin America and Canada; and 30% from the Asia/Pacific region.

  <p>
   The company operates five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Electronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Industrial segment (33% of 2015 revenues) serves a broad range of markets, such as automotive OEM and aftermarket, electronics, appliance, paper and printing, packaging, food and beverage, and construction. Products include vinyl, polyester, foil and specialty industrial tapes and adhesives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Safety and Graphics segment (18%) includes architectural, building and commercial services, commercial graphics, industrial minerals, personal safety, and traffic safety and security (including border and civil security). Major products offerings include architectural surface and lighting solutions; personal protection products; traffic safety and security products; commercial graphics sheeting and systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Health Care segment (18%) serves medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, health information systems, food manufacturing and testing, and others. Its products and services include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, inhalation and transdermal drug delivery systems, and oral care products and food safety products. In 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Electronics and Energy segment (17%) includes communication, electrical, electronics materials, electronics, infrastructure protection, optical systems, renewable energy, and 3M Touch Systems. Its products include electrical, telecommunications, renewable energy, and infrastructure protection goods and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumer segment (14%) includes consumer retail, office retail, home improvement, drug and pharmacy retail, building maintenance and other markets. Major consumer products include ScotchÂ® brand products; construction and home improvement products, include surface-preparation and wood-finishing materials, and filters for furnaces and air conditioners; home care products include Scotch-Brite pads and sponges.
  </p>

  <p>
   3M sells its products globally though a wide range of distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors, sales reps, and dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $368 million on advertising and merchandising in 2015, compared to $407 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has seen stable growth in its revenues since 2011. However, in 2015 it reported a overall drop of 5% due to a 6% sales decline from Industrial, 7% from Electronics and Energy, 4% from Safety and Graphics, 3% from Health Care and 2% from Consumer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decrease was mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency translation as the result of the strong US dollar, partially offset by organic growth and additional revenues from acquired companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has followed the company's revenues trend over the last five years. In 2015 net income decreased by 2% due to lower net revenues, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow has followed the net income trend. In 2015 3M's operating cash flow decreased by 3%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has invested in a new brand platform - 3M Science, Applied to Life - which enhanced awareness of use of science to solve problems for customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a technology-driven company, 3M continues to make research and development a top priority, investing heftily in new product development efforts. Through significant investments in R&amp;D, sales, and manufacturing, the company ranks among the most innovative companies in the world. It also competes on a global scale and likes to develop, manufacture, hire, and purchase locally in whatever region it is in to get close to its customers. In 2015 the company invested $1.8 billion in R&amp;D activities worldwide. The company opened six customer technical centers around the world, and planned to open a new, research laboratory in the US in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 3M New Ventures unit seeks game-changing opportunities, cutting-edge platform technologies, outstanding entrepreneurs and strong intellectual property positions in high-growth markets that are strategically important to 3M. With minority investments in start-up companies, 3M New Ventures creates not only financial value but strategic synergies between 3M and new ventures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 3M invested in Nanoscale Components to expand the adoption of 3M's unique silicon alloy anode into lithium-ion batteries.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also continues to see emerging markets like China and other developing countries as promising avenues for growth. Although China has made recent moves to curb inflation, 3M believes that China holds great potential for the company's growth in the long term.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 it sold its safety prescription eyewear business to HOYA Vision Care for $45 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company sold the library systems business, part of the Traffic Safety and Security Division; and its Pressurized Polyurethane Foam Adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam) to Innovative Chemical Products Group to focus on its core adhesives, sealants, and tapes businesses. It also agreed to sell the identity management business within its Traffic Safety and Security Division, to
   <company id="132601">
    Gemalto
   </company>
   , the world leader in digital security, for $850 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 3M sold its Faab Fabricauto business to Hills Numberplates. Faab Fabricauto, a French maker of license plates and signage solutions, was a part of 3M's Traffic Safety and Security Division. The company also sold its global Static Control business to Desco Industries Inc., based in Chino, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company began restructuring actions primarily focused on structural overhead, largely in the US and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and Latin America. This impacted 1,700 positions worldwide, of which employment decreased by 354 positions in 2015 and remaining in 2016. The restructuring was aimed at delivering savings of $130 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company invested nearly $4 billion in acquisitions. It acquired Ivera Medical Corp., a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices, to enable 3M to bring a broader array of vascular access solutions to more health care systems worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   It acquired Minnesota-based Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L (a provider of fall protection equipment) from
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   for $1.7 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the same year, it also acquired Polypore's Separations Media business, which provides membranes and modules for blood treatments, ultrafiltration and gas transfer, from
   <company id="133231">
    Polypore International Inc.
   </company>
   for $1 billion. The acquisition strengthens the company in technology, manufacturing, global capabilities, and brand and accelerate the global growth of 3M's membrane business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it acquired New York-based-Treo Solutions, a leading provider of data analytics and business intelligence to healthcare payers and providers for $94 million. This deal makes it possible to extend real-time data analytics and payment redesign worldwide, jumpstarting the many provider organizations that have adopted the 3M 360 Encompass System for computer-assisted coding in their transition to population health management.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Five businessmen in Two Harbors, Minnesota, founded Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) in 1902 to sell corundum to grinding-wheel manufacturers. The company soon needed to raise working capital. Co-founder John Dwan offered his friend Edgar Ober 60% of 3M's stock. Ober persuaded Lucius Ordway, VP of a plumbing business, to help underwrite 3M. In 1905 the two took over the company and moved it to Duluth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1907 future CEO William McKnight joined 3M as a bookkeeper. Three years later the plant moved to St. Paul. The board of directors declared a dividend to shareholders in the last quarter of 1916, and 3M hasn't missed a dividend since. The next two products 3M developed -- Scotch-brand masking tape (1925) and Scotch-brand cellophane tape (1930) -- assured its future.
  </p>
  <p>
   McKnight introduced one of the first employee pension plans in 1931, and in the late 1940s he implemented a vertical management structure. 3M introduced the first commercially viable magnetic recording tape in 1947.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1950, after a decade of work and $1 million in development costs, 3M employee Carl Miller completed the Thermo-Fax copying machine, which was the foundation of 3M's duplicating division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products in the 1960s included 3M's dry-silver microfilm, photographic products, carbonless papers, overhead projection systems, and medical and dental products. The company moved into pharmaceuticals, radiology, energy control, and office markets in the 1970s and 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   A 3M scientist developed Post-it Notes (1980) because he wanted to attach page markers to his church hymnal. Recalling that a colleague had developed an adhesive that wasn't very sticky, he brushed some on paper and began a product line that now generates hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company bought sponge maker O-Cel-O. But not all of its inventions have brought 3M good news. In 1995, along with fellow silicone breast-implant makers Baxter International and Bristol-Myers Squibb, it agreed to settle thousands of personal-injury claims related to implants. The companies paid an average of $26,000 per claim.
  </p>
  <p>
   3M spun off its low-profit imaging and data-storage businesses in 1996 as
   <company id="51726">
    Imation Corp.
   </company>
   and closed its audiotape and videotape businesses. The next year 3M sold its National Advertising billboard business to Infinity Outdoor for $1 billion and its Media Network unit (a printer of advertising inserts) to Time Warner.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company created the 3M Nexcare brand for its line of first-aid and home health products in 1998. To regain earnings growth, 3M closed about 10% of its plants in the US and abroad; it also discontinued unprofitable product lines. The next year 3M sold its heart-surgery-equipment health care unit to Japan's Terumo and its Eastern Heights Bank subsidiary to Norwest Bank of Minnesota. It also bought out Hoechst AG's 46% stake in Dyneon LLC, a fluorine elastomer joint venture between the two companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   3M bought Polaroid's Technical Polarizer and Display Films business and a controlling stake in Germany-based Quante AG (telecom systems) in 2000. In addition, the company decided to halt the manufacture of many of its Scotchgard-brand repellent products due to research revealing that one of the compounds (perfluorooctane sulfonate) used in the manufacturing process is "persistent and pervasive" in the environment and in people's bloodstreams. As 2000 drew to a close, 3M named
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   executive James McNerney to succeed L. D. DeSimone as its chairman and CEO. With the sale of Eastern Heights and several health care businesses (including its cardiovascular systems unit), 3M was rewarded with its second-best financial performance in 14 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   3M then bought Robinson Nugent (electronic connectors) and
   <company id="13467">
    MicroTouch Systems
   </company>
   (touch screens) in 2001. It also announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs and authorized a stock buy-back program of up to $2.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its legal name from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company to 3M Company that year. Also in 2002, 3M restructured its business segments around end uses rather than products or raw materials. So the Health Care segment encompassed everything from transdermal skin patches to software for hospital coding and classification. Similarly, the Consumer and Office Business unit became responsible for Post-its, O-Cel-O sponges, wood-finishing materials, and air conditioner filters. By the end of that year, the company had cut more than 8,500 jobs, 11% of its total workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nevertheless, a strong year in 2003 emboldened the company to look to expand. 3M closed a deal to buy fellow Minnesota resident
   <company id="106615">
    HighJump Software
   </company>
   , a maker of supply chain software for businesses, in February 2004. CEO McNerney left 3M in 2005 to join
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   in the same capacity and was replaced by George Buckley, formerly of the
   <company id="10244">
    Brunswick Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company made a billion-dollar acquisition of liquid filtration producer
   <company id="52395">
    CUNO
   </company>
   . 3M's own filtration products business -- primarily air filters -- amounted to more than $1 billion in annual sales before the deal, and the deal added nearly half that. (3M eventually changed CUNO's name to 3M Purification.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company signaled a new strategic direction in 2006 when it broke up its pharmaceutical unit along geographic lines and sold it in pieces. In total, 3M got $2.1 billion for the sale of its pharmaceutical operations. The next year it sold
   <company id="106615">
    HighJump Software
   </company>
   . High-tech venture capital firm Battery Ventures bought HighJump to set it up as a stand-alone company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company then ran through another string of acquisitions in 2007, buying companies such as Unifam, Lingualcare, Innovative Paper Technologies, and Diamond Productions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 2008 acquisition of protection products maker
   <company id="51384">
    Aearo Technologies
   </company>
   helped 3M's sales growth in the area of safety, security, and protection services. It added to the unit with the purchase (through its 3M Canada subsidiary) of Toronto-based
   <company id="116337">
    MTI PolyFab
   </company>
   , which makes thermal and acoustic insulation for aerospace products. 3M also capitalized on its purchase of
   <company id="91141">
    Beiersdorf
   </company>
   subsidiary Futuro, which makes medical products, such as wraps, elastic bandages, and compression hosiery.
  </p>
  <p>
   3M made two moves into the high-tech security field in 2010. The company acquired
   <company id="132798">
    Cogent Inc.
   </company>
   for $943 million. Known as Cogent Systems, the firm provides finger, palm, face, and iris biometric systems for governments, law enforcement agencies, and commercial enterprises. 3M also acquired
   <company id="103073">
    Attenti Ltd.
   </company>
   , an Israeli manufacturer of people-tracking technology, for $230 million. Attenti makes remote monitoring devices to track people awaiting trial or on probation, as well as for elder-care facilities to monitor patient safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its consumer and office business line in 2010 by acquiring a majority stake in Japanese company A-One, the top office label brand in Asia and the second-largest label business worldwide. It also acquired Alpha Beta Enterprise, a manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in Taiwan. Both acquisitions will expand 3M's presence in the global packaging market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010, 3M acquired J.R. Phoenix Ltd., a manufacturer of hand hygiene and skin care products for health care and professional use. The majority of J.R. Phoenix products are sold under the Laura Line brand in Canada. The deal expanded 3M's line of hand hygiene skin care products to the healthcare market in Canada. The company also acquired UK-based Dailys Ltd., a global supplier of non-woven disposable chemical protective coveralls for industrial use.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made several acquisitions in 2010, including Minnesota-based Arizant, which manufactures forced-air warming garments designed to prevent hypothermia in surgical settings, a growing international market estimated at some $1 billion per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   3M completed nine acquisitions in 2011 that totaled $649 million, including the do-it-yourself unit and professional division of France's GPI Group, a manufacturer and marketer of home improvement products such as tapes, hooks, insulation, and floor protection products. The deal boosts 3M's presence in Western Europe. It also added to its growing Industrial and Transportation segment by acquiring a majority stake in Switzerland-based Winterthur Technology Group, an international supplier of precision grinding technologies that makes grinding tools used in the aircraft, automotive, industrial, and steel industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Back in the US, it acquired Florida-based Nida-Core, a manufacturer of structural honeycomb core and fiber-reinforced foam core materials, and Nida-Core's French affiliate, Structiso SARL. The acquisition allows 3M's Engineered Products and Solutions department to build on its composite and engineered materials product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a related deal, in 2012 3M acquired Maryland-based CodeRyte, which provides clinical natural language processing (NLP) technology and computer-assisted coding for healthcare outpatient providers. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. 3M will apply CodeRyte's NLP technology to its new 3M 360 Encompass system, used by its 3M Health Information Systems division for clinical documentation and coding workflows. More than 5,000 hospitals worldwide use 3M's coding for patient data for measurement and reimbursement purposes. The 3M system also addresses data problems resulting from health care reform requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to broaden its global presence in office, education and consumer products, in 2012, 3M acquired the Office and Consumer Products business of
   <company id="10150">
    Avery Dennison Corp.
   </company>
   for $550 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing a quest for technology buys, on 2012 3M acquired the Federal Signal Technologies Group (FSTech) from
   <company id="10556">
    Federal Signal Corp.
   </company>
   for $110 million in cash. FSTech focuses on hardware and software services for the $3 billion electronic tolling industry. The business also complements offerings from 3M's Traffic Safety Systems Division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its ceramics portfolio, in 2012 it also bought advanced technical ceramics producer
   <company id="12939">
    Ceradyne
   </company>
   for $860 million. The deal adds Ceradyne's advanced ceramics technologies portfolio to its own diversified product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 3M formed partnership with US-China Clean Energy Research Center Building Energy Efficiency Consortium, under which 3M participates in research on building efficiency strategies, tools, and practices in areas such as building envelope technologies and integration of new construction materials for increasing energy efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move aimed at bringing greater economic efficiencies to Premier's more than 100,000 health care provider members, in 2014 the company reached a group purchasing agreement with health care alliance company Premier, Inc. for multiple catheter securement and stability products. The new agreement allows them to take advantage of special pricing and terms pre-negotiated by Premier.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, the company and China-based Hunan Reshine New Material Company signed a patent license agreement to expand the use of nickel, manganese and cobalt in lithium ion batteries (in growing demand in consumer electronics, automotive, and other markets).
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, in order to expand its manufacturing assets in Asia, 3M Company invested in plants in China and Singapore to support the growing window film business.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also signed a patent license agreement with Korea-based ECOPRO to further expand the use of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathode materials in lithium ion batteries.
