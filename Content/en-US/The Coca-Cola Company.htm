   Coke is it -- it being the #1 nonalcoholic beverage company, as well as one of the world's most recognizable brands. The Coca-Cola Company is home to 20 billion-dollar-brands, including four of the top five soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and Sprite. Other top brands include
   <company id="59937">
    Minute Maid
   </company>
   , Powerade, and vitaminwater. All told, the company owns or licenses and markets more than 500 beverage brands, mainly sparkling drinks but also waters, juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, and ready-to-drink teas and coffees. With the world's largest beverage distribution system, The Coca-Cola Company reaches thirsty consumers in more than 200 countries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Coke manages seven main operating segments (most of them geographically-based), including: Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. The North America operating segment generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of finished beverages, while the other geographic regions get most of their business from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups. The company made 63% of its sales from finished product operations during 2015, while the rest came from concentrate operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Bottling Investments division focuses on the beverage company's owned bottling operations outside of North America. This segment helps to maximize the efficiency of its production, distribution, and marketing efforts. They include a 29% stake in Mexico's bottler
   <company id="51101">
    Coca-Cola FEMSA
   </company>
   (now the largest independent Coke bottler), 23% of European bottler
   <company id="91693">
    Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling
   </company>
   , and 29% of
   <company id="89492">
    Coca-Cola Amatil
   </company>
   , a bottler and distributor of Coke products in Australia, New Zealand, and surrounding countries. Other major independent bottling partners include

    Arca Continental
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="161914">
    New Coca-Cola Enterprises

  <p>
   The world's largest beverage company rang up almost 55% of its sales outside the US during 2015, in some 200 countries worldwide across Eurasia, Africa, Europe, North America, and the Pacific Region. Important international markets include Asia, Latin America, and Europe, which made up more than 30% of 2015 revenues, combined.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Not only is Coca-Cola one of the world's most recognizable and valuable brands, but The Coca-Cola Company supports the largest beverage distribution system in the world, made up of company-owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, as well as independently owned bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to them account for 1.9 billion of the approximately 57 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, about 81% of the company's worldwide unit case volume was outside of the US. The largest unit case volumes were in Mexico, China, Brazil, and Japan, which made up 31% of worldwide total. Of these international unit case volumes, 74% held sparkling beverages while the rest held still beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep its brand foremost in the mind of consumers, the company spent $4 billion on advertising in 2015, up from $3.5 billion and $3.26 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Coca-Cola Company's annuals sales and profits have been trending lower over the past several years as traditional soft drink sales have fallen with changing consumer tastes in developed markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The soft-drink maker's sales fell 4% to $44.3 billion during 2015 with sales falling in every segment and region except for North America (where it sold more bottled water and teas), mostly due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Unit case volume shipments, however, increased in every territory in the low-single digits, while Bottling Investment shipments rose 8% with higher growth in China and India, and in Germany to a lesser extent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite sales declines in 2015, the company's net income rose 4% to $7.35 billion mostly as its deal with
   <company id="45737">
    Monster Beverage
   </company>
   was re-appraised to be worth $1.4 billion more than previously believed. Coca-Cola's operating cash levels dipped 1% to $10.53 billion after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and because it paid more in tax payments.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Coca-Cola Company continues to look to relatively undeveloped markets with a growing middle class and money to spend on soft drinks and juices. To that end, it announced it will invest $5 billion with its bottling partners in Africa through 2020, raising its investment in the region to $17 billion from 2010 to 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move that supported expanding its fruit-based drinks portfolio and investing in Africa, The Coca-Cola Company in late 2014 announced a partnership with alcoholic beverage company
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   and South Africa's Gutsche Family Investments to create Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, the continent's largest bottler. The new company serves about a dozen high-growth markets where disposable incomes and the population are growing, and handles about 40% of the beverage company's African volume. In exchange for its $260 million investment, The Coca-Cola Company will receive an 11% interest in the bottler and SABMiller's global Appletiser brand of carbonated juices as well as about 20 other African and Latin American non-alcoholic beverage brands. Gutsche Family Investments already controls Coca-Cola Sabco, a Coke bottler since 1940 with operations in seven African countries. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will absorb most of SABMiller's non-alcoholic operations on the continent as well as Coca-Cola Sabco's plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, the company teamed up with
   <company id="45721">
    Keurig Green Mountain
   </company>
   , entering into a 10-year global strategic agreement to collaborate on the development and introduction of The Coca-Cola Company global brand portfolio for use in Keurig Green Mountain's Keurig Kold at-home beverage system. It purchased a 16% stake in
   <company id="45737">
    Monster Beverage Corporation
   </company>
   in a long-term strategy to accelerate growth for both companies in the fast-growing, global energy drink industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The popularity of soft drinks, especially in mature markets, has been on the decline for the past decade as negative publicity about obesity and other health risks continues to threaten sales. As a result, The Coca-Cola Company and other top soft drink makers are turning toward other parts of their noncarbonated product portfolio for growth, such as fruit juices, sports and energy drinks, and bottled water and tea beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   A part of the plan to rely less on the old way of doing business, and compensate for falling sales amidst changing tastes, the company is selling many of its low-margin bottling operations to concentrate on higher margin operations like selling concentrates and syrups to bottlers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Diversifying its portfolio, in 2014 the company acquired a 16.7% equity stake in
   <company id="45737">
    Monster Beverage Corp.
   </company>
   , a leading maker of energy drinks. Under the terms of the deal, The Coca-Cola Company will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business, including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and Relentless, to Monster; and Monster will transfer its non-energy business, including Hansen's Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert's Lemonade and Hansen's Juice Products, to The Coca-Cola Company.

  <p>
   In 2013 Coca-Cola opened a new bottling plant in Myanmar as part of a planned $200 million investment during the next five years there which also includes adding more than 22,000 jobs during that time period. Also that year, in growing its distribution network, The Coca-Cola Company bought Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the sixth-largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the nation that serves nine northern California counties.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Atlanta pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coke in 1886. His bookkeeper, Frank Robinson, named the product after two ingredients, coca leaves (later cleaned of narcotics) and kola nuts. By 1891 druggist Asa Candler had bought The Coca-Cola Company, and within four years the soda-fountain drink was available in all states; it was in Canada and Mexico by 1898.
  </p>
  <p>
   Candler sold most US bottling rights in 1899 to Benjamin Thomas and John Whitehead of Chattanooga, Tennessee, for $1. The two designed a regional franchise bottling system that created more than 1,000 bottlers within 20 years. In 1916 Candler retired to become Atlanta's mayor; his family sold the company to Atlanta banker Ernest Woodruff for $25 million in 1919. Coca-Cola went public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm expanded overseas and introduced the slogans "The Pause that Refreshes" (1929) and "It's the Real Thing" (1941). To keep WWII soldiers in Cokes at a nickel a pop, the government built 64 overseas bottling plants. Coca-Cola bought Minute Maid in 1960 and began launching new drinks -- Fanta (1960), Sprite (1960), TAB (1963), and Diet Coke (1982).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Roberto Goizueta became chairman. Four years later, with Coke slipping in market share, the firm changed its formula and introduced New Coke, which consumers soundly rejected (thus, Coca-Cola Classic was born). In 1986 it consolidated the US bottling operations it owned into Coca-Cola Enterprises and sold 51% of the new company to the public. Goizueta also engineered the company's purchase of
   <company id="106993">
    Columbia Pictures
   </company>
   in 1982. (Columbia earned Coke a $1 billion profit when it sold the studio to
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   in 1989.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 it bought Barq's root beer. Goizueta died of lung cancer in 1997; while he was at the helm, the firm's value rose from $4 billion to $145 billion. Douglas Ivester, the architect of Coca-Cola's restructured bottling operations, succeeded him. An agreement to buy about 30 Cadbury Schweppes beverage brands -- including Canada Dry, Dr Pepper, and Schweppes -- outside the US and France was scaled down because of antitrust concerns. Completed in 1999, the deal also excluded Canada, much of continental Europe, and Mexico. (Cadbury in 2008 spun off its beverage division, which became Dr Pepper Snapple Group.)
  </p>
  <p>
   A battered Ivester resigned in 2000; president and COO Douglas Daft was named chairman and CEO. Coca-Cola began its largest cutbacks ever, slashing nearly 5,000 jobs, and later agreed to pay nearly $193 million to settle a race-discrimination suit filed by African-American workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To fortify its portfolio in the fast-growing noncarbonated drinks segment, Coca-Cola acquired Mad River Traders (teas, juices, sodas) and
   <company id="46046">
    Odwalla
   </company>
   (juices and smoothies) in 2001. The company also bought a 35% interest (
   <company id="41836">
    San Miguel Corporation
   </company>
   owned the rest) in bottler Coca-Cola Philippines from
   <company id="89492">
    Coca-Cola Amatil
   </company>
   . (In 2005 Coke bought the remaining percentage of the Philippine bottler.) The company announced the creation of a huge beverage and snack distribution joint venture with
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   , but the multibillion-dollar operation fell apart before it could begin. Coca-Cola also announced that it would invest $150 million to build bottling facilities in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Coca-Cola introduced Vanilla Coke, its biggest new product launch since the disastrous New Coke debacle. The company also secured distribution rights to Danone's Evian brand in North America and paid about $128 million when it formed a joint venture (CCDA Waters, LLC) with Danone to produce, market, and distribute Danone's bottled water in the North America (including Dannon and Sparkletts brands, under license).  Also in 2002 Steven Heyer, president and COO of Coca-Cola Ventures and Coca-Cola Latin America, was named Coca-Cola's new president and COO. (The company's former president, Jack Stahl, had left after a reorganization in 2001.)
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the restructuring initiated by Daft in 2000, another 1,000 employees (half in Atlanta) were laid off in 2003 after the company decided to combine several business units under the Coca-Cola North America umbrella. The company laid off 2,800 employees worldwide in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those layoffs led one former employee to sue, claiming the soft drink maker improperly accounted for funds, discriminated against minorities, and in 2000 rigged test marketing of frozen Coca-Cola at a Virginia
   <company id="54531">
    Burger King
   </company>
   . Coca-Cola said it does not violate general accounting principles and does not discriminate. However, the company said it had already disciplined employees involved in the Burger King tests, and Coke executive Thomas Moore, who led the fountain drinks division responsible for the questionable tests, resigned. Coke also agreed to pay Burger King as much as $21 million to settle the matter. Coke said in 2003 it would reduce its revenue by $9 million to make up for accounting errors from the fountain drinks division that managed the troubled tests. Coke later settled its dispute with the former employee who first raised concerns about Coke's conduct, agreeing to pay $500,000 in severance and legal costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2003 trouble broke out for the company overseas. Claims surfaced in India that both Coke and Pepsi bottled in that country contain traces of DDT, malathion, and other pesticides that exceed government limits. Both Coke and Pepsi denied the reports in a joint press conference. Government labs cleared the colas, saying the drinks were safe, but not before both soft drink companies saw sales dip by as much as 50% in a two-week period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to boost the younger consumer's interest in its flagship cola, Coca-Cola launched new marketing and ad campaigns in 2003. Efforts included changing graphics on Coke bottles and cans back to a more traditional look. However, Coca-Cola took the opposite tactic to spur interest in Sprite, unveiling Sprite Remix, a tropical-flavored version of the soft drink. Minute Maid unveiled Minute Maid Premium Heart Wise, which claims to lower cholesterol as long as people consistently drink two glasses a day.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coca-Cola rolled out a lime version of its Diet Coke in 2004. (The non-diet version came out in 2005.) The flavor joined diet cherry, lemon, and vanilla. In making the announcement, Coca-Cola said it also had reformulated its lemon flavor so that it tastes "lighter." Also in 2004, Coke opened an online music store in the UK called MyCokemusic.com. A month later, Coke began selling its Dasani bottled water in the UK and 19 other countries. Later in 2004 the company recalled Dasani water in Europe because of elevated levels of bromate. In addition, Daft retired as Coca-Cola's chairman and CEO in 2004 and former Coca-Cola HBC CEO E. Neville Isdell replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to the growing awareness by consumers of health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles, in 2004 Coca-Cola created The Beverage Institute for Health &amp; Wellness, a beverage research and educational operation, which the company hopes will lead to the creation of more healthful beverage products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having introduced Minute Maid products in Russia in 2004, Coke furthered its juice presence in the country with the 2005 purchase of Russian juice maker Multon. Coke bought the company in conjunction with
   <company id="91693">
    Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co
   </company>
   . Later that year, Coke began test marketing a Mountain Dew-like drink named Vault in Alabama, North Carolina, and Tennessee. (Surge, a previous Mountain Dew competitor tried by Coke, failed in testing.) In 2005 the company announced the phasing out of Vanilla Coke and introduction of Black Cherry Coke.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Coke bought Danone's 49% stake in their North American bottled-water venture for about $100 million. The joint venture never turned a profit during its three-year run, but Coke hopes full ownership of the Dannon and Sparkletts brands will prove profitable. Coke still shares North American import and marketing rights of Danone's premier water brand Evian, which although the world's top-selling bottled water, has seen declining in US sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's rivalry with PepsiCo goes beyond soda to juice products (Coca-Cola's Minute Maid vs. PepsiCo's
   <company id="57224">
    Tropicana
   </company>
   ), bottled water (Dasani vs. Aquafina), and other noncarbonated products. Feeling pressure to stay competitive with these faster selling beverages, Coca-Cola introduced an energy drink, Full Throttle, in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005, Coke also announced a revamping of its global marketing team, announcing the retirement of Sandy Allen, president of its European division. In an effort to expand its international product offerings, later that same year it acquired Brazilian juice maker Sucos Mais for some $48 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   New drinks introduced in 2006 included Vault (a Mountain Dew knock-off). That year, Blak, a coffee-flavored Coke (with half the calories and twice the caffeine of a regular Coke that was in development for two years) was first test-marketed in France and subsequently introduced in the US. (The pricey soda -- $1.99 for an 8-ounce bottle -- was discontinued in the US in 2007 due to poor sales.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its drinks in the reduced-calorie category, in 2006 the company introduced a so-called "calorie-burning" drink called Enviga, a green-tea-based drink. It is marketed through a joint venture with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   . (The joint venture, called Beverage Partners Worldwide, primarily focuses on black tea drinks.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also launched a new line of premium coffee and tea beverages called Far Coast in 2006. The drinks were launched in Canada along with Far Coast concept stores, where consumers can taste test the flavors. The company expanded its reach into coffee further with a deal with coffeehouse chain
   <company id="106161">
    Caribou Coffee
   </company>
   . Coca-Cola and Caribou created a new line of ready-to-drink iced coffee beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Coca-Cola opened a new bottling plant in Myanmar as part of a planned $200 million investment during the next five years there which also includes adding more than 22,000 jobs during that time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it bought ZICO Beverages, a maker of ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its distribution network, in 2013 The Coca-Cola Company bought Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the sixth-largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the nation that serves nine northern California counties.
