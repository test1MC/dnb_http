   Cox Newspapers keeps its nose to the news grindstone. One of the nation's top newspaper businesses, the company publishes about 10 dailies including the Austin American-Statesman (Texas), Dayton Daily News (Ohio), and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The company's Cox News Service is a leading news syndication network serving more than 650 customers around the world. In addition, the company operates more than 100 online properties, including websites for its papers. Cox Newspapers is part of

   Cox Enterprises reorganized its broadcasting and publishing units in 2009, forming Cox Media Group to oversee its portfolio of television stations and radio stations (

    Cox Radio
   </company>
   ), as well as Cox Newspapers. Longtime newspaper chief Sandy Schwartz was tapped to lead the new division; Doug Franklin, previously publisher of the Palm Beach Post, took over the newspaper operation. The reorganization came at time of declining revenue for many of Cox's media properties and the company hopes it can boost revenue through greater integration.

   The company's newspapers, in particular, have struggled with declining circulation as readership turns to other forms of media for news. Cox put all but three of its papers up for sale in an effort to cut costs and dispose of under-performing properties. It plans to use the proceeds from the disposals to pay down debt and for new business investments.
