   The paper trail has been a path to success for Axel Springer. Germany's leading newspaper company and one of Europe's largest media concerns, Axel Springer publishes more than 170 newspapers and magazine titles in more than 30 countries. Its flagship paper
   <em>
    Bild
   </em>
   is Germany's #1 newspaper. Other papers include
   <em>
    Die Welt
   </em>
   and the tabloid
   <em>
    Welt Kompakt
   </em>
   . Axel Spinger's magazine operations include
   <em>
    Auto Bild, Computer Bild
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    TV Digital
   </em>
   . In addition to publishing, the company has holdings in online content, online classifieds, printing, real estate, and television. The family of founder Hinrich Springer owns about 50% of the company.

   The troubled print publishing business has led Axel Springer to invest heavily in digital media holdings.

   Hinrich Springer, whose newspaper business had been closed by the Nazi government in 1941, and his son Axel launched Axel Springer Verlag in 1946 with the magazine
   <i>
    Nordwestdeutsche Hefte.
   </i>
   In 1948 the company unveiled
   <i>
    Hamburger Abendblatt,
   </i>
   which became Hamburg's best-selling newspaper by 1950. Axel Springer eventually took over the business and introduced the tabloid
   <i>
    Bild Zeitung
   </i>
   (later renamed
   <i>
    Bild
   </i>
   ) in 1952. The success of the paper helped fund the company's expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axel Springer bought the daily
   <i>
    Die Welt
   </i>
   in 1953 and
   <i>
    Berliner Morgenpost
   </i>
   in 1959. The company moved its headquarters to Berlin in 1966. Fiercely supportive of the reunification of Germany, Springer built the company's headquarters immediately next to the Berlin Wall. In the 1970s the company expanded into the regional newsletter and magazine market. Axel Springer's growing control over German media did not go unnoticed, however, and opposition to the company's power was demonstrated when its Hamburg office was bombed in 1972 (the company was the target of arson again in 1998). Springer considered selling the entire company, but opted to sell several individual publications instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded beyond print media in 1984, investing in satellite consortium SAT.1 Satelliten Fernsehen. In 1985 it acquired stakes in cable TV and bought two Munich radio stations. After taking the company public that year, founder Axel Springer died. In 1989 German media firm KirchGruppe (later
   <company id="48060">
    TaurusHolding
   </company>
   ) began buying shares in Axel Springer Verlag.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Axel Springer entered the Czech and Slovak newspaper markets with the purchase of a 49% stake in Dutch firm Ringier-Taurus. The company formed a joint venture in 1998 with Infoseek (later absorbed by
   <company id="43304">
    Disney Online
   </company>
   ) and other partners to launch a German-language Web search service. It also bought 95% of German book publisher ECON + LIST Verlagsgesellschaft. August Fischer, former chief executive of
   <company id="41816">
    News Corp.
   </company>
   's
   <company id="90297">
    News International
   </company>
   , was appointed chairman and CEO that year. A 1998 bid to buy UK-based media firm Mirror Group (now
   <company id="90442">
    Trinity Mirror
   </company>
   ) proved unsuccessful.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Axel Springer acquired stakes in several TV production companies, including a 90% interest in Schwartzkopff TV-Productions. The following year the company merged its 41%-owned TV station SAT.1 with German TV station operator Pro Sieben Media to create
   <company id="103451">
    ProSiebenSAT.1 Media
   </company>
   , Germany's largest commercial TV group. Fischer retired at the end of 2001 and was replaced by Mathias DÃ¶pfner. The company began investing in new online ventures, including a portal built around
   <i>
    Bild
   </i>
   . TaurusHolding sold its shares in the company in 2003 to Deutsche Bank.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 it agreed to sell the paperback unit of its Ullstein Heyne List book group to
   <company id="43807">
    Random House
   </company>
   . The company also sold off several of its stakes in TV production companies as it sought to focus on its main publishing unit. In 2004 it took a 49% stake in Stepstone Deutschland, a Web-based employment agency in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axel Springer bid $3 billion in 2005 to acquire ProSiebenSat.1 from media mogul Haim Saban, but the deal was blocked by antitrust regulators. Investment firms
   <company id="134986">
    Permira
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40268">
    Kolberg Kravis Roberts
   </company>
   acquired control of the TV broadcaster the following year; Axel Springer later sold its remaining stake in the business in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Axel Springer sold its stake in broadcaster
   <company id="103451">
    ProSiebenSat.1 Media
   </company>
   before the newspaper company sold stakes in some of its regional papers in 2009. Its Digital Window (a joint venture with Swiss ad firm
   <company id="99958">
    PubliGroupe
   </company>
   ) bought Buy.at from
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   the next year. Continuing its transition to a more digital publishing company, Axel Springer completed a takeover of French online classifieds site
   <company id="160959">
    SeLoger.com
   </company>
   in 2011.
