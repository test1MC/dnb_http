   Wella brushes off much of its competition. One of the world's leading haircare companies, it sells professional and retail haircare products, cosmetics, and fragrances. Its Wella brand is its top seller; hair coloring products (Koleston, Wella Viva) are also leaders. Its Tondeo unit supplies professional products and appliances to salons. Wella's fragrances include Alfred Dunhill, Anna Sui, and Gucci, among others. Reluctantly for Wella at the time,

   acquired a majority stake in the firm in 2003 from four families (Ebert, Pohl, Sander, and Stroeher) that owned some 80% of Wella. Through a Domination Agreement transaction, P&amp;G in November 2007 acquired the rest of its outstanding shares.

   Franz Ströher started his business in 1880 at age 26. After passing his hairdressing apprenticeship exam at 18, he worked his way across Europe for several years, gaining experience and studying beauty trends. At first he produced colored wigs and related products suited to the tastes of imperial Germany. His first brush with success came with the invention of the tullemoid, a base upon which wig hair could be easily attached. The invention revolutionized wig making and enabled Franz to open a factory in Rothenkirchen in 1904.
  </p>
  <p>
   His sons, Karl and Georg, joined the family business in 1914. Four years later, their company, Franz-Ströher OHG, was listed as a publicly traded company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bob haircut, popular among women in the 1920s, was bad for business as women everywhere cut their hair and stopped wearing (and buying) wigs. Karl and Georg produced work clothes and salon supplies (towels, gowns, shop window dummies) to keep the business going. However, the Ströhers acquired a license to produce perming appliances in 1924, the same year the Wella trademark was registered with the German patent office. By 1927 perms were all the rage among stylish women, and the company's machines were sold together with complementary hair cosmetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1931 Wella Corporation began operations in the US as other Wella businesses sprang up in Europe. Its haircare products, cosmetics, and appliances (including hair clippers and hydraulic chairs) were top sellers, and the firm enjoyed a period of expansion until WWII reversed the company's fortunes.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Wella's overseas patents and subsidiaries were lost, as were its European factories. Georg and Karl, who had opposed the Nazi Party, started over in 1945. The brothers, along with 12 former employees, gathered to begin a new company called Ondal. A year later Wella Fiseurbedarf was founded in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gradually the demand for hair and beauty services returned and the company supplied the growing international market. By 1950 headquarters were moved to Darmstadt, and the company became known as Wella AG. Products such as Koleston, a hair colorant, enjoyed global success. The company continued to expand throughout the 1960s, and by the end of the decade its products could be found almost anywhere in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1973 the founding family, now in its third generation, relinquished day-to-day management responsibilities to a group of outside directors; family members continued to serve on advisory and supervisory boards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wella celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1980, the same year it purchased Tondeo-Werk, a producer of scissors and hairdressing supplies in Solingen, Germany. Wella went public in 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following German reunification in 1990, the company bought back operations it had lost in the political upheavals of post-WWII Germany and the ensuing Cold War. Wella initiated operations in the former Soviet Union. Wella acquired 91% of Muehlens AG to beef up its fragrance business in 1994. The next year, Jorg von Crausharr became chairman of the company's management board. After a major drop in sales that year, the company posted consecutive gains through 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Heiner Gürtler succeeded von Crausharr as chairman. In 2001 the company acquired Graham Webb International, the fifth largest haircare products manufacturer in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company bought fragrance maker Escada Beauté Group S.A. as well as partnered with haircolorxpress International (a nationwide franchiser of hair-color-only salons) to distribute Wella's products in haircolorxpress salons. Wella also acquired 75% ownership of Tony &amp; Tina cosmetic brands (which closed its doors in April 2005) and the brands and business operations of Italian fragrance and cosmetic company, Atkinsons.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Wella also combined its two US divisions, Intercosmetics and Adipar Ltd./Escada Beauté, naming it Cosmopolitan Cosmetics Inc. Later that year it formed a joint venture with Italian beauty-products firm Max Mara to develop, manufacture, and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under its Cosmopolitan Cosmetics name. Wella refused a $5.4 billion buyout offer from
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel KGaA
   </company>
   in October 2002. In March 2003 Henkel did succeed in buying a 6.9% stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move that strengthened its presence in Australia, Wella acquired PPS Hairwear Australia in 2003. PPS offers professional hair-care products for home use through salon sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unable to keep Procter &amp; Gamble at arm's length, Wella was bought by the US consumer products company to fill out P&amp;G's expanding haircare portfolio. Not without some heated negotiations, Wella eventually relinquished itself to P&amp;G and is being integrated into P&amp;G's supply chain and other operations alongside P&amp;G's other significant acquisition, Clairol.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2005 Gürtler resigned from his post at Wella and retained the title of president on special assignment at P&amp;G until his retirement on June 30, 2006.
