  <p>
   Sandvine generates nearly two-thirds of its revenue from the sale of it hardware and software products with the rest coming from the services it provides to customers. The company researches, designs, and makes its products with some sub-assemblies made by by contract manufacturers. It generally carries a good amount of inventory because of the variability in product mix and a long lead time for parts. The company balances the cost of stocking up on parts with the ability to make quick deliveries to customers.
