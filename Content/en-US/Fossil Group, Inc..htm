  <p>
   Fossil's advertising costs were approximately $241.3 million, $232.7 million, and $205.6 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products are distributed globally through various distribution channels, including wholesale in countries, direct to the consumer through its retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors. Internationally, its products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores, and specialty watch and jewelry stores and websites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fossil's marketing modes includes point-of-sale merchandise displays, print and media advertising, as well as company websites, catalogs, and retail stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 10 largest customers in the US represented 21.3%, 18.9%, and 20.5% of net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net sales decreased by $280.8 million primarily due to lower European sales. Net sales also decreased in the Americas and Asia segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Europe net sales declined due to lower sales of multi-brand watch portfolio, jewelry category, and leathers businesses. The declines were in United Kingdom, distributor and Germany markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped by $156 million compared to 2015 due to lower sales and restructuring charges, partially offset by decreased provision for income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Fossil's net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $27.1 million due to a change in income tax payable.

  <p>
   Fossil is looking to the stronger global economy, the upward trend in fashion watches, and its keen focus on design to lift its sales over the long term. A handful of licensed brands (including Michael Kors), as well as Fossil and Michele, have been strong sellers. In 2014 it launched Emporio Armani Swiss Made and Tory Burch brand watches. Fossil also formed a partnership with Intel to develop wearable technology for the fashion industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fossil also has a licensing agreement with Kate Spade through 2025 and holds the exclusive rights to manufacture, market, and distribute a Kate Spade jewelry collection. Fossil's deal with retailing behemoth Wal-Mart has also given it an advantage. The deal, to design, make, and distribute watches for the retailer's private-label brand George, is largely responsible for the 40% increase in Fossil's mass market watch business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fossil is also aggressively expanding its store base. In 2015 the company opened 38 new stores and closed 36 stores. In addition, it added 24 stores through its SKWG acquisition. During fiscal 2016, it anticipates opening 25 to 30 additional retail stores and closing 30 stores globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focusing its efforts outside the US to sell its full-price accessories. Building on the Fossil brand name, the company also markets wallets, handbags, and belts.

   , Fossil has typically targeted those in their teens, 20s, and 30s, i.e., those hip to the latest trends. But Fossil's target audience has broadened to include those who will drop some big green for some bling. While the majority of Fossil's products are priced from $50 to $600, the company entered the luxury products niche when it acquired Tempus International, which does business as Michele Watches, for about $50 million. (Some Michele watches sell for thousands of dollars.) The subsidiary launched Michele Jewelry, a collection of 18-karat gold pieces that are sold at Neiman Marcus stores nationwide. Fossil also sells a vintage-inspired summer clothing collection -- called Vintage Expedition -- in stores in Germany and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy for growing the business includes, realizing the full potential of vintage American lifestyle brand as a key element of its long-term growth strategy; growing SKAGEN into a multi-category lifestyle brand by leveraging the Fossil Group infrastructure; and proving a unique brand experience.
  </p>
  <p>
   International expansion and gaining market share are key elements in expanding the distribution of its brands. Its growth is dependent on diversification of its product offerings, developing wearable technology, and strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Fossil acquired 51% of S. Keren Watch Group (a Cape Town, South Africa-based distributor) for $4.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also acquired Misfit, Inc., an innovator and distributor of wearable technology and stylish connected devices, for 215.4 million. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to acquire a scalable technology platform that can be integrated across the Fossil's multi-brand portfolio, a native wearable technology, brand and a pipeline of innovative products.

  <p>
   Tom Kartsotis founded a Dallas area import-export company, originally called Overseas Products International, in 1984. He was only 24, and Swatch was the hot watch brand. His brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a department store executive, had told him about high profits from Asian imports. With Lynne Stafford (whom Tom later married) as designer, the company gave its Asian-made Fossil watches a retro image, and sales took off. In 1988 Kosta joined the firm to woo department stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1987 and 1989 sales rose from $2 million to $20 million. In 1990 a less-expensive line of watches, Relic, was created for stores such as
   <company id="10810">
    JCPenney
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   . Tom renamed the company Fossil in 1992 and took it public in 1993. Its product line then included women's accessories (such as belts) and small leather goods for men. Two years later Fossil introduced sunglasses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened its first US retail outlets in 1996. The next year Fossil signed licensing agreements with Giorgio Armani for the Emporio Armani Orologi watch line and with
   <company id="43030">
    London Fog
   </company>
   to make Fossil outerwear. Through a joint venture with Netherlands-based Capstan Bay, the firm opened its first European store in 1998 in Amsterdam.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Fossil entered a joint venture with the American subsidiary of Japanese watchmaker
   <company id="41883">
    Seiko
   </company>
   to produce and market Lorus and Disney character watches. The following year Fossil launched its own Fossil-brand jeans and apparel line to be sold at its approximately 12 new Fossil apparel stores. Fossil acquired UK-based The Avia Watch Company, maker of Avia-brand watches, in mid-2001 to grow its business in the UK, as well as 80% of its Australian distributor FSLA. In November 2001 the company acquired three Swiss watchmakers, Montres Antima SA, Meliga Habillement Horloger SA, and Synergies Horlogères SA. The next year Fossil acquired No-Time (its Swiss distributor) and X-Time (a retailer with three stores in Switzerland).

  <p>
   In 2003 Fossil gave nerds a watch to celebrate. The company developed the Wrist PDA, a line of watches that incorporated a Palm personal digital assistant that synchronized with a Windows-based PC. The year 2004 brought a refined version of the Wrist PDA: In a joint effort with
   <company id="60227">
    Citizen Watch
   </company>
   , the companies began production of wrist watches capable of receiving news, weather, and other information, through a subscription-based service provided by

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Tom Kartsotis retired as chairman of Fossil in April 2010. He had served as chairman since 1991.
