Bemis also offers contract manufacturing services for auto, large appliance office furniture, and other OEMs. The company's brands include Bemis, Carrara &amp; Matta, Church, Mayfair, Olsonite, and Wesport.

   and

   ) and wholesalers worldwide, as well as directly distributing them through national and regional dealer networks. In addition, management invests in new technologies and designs. R&amp;D helps to differentiate Bemis products, and their manufacture and installation, from those of other US and international rivals.

   Product introductions have included seats with improved hinge and fastening systems, which deliver less cleaning maintenance and better hygiene. A personal cleansing spa is another idea brought to market. Bemis has even developed a self-closing toilet seat.

   That year it also opened a market and business development office in Amsterdam. The office sells Bemis' products across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

  <p>
   Bemis was founded in 1901 by Albert Bemis. The firm initially made its products (toilet seats and bowling balls) out of wood. In the 1950s the company began experimenting with a mixture of wood flour and resins. It switched in the 1960s to making all-plastic products based on injection molded techniques. In the 1990s Bemis pioneered the use of articulating-arm robots, installing six-axis robots on every one of the 500-plus presses in one building.
  </p>
  <p>
   The privately owned and operated company is led by descendants of its founder.
