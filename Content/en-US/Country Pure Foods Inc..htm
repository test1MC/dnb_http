   Country Pure Foods is one of the largest independent processors of juice products in the US.

   The company was formed by combining Natural Country Farms of Ellington, Connecticut, and Ohio Pure Foods of Akron, Ohio. It has since expanded with the addition of Ardmore Farms of DeLand, Florida, and Cal-Tex Citrus Juice of Houston, Texas.
