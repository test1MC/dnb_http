The company also sells less expensive Boston and Essex brand upright pianos, as well as band and orchestral instruments. Steinway's

   Steinway sells its products through about 220 independent dealers, as well as four company-run showrooms located in the US and five in Europe. Steinway targets several audiences -- and pocketbooks. Its high-end Steinway &amp; Sons business courts individuals between 40 and 50 years old with a high level of musical ability and incomes of more than $300,000. Buyers of its Boston and Essex upright brands are between 35 and 45 years old with somewhat less musical skill and annual incomes exceeding $100,000. Institutional customers -- including concert halls, music schools, and churches -- account for more than 20% of piano sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steinway is working to increase its sales in Asia by expanding its sales network, adding new dealers in Japan and China. The company is also looking to Eastern and Central Europe, as well as Brazil for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, the company has spent between $5 million and $6.5 million in advertising expenses each year.

  <p>
   Sales of band and orchestral instruments -- historically more sensitive to demographic trends than economic ones -- fell in recent years as budget shortfalls in many states led to cutbacks in school music programs. The company's band and orchestral instruments primarily are sold by or rented from dealers to students in the US, although markets in Asia and Europe present an opportunity for growth. To this end, Steinway received an unsolicited management buyout offer in mid-2011 to acquire its band instrument and online music divisions. Steinway formed a special committee to evaluate the offer, as well as other alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including the sale of its band division and that of the entire company. In late 2012 the company announced the special committee recommended not to sell the band division to the investor group.

  <p>
   German cabinet and piano maker Heinrich Steinweg founded Steinway and Sons (the Anglicized version) in 1853 after immigrating to New York to join his son, Carl. By the end of the Civil War, the company was the world's top piano maker, introducing a method of piano building that became the norm for more than a century. Steinway established its first retail outlet, the Steinway-Haus, in Hamburg, Germany, in 1880.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anti-German sentiment after WWI hurt sales, a condition exacerbated by the Depression and the rise of radios. In response, the company boosted its presence with artist-support programs, offering pianos and tuners free of charge at concerts. Steinway also trimmed production, began making upright pianos, and diversified into radios and record players. With pianos deemed nonessential items during WWII, the company switched to Army gliders and caskets. After the war, Steinway modernized its equipment and returned to the music business. Grand piano production rose briefly in the early 1960s, but a flood of imports eroded Steinway's market share.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Steinways relinquished control of the company in 1972, selling it to broadcaster CBS. The company was then sold to a group of Boston investors, who in 1995 sold Steinway to another group of investors, led by chairman Kyle Kirkland and CEO Dana Messina. Kirkland and Messina merged Steinway with Selmer (which the group had purchased two years earlier). To help pay off debt, Steinway Musical Instruments went public in 1996. A year later the company acquired Emerson Musical Instruments, a flute and piccolo maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Steinway bought The Kluge Company, Europe's leading piano key maker, and in 1999 it added piano plate maker O.S. Kelly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company bought Germany's largest piano dealer, Pianohaus Karl Lang, to expand sales outside the US; it also bought United Musical Instruments (brass instruments with names such as C.G. Conn and King). Having established Steinway and Sons Japan, Ltd in 1997, the company became the first Western-based piano company (in 2000) to open dealerships in China. Steinway introduced its lower-priced line of Essex pianos in 2001. Later that year Steinway said it would shut down its New York plant periodically as it cuts back on piano production.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Steinway decided to merge The Selmer Company with United Musical Instruments. Completed in early 2003, Conn-Selmer, Inc. was the resulting unified subsidiary. In October Conn-Selmer announced the closing of one of its three manufacturing facilities in Elkhart, Indiana.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2004 Steinway acquired G. Leblanc Corporation, a manufacturer of high quality band instruments with production facilities in Wisconsin and France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steinway acquired ArkivMusic in May 2008 for about $4.5 million. The company is an online retailer of classical music recordings for its more than 90,000 musical titles, which include out-of-print recordings, and as a way to promote musicians. Henry Zeigler Steinway, the great-grandson of the founder, died in September at the age of 93. Steinway was the last of his family to run the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2011 Steinway eliminated its dual class voting structure, under which CEO Dana Messina and Chairman Kyle Kirkland controlled more than 80% of the voting power. Messina and Kirkland sold their shares to SMI and ValueAct SmallCap Partners, relinquishing their control.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2013 Steinway was taken private by an affiliate of investment firm Paulson &amp; Co. for about $512 million.
