   Looking to improve employee performance, in 2012 Arvin Sango chose

  <p>
   Expanding its capacity to keep up with the growth in demand for automobiles as the result of a recovering economy in North America, Arvin Sango broke ground on new facility in Ontario in 2011 to supply exhaust systems to supply Toyata's Corolla assembly plant in Massachusetts. It also opened its Henderson, Tennessee plant that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was created a joint venture between ArvinMeritor (later
   <company id="54341">
    Meritor
   </company>
   ) and SANGO in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   It later became a 50-50 joint venture between SANGO and
   <company id="55216">
    Faurecia
   </company>
   after Faurecia bought the former ArvinMeritor unit that was responsible for the JV. Faurecia sold its share in 2010 leaving SANGO as the sole owner.
