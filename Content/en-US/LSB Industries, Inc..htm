  <p>
   LSB Industries distributes its agricultural products through 17 wholesale and retail distribution centers (15 in Texas; one in Tennessee; and one in Missouri). Climate Control business conducts its operations in seven facilities, all located in the greater Oklahoma City area.

  <p>
   In 2014 LSB Industries' net revenues increased by 7.8%. Chemical sales increased mainly from agricultural markets driven by increased on-stream rates of their facilities partially offset by lower average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizers. Industrial acid, chemical products and mining products increased due to more products available to sell as the result to the improved on-stream rates of their chemical facilities. Revenues from natural gas increased due to higher sales volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the Climate Control side of the business ,net sales of water source and geothermal heat pump products decreased in 2014 primarily as a result of the loss of the Carrier heat pump contracts resulting in decline in number of units sold. Net sales of hydronic fan coils declined primarily due to lower product orders partially offset by higher selling prices. Net sales of other HVAC products decreased primarily due to a lower beginning backlog in 2014, customer scheduled delivery dates shifting out for their large custom air handlers and modular chillers, partially offset by increased activity on contracts for engineering and construction services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has recorded a decline in net income in the last four years. In 2014, the net income was $19.6 million, a decrease of $35.3 million on 2013. This strong dip was due to changes in property insurance recoveries in excess of losses incurred driven by settlement claims with insurance carriers related to property damage and business interruptions at its El Dorado and Cherokee facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, interest expense, net increased primarily to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes during 2013, partially offset by $14.1 million of capitalized interest on capital projects under development and construction that reduced net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities increased by 23% due to changes in prepaid and accrued income taxes, accrued interest, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid insurance.

  <p>
   In the chemical business, LSB Industries' strategy includes evaluating investment in expansion projects and the decision to build the ammonia plant at the El Dorado facility and construct a new nitric acid plant and concentrator at the El Dorado facility to reduce feedstock costs. The company will also continue to emphasize growth in the agricultural sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   LSB Industries' Climate Control business plans to continue to launch new products and product upgrades in an effort to maintain and increase its current market position and to establish a presence in new markets. Further, it plans to drive growth in the Climate Control business by deeper penetration in certain vertical markets, developing the market for geothermal products, and products for green and energy-efficient construction retrofit. It will also focus on a lean initiative program to reduce production cost, and strategic acquisitions that add complimentary products, scale to existing products or broaden geographic capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's potential strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value include separating the Climate Control business from the Chemical business through a spin-off or sale, and placing some or all of the LSB Industries' Chemical business into an master limited partnership structure.

   As a hedge against rising natural gas prices, in 2012 a Chemical business unit acquired a 7.7% working interest in certain natural gas properties for $49 million. The acquisition (in the Marcellus Shale, in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania) includes interests in 14 proved producing natural gas wells, seven proved non-producing natural gas wells, and 36 proved undeveloped future drilling locations.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company acquired a group of chemical plant components for $6.5 million that it will install in its ammonia plant in Pryor, Oklahoma, and possibly at other plants.
