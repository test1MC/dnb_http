   Prestolite Wire is a pro at creating sparks. The company produces ignition wire sets and battery cables, both in North America and abroad. Prestolite's products are part of the wiring harness assembles found in passenger cars, as well as off-road and recreational vehicles, trucks and buses, and agriculture, construction, and rail equipment. Under the ProConnect trademark, its lineup is also sold to aftermarket distributors and pro mechanics. Non-automotive offerings include copper wires and cables for the industrial, renewable energy, and military markets. Prestolite has manufacturing operations in the US and Mexico and is owned by cable making giant

  <p>
   Using its experience with carmakers as a spring board, the company has focused on expanding its customer base into the North American automotive aftermarket. Its progress is supported by organic investments in manufacturing ignition wire sets, alliances, and business acquisitions that align its offerings with the pro mechanic's requirements.

  <p>
   Although Prestolite was formed as a subsidiary of the Henley Group in 1985, its roots trace back to introducing the focused beam headlamp in the early 1900s. The company became privately held in 1989, and, in 2008, changed its name from Prestolite Wire Corporation to Prestolite Wire LLC.
