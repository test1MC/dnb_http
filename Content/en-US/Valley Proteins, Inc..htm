   The winds of change might be blowing from Valley Proteins, but you'll probably want to hold your nose. A major US rendering company with about 15 plants in eight states, Valley Proteins and its Carolina By-Products subsidiary gather inedible waste from slaughtering operations, provide dead animal collection, and pick up used cooking grease and bones from restaurants and supermarkets. The company turns these waste products into liquid fats, oils, and protein meals for agricultural and pet-food manufacturing companies. Products from Valley Proteins are also used in the production of biofuels. President Gerald Smith Jr. and his family own and operate the company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1949.

  <p>
   From its headquarters in Virginia, Valley Proteins is a global supplier with operations in Singapore. The company services supermarkets, restaurants, slaughterhouses, poultry-processing facilities, and farmers in selected areas of Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and West Virginia. It exports its products from facilities in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia to Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South America, as well as Canada.

  <p>

   As the price for its commodity products rose and people looked for alternative energy sources, Valley Proteins began offering its liquid-fat product BioFuel as an affordable and environmentally sound substitute for natural gas and heating oil. Diversifying products is one component of the company's growth strategy, which also includes acquisitions and expansion into foreign markets. To that end, it added exports beyond the Americas in 2010.

   . Buying Perdue Agribusiness gave the company Perdue's existing supply agreements at its processing facilities, as well as a pair of rendering facilities in (Accomac) Virginia and (Lewiston) North Carolina.
