   Cast around as much as you want, but you won't find a bigger Japanese fabricated metals company than Hitachi Metals. The subsidiary of
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi, Ltd.
   </company>
   manufactures high-grade metal casting components, such as automotive parts (aluminum road wheels, heat-resistant cast exhaust manifolds, and magnetic compass sensors), IT components and materials (antenna switch modules, isolators, and linear motors), and piping and infrastructure products (fire protection piping systems, gas piping, and mass flow controller and metal diaphragm valves), which are used in the automotive, construction, and electronics industries. Hitachi Metals gets more than two-thirds of its sales in Japan.

  <p>

  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net sales surged 24%, and its net income increased 49% from 2014 to 2015. The growth was due to increased sales from high-grade metal products and materials (10%); high-grade functional components and equipment (52%); and wires and cables (30%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hitachi Metals' growth for 2015 was attributed to increased sales of tool steels, due to robust demand in Japan backed by strong capital investment as well as steady overseas markets. Sales of alloys for electronic products also increased, supported by strong demand for display-related materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of rolls spiked on steady demand in overseas markets and a recovery in domestic demand. Sales of cutting tools surged due to favorable demand for industrial machinery in Japan as well as steady demand in overseas markets driven by a bump in exports. Sales of high-grade ductile iron products also climbed in 2015 due to favorable demand for automobiles in overseas markets.

  <p>
   Hitachi Metals often grows through the use of acquisitions. In 2014 it expanded its North American footprint through the purchase of Waupaca Foundry Holdings. Waupaca specializes in making iron casting products for the transportation machinery industry.
