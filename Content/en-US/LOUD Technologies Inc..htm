   LOUD Technologies has worked to extend its global reach through new distribution agreements. In 2013 the company inked a distribution agreement with POLAR Audio Limited to provide for deeper penetration of its Ampeg and Mackie brands in the UK and Ireland. Another agreement, with Mega Audio GmbH, allows LOUD Technologies to sell the brand pair in Germany. It's marketing its EAW and Mackie brands in India through distributor Musik City, as well as via new distribution partners Vardhaman and E&amp;E Systems India Pvt Ltd. since 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   LOUD Technologies is banking on Martin Audio, a UK-based company acquired in 2007, to boost its international distribution, as well as its share of the global audio industry.

  <p>
   In 1970, 20-year-old Greg Mackie and childhood friend Martin Schneider co-founded Technical Audio Products Co. (TAPCO) to make public address systems. Within a few years TAPCO's sales grew to the multimillions; both men left the company in 1978. That year Mackie started AudioControl, a maker of consumer audio equalizers and analyzers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mackie left AudioControl in 1985 and three years later started Mackie Designs by turning out compact mixers from his three-bedroom condo in Edmonds, Washington. Mackie debuted its 8-Bus mixer consoles for multi-track recording and live sound in 1993 and its SR Series (sound reinforcement) of audio mixers in 1995. That year the company went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mackie began selling power amplifiers in 1996, and the next year started making powered monitor speakers, which combine signal processing, power amplifiers, and speakers in a single cabinet. The company later unveiled its digital 8-Bus console system in 1998, developed with Apogee Electronics, and added a 56-channel console to its SR Series mixer line.
  </p>
  <p>
   After acquiring Italy's Radio Cine Forniture (loudspeakers, now Mackie Italy) in 1998, the company established its Mackie Industrial division in 1999 to make sound systems for installation by professional contractors. When profits dipped the company trimmed its Woodinville workforce in mid-1999. CEO Roy Wemyss resigned shortly thereafter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company acquired Eastern Acoustic Works, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of professional loudspeaker systems used in sports arenas and concert halls. It also bought Canadian software developer Acuma Labs and launched its first line of hard disc recorder products. The next year it bought Sydec, a Belgian manufacturer of digital audio products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2003 the company announced its voluntary Nasdaq delisting and began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board. Also that month Sun Capital Partners, a Boca Raton-based private investment firm, acquired about 75% of the company. In September Mackie Designs announced the company was changing its name to LOUD Technologies to eliminate confusion around the company name Mackie and the Mackie brand. In December the company sold its Italian operations, Mackie Designs S.p.A., and also formed the EAW commercial systems group in order to consolidate all of its commercial audio products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 LOUD acquired St. Louis Music, a manufacturer and distributor of branded musical instruments and professional audio products. It purchased Martin Audio in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2008 James Engen resigned as chairman and CEO of the company and was succeeded by Rodney Olson. In October 2010 Mark Graham succeeded Olson was CEO.
