   RTI International Metals has titanium on the cranium. Through its Titanium Group the company produces ingots, bars, plates, sheets, strips, pipes, wire, and welded tubing, used primarily by the aerospace industry to make bulkheads, tail sections, engine components, and wing supports. Fabrication and Distribution groups operate through subsidiary RTI Energy Systems, making pipe and tubing for offshore oil and gas exploration and production, as well as geothermal energy production. RTI caters to commercial aerospace and defense industries, which represent almost 80% of sales, and a growing number of industrial and consumer customers. In 2015 the company agreed to be bought by
   <company id="10068">
    Alcoa
   </company>
   in a $1.5 billion deal.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through two segments: Titanium (45% of total revenue) and EP&amp;S (55%). The Titanium segment melts, forges, processes, and produces a complete range of titanium mill products which are further processed by its customers for use in a variety of commercial aerospace, defense, and industrial, and consumer applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The EP&amp;S segment offers hard and soft-metal services that form, extrude, fabricate, machine, additively manufacture, micro-machine, and assemble titanium, aluminum, and other specialty metal parts and components.
  </p>

  <p>
   RTI markets its products to the international aerospace, defense, energy, medical device, and other consumer and industrial markets. Customers include prime aircraft manufacturers and their family of subcontractors, including fabricators, forge shops, extruders, castings producers, fastener manufacturers, machine shops, and metal distribution companies.

  <p>
   RTI achieved record-setting growth in 2013, with revenues peaking at $783 million. Profits, however, fell 40% from $24 million in 2012 to $14 million in 2013 due to increased expenses, professional fees, and a loss from discontinued operations. (Note: the company restated its annual financial report for 2012 due to discontinued operations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue growth for 2013 was driven by a spike in EP&amp;S segment sales due to higher Boeing 787 volumes and higher duty drawback recoveries. The company also earned additional revenues from previous acquisitions it made.
  </p>
  <p>
   RTI's operating cash flow dropped significantly from $75 million in 2010 to $15 million in 2011. Its cash flow remained at $8 million in 2012 and $12 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   RTI has been making acquisitions to add to its revenue stream. In 2014 the company acquired Directed Manufacturing for $23 million in cash. Directed Manufacturing provides additive manufacturing of titanium, specialty metal, and plastic components for both commercial production and engineering development applications in the commercial aerospace, medical, and oil and gas markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   RTI also in 2014 picked up Advanced Powder Materials for $19 million. Advanced Powder Materials has expertise in titanium powder metallurgy and is a supplier of near-net shape titanium and titanium alloy preforms and components to commercial aerospace, defense, biomedical, and industrial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To extend its international reach, in 2013 the company paid $16 million to acquire Extrusions Europe, Limited (formerly the extrusions business of Osborn Metals Limited). Extrusions Europe manufactures extruded, hot-or-cold stretched steel and titanium parts for a number of markets including the aerospace and oil and gas markets, and its business complements RTI's existing titanium extrusion operations in Houston.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1964 Quantum Chemical (now a subsidiary of Millennium Chemical) and U.S. Steel (now
   <company id="12969">
    United States Steel
   </company>
   ) formed Reactive Metals Inc. The company changed its name to RMI Titanium Company in 1971. It went public in 1990, with Quantum selling its shares and United States Steel retaining its interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The titanium industry is closely tied to the ups and downs of the aerospace industry, and just after RMI's IPO, the industry hit one of its cyclical slumps. RMI suffered years of losses even as it worked to cut costs and develop new markets. In 1992 it closed its titanium sponge (a porous metal used as raw material) facility and began buying lower-cost sponge from third parties. The next year it began providing seamless titanium pipe to California Energy Co. for use in that company's geothermal well. In 1995 RMI completed the world's first high-pressure titanium drilling riser for use in a
   <company id="53892">
    Conoco
   </company>
   North Sea oil rig.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 two events turned RMI's fortunes around. The aerospace industry took off once more, and golfers discovered titanium club heads. RMI formed a joint venture with Earthline Technologies in 1997 to offer soil-remediation services (perhaps relying on its experience as an owner of a Superfund site). In 1997 RMI bought Galt Alloys, a producer of ferrotitanium. The next year the company signed long-term supply agreements with Boeing,
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="90781">
    Aerospatiale
   </company>
   . The company changed its name to RTI International Metals in 1998. USX sold off its 27% stake in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 RTI International Metals received a $6 million settlement from Boeing after the aerospace giant failed to meet the conditions of a 1999 long-term supply agreement between the two companies. Later in the year the company purchased the remaining shares of Reamet, S.A., a French-market distributor of titanium products. In 2001 RTI International Metals saw an increase in net income of over $12 million on sales of almost $286 million, but noticed troubles ahead for its titanium group because of a weakening commercial aerospace industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company entered into agreements with Europe's largest aerospace group,
   <company id="101208">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , to supply titanium products and parts. The following year a work stoppage was held by the company's
   <company id="56122">
    UAW
   </company>
   employees at its Niles, Ohio, plant. Non-union employees operated the plant until union representatives and company management agreed on a contract settlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2008 RTI signed two long-term contracts to supply a wide range of structural and flight control component parts and complex electro-mechanical assemblies to
   <company id="138843">
    Bombardier Aerospace
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105872">
    Bell Helicopter
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the economic crisis grounded the aviation industry. RTI's commercial aerospace market, which represented about 44% of company revenues, sustained revenue losses of 6% over 2008 due to worldwide slowdown of travel.
