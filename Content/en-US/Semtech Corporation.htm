   Semtech doesn't need a semaphore to signal its semiconductors' roles in communications. The company's analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are used by manufacturers of computers, telecommunications, consumer, and industrial electronics. The company's chips are used for power management, circuit protection, transmission, and other functions in a variety of devices, including cellular phones and base stations, notebook and desktop PCs, network transmission equipment, and automated test equipment. Semtech's LoRa platform for long range, low power Internet of Things applications generates a growing amount of revenue for the company. About three-quarters of the company's sales are in the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>

  <p>
   Semtech organizes its operations into four product lines: Signal Integrity, Protection, Wireless and Sensing, and Power and High-Reliability. Each line produces devices for the enterprise, consumer, communications, and industrial end markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Signal Integrity (45% of revenue) makes integrated circuits for optical communications, broadcast video, surveillance video, active cable transceiver and backplane products used in enterprise computing, industrial, communications, and high-end consumer applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Protection products (28% of revenue) makes devices -- called transient voltage suppressors (TVS). The devices protect electronic systems from voltage spikes (called transients) such as electrostatic discharge or secondary lightning surge energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wireless and Sensing (15% of revenue) produces specialized radio frequency products used in industrial, medical, and communications applications as well as specialized sensing products used in industrial and consumer applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Power and High-Reliability (11% if revenue) makes devices that control, alter, regulate, and condition power within electronic systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Systems Innovation Group (1% of revenue) develops analog/mixed signal intellectual property for emerging systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Semtech outsources most of its manufacturing to third-party contractors, which are mostly located in China.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Semtech is based in California and has operations in other parts of the US and in Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Lithuania, South Korea; Sweden, the Philippines, Switzerland, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. The company runs a silicon plant in Reynosa, Mexico.

  <p>
   The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, partly due to its dependence on the consumer electronics industry. Most of Semtech's sales go into big end-use markets: cell phones, desktop and notebook computers, data centers, autos, and the internet of things.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company offers its products through direct sales to customers (more than 40% of revenue) while the rest come via independent distributors. Customers include

  <p>
   After peaking at about $595 million in 2014, Semtech's revenue has tumbled more than $100 million since. The company posted $490 million in sales for 2016 (ended January), a 12% drop from 2015. Enterprise computing, which rose 25%, was the only end-market with gains in 2016 from sales of optical products for data center upgrades and increased deployments of passive optical networks (PON), particularly in China. Sales to other end-markets fell. Communications revenue dropped 24%, hurt by weakness in 40Gbps and 100Gbps Serialization/Deserialization devices for the long-haul optical market and lower net sales to the 4G/LTE wireless base station market. High-end consumer end market sales slid 28% on lower demand from South Korean mobile phone customers due to their loss of world-wide market share. Samsung's share of Semtech sales slipped to 7% in 2016 from 11% in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lower revenue lopped off more than $16 million from Semtech's profit, driving it down to about $11 million in 2016. Expenses included $4.5 million for a restructuring that included a headcount reduction. Cash flow from operations fell $3 million to close 2016 at $103 million, compared to $106 million in 2015. The company reported improved figures for accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses in 2016 than 2015.

  <p>
   Semtech has been around since 1960 by developing new integrated circuits for new uses. It has joined the race to develop chips for the internet of things (IoT), data centers, and automotive applications -- markets that have drawn other chip makers. In 2016 (ended January), the company adjusted its workforce, invested in technologies for these applications, and weathered a slowdown in sales to smart phone manufacturers in South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has seen increased demand in phone makers in China and strength in enterprise applications for its chips. Semtech is betting on its LoRa technology, a long range, low power platform for IoT networks. It has had design wins with LoRa being integrated into cars, street lights, manufacturing equipment, appliances, and wearable devices. The company has deals with Comcast, Softbank, and ZTE to use LoRa in their IoT projects. Semtech counts more than 400 companies in its LoRa Alliance for developing sensors, gateways, and networking using the technology. The company looks for the LoRa business to generate more than $100 million in several years, up from $20 million to $30 million in 2017 (ended January).
  </p>
  <p>
   Semtech was minimally affected by Samsung's battery-induced fire problems and cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7 phone in terms of cost. It does, however, miss out on longer term revenue it might have received over a longer life for the product. The company looks to balance any losses from Korean phone manufacturers with gains from Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, Semtech acquired Triune Systems, a supplier of wireless charging and power management platforms targeted at high and low power, high efficiency applications, for $4 million. The acquisition aids Semtech in developing products for the wireless charging, portable charging, and power management markets. Another 2015 acquisition, EnVerv Inc., adds power line communications (PLC) and smart grid products for advanced metering, home energy management, and internet of things applications to Semtech. The $5 million deal Semtech's available market beyond the industrial wireless segment into the industrial PLC market and the residential gateway market.

  <p>
   Founded in 1960, Semtech was the second semiconductor startup in as many years for Gustav Franzen and Harvey Stump. It went public in 1967. Catering to military customers enabled Semtech to reach $15 million in sales by the end of its second decade. When the price of silver, one of Semtech's raw materials, rose tenfold in 1979 and 1980, the panicked company switched to copper, which didn't work as well. Facing mounting troubles, in 1985 Semtech tapped former Silicon General executive John Poe as CEO (replacing Franzen, who was on vacation at the time).
  </p>
  <p>
   Poe cut costs, raised capital, and brought in new management; by the early 1990s he had moved Semtech into commercial markets. The acquisitions of Lambda Semiconductors in 1990 and Modupower in 1992 boosted the company's power regulation business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diversified industrial firm Allegheny Teledyne, which had once owned nearly a fourth of Semtech, sold most of its stake in 1997 (Allegheny Teledyne's operations were sold off separately in 1999). That year Semtech began providing chips to the fast-growing automated test equipment market when it bought Edge Semiconductor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Semtech made two acquisitions in 1999: Practical Sciences, a designer of high-speed communications components and analog integrated circuits (ICs), and USAR Systems, a maker of input device and systems management ICs for PCs and portable electronics. In 2002 Semtech announced plans to close its last wafer fabrication plant as part of its strategy to outsource all wafer manufacturing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   COO Jason Carlson succeeded Poe as CEO in 2003. Poe remained chairman. In 2004 the company named Tony Giraudo as COO; Giraudo joined Semtech from
   <company id="105657">
    TelASIC Communications
   </company>
   , where he was CEO, and previously worked at
   <company id="14420">

    IBM
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="43707">
    NCR
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company acquired XEMICS, a Swiss developer of ultralow-power analog, radio-frequency, and digital ICs, for $43 million in cash, plus future earnout payments. XEMICS became Semtech's Wireless and Sensing Products business unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   After two years Carlson left the board and the company. Poe stepped in as interim CEO. Mohan Maheswaran, formerly an EVP/GM at
   <company id="99382">
    Intersil
   </company>
   , was named president and CEO in 2006. Later that year, Poe was succeeded as chairman by Rockell Hankin, who previously served as Semtech's vice chairman for eight years and was on the board since 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Poe stated his intention to resign from the board in 2006, effective once Semtech completed its restatement of historical financial results. The company was reviewing its past practices in granting stock options, partly during a period when Poe served as CEO. He previously took a leave of absence from the board to avoid the appearance of a conflict in interests while the board investigated option granting practices. Poe's resignation finally took effect in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company agreed to pay $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over allegations of backdating securities options. The settlement would resolve claims against the company and its current and former officers and directors. No parties conceded any wrongdoing as part of the proposed settlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Semtech acquired France-based Cycleo, a developer of intellectual property (IP) for long-range wireless semiconductors, for $5 million, with an additional $16 million possible based on performance targets. Cycleo's wireless technology, used primarily in smart metering and other automation and control applications, expanded Semtech's extended-range radio-frequency (RF) products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Semtech moved to broaden its high-speed communications infrastructure portfolio when it paid CDN$500 million (about $500 million) for Gennum, a provider of high speed analog and mixed-signal semiconductors used in broadcasting, networking, storage, telecom, and consumer connectivity.
