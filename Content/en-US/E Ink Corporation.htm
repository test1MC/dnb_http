   E Ink is revolutionizing e-reading -- one display at a time. The company develops electronic ink technology used in electronic displays. The ink is printed onto plastic film and contains microcapsules full of positively or negatively charged particles, which form images when an electrical current is applied. The technology, which has the advantage of being visible in direct sunlight, has been used in such applications as signage, mobile phones, electronic readers, and watches.The company's branded product displays include the Carta, Spectra, Aurora, Mobius, Triton, Pearl, and Segmented names.

   Though E Ink's displays have been used in products as diverse as flash drives and mobile phone handsets, its technology has garnered the most attention for its use in eBooks. Amazon.com's popular Kindle reading device, in particular, raised the company's profile. Over the years, E Ink has introduced E Ink Pearl, a next generation electronic paper technology, with a higher contrast ratio and greater readability in sunlight. Companies such as

   have created display driver and power management chips that support the Pearl platform.

   E Ink is looking to expand into other applications, including e-newspapers, e-textbooks, smartcards, shelf labels, and promotional displays. It has partnered with Taiwan-based Chilin Technology, a vertically integrated manufacturer of flat-panel displays that specializes in back-lighting technology, to develop small and midsized displays for industrial controls, medical devices, and smart labels.
