   Zoom Technologies really took off once it traded modems for mobile phones. Through TCB Digital, the company provides electronic manufacturing services (EMS), specializing in mobile phones, wireless data modules, digital cameras, set-top boxes, and GPS equipment for clients that include

   Frank Manning and Peter Kramer started Zoom Telephonics in 1977 to sell the speed dialers that Manning designed while studying at MIT. The company marketed the dialers to MCI and Sprint customers for dialing lengthy long-distance access codes. In 1985 regulators eliminated the need for these codes; Zoom's sales plummeted, but rebounded when it changed gears and concentrated on making modems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unable to find enough financing in the US, in 1988 Zoom went public on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. The company switched to the Nasdaq in 1991. In 1993 Zoom debuted a modem that integrated voice and fax functions. It entered the fast-growing PC card modem market the next year.

  <p>
   In 1996 Zoom entered the remote-access market with its acquisition of Tribe Computer Works, offering products for remote-user connections to LANs. Lowered demand for Zoom's external 33.6K modems (as customers waited for next-generation 56K models) led the company to slash prices in 1997. That year Zoom shipped its first 56K modem, but competing technological standards hindered sales and contributed to a loss for the year. Also in 1997 Zoom began selling PC telephony video cameras

  <p>
   Faced with an industrywide product surplus and a decrease in external modem purchases, the company again saw a loss in 1998. Hoping to gain access to the corporate and reseller markets, Zoom bought the brand name and assets of bankrupt modem maker

   </company>
   in 1999. Zoom followed up with another acquisition in 2000, buying assets of the analog modem business of Boca Research (now Inprimis).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company changed its name to Zoom Technologies.
  </p>

   Zoom began shipments of its DualCam digital cameras, which do double duty as PC video cameras, in 2003. It also initiated shipments of a Bluetooth wireless modem and adapters that year. The company started shipping VoIP products in 2004.

  <p>
   In 2009 the company acquired Gold Lion Holding, a manufacturer of mobile phones in China. Gold Lion was renamed Leimone United, and the purchase gave Zoom its own brand of wireless phones. The company then spun off its dial-up, broadband, and DSL modem products to its former subsidiary,
