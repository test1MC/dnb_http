   The company claims that about 76% of oil and gas companies in North America have used products in their operations. Lufkin Industries has seen a resurgence in rod lift unit sales in recent years due to increased development of oil and liquids-rich formation such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale plays.

   Prior to its acquisition by GE, the company's overall strategy was to extend its position as a leading global supplier of high quality artificial lift and power transmission products, and related aftermarket services, through organic growth and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2015GE Oil &amp; Gas announced plans to close its plant in Lufkin and eliminate 262 positions at the plant and at one other facility.

   To grow its position as the leading provider of automation systems integrated with artificial lift technologies, in 2012 it acquired Ireland-based Datac Instrumentation and RealFlex Technologies. That year it also bought UK-based automation business Zenith Oilfield Technology, for $127.3 million.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired Canada-based Pentagon Optimization Services, which provides plunger lift systems and well optimization products and services. The acquisition bolsters the company's presence in Canada, and introduced Lufkin Industries to the well optimization, testing, and services market. That year the company also bought privately held Canadian firm Quinn's Oilfield Supply for $311 million.
