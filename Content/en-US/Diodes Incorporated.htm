   Diodes Incorporated knows how important it is to be discrete in business. The company makes discrete semiconductors -- fixed-function devices that are much less complex than integrated circuits. Diodes' products include diodes, transistors, and rectifiers; they are used by computer and consumer electronics manufacturers in products such as notebooks, LCD monitors, smartphones, and game consoles. Other applications include power supplies, climate control systems, GPS devices, and networking gear.

        <p>
   In 2015 Diodes' revenue slipped 5% to $849 million, down from $891 million in 2014 due to weaker demand across several key end markets and geographies and lower average selling prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income tumbled 62% to $24 million from $64 million in 2014. Diodes had higher costs for selling, general and administrative purpose and an increase in its research and development budget. Some of the higher costs were related to its Pericom acquisition.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $118 million in 2015, down from $134 million in 2014.

        <p>
   Diodes is under continuous pressure from customers and competitors to reduce the prices of its products, which can result in lower sales and profits for the company. The company has countered by expanding into higher-margin, proprietary product lines, such as high-density arrays and ultra-miniature switching diodes used in mobile applications. It also continues to become more vertically integrated, which brings down cost and increases efficiency of operations. Diodes is looking to expand manufacturing capacity, R&amp;D capabilities, product development, and its sales and marketing organization in part through acquisitions. It's also looking to reduce its gold consumption.

        <p>
   Diodes completed the Pericom Semiconductor acquisition in 2015. The $413 million deal broadened Diodes' analog footprint and adds a mixed-signal connectivity offering. Pericom also brought an extensive timing product line complementary to Diodes' standard product portfolio.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired
   <company id="159552">
    BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited
   </company>
   for about $151 million in an effort to broaden its reach in Asia, particularly China where BCD is strong. Previously, Diodes purchased Power Analog Microelectronics, a provider of advanced analog and high-voltage power ICs, for $16 million in 2012. The purchase strengthened its position in analog products.
