   Danisco intends a pinch of pectin to make foods healthier and safer. One of the world's largest producers of specialty food ingredients, the company sells to food manufacturers worldwide. Its diverse lineup ranges from antioxidants to emulsifiers, enzymes, and fat replacers, used in bakery, dairy, meat, beverage, confectionery, and snack-food products. The company's other offerings include sweeteners; it is a major producer of xylitol, an additive to toothpaste and sugar-free chewing gum. A subsidiary, Genencor makes industrial enzymes and biotechnologies, including cellulosic bioethanol, for applications in animal nutrition to textile treatment. Danisco was acquired by
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   in 2011 for more than $6 billion.

  <p>
   Three publicly held Danish companies -- A/S Danisco (food ingredients), De Danske Spritfabrikker (Danish Distillers), and De Danske Sukkerfabrikker (Danish Sugar) -- merged to form Danisco A/S in 1989. The newly formed company, Danisco A/S, created one of Denmark's largest industrial groups, competing internationally in the food, beverage, sugar, packaging, and ingredients sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   C. F. Tietgen founded De Danske Sukkerfabrikker (Danish Sugar) in 1872, operating two sugar refineries in Copenhagen. Danish Sugar became the sole producer of sugar in Denmark after it acquired Sukkerfabrikken Nykøbing Limiteret (Nykøbing Sugar Refinery Ltd.) in 1989. After acquiring eight sugar refineries in Germany (1991) and overtaking the Swedish sugar industry (1992), Danish Sugar became one of largest producers of sugar in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1881 C. F. Tietgen and C. A. Olesen founded De Danske Spritfabrikker (Danish Distillers), uniting some of the local distilleries in Denmark to produce akvavit. By 1923 Danish Distillers had acquired all remaining independent distillers in Denmark, and had begun producing yeast and spirits.
  </p>
  <p>
   A/S Danisco entered the food ingredients market with the acquisition of Grindstedværket in 1939. Grindstedværket began producing organic chemicals in 1924, and by 1939 the company was producing flavor chemicals, emulsifiers, and enzymes. Danisco renamed its subsidiary Grindsted Products in 1980. Grindsted acquired plants throughout Europe in the 1980s, operating plants in Brazil, France, Malaysia, Mexico, Spain, and the US. In 1995 Grindsted was renamed Danisco Ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997, Danisco announced plans to focus its business on ingredients, sugar/sweeteners, and flexible packaging, as well as divesting its non-related businesses (Suomen Rehu, Danisco Pack, Danisco Distillers, Danisco Paper, Danisco Food, and Ewos). The next year, Danisco continued to add to its ingredients division with the acquisition of Beck Flavors, the largest producer of vanilla in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999, Danisco enhanced its packaging unit by acquiring Sidlaw, a packaging company in Britain. Later that year Danisco acquired Finland-based
   <company id="90934">
    Cultor
   </company>
   and renamed its ingredients division Danisco Cultor. The acquisition transferred Cultor's 50% stake in Genencor International to Danisco. In 2000, Danisco announced plans to develop bio-ingredients for the food industry with Genencor International.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued in 2001 when Danisco lapped up Florida Flavors, a fruit flavor maker which supplies the juice industry. In 2002 in a move congruent with its strategy of focusing on food ingredients, sweeteners, and sugar, Danisco sold its condiment business to Bähncke A/S. It bought Belgian flavor-making company, Perlarom S.A., and opened a flavor-making factory in China geared toward developing flavors customized for the Asian market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2002 Danisco merged its flexible packaging division into a joint venture with
   <company id="42329">
    Amcor
   </company>
   and AB Åkerlund &amp; Rausing to form Amcor Flexibles Europe; however Danisco sold its share in Amcor in 2003. In addition Danisco introduced Elevations 800, a sugar alternative for use in ice cream and other frozen desserts. In 2003 the company formed a joint venture with Chinese company Henan Tianguan Group to produce and market xanthan gum worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Danisco Cultor USA introduced Benefat in 2004. Benefat contains one-half the fat content of traditional fats. Later that year the Danisco's seed division announced the phasing out mustard and rape seed crops to concentrate on sugar-beet seed. The company also formed a joint venture with Chinese company Henan Tangyin Yuxin Co., Ltd., to expand its food ingredients xylitol and xylose production in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   To increase its presence in the emulsifier, ingredient-blend, bio-preservation, and sweetener sectors, the company acquired the food-ingredients business of French specialty chemicals company
   <company id="57376">
    Rhodia
   </company>
   in 2004. The acquisition helped strengthen Danisco's position in the specialty products and texturants market and boosted sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Danisco acquired Eastman Chemical Company's stake in Genencor, as well as the remaining shares from other investors, for $519.5 million, making it the sole owner of Genencor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Danisco develops and produces bio-ingredients through Genencor. It moved much of its biotech research to the US in order to sidestep EU restrictions on genetically modified products. It acquired Genencor in order to enhance its food and animal-feed enzyme operations, as well as its industrial enzyme operations. It sold most of Genencor's health care-operations, including the development operations of two compounds for hematological malignancies, to
   <company id="61777">
    Cambridge Antibody Technology
   </company>
   in November 2005 for $14 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company sold its flavors division to Swiss company,
   <company id="106111">
    Firmenich
   </company>
   ; it subsequently formed a global strategic partnership with Firmenich to provide complete and flexible solutions for food manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lowered sugar demand in Europe forced the company to look for new markets. Danisco widened its footprint in China in 2007 by forming a joint venture, Danisco Sweeteners (Anyang) Co., with Henan Tangyin Yuxin Co. to produce xylitol and xylose for Chinese and international markets. The joint venture helped the maintain its product leadership in this sector of the food-ingredients market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2008, the company bought US company Agtech Products, which develops and produces microbial products for the animal-feed industry. The acquisition was in line with Danisco's strategy of expanding the offerings of its animal-nutrition sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2011 DuPont completed its takeover of Danisco after more than 92% of shareholders tendered their shares. DuPont ultimately offered 700 Danish kroner ($139.12) per share (up from its previous offer of 665 Danish kroner in January). The shares were delisted from the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Exchange in June.
