   Schurz Communications is a regional media company with publishing and broadcasting operations in about 15 states. Its publishing unit is anchored by about a dozen daily newspapers that serve mostly small communities. The company also publishes a number of weekly papers and shoppers. On the air, Schurz Communications owns about ten television stations and more than a dozen radio stations mostly serving Indiana and South Dakota listeners. Other operations include two cable companies, about 25 websites, a phone directory, and a printing firm. The family-owned company traces its roots to 1872 when Alfred B. Miller and Elmer Crockett started the

    South Bend Tribune
   </em>
   in Indiana.

   Like the rest of the media world, the company is focusing its efforts on its digital holdings as audiences increasingly turn away from print. It is making the necessary technology upgrades through the formation of a couple of key partnerships. Schurz wants to continually update and improve its mobile content.
