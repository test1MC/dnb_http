   Axiall's business revolves around the axis of commodity chemicals. The company makes chlorovinyls used by the construction and housing, plastics, pulp and paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Its primary chlorovinyl products are PVC (polyvinyl chloride), caustic soda, and chlorine; this segment also makes vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), used to make PVC resins, chlorinated ethylene, calcium hypochlorite, and hydrochloric acid. Its building products unit makes extruded vinyl window and door profiles and moldings products. In 2016 Axiall was acquired by rival

    Westlake Chemical
   </company>
   in a $3.8 billion deal.

   Axiall chemicals and building products company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its chlorovinyls segment produces a highly integrated chain of products, including chlor-alkali and derivative products (chlorine, caustic soda, vinyl chloride monomer, vinyl resins, ethylene dichloride, and other products). This segment accounted for 75% of the company's total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axiall's building products sub-segment (25%) consists of two primary product groups: Window and door profiles and mouldings products (extruded vinyl window and door profiles and interior and exterior mouldings products); and Outdoor building products, which includes siding, pipe and pipe fittings, and deck products. The company's vinyl-based building and home improvement products, marketed under Royal Building Products and Exterior Portfolio brands.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company does most of its business in the US and has manufacturing facilities located throughout North America. It has 19 distribution branches in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the US accounted for 82% of Axiall's total revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's primary customers are major chemical companies, industrial end-users and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The majority of Axiall's products are shipped from a production facility directly to customers via pipeline, truck, rail, barge and/or ship. The remaining products are shipped from production facilities to third party chemical terminals and warehouses until being sold to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a dedicated sales force for its chemicals businesses, organized by product line and region. In addition, it relies on distributors to market products to smaller customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axiall's building products segment, sales, and marketing activities vary by product line and distribution channel. The window and door profiles are primarily sold by a dedicated sales force and supported by marketing support activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mouldings products are distributed primarily by a dedicated sales force to independent dealers, fabricators, distributors and retail home improvement centers, who resell the products directly to builders, installers or homeowners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The majority of vinyl siding and accessories sales are in North America, where products are distributed through independent building product distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's pipe and pipe fittings are generally sold through municipal and electrical distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deck products are sold to independent building materials supply businesses and are also sold to professionals through distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Axiall spent $17.4 million toward advertising in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, net revenue was $3.36 billion, a decrease of 26% compared to 2014 due to the sale of its aromatics business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, revenue from the chlorovinyls segment decreased due to lower PVC, VCM and chlorinated derivatives sales prices; lower ECU values, especially with respect to caustic soda pricing; and lower ECU volumes driven by weaker demand. These factors were partially offset by higher operating rates and related sales volumes for PVC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building products segment sales decreased due to the impact of a stronger US dollar against a weaker Canadian dollar, partially offset by higher overall sales volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net loss was $816.4 million, a decrease of $862.7 on 2014 due to lower net sales and an increase in goodwill impairment charges related to the chlor-alkali and derivatives reporting unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Axiall's cash from operating activities was $267.1 million, a decreased of 8%.

  <p>
   Axiall is looking to improvements in the US housing market to drive building products volumes higher, increasing the demand for vinyl.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taking advantage of the abundance of ethane in North America's shale basins, in 2014 Axiall signed a deal with Korea-based Lotte Chemical to pursue a 50/50 joint venture to design, construct, and operate a 1 million metric ton/year ethane cracker to be located in Louisiana. The plant is expected to begin operating in 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Axiall sold its aromatics business to

   Americas LLC for $62.9 million.

  <p>
   In 2013
   <company id="11139">
    PPG Industries
   </company>
   merged its commodity chemicals business with Georgia Gulf in a $2.1 billion deal and the company became Axiall.
  </p>
  <p>
   Formerly growing through acquisitions and organic growth, Georgia Gulf's merger with PPG's commodity chemicals business allows Axiall to benefit from significant integration and scale, a broad portfolio of downstream products, as well as the regional advantage of access to low-cost North American natural gas for raw chemical materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   The combined company was the third-largest chlor-alkali and second-largest VCM producer in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the then Georgia Gulf acquired Exterior Portfolio by Crane from the Crane Group for $71 million, which became part of Georgia Gulf's Royal Building Products unit. Ohio-based Exterior Portfolio is a US manufacturer and marketer of siding products. The acquisition furthers Georgia Gulf's strategy of expanding its premium siding offerings to the US market  and obtaining new customers for its chemical products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs, in 2011 the company initiated a restructuring plan that consisted of the shutdown of a plant in Milford, Indiana; discontinuing its fence product line; and the consolidation of three plants, two in the window and door profiles business and another in the pipe business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was incorporated in 1984.
