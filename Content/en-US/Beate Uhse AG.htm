   The titillating catalogs from Beate Uhse are a far cry from
   <company id="14773">
    Spiegel
   </company>
   . The company is Europe's largest porn retailer, selling erotic lingerie, sex toys, and videos through its mail-order catalog (PABO by Beate Uhse) and its chain of nearly 300 sex shops in about 10 countries. In addition, Beate Uhse offers adult content through its Web site operations, telephone sex network, and 49%-owned Beate-Uhse.TV in Germany. The company also has a wholesale manufacturing business with two latex products plants in Germany and the Netherlands, and it owns 30% of Content Group (formerly erotic media), a film licensing operation with a portfolio of some 6,000 erotic films.

   Beate Rotermund (Uhse is her maiden name) took flying lessons growing up in East Prussia. Later she put her skills to work flying repaired German fighter planes back to the front in WWII. With the fall of the Third Reich in 1945, Uhse and her infant son flew to British-occupied Schleswig-Holstein to start a new life. By 1947 she had obtained a trade license and was selling shopping bags and toys from her bicycle.
  </p>

   Condoms were unavailable during the lean postwar years, and while making her rounds, Rotermund noted many unplanned pregnancies. She summarized a book on the rhythm method in a pamphlet called Schrift X, which she had printed. Strong demand prompted her to set up a mail-order business that filled 32,000 orders that year. At the end of the 1940s Rotermund moved to Flensburg and began distributing a leaflet offering products, including condoms and books.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s Rotermund's business got her into trouble with authorities. She was tried under laws that banned material encouraging single people to have sex. None of the more than 2,000 charges against her stuck. Meanwhile, her catalog (titled "Is Everything in Order With Our Marriage?") grew to 32 pages and more than 50 products.

   In the early 1960s Rotermund moved her growing company to its present location in Flensburg. Also that decade she traveled to the United States to study marketing practices and opened her first sex shop.

   Beate Uhse became a private limited company in the 1970s and expanded into over-the-counter medicine and publishing. It also founded the Blue Movie theater chain, which later helped develop Beate Uhse Video Productions. It bought out rival chain Dr. Müller in 1979.
  </p>

   The company became Beate Uhse AG in 1981. During the 1980s its mail-order and sex shop businesses in Germany continued growing. The company celebrated the Berlin Wall's fall in 1989 by giving away 25,000 catalogs to former East Berliners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1990s Beate Uhse expanded into television, radio, telephone sex, and adult Web sites. The company opened its Erotica Museum in Berlin in 1996. In 1998 the company bought Aktuelle Information, which added live interactive sex to its portfolio, and went public in 1999. The following year it began opening sex shops on Germany's autobahns (in 2001 a group of German churches fought back by opening small chapels in the rest areas) and applied for a license to broadcast movies and programs on digital pay TV.

  <p>
   In 2001 Beate Rotermund died of a lung infection at age 81. That year the company joined Swiss firm Erotic Media to launch an erotic pay-TV channel. Beate Uhse expanded its mail order operations into the US for the first time in 2002. Two years, later the firm launched a new retail concept, Mae B., an erotic store designed to attract women.

   In 2005 the company made a further outlay into subscription television, acquiring the Blue Movie service from Premiere (now

    Sky Deutschland
   </company>
   ).
