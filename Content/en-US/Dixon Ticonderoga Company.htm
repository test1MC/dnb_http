   Pencil sales have continued to grow, in spite of many people's reliance on keyboards to do much of their communicating. One help has been the popularity of the Sudoku numbers game, similar to a crossword puzzle, which is best played using a pencil with an eraser. Dixon Ticonderoga has also looked to boost sales by introducing bigger packages, now as large as 48 and 72 pencils per pack.

  <p>
   In 1812 Joseph Dixon, then 13, made his first pencil as a way of reusing graphite that was loaded aboard empty ships as ballast and then dumped overboard at voyage's end. Dixon's experiments in pencil making led him to look for other uses for graphite, and he began using it as a stove polish and then to make crucibles (vessels used for melting iron and steel). He founded Joseph Dixon Crucible in 1827 in Salem, Massachusetts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Civil War spurred demand for portable writing tools, which became more readily available when Dixon's son-in-law developed the first method for mass-producing pencils. By the time of Dixon's death in 1869, the company was supplying about one-third of the nation's pencils. Seeking to control its primary raw material, the firm acquired American Graphite and its Ticonderoga, New York, mine in 1873.

   During the first half of the 20th century, Joseph Dixon Crucible and three other firms owned the US market. (In 1954 the firm pleaded no contest to charges that it had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.) It added to its product line in 1957 by acquiring American Crayon, the maker of Prang and Tempera art products.
  </p>

   Joseph Dixon Crucible fared well over the next two decades but faltered by the early 1980s. In 1983 it was acquired by Bryn Mawr, led by Gino Pala, and it changed its name to Dixon Ticonderoga Company.
