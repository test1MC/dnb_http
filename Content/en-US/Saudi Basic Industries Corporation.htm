   In 2014 SABIC and the Korea-based SK Global Chemical signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement in Seoul, South Korea, for a total investment of $595 million to manufacture a range of high-performance polyethylene products using SK's cutting edge Nexlene technology. The joint venture, located in Singapore, is expected to operate a series of manufacturing plants, the first of which was recently completed by SK Global Chemical at its complex in Ulsan, South Korea, with an expected annual capacity of 230,000 tons. The plants will produce metallocene linear low density polyethylene, polyolefin plastomers and polyolefin elastomers that will meet the growing needs of diverse industries, such as advanced packaging, automotive, healthcare, footwear, and electrical and lighting.
