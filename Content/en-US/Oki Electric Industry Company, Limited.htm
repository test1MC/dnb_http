   Oki posted a 12% revenue increase from 2014 to 2015 (ended March). Sales in its biggest segment, info telecom systems, rose 16%, outpacing growth in the other segments. Specificially, Telecom Systems' sales rose with existing networks for telecom carriers buying more equipment and the steady performance from home networks and GE-PON (Gigabit Ethernet Passive Optical Network). Net income jumped 21% from 2014 with increases revenue and a lack of business structure improvement expenses. Oki has more cash rolling through the company in 2015 with cash from operations rising 21% from 2014.

  <p>
   Engineer Kibataro Oki founded Meikosha in Tokyo in 1881 to produce telephones (only five years after they were invented). Meikosha was soon producing telegraphs, bells, and medical equipment. Its main factory adopted the name Oki Electric Plant in 1889, and the marketing division began operating under the name Oki &amp; Company in 1896.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1907, a year after the founder's death, the Oki groups were united as a limited partnership. Divided again in 1912, they were recombined in 1917 as Oki Electric Co. Oki continued to expand its product line to include automatic switching equipment (1926) and electric clocks (1929).
  </p>
  <p>
   The manufacturer produced communications equipment for the Japanese military during WWII, but after the war it started working on the teleprinter and added consumer goods such as portable stoves. The company adopted its present name, Oki Electric Industry Company, in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oki entered the semiconductor and computer industries in the 1950s, joining Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Nippon Electric Co., and Toshiba as one of Japan's Big Six electronics makers by 1960. It then began developing overseas businesses, particularly in Latin America, where it built communications networks in Honduras (1962) and Bolivia (1966) and radio networks in Brazil (1971).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 Oki formed a computer software unit. The company was a major telecommunications equipment supplier for the Japanese government until the mid-1970s, when the government increased its purchases from other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oki started building PCs in 1981. It consolidated its US operations as Oki America in 1984. A new financial crisis followed in the mid-1980s when the bottom fell out of the semiconductor market -- Oki's earnings plummeted into the red in 1986. However, by the end of the decade Oki had become a major provider of automated teller machines (ATMs) and bank computer systems; growth in the Japanese financial industry sparked a ninefold increase in Oki's sales in 1989. In 1994 Oki established subsidiary Oki Data Corp. to handle printer and fax machine operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plunging memory prices and higher taxes stymied Oki's recovery in fiscal 1998, so the company halted mass random-access memory (RAM) production and closed an assembly and testing facility. Oki shifted its semiconductor focus to large-scale integrated circuits, and placed more emphasis on its information systems segment, which had seen increasing sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further battered by a weak Asian economy, Oki restructured in 1999. That year the company bought Toshiba's ATM operations. It also launched an access control system that uses a person's iris for identification and payment services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Oki announced plans to establish (along with NTT Data, NTT DoCoMo, Microsoft and others) Payment First Corporation, an Internet payment company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to poor market conditions, Oki announced in 2001 that it would reduce its workforce by about 10% over two years. The company also sold its automotive electronics division to Keihin Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oki acquired the driver chip business for large TFT-LCDs from Texas Instruments Japan in early 2005. TFT-LCD drive chips are used in notebook computers, monitors, and TVs.
