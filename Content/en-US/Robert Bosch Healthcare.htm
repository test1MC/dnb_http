   Robert Bosch Healthcare wants to be your healthy buddy. The
   <company id="41437">
    Robert Bosch
   </company>
   subsidiary makes the Health Buddy brand of patient monitoring systems and other means of keeping patients and doctors connected. Health care providers use the systems to communicate with patients, collect vital health information, and provide feedback to patients on health progress. Using the system, diabetics can monitor their blood glucose level or be reminded to take their medicine. The company sells the Health Buddy systems to hospitals and HMOs; drug developers use the product for assistance in clinical trials. Founded in 1988, Robert Bosch Healthcare has been a part of Robert Bosch's US operations since 2007.

  <p>
   The Health Buddy platform is available as a four-button device; as an online system that can be retrieved on PCs, smartphones, and tablets (launched in 2014); and as a cell phone service (an option for patients who may not have access to the Internet). Health Buddy Web features include an integrated reminder system, brain games, and educational content. In addition to its suite of Health Buddy offerings, Robert Bosch Healthcare provides health management programs to help caregivers and patients monitor and manage chronic and post-acute conditions; and offers call center and coaching services. The company also makes a weight scale and a blood pressure monitor (both of which communicate with the Health Buddy system).

   The company is focused on increasingly getting Health Buddy out to the public. To that end, it has enhanced its mobile health, or mhealth, offerings through a partnership with Remedy Health Media. Together the companies will develop and market new Web-based products and services to better engage patients in their own health care. Robert Bosch Healthcare has also partnered with GreatCall to develop wireless mhealth solutions, particularly for older patients.
