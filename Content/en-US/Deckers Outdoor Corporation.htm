   There's no business like the specialty shoe business for Deckers Outdoor. It designs and markets the iconic UGG brand of luxury sheepskin footwear in addition to Teva sports sandals -- a cross between a hiking boot and a flip-flop used for walking, hiking, and rafting, among other pursuits. Other product lines include Sanuk, Hoka One One, and Koolaburra. While imitations flood the market, the company distinguishes UGG and Teva from its competitors by avoiding distribution in off-price outlets. Deckers Outdoor's products are made by independent contractors primarily in Asia. The company sells its footwear through about 150 retail stores worldwide, independent distributors, catalogs, and online.

  <p>
   The footwear firm markets its products under three primary brand names: UGG, Teva, and Sanuk. The UGG brand is one of the industry's most recognized shoe brands. Deckers Outdoors sells its products through both domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to end-user customers worldwide. It also uses websites, call centers, retail concept stores, and retail outlets stores to get its products in consumers' hands.

  <p>
   Deckers Outdoor posted record-setting revenues of $1.88 billion for 2016 (ended in March). The historic growth was fueled by higher sales from its Direct-to-Consumer segment, which was attributed to additional sales from its e-commerce operations as a result of increased traffic to its websites and improved conversion rates. The growth was also attributed to a rise in the number of stores opened in addition to higher sales from Other Brands, mostly its Hoka brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, on the other hand, decreased 24% to $122 million in 2016. This was fueled by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, related to new retail stores opened and increased marketing and advertising and expansion for its e-commerce business. Its operating cash flow dipped by 26% in 2016 mainly due to the lower profits coupled with additional cash used in inventories and in accrued expenses.

  <p>
   While it continues to hone its UGG business to further boost sales, Deckers Outdoor continues to develop its heritage Teva brand. Pleased that the brand survived the downturn in the economy, Deckers Outdoor has expanded the Teva product line in both performance and lifestyle markets and introduced shoes at several price points to attract additional men, women, and children who might be lured away by rival brands, such as Chaco and other shoes owned by

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Deckers Outdoor also focuses on expanding its product portfolio. In 2015, it acquired the Koolaburra brand, a line of fashion casual footwear using sheepskin and other plush materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Deckers Outdoor achieves growth through the expansion of its DTC stores, and in 2015 the company opened a total of 30 new DTC stores. In 2016, the company opened its new flagship store in Disney Springs at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold the MOZO brand, a footwear brand crafted for culinary professionals. It also sold the TSUBO brand, a line of mid- and high-end dress and dress casual footwear, in 2016.

  <p>
   Douglas Otto and his former partner, Karl Lopker, founded Styled Steers in 1973. But the small, obscure maker of leather sandals gained prominence with a line of multicolored rubber sandals. Surfers in Hawaii called them "deckers," and the company soon adopted the name. In 1985 Deckers Outdoor licensed Teva from river guide Mark Thatcher, who invented the Teva strapping system for rafters to ensure sandals remained attached in turbulent waters. Teva sport sandals became a popular form of casual footwear, largely through word of mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
   A continuing rise in UGG sales has extended debates over whether the name is generic or a trademark that could possibly be defended over international boundaries. Australian makers of the sheepskin boots, traditionally called uggs, contend that the name is generic, akin to trying to protect the name "sneaker" as a trademark.
