   Driving some of the demand for its trucks was the company's 2010 introduction of an
   <company id="130205">
    EPA
   </company>
   -compliant truck equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology. The trucks run at near-zero emissions and are up to 5% more fuel efficient. Rallying sales, customer Talon Logistics led took delivery of the first certified trucks in late 2009, followed by significant orders from
   <company id="42237">
    Knight Transportation
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58778">
    Penske Truck Leasing
   </company>
   in 2010. Going forward, the company intends to center its vehicle development efforts on improving emissions and fuel efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 increased demand for the new compliant trucks spurred the company to recall former employees to its New River plant, which boosted headcount by 23%. The New River plant, located in Dublin, Virginia, is Volvo Trucks North America's newest facility and manufactures Volvo's VN and VHD lines. (New River employees took a hit the year before when Volvo Trucks North America made a series of heavy layoffs.) Volvo Trucks North America has also taken steps in recent years to streamline its operations; in 2010 it began sharing campus headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina with Mack.

   AB Volvo built its first truck in 1928. It entered the North American truck market in 1959.
