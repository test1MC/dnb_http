   Coherent's lasers make a lot of sense. The company uses light wave manipulation, called photonics, to manufacture and market a diverse array of lasers. Its products are used in a host of areas: microelectronics (semiconductor fabrication, packaging, flat-panel display, and solar cell manufacturing), scientific and government research in physical and chemical processes, OEM components and instrumentation, and materials processing. Its specialty lasers and systems segment (70% of sales) makes configurable laser products, while its commercial lasers and components unit (30% of sales) specializes in high-volume products sold in set configurations.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has more than a dozen manufacturing plants in Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, the UK, and the US (in Bloomfield, Connecticut; East Hanover, New Jersey; Salem, New Hampshire; Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, California; and Wilsonville, Oregon), in addition to customer support and sales offices worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coherent's largest market is the US, which contributed 27% in 2015, followed by South Korea, 24%, and Japan, 17%.

  <p>
   Coherent uses a direct sales staff located in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. The company reduced advertising spending to $2.1 million in 2015, down from $2.9 million in 2014 and $3.4 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   About half of its sales come from customers in Asia, where most of the world's electronics are made. Its largest customer is South Korea-based semiconductor maker Advanced Process Systems Corporation, accounting for 10% of revenue.

  <p>
   Coherent's revenue has fluctuated in the last five years. In 2015 revenue ticked up 1% to $802 million from $794 million in 2014. The commercial lasers and components segment revenue increased 6% on higher medical, bio-instrumentation, and flat panel display application sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income jumped 29% higher to $76 million in 2015 from $59 million in 2014. Coherent had lower selling, general, and administrative expenses because of reduced charges in deferred compensation plan liabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to about $125 million in 2015 from $91 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Coherent's strategy includes expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and internal development in order to enter new markets while extending its leadership in existing markets, including microelectronics. The company also collaborates with customers to design and development new products as new technologies emerge, and looks to increase its market share using both new product development -- it spends upwards of 10% of sales on research and development -- and acquisitions to spur growth.

  <p>
   In late 2016, Coherent acquired
   <company id="51993">
    ROFIN-SINAR Technologies Inc.
   </company>
   , a developer and manufacturer of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based components, for $942 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Coherent bought Raydiance Inc. for $5 million and the Tinsley Optics business from
   <company id="89493">
    L-3 Communications Corp.
   </company>
   for approximately $4.3 million.

   In 1966 the six founders of Coherent Radiation Laboratories created their first product, a carbon dioxide laser, in a laundry room (the only room in the house with a 220-volt outlet to power the laser). In true Silicon Valley fashion, the founders were all disgruntled ex-employees of another, established company -- in this case,
   <company id="54968">
    Spectra-Physics
   </company>
   . With a research contract from
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   and sales to
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   , Coherent's revenues topped $1 million by 1968. In 1970 the company pioneered lasers for ophthalmologic use and completed an IPO. It introduced a carbon dioxide surgical laser in 1976 and the first true excimer laser (which produces a deep ultraviolet light) in 1977 (the same year it became Coherent, Inc.). In 1981 the company acquired a stake in
   <company id="103507">
    Lambda Physik
   </company>
   (founded in 1971 as the commercial arm of Germany's renowned Max Planck Institute).
  </p>
  <p>
   After limping through the recession of the early 1990s, Coherent sold its industrial division in 1993. In 1995 the company expanded its semiconductor diode laser business with several acquisitions, including the manufacturing operation of laser maker Uniphase (now part of
   <company id="41984">
    Viavi Solutions
   </company>
   ). In 1996 Coherent bought telecommunications microchip laser maker Micracor and a controlling stake in Finnish semiconductor wafer maker Tutcore. That year VP Bernard Couillaud was named CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1997 acquisition of UK-based Ealing Electro-Optics added assembly capabilities for medical and other systems. Also that year the company formed a telecommunications market-based joint venture with Fiber Optics Network (closed in 1999). In 1999 Coherent bought Star Medical Technologies, a maker of laser hair removal equipment, in an effort to expand its medical business.
