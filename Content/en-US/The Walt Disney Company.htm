  <p>
   The company reported in 2015 through five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products, and Interactive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Media Networks operates cable programming services including the

The media networks is the largest segment, accounting for 44% of total revenue in fiscal 2015 (October year end).
  </p>
  <p>
   Parks and Resorts (31%) owns and operates the
   <company id="104368">
    Walt Disney World Resort

   in Florida and the Disneyland Resort in California.

   Studio Entertainment (14%) produces and acquires live-action and animated motion pictures for worldwide distribution to the theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer Products (9%) licenses its trade names, characters and visual and literary properties to various retailers and publishers throughout the world. The company also engages in retail, online and wholesale distribution of products through The Disney Store, DisneyStore.com and MarvelStore.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interactive (2%) creates and distributes branded entertainment and lifestyle content for interactive media platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company combined its Consumer Products and Interactive segments into a single segment.
  </p>

  <p>
   Disney has properties in the US and Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. The company gets about 77% of its revenue from the US and Canada; followed by Europe (12%); Asia Pacific (8%); and Latin America and Other (3%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Other international Disney park locations include a 77% interest in Euro Disney, which operates Disneyland Paris; the company also collects royalties and fees from Tokyo Disneyland Resort, operated by Oriental Land Co.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Disney incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of its films in an effort to generate publicity and generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.6 billion on advertising costs in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's net revenue has been increasing over the last five years. In fiscal 2015, Disney's net revenue increased by 7% to $52.47 billion due to higher media networks segment revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The media networks segment revenue increased due to a 13% rise in affiliate fee revenue, higher contractual rates, and an increase in subscribers, as well as from the benefit of an additional week of operations and from new contractual provisions. Other factors included an increase in advertising revenues due to higher cable networks and broadcasting sales, and growth in TV/SVOD (subscription video-on-demand) distribution and other revenue driven by higher SVOD sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has followed a similar trend to net revenue over the last five years. In fiscal 2015, Disney's net income increased by 12% to $8.38 billion due to higher net revenue and a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges related to severance costs across several of its segments and radio FCC license impairments, in connection with the company's plan to sell its Radio Disney stations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash inflow increased by 12% in fiscal 2015 to $10.91 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Like other media conglomerates, the company depends on a wide array of entertainment offerings across its film, television, and theme parks divisions to generate revenue; it also earns money by distributing its content through multiple channels. A substantial part of Disney's business also comes from ancillary products, mostly aimed at children, created from its trove of characters and other intellectual property.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's growth strategy includes expanding its existing and new businesses, including investments in the international expansion of business and in investing in new business lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its growth business in 2014 and 2015 the company sold it more than 20 Radio Disney stations around the US.

  <p>
   After getting started as an illustrator in Kansas City, Walt Disney and his brother Roy started Disney Brothers Studio in Hollywood, California, in 1923. Walt directed the first Mickey Mouse cartoon,
   <i>
    Plane Crazy,
   </i>
   in 1928 (the third,
   <i>
    Steamboat Willie,
   </i>
   was the first cartoon with a soundtrack). The studio produced its first animated feature film,
   <i>
    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,
   </i>
   in 1937. Walt Disney Productions went public in 1940 and later produced classics such as
   <i>
    Fantasia
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Pinocchio.
   </i>
   The Disneyland theme park opened in 1955.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roy Disney became chairman after Walt died of lung cancer in 1966. Disney World opened in Florida in 1971, the year Roy died. His son, Roy E., became the company's principal individual shareholder. Walt's son-in-law, Ron Miller, became president in 1980. Two years later Epcot Center opened in Florida. In 1984 the Bass family of Texas, in alliance with Roy E., bought a controlling interest in the company. New CEO Michael Eisner (from
   <company id="103362">
    Paramount
   </company>
   ) and president Frank Wells (from
   <company id="103206">
    Warner Bros.
   </company>
   ) ushered in an era of innovation, prosperity, and high executive salaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company later launched
   <company id="143740">
    The Disney Channel
   </company>
   and opened new theme parks, including Tokyo Disneyland (1984) and Disney-MGM Studios (1989; eventually renamed Hollywood Studios). In 1986 the company changed its name to The Walt Disney Company. The Disney Store retail chain debuted in 1987.
   <company id="90721">
    Disneyland Paris
   </company>
   (originally Euro Disney) opened in 1992. The following year Disney expanded its movie studio with the purchase of independent film company Miramax, the brainchild of producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Wells' death in a helicopter crash in 1994, boardroom infighting led to the acrimonious departure of studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg. (He was awarded $250 million in compensation in 1999.) The next year Eisner appointed Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz as president. (Ovitz left after 16 months with a severance package of more than $100 million.) Disney bought Capital Cities/ABC (now
   <company id="10290">
    ABC, Inc.
   </company>
   ) for $19 billion in 1996, and two years later it bought Web services firm Starwave from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. It later acquired 43% of Internet search engine Infoseek for $70 million, and together they launched the GO Network in 1999. Disney bought the remaining 57% of Infoseek later that year and formed GO.com (later
   <company id="43304">
    Disney Online
   </company>
   ), which began trading as a separate tracking stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 ABC chairman Robert Iger was named Disney's president and COO. Later that year
   <company id="103276">
    Time Warner Cable
   </company>
   briefly suspended ABC broadcasts during a dispute over re-broadcasting rights, drawing the ire of some 3.5 million cable customers. (The
   <company id="105650">
    FCC
   </company>
   later ruled that Time Warner violated rules against dropping a station from cable systems during sweeps periods.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its theme parks in Anaheim in 2001, opening Downtown Disney and Disney's California Adventure. It also announced a further restructuring of its Internet business, including closing the GO.com search site and converting its Internet tracking stock back into Disney common stock. That year Disney formed a joint venture with
   <company id="43312">
    Wenner Media
   </company>
   (US Weekly LLC) and took a 50% stake in entertainment magazine
   <em>
    US Weekly
   </em>
   (sold in 2006)
   <em>
    .
   </em>
   Later Disney bought Fox Family Channel, which it renamed
   <company id="143503">
    ABC Family
   </company>
   , from
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   and Haim Saban for $2.9 billion in cash and assumption of $2.3 billion in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Disney began its exit from the sports world by selling the
   <company id="56044">
    Anaheim Angels
   </company>
   . (The company had acquired a 25% stake in the baseball team in 1995 and purchased the remaining interest four years later.)  At Disney's annual shareholder meeting in 2004, about 45% of stock owners voted to not re-elect the embattled Eisner to the board. In response, Disney directors stripped Eisner of the chairman title and named director and former US senator George Mitchell to that position.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disney sold its under-performing chain of Disney Store retail outlets to
   <company id="54082">
    The Children's Place
   </company>
   in 2004. Amid all the strife, the company boosted its children's entertainment properties by purchasing the Muppet and
   <em>
    Bear in the Big Blue House
   </em>
   characters, along with their film and television libraries, from
   <company id="47507">
    The Jim Henson Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Several big executive shakeups occurred at Walt Disney in late 2005. Eisner finally passed the CEO torch after more than 20 years to former COO Iger. That same year Disney Parks opened Hong Kong Disneyland, the company's biggest foray into the world's most populated country. In addition, the Weinstein brothers left Miramax to form
   <company id="148445">
    The Weinstein Company
   </company>
   , ending two of the most successful tenures of the independent film movement. (Disney ceased the operations of Miramax in a cost-cutting move in 2010, and announced plans to sell the Miramax label later that year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006 Walt Disney completed a crucial acquisition -- the $7.4 billion purchase of
   <company id="46451">
    Pixar Animation
   </company>
   . Disney almost lost Pixar as a production partner in the animation house's blockbuster films, but Iger successfully dodged the bullet. Disney Studios' release of
   <em>
    Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
   </em>
   that year topped box office records when it brought in $132 million during its opening weekend. The mark was broken by the third installment of the series,
   <em>
    Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
   </em>
   , which took in $156 million when it was released the next year. Also in 2007, Disney spun off ABC's radio broadcasting operations to
   <company id="56948">
    Citadel Broadcasting
   </company>
   for $2.7 billion in cash and stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disney re-acquired the Disney Store chain in 2008 from Hoop Holdings, a subsidiary of retailer
   <company id="54082">
    The Children's Place
   </company>
   , in an effort to save the stores from closing. Hoop Holdings had filed bankruptcy that year citing continued losses and rising debt. (The Children's Place was not involved in the bankruptcy filing.) Also in 2008 the company reorganized its digital holdings with the formation of Disney Interactive Media Group. The following year, the company purchased a 30% stake in video streaming website
   <company id="159434">
    Hulu
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Roy E. died in late 2009 at age 79. Also that year Disney acquired
   <company id="42835">
    Marvel Entertainment
   </company>
   , bringing Spider-Man, Iron Man, and other comic book characters into the Magic Kingdom. The deal was worth a whopping $4 billion, and changed the course of its movie-making strategy, reducing the number of films the studio releases each year while significantly ramping up production of costly big-budget franchises.
  </p>
  <p>
   In attempts to cut costs, Disney Studios in 2010 sold its venerable
   <company id="104036">
    Miramax
   </company>
   production unit (producer of films as
   <em>
    Pulp Fiction
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Shakespeare in Love
   </em>
   ) in 2010 to a group of investors (including Ron Tutor, private equity firm Colony Capital, and Qatar Holdings) for some $663 million.  Also that year the company spent $563.2 million to acquire Playdom, a popular social game company on
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   , in order to boost its DIMG holdings. Meanwhile, Pixar's
   <em>
    Toy Story 3
   </em>
   was the top grossing summer release in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jobs, who stepped down as CEO of Apple in 2011 for medical reasons and died of pancreatic cancer later that year, had been Disney's largest individual stockholder with a 7% stake he acquired when the company purchased Pixar. (Jobs had bought Pixar from
   <company id="47482">
    Lucasfilm
   </company>
   in 1986.) Upon his death, his Disney shares were converted to the Steven P. Jobs Trust led by his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disney's 2012 box office bomb
   <em>
    John Carter
   </em>
   lost some $200 million, and is reported to be one of the biggest money-losing films of all time.
