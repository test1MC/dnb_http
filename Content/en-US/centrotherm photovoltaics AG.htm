   centrotherm photovoltaics can't make the sun shine but it can help those who want to take advantage of the golden rays. The company, known as CTPV, provides production lines and equipment for manufacturing solar cells and films. It also offers engineering and process-technology services and turnkey production set ups. Operating through six subsidiaries, CTPV supplies manufacturers of crystalline solar cells and thin-film solar cells, as well as solar silicon, including German firms

   and

    ErSol
   </company>
   along with others in North America, Asia, and Europe. CTPV was formed in 2005 but traces its roots to the 1990s when it was part of centrotherm Elektrische Anlagen. The family of CEO Robert Hartung controls CPTV.
The company went public in late 2007 and soon thereafter purchased thin film company FHR Anlagenbau (early 2008). Other subsidiaries include research and development firms as well as an Asian photovoltaic division. About 70% of CTPV's revenue comes from Asia.
