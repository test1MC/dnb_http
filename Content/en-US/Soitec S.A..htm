   Soitec (short for Silicon-On-Insulator Technologies) is a pioneer in the production of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor wafers. SOI technology allows chips to run faster while using less energy. Its Conentrx technology has been used to make systems serving the concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) solar energy industry. Other brand names for its technology include Smart Cut and Smart Stacking. Soitec has manufacturing and research centers in France, Germany, Singapore, and the US. The company was founded by André-Jacques Auberton-Hervé and Jean-Michel Lamure, engineering veterans of France's Laboratoire d'Electronique et de Technologies de l'Information in 1992.

   Soitec's products end up in mobile and multimedia communications, high-performance microprocessors, game and entertainment systems, smart power devices in automotive components, radio frequency and wireless transmission, and lighting. It also makes substrates for specialty electronics and develops materials for the production of LEDs.

   A full 80% of Soitec's revenue comes from its sales to the electronics industry. Sales to solar energy companies bring in 19% of revenue with lighting revenue at 1%.

  <p>
   Soitec's revenue fell 12% in 2015 (ended May) compared to 2014. Sales dropped 45% in its solar segment as part of its purposeful winding down of that business. The company posted its fifth straight loss in 2015 and it was higher than the 2014 loss. The company had higher expenses across the board.

   Soitec is shifting to develop and make more products for mobile devices. Already, it has RF devices in 99% of mobile phones. It wants to get more products elsewhere in a phone and into other devices. As part of the switch, Soitec is sunsetting its solar business, selling it to ConcenSolar. The sales include Soitec's solar assets and manufacturing operations in Germany and the US. In 2015, Soitec secured short-term financing to bolster its balance sheet.
