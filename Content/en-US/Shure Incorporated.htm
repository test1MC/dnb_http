   Shure has been recognized for producing high-fidelity recording gear for consumers amid surging interest in user-generated multimedia content. Shure's most commended product line in recent years has been its PG side-address condenser microphones, which plug into USB ports on computers and feature a built-in headphone jack for zero-latency monitoring and mix control. The microphones are suited for instrumental and vocal recording, and are primarily targeted to performers using a home studio setup.
