   CCL Industries won't object if you give it a little squeeze. CCL produces specialty packaging for the food, health care, automotive, and personal care industries through its three business divisions: labels (pressure sensitive and film), containers (aluminum), and tubes (plastic squeeze). Customers include
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . CCL's packages have held such well-known brands as Febreze fabric freshener and Equal non-caloric sweetener. It has facilities in North and Latin America, Europe and Eastern Europe, and Asia/Pacific.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   CCL operates almost 90 plants worldwide in more than a dozen countries. It gets more than half of its sales from the Americas, with the US (and Puerto Rico) representing 37% of total sales.

  <p>
   CCL has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last few years. Total sales peaked at $1.31 billion in 2012, a historic milestone for the company. Profits also spiked to $98 million in 2012. The company's label segment experienced increased revenue due to strong organic growth and the positive benefit of previous acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth for 2012 was also driven by higher container segment sales fueled by a strong performance in the US and Mexico and improved volume gains in aerosols. The tube segment enjoyed higher demand for highly decorated tubes for the premium personal care and cosmetic sector.

  <p>
   The company makes strategic purchases to enhance and increase its global customer base, as well as its product portfolio. In recent years the company has focused acquisitions on emerging markets such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Though the Asia/Pacific region represents a little over 5% in sales, CCL is looking to grow its presence in that emerging market.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCL has also made key acquisitions in established markets. In 2014 it agreed to acquire Sancoa &amp; TubeDec, a label and plastic tube supplier with three plants located in New Jersey and one in Ohio, for $71 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it acquired the former Office and Consumer Products segment belonging to
   <company id="10150">
    Avery Dennison
   </company>
   for $500 million. The operations make school and office products under established brand names such as Avery, Marks-A-Lot, and HI-LITER. The operations had sales of $120 million in 2012, and the deal was CCL's biggest to date. CCL Industries also in 2013 acquired Advanced Packaging Films GmbH for $9 million. Advanced trades as Advanced Performance Films and became part of the CCL Label global Food &amp; Beverage business.

  <p>
   CCL Industries was founded in 1951 by George S. Lang as the packaging and custom-manufacturing partner of a US-based aerosol firm, Connecticut Chemicals Limited. The Lang family later bought out its partner and changed the company name to Conn-Chem. It expanded into the pressure-sensitive label business in the 1970s before being renamed CCL in 1979. The company went public in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCL continued to expand its operational scope, entering the container business with the purchase of Continental Can Canada's packaging subsidiary in 1983. In 1985 the company bought Advanced Extrusions and several other US aerosol and tube manufacturers as it entered the specialty-packaging field under the divisional name of CCL Container.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company decided a change in course was necessary in order to survive the ramifications of the US-Canada free trade agreement. Under the agreement, large US manufacturers were allowed to serve the Canadian market from domestic facilities, rather than outsource the work to a Canadian company. So, in 1989 the company agreed to sell Continental Can Canada to Crown, Cork &amp; Seal for cash and stock. The decision to sell -- risky considering the can division represented about 68% of CCL's 1988 operating profit -- was born of the knowledge that it lacked the scale to compete globally with American competitors; it also cemented the company's change of identity from primarily that of a can manufacturer to that of a consumer products company. Strategically, this restructuring targeted the European market as the means to global status; it planned to spend up to $500 million on acquisitions in Europe in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1989 and 1995 the company made 19 acquisitions; business outside Canada accounted for 75% of CCL's sales. Also in 1995 the company expanded its label business with the purchase of
   <company id="10150">
    Avery Dennison
   </company>
   's pressure-sensitive label business, making it one of the North American leaders in this sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its purchases of SEDA Specialty Packaging,
   <company id="12842">
    CLARCOR
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="53047">
    Teledyne
   </company>
   Packaging in 1997, CCL became the only company able to offer aluminum, tin, laminate, and plastic tubes. In 1998 the company also became North America's largest pressure-sensitive label maker with the acquisition of
   <company id="14746">
    Sonoco
   </company>
   Engraph.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Chairman and CEO Wayne McLeod announced his retirement, and president and COO Donald Lang (son of the founder) was tapped to succeed him as CEO; Jon Grant was named non-executive chairman. CCL aerosol and liquid manufacturing began in CCL's joint venture in China, and it expanded the company's manufacturing into continental Europe by buying the German aerosol-filling business of Rapid Spray and PharmCoTec.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company celebrated nine years of consecutive sales growth by signing multi-year contracts with
   <company id="110997">
    Clairol
   </company>
   and Procter &amp; Gamble in 2000. That year the company sold its labeling equipment group, aiming to focus on the label division's core objective: providing identification and information labels for a variety of consumer products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 CCL sold of two of its units: K-G Packaging business unit lines -- Air Guard Control, which marketed insect and odor control solutions; and North American Professional Products (NAPP), which marketed Crown brand industrial adhesives, cleaners, lubricants, paints, and other specialty products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 CCL sold four units organized under its Container division in an effort to return focus to the division's core operations. The company also expanded its health care solutions unit through the acquisition of Lucas-Insertco. Later that year, CCL purchased Avery Dennison's European label business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company acquired leaflet manufacturer Graphiques Apex. It also sold its label manufacturing plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Color Ad Label for about $7 million. The following year CCL sold its custom manufacturing division, with four North American plants, to further hone its focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company merged its European and Asian label operations with German label provider Steinbeis Packaging, which it acquired in 2005. CCL also acquired Graphiques Apex, a manufacturer of leaflets for pharmaceutical companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCL exited the custom manufacturing business via a series of dispositions, culminating in its 2005 sale of CCL Custom Manufacturing and its four plants to KIK Corporation's KCP Income Fund, a manufacturer of bleach and provider of contract packaging services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, CCL bought the 49% of its joint venture with Pachem that it did not already own. Through the venture, CCL offers package decoration for European food, beverage, and battery companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later and a world away, CCL bought Brazil-based pressure label maker Prodesmaq. The deal gave CCL two manufacturing facilities and a significant foothold in the Latin American label market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2007, CCL spent about $90 million to acquire the sleeve label business of
   <company id="10778">
    Illinois Tool Works
   </company>
   . That same year it sold its 40% stake in ColepCCL, to its joint venture partner, RAR - Sociedade de Controle. Early the next year, the company formed a joint venture with Russian entrepreneur Ilgar Mamedov to provide labels to customers in Russia and surrounding nations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 2008 the company invested some $25 million into expanding its CCL Label operations in Asia, including building a label facility in Vietnam. The company first entered Asia in 2005 with a facility in Thailand; that facility has subsequently undergone two expansions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 CCL acquired Australia's Clear Image Labels for about $33 million in cash, stock, and assumed debt. The firm makes pressure-sensitive labels for wineries in Australia and the US and gave the company an entrée into the beverage labeling industry. Clear Image has annual sales of around $21 million. That same year CCL purchased German-based Eltex and Russia-based CCL-Kontur.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCL exited its tube operations in Mexico in 2009, and it sold its ABS bag-on-valve business from its Container division to
   <company id="16066">
    AptarGroup
   </company>
   . The operations were a part of CCL's aluminum aerosol can business, which the company continues to operate. CCL received about $9 million for the unit, the sale of which was part of CCL's efforts to focus on extruded aluminum products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In spring 2011 CCL acquired Thunder Press (operates under trade name Sertech), a label company based in Chicago. Sertech produces patient instructional leaflets for US pharmaceutical customers. The transaction was valued at approximately $10 million (cash and assumed debt).
