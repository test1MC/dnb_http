  <p>
   Formed in 1970 as Azteca Corn Products Corp., the company was sold to baker Pillsbury in 1984. Under Pillsbury, Azteca's product line and brand recognition grew. In 1989 founder Velasquez and his wife bought back the assets of the business from Pillsbury and changed the name to Azteca Foods, Inc.
