   Canon is at home in the office, as customers keep putting off the day of the paperless office by buying printers and copiers. The company makes digital printers, multifunction document equipment, and other computer peripherals for use in the office and the home. Its consumer and professional photography business (including the EOS and PowerShot cameras), makes still and video digital cameras, LCD projectors, lenses, and binoculars. Canon remains big but has been affected by market forces. It also operates an industrial segment, featuring such diverse products as semiconductor manufacturing equipment, television broadcast lenses, and devices used for eye examinations. Customers in its home country of Japan generate 19% of the company's revenues.

   Canon's office segment accounts for 56% of its revenue. The biggest part of the segment is its printer business, which brings in 23% of the company's revenue. Copiers -- color and monochrome combined -- generate 20% with other devices at 13%. Cameras lead Canon's imaging system segment with 23% of revenue with inkjet printers printing out 10% of total revenue. The company's industry-focused segment accounts for just 8% of revenue. Sales of the tiny lithography equipment unit (2% of revenue), bolstered by the addition of the Molecular Imprints acquisition, grew 46% in 2014.

  <p>
   Canon makes products in 28 plants in Japan and 18 plants in other countries including China, France, Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. Europe is the company's biggest market with 29% of sales, with the US a close second at 28%. Canon's Asia and Oceania territory is the only place where sales grew (up 5%) in 2014. It accounts for about a quarter of Canon's revenue.

  <p>
   Canon sells mainly through its regional marketing subsidiaries: Canon Marketing Japan Inc. in Japan; Canon USA, Inc. in the Americas; Canon Europe Ltd. and Canon Europa NV in Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East; Canon (China) Co. Ltd. in Asia outside Japan; and Canon Australia Pty. Ltd. in Oceania.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sells laser printers on an OEM basis to Hewlett-Packard, which resells them under the 'HP LaserJet Printers' name. Sales to HP made up 17% of Canon's revenue in 2014.

   Canon's revenue was essentially flat from 2013 to 2014 with a 7% decline in sales from the company's imaging system segment. Sales of cameras and related equipment such as interchangeable lenses fell 12% in 2014. Canon did report, however, healthy growth for some of its higher-end cameras that feature high-resolution images and high-magnification zoom lenses. A 4% increase in the office segment helped offset the imaging decline. Since 2011 when revenue peaked at $45.9 billion, Canon's revenue has tumbled 32%. Sales of lithography equipment to the semiconductor industry and of digital radiography instruments for medical use were healthy in 2014.

  <p>
   Net income, however, rose 11% in 2014 compared to 2013 on increases in other income from higher interest and dividend income.

   In 2015 Canon came to the conclusion of a multiyear program it calls the Excellent Global Corporation Plan, which was designed to get the company in shape to compete in the digital economy. The company has transformed finances and operations, including the complete digitization of its imaging and printer products. While Canon has made internal changes, it also has acquired companies to add new capabilities.

  <p>
   In 2014 Canon acquired Molecular Imprints (now

    Canon Nanotechnologies
   </company>
   ), a company that makes nanotechnology-based lithography for making semiconductors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another acquisition, of Milestone Systems, a provider of open platform video management software, is to help Canon maintain its top spot in the global network video surveillance market. Video is also the focus of Canon's 2015 acquisition of Axis AB, a developer of network video applications.

  <p>
   Takeshi Mitarai and a friend, Saburo Uchida, formed Seiki Kogaku Kenkyusho (Precision Optical Research Laboratory) in Tokyo in 1933 to make Japan's first 35mm camera. In 1935 the camera was introduced under the brand name Kwanon (after Quan Yin, the Buddhist goddess of mercy) -- but later renamed Canon. In response to a pre-WWII military buildup, the company made X-ray machines for the Japanese.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1947 the company became Canon Camera Company as the brand name gained popularity. Canon opened its first overseas branch, in New York, in 1955. It diversified into business equipment by introducing the first 10-key electronic calculator (1964) and a plain-paper photocopier (1968) independent of
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   's patented technology. Canon dropped "Camera Company" from its name in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company invented the "liquid dry" copying system, which used plain paper and liquid developer, in 1972. It failed to produce new cameras and was surpassed by
   <company id="41874">
    Minolta
   </company>
   (now defunct) as Japan's top camera exporter. Sales were sluggish in the early 1970s, and in 1975 Canon suspended dividends for the first time since WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   At that time Canon's managing director, Ryuzaburo Kaku, convinced Mitarai that the company's problems stemmed from indecisive leadership and weak marketing. Kaku turned Canon around, unleashing the electronic AE-1 in a media blitz that in 1976 included the first-ever TV commercials for a 35mm camera. With automated features, the AE-1 appealed to the clumsiest photographers. Its success catapulted Canon past Minolta as the world's #1 camera maker.
