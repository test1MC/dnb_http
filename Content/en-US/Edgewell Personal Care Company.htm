  <p>
   Revenues declined by 2% from 2015 to 2016 due to decreased sales from infant care and other segment (26%) and skin products (8%). The company was also hurt by currency fluctuations from Venezuela in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Edgewell posted positive net income of $178 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $275 million in 2015. The was fueled by decreased selling, general, and administrative expenses driven by lower pre-tax spin costs in addition to fewer impairment charges.

  <p>
   Both internal development and acquisitions have fueled Edgewell's growth. In 2015 it exited its industrial business, which was part of its all other segment, due to a shift of management focus to other segment products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Edgewell acquired Bulldog Skincare Holdings, a UK-based men's grooming and skincare products company. Bulldog offers male skincare products including moisturizers, face washes, scrubs, balms, shave gels and creams, body washes, lip balm, and lotions. The acquisition allowed Edgewell to expand its personal care portfolio in a growing global category where it can leverage its large geographic footprint.
