   Escalon Medical has an eye for ophthalmic instruments. The company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes diagnostic and surgical devices for use in ophthalmology, specifically ultrasound, digital photography, and image management systems. Its subsidiary companies are branded and operate under the Sonomed Escalon name. Products include the PacScan Plus and Master-Vu ultrasound systems and AXIS image management system. Escalon Medical was founded in 1987. It divested its Escalon Clinical Diagnostics (ECD) business in 2012  to put more focus into growing its ophthalmic business.

   Escalon's operations underwent some significant changes in 2012 in the face of recurring operating losses and  mounting debt. In 2012 it sold its Escalon Clinical Diagnostics (ECD) business for $6.5 million in cash to
   <company id="61584">
    ERBA Diagnostics
   </company>
   . That segment included the
   <company id="100998">
    Drew Scientific
   </company>
   and JAS Diagnostics subsidiaries, which made and sold instruments and consumables for blood cell counting and analysis, including diabetes testing and hematology equipment. The sale of ECD is intended to help the company pay down debt and enable it to focus on growth opportunities for its ophthalmic medical device business, Sonomed Escalon, which consists of subsidiaries Sonomed, Escalon Digital Vision, and Trek.

  <p>
   A key part of Escalon's strategy since 1997 has been to acquire certain businesses or product lines to enhance or expand them, then eventually divest them, using the proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and provide additional working capital. It divested its ECD business in 2012 and previously did the same with its SMARTNEEDLE and pd ACCESS Doppler guided needle product lines, selling that vascular access product line to
   <company id="60751">
    Vascular Solutions
   </company>
   in 2010 for $5.75 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Escalon's acquisitive strategy isn't wihthout its pitfalls, however, as the company has reported recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, which are now raising doubt as to its ability to continue. In fiscal 2012 (ends June) Escalon saw its net loss deepen to $5.9 million from a net loss of $5.7 million in fiscal 2010. Already, it has been trying to reduce its R&amp;D and administrative expenses (including employee layoffs), but the company says it is also now exploring other options, such as entering into business partnerships or selling off more assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Year over year, Escalon's total revenues declined about 4% in fiscal 2012 (ends June) from 2011. Product revenue from ECD and Sonomed Escalon decreased approximately 5% and 3%, respectively. ECD was hurt in part by the decreased availability of certain Drew instruments, while Sonomed Escalon's revenues fell partly as a result of decreased sales of Sonomed ultrasound products.in domestic and international markets. Within the same period, Sonomed Escalon R&amp;D expenses increased about 15% as the business develops its next generation of diagnostic ultrasound instruments.
