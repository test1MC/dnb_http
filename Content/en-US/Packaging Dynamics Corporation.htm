  <p>
   Making good on its growth strategy, Packaging Dynamics has added new businesses and trimmed operations. In 2013 it sold Thilmany Papers to a new company formed and owned by investment funds sponsored by
   <company id="108940">
    KPS Capital Partners
   </company>
   . By selling the operations, Packaging Dynamics is shifting focus to its packaging and converting businesses while allowing the new specialty papers company to focus on its own set of customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Packaging Dynamics acquired Pac Paper, located in Vancouver, Washington. Pac Paper manufactures and sells a broad range of specialty paper packaging products primarily for foodservice, food processing, agricultural, and industrial applications. The deal grew the company's operations in the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada.
