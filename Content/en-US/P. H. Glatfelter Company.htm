   Turning over a new leaf? P. H. Glatfelter does it every day as a leading global manufacturer of specialty papers and engineered products. The company's largest business unit, Specialty Papers, produces carbonless paper, book publishing paper, envelopes, and engineered paper for digital imaging, postage stamps, greeting cards, and other niche applications. Its Germany-based Composite Fibers unit makes products like coffee and tea filter paper and self-adhesive labeling paper, while the

    Advanced Airlaid Materials
   </company>
   business focuses on nonwoven fabric-like materials used in feminine hygiene products, diapers, cleaning pads, and wipes.

  <p>
   Glatfelter owns and operates manufacturing facilities and pulp mills in the US (Pennsylvania and Ohio), Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the Philippines.

  <p>
   From an operating perspective, Glatfelter's businesses performed relatively well in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011, led by improvements from Specialty Papers (which benefitted from higher selling prices) and Advanced Airlaid Materials (which saw an increase in shipping volumes). Shipping volumes in Composite Fibers, on the other hand, were down 3% due to softer economic conditions in its markets. Overall company sales and profit for the year were up slightly, though net income was half of what it was in fiscal 2009.

  <p>
   Glatfelter's largest business unit, Specialty Papers, ranks among the top five paper companies that serve approximately 80% of the North American market. It is one of the leading suppliers of carbonless and book publishing papers in the US. However, those paper markets are facing shrinking demand in the digital age. The company is replacing this lost volume with products such as envelope papers and business forms, though these markets too are in decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   This downward trend is putting more pressure on its other two business units, Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials, to more aggressively pursue growth markets. Composite Materials is investing in new machinery to enhance production capacity, and it is looking for ways to reduce costs and improve product mix in order to better serve the food and beverage and composite laminates markets. (The composite laminates market uses papers in the production of decorative laminates, furniture, and flooring.) Advanced Airlaid Materials, a relatively new business, is trying to optimize its existing production capacity and acquire new customers. It currently generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market. The feminine hygiene category accounted for 80% of Advanced Airlaid Materials' revenue in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   Glatfelter has made four acquisitions since 2006, including its 2010 acquisition of Concert Industries for $235 million, which led to the formation of the business unit known as Advanced Airlaid Materials. This purchase opened the door to a new customer base, namely global consumer product companies that make and sell feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products.

   Similarly, Glatfelter announced an agreement in 2013 to purchase Germany's Dresden Papier from Canada's Fortress Paper for $209 million to add nonwoven wallpaper base materials to its Composite Fibers' nonwoven product line. Through the deal, Glatfelter will become a supplier to most of the world's largest wallpaper manufacturers, and it will gain leverage in large emerging markets such as China and Russia.
