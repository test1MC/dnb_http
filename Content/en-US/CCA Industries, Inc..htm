   Consumers count on CCA Industries for health and beauty care. The company makes and markets health and beauty aids, each under its own brand name, including Plus+White (oral care), Bikini Zone (shave gels), Sudden Change (skin care), Solar Sense (sun protection), and Nutra Nail and Gel Perfect (nail care), among many. It also sells dietary supplements (tea and chewing gum) under the Mega-T label. CCA items are made under contract, and several, such as Hair-Off, Mega-T, and Kids Sense, are made and marketed under licensing agreements. The firm caters to food and drug retailers, such as

  <p>
   CCA's sales and profits fell in fiscal 2013 (ended November). Sales declined 28% versus the prior year, to $38.8 million, and the company posted a loss of $6.2 million. Lower revenue from its health and beauty aid business, a decline in royalty income on foreign sales, and a loss on sales of investments, all contributed to the disappointing performance. Sales of the company's skin care, nail care, dietary, and fragrances were all down significantly, sales of oral care products declined slightly, while analgesics (less than 1% of sales) posted a gain. The company blamed its net loss on lower revenue and an increase in bad debt expenses. Cash flow plunged from nearly $1.5 million in fiscal 2012 to -$5.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company posted a loss in fiscal 2013, it expects to benefit from its outsourcing agreement with sales and marketing company Emerson Group in 2014, which should result in a substantial reduction in personnel and other expenses.

   Amid falling sales and profits CCA is restructuring its operations to reduce its overhead and return to profitability. As of February 2014, the company turned over all its warehousing and shipping functions to
   <company id="130105">
    Ozburn-Hessey Logistics
   </company>
   (OHL), a supply chain management company. (The company's inventory will be moved to an OHL-managed facility in Indianapolis.) CCA also recently formed a partnership with New Jersey-based Emerson Group, under which CCA will outsource certain sales and administrative functions. CCA expects these two initiatives to potentially save it more than $3.5 million in overhead expenses over the course of the year. The sudden death of the company's CEO in February 2013 amid a challenging retail environment was blamed for a loss of momentum at the company. A new permanent leader was named in October 2013.
