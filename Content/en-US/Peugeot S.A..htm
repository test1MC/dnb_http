   PSA Groupe (formerly Peugeot S.A) is Europe's second largest carmaker, behind
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   . The company makes and sells over 3 million cars and light commercial vehicles each year under the Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, and Opel brands. Peugeot is among the top manufacturers in European passenger car and commercial vehicle sales. It also has a significant automotive parts business,
   <company id="55216">
    Faurecia
   </company>
   , as well as a transportation and logistics arm,
   <company id="142020">
    GEFCO
   </company>
   , and a financial services business, Banque PSA Finance. Other group products include motorcycles and scooters. Peugeot makes most of its sales in Europe. PSA agreed to acquire

   's European business, which includes the
   <company id="103617">
    Vauxhall

  <p>
   PSA makes most of it money from automotive sales, accounting for some 65% of revenue. Its
   <company id="55216">
    Faurecia
   </company>
   business brings in some 32% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   PSA's Peugeot line-up includes two small city cars, the 108 city car and the 208 supermini; a range of family cars, the 308 small family car, the 3008 SUV, the 508 saloon, and the 5008 large SUV; and utility vehicles like the Partner Tepee leisure van and the New Traveler van. It also makes a small electric city car, the Ion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citroen's line-up fills much the same niches in the C-Zero and C1 (city segment); C3 and C4 (family); and the Berlingo and SpaceTourer (large and utility). Citroen also controls DS, a premium sub-brand that sports a different logo.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="55216">
    Faurecia
   </company>
   is Peugeot's automotive parts arm. It specializes in automotive seating, but also does interior systems, emissions control technologies, vehicle interiors and doors, and front-end systems.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Peugeot makes around 72% of sales in Europe, 8% from North America, 7% from Latin America, 6% from China &amp; Southeast Asia, 4% from the Middle East and North Africa, 2% from India, and 1% from Eurasia.

    Note: Growth rates may differ after conversion to US Dollars.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended December), revenue fell a marginal 1% to €54.7 billion amid slight weakening in both Automotive and Faurecia. The main contributing factors were unfavorable exchange rate movements and a decrease in sales to partners. Sales volumes and prices were both up 2%, partially offsetting the exchange-related decline. Unit sales increased in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Latin America, but fell in China and Southeast Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 79% to €2.1 billion as cost saving initiatives increased margins in both Automotive and Faurecia. Cash from operating activities of €6.5 billion was down 46% from €12.0 billion in 2015 due to changes in working capital.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The once-struggling Peugeot returned to growth sooner than expected, changed its name to PSA Groupe to mark a clean break from the past, and has wasted in no time in launching a large-scale growth strategy. It is aiming for 4% recurring automotive operating margin and 10% revenue growth by 2018, with secondary 2021 targets of 6% and +15%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The strategy is based on three pillars: digital transformation, an ambitious product release schedule, and cost reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key to the latter two is its EMP2 platform. EMP2 is a foundation (comprising engine, chassis, drivetrain, wheels, among other things) upon which PSA builds a varied range of cars for the Peugeot and Citroen brands. The platform is highly scalable and flexible, allowing PSA's manufacturing plants to switch production models relatively quickly, while the reduction in variables improves cost efficiencies. From a product standpoint, EMP2 allows for customization of suspension, driving position, and cabin size, among other things. Its high-end cars can be four wheel drive, with combustion and electric engines separately powering the front and rear axles.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the flexibility offered by the EMP2, PSA is aiming to release one new model per brand per region per year. The company has said it's developing 26 new passenger vehicle models and eight new commercial vehicles, including a 1-ton pickup.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the digital front it is increasing its mobility services. PSA ultimately sees its future as a mobility company, of which car sales is one pillar. Reaching this goals involves re-imagining its digital offering, ushering services such as car sharing, smart services, leasing, and B2B fleet sharing and management. It make a series of acquisitions of car sharing firms across Europe in 2016, including Kooliar in France, emov in Spain, Travelcar in France and more, Communauto in Canada, and Bollore in Los Angeles. PSA launched an app in 2017 that consolidated the acquired services into one platform. Additionally, PSA acquired Autobutler, an online quote platform for car repair work, has rolled out online car purchases in Brazil and the UK and online aftersales appointments in Europe, and in 2018 it will begin over-the-air updating of infotainment software. Further down the line, PSA hopes to develop its automated driving capabilities, initially in limited systems such as traffic jam assist but eventually extending to fully self-driving.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another facet of PSA's strategy includes a long-anticipated return to the US. Its US strategy is likely to be led by its DS brand -- the long-term aim is to ramp up perception of the brand to parity with the likes of Audi, BMW, and Mercedes. The Citroen and Peugeot brands could follow.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concurrent to the above, in 2017 PSA agreed to acquire
   <company id="10640">
    General Motor
   </company>
   's European arm, comprising the Vauxhall and Opel brands, for £1.9 billion. The two brands have combined sales of around 1 million; factoring in PSA's own sales takes the total to some 2.5 million. The acquisition brings firstly size, allowing PSA a certain amount of stability in the highly competitive European car market. Secondly, Vauxhall and Opel have not turned a profit for many years but given CEO Carlos Tavares' success in turning around PSA's profitability, the hopes are that he can repeat the trick at the acquired businesses.

  <p>
   In 1810 brothers Frédéric and Jean-Pierre Peugeot made a foundry out of the family textile mill in the Alsace region of France and invented the cold-roll process for producing spring steel. Bicycle production began in 1885 at the behest of avid cyclist Armand Peugeot, Jean-Pierre's grandson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Armand turned to automobiles and built Peugeot's first car, a steam-powered three-wheeler, in 1889. A gas-fueled Peugeot tied for first place in the 1894 Paris-Rouen Trials, the earliest auto race on record. That year the budding carmaker built the first station wagon, followed in 1905 by the first compact, the 600-pound "Le Bébé."
  </p>
  <p>
   Peugeot built factories in France, including one in Sochaux (1912) that remains the company's main plant. It made the first diesel passenger car in 1922. The 1929 introduction of the reliable 201 model was followed by innovations such as synchromesh gears in 1936. The company suffered heavy damage in WWII, but quickly bounced back and began expanding overseas after the war.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1954 CEO Roland Peugeot rebuffed a board proposal calling for global expansion that would place the company in competition with US automakers. By 1976 the French government persuaded Peugeot to merge with Citroën.
  </p>
  <p>
   André Citroën founded his company in 1915, and in 1919 it became the first in Europe to mass-produce cars. Citroën hit the skids during the Depression and in 1934 handed
   <company id="41240">
    Michelin
   </company>
   a large block of stock in lieu of payment for tires. Citroën never fully recovered, though by 1976 the company's line ranged from the 2CV minicar (discontinued in 1990) to limousines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1978 Peugeot bought
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   's aging European plants and withering nameplates, including Simca (France) and Rootes (UK). Peugeot changed the nameplates to Talbot but sales continued to slide. It lost nearly $1.2 billion from 1980 to 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jacques Calvet took over as CEO in 1984. He cut 30,000 jobs and spent heavily on modernization. Aided by the strong launch of the 205 superminicar, Peugeot returned to profitability in 1985, and by 1989 had halved its production break-even point. In the 1980s Peugeot inked production deals with
   <company id="41191">
    Renault
   </company>
   (industrial vehicles, motors, gearboxes) and
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat
   </company>
   (light trucks) and introduced a reasonably priced electric van in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Peugeot withdrew from the US in 1991 after five years of declining sales. A year later Renault and Peugeot developed electric cars and set up servicing centers throughout France. Citing an economic slump in 1993, Peugeot suffered its first loss ($239 million) since 1985. A French government incentive to replace cars more than 10 years old boosted 1994 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Peugeot and rival Renault together introduced a V6 engine in 1996. Jean Martin Folz replaced Calvet as managing board chairman in 1997; Folz headed up Peugeot for 10 years and was replaced by Christian Streiff in 2007. In 1998 the company began building Peugeots and Citroëns in the same plants and created its
   <company id="55216">
    Faurecia
   </company>
   unit when its ECIA subsidiary merged with car parts maker Bertrand Faure. In an effort to capitalize on the growing South American car market, the company purchased more than 80% of Argentina's Sevel, and built a plant in Brazil. In 1999 the company sold its flight systems supplier, SAMM, to TRW's Lucas Aerospace unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   With demand for its cars falling steeply in South America due to the region's continuing economic crisis, Peugeot restructured its Brazil operations in 2000 and formed a new subsidiary, Citroën do Brasil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Peugeot announced that it was building an engine plant in Brazil and agreed to produce a subcompact car for the European market with
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Peugeot formed an alliance with
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   to develop and build a line of small diesel engines for use in vehicles made by both companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Peugeot achieved a major milestone when, for the first time, it sold more than 1 million units outside its traditional market of Western Europe, or 30% of total sales. Large gains were made in South America, and even more so in China. In 2006 the company repeated the feat. With Western Europe a mature market, Peugeot was looking to three key emerging markets to drive future growth: China, the Mercosur region (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), and Central and Eastern Europe.
