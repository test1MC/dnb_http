  <p>
   Haworth recorded 2016 global sales of $1.94 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year. It attributed the growth to strong performances from its commercial interiors, lifestyle designs, and performance technology businesses. It also generated strong results from the Asia/Pacific region driven by a showroom in Shanghai it opened in 2015.

  <p>
   Buoyed by its strong financial performance and recovery in North America, Haworth is looking to grow its global market share. In 2015 it opened its first showroom in Shanghai.

  <p>
   Haworth has grown through acquisitions. In 2016 it purchased Los-Angeles based JANUS et Cie, a firm that sells furniture products through its 16 directly-owned showrooms and 40 sales offices throughout the world. Haworth views the deal as important for penetrating the outdoor furniture market and capitalizing on JANUS' global network for future growth.

  <p>
   Gerrard Haworth, an industrial arts high school teacher in Holland, Michigan, started a woodworking business in his garage in 1938. Ten years later, he quit his teaching job, took out a mortgage on his house, and borrowed $10,000 from his father, using the funds to start Modern Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fledgling company employed only six workers, but that changed two years later when Modern Products received a contract with the United Auto Workers in Detroit. The contract called for an innovative product: a "bank partition" -- a partition constructed with wood below but with glass at the top. Believing other companies would want these partitions, Gerrard concentrated on their production. His hunch was correct, and Modern Products boomed throughout the 1950s, gaining a national presence by the decade's end.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another Haworth, Gerrard's son Richard, went to work for the company in the 1960s, starting with sweeping floors but rising quickly to VP of research and development. When competitor Herman Miller introduced a set of movable panels, shelves, and desktops, it was Richard who developed the counterstroke for Modern Products, creating an insulated movable panel that also reduced noise. The insulated panels started shipping in 1971, helping fuel the company's continued growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Four years later, Richard -- who would visit competitors' showrooms and take apart their furniture surreptitiously -- invented, developed, and patented an even more innovative panel, this one with electrical wiring inside. These panels, called Uni-Group, eliminated the need to call electricians in for rewiring, boosting sales by millions -- and ushering in the age of cubicles for office workers everywhere. Also in 1975 Modern Products changed its name to Haworth.
