   Therm-O-Disc is a subsidiary of
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   and part of its Emerson Appliance Solutions and Emerson Climate Technologies businesses. It's recognized globally for its expertise in designing and making temperature sensors and controls.

   The company serves several sectors, such as HVAC, appliance, automotive, and electronics. Its customer groups include consumer, climate, oil and gas, power and equipment, and transportation. Therm-O-Disc sells its products through North American distributors and wholesale distributors, as well as through wholesalers such as

        <p>
   Therm-O-Disc's cost-cutting efforts during the economic downturn, which included shuttering its nearly half-century-old St. Thomas plant in Canada and shifting production of thermal controls to its Mansfield, Ohio, plant and to facilities in Mexico, helped parent Emerson perform well during the recession.
  </p>
        <p>
   More recently, Therm-O-Disc has focused on investing in technology and international expansion. Its Climate Technology segment has logged sales gains, thanks to stimulus programs that supported higher efficiency standards. The company performs its extensive performance and regulatory agency testing in its Mansfield, Ohio, and Bao'an China engineering centers.
