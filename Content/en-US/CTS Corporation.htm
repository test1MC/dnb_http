   CTS is all about electronics. The company makes components and sensors such as actuators, switches, and resistor networks. The biggest user, by far, of its products is the automotive market in powertrain, safety, fuel and emissions control systems. CTS-made products also are used in the aerospace, communications, computer, medical equipment, and military contracting industries. Customers have included industry leaders such as

   Beyond the US (the company is headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana), CTS maintains sales offices in China, Japan, India, Scotland, Singapore, and Taiwan. Other locations, which also include corporate, manufacturing, and R&amp;D functions, are in Canada, Mexico, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Thailand. Manufacturing takes up nearly 1.2 million square feet of the company's owned or leased property space, while non-manufacturing activities -- mostly in the US, with a facility in China and Japan -- take up less than half a million square feet. The company's third-biggest single country market after the US (58% of sales) and China (15%) is the Czech Republic which accounts for 11% of sales.

   The company's sales engineers generate more than 90% of sales through contact with OEMs and other major customers. The remainder of sales is brought in through independent manufacturers' representatives (nearly 5%) and independent distributors (less than 5%). Automotive customers accounted for about 70% of revenue with industrial and communications customers each accounting for 10% or more of sales.

   CTS posted lower revenue for the third year in a row in 2014. Revenue fell 1% to $404 million from $409 in 2013. In 2014, the company had lower shipments of electronic components, mainly in frequency, filter, and HDD products.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a loss of about $4 million in 2013, the company rebounded to a profit of $26.5 million in 2014. CTS had lower expenses in 2014 while in 2013 it dealt with costs associated with discontinuing its Electronics Manufacturing Solutions business. Cash flow from operations was $32.4 million in 2014, down from $37.5 million in 2013 because of a change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

   CTS' growth strategy includes new product introductions, geographic market expansion, broadening its customer base, and targeting strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 and 2014 CTS restructured its operations, cutting 350 positions and spending about $11.5 million on restructuring-related charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of CTS' overall strategic plan to simplify its business model and rationalize CTS' global footprint in 2014, company announced plans to consolidate its Canadian operation in Streetsville, Ontario, into other existing CTS facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through EMS, CTS produced subassemblies and even provides complete manufacturing services such as design, logistics, and repair, but in 2013 sold this segment to
   <company id="13094">
    Benchmark Electronics
   </company>
   for $75 million in cash. The sale is designed to provide CTS with the financial flexibility to fund organic growth of its higher margin activities, including its components and sensors business. Included in the sale were five manufacturing facilities located in California (Moorpark, San Jose), New Hampshire, Bangkok, and Mexico.
