   Think of it as plastic wrap for solar cells. STR Holdings operates primarily through subsidiary Specialized Technology Resources, which manufactures solar encapsulants -- polymer films that hold solar modules (panels) together and protect semiconductors from exposure to the elements. The company pioneered the development of ethylene vinyl acetate- (EVA-) based encapsulants for the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   in the 1970s. Its PhotoCap-brand encapsulants are sold worldwide to photovoltaic (PV) module makers.The company has production plants in Malaysia and Spain, each with an annual production capacity of 3,000 MW.

  <p>
   Based in East Windsor, Connecticut, the company operates facilities in China, Malaysia, Spain, and the US. In 2013 the company derived about 54% of its revenues from Spain, 36% from Malaysia, 6% from the US, and the rest from China.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company has 14 commercial encapsulant formulations. Drawing upon its considerable experience, it develops its formulations internally and work in conjunction with its customers to meet their varying requirements. The formulations, which offer a range of properties and processing attributes, can be used in both crystalline silicon and thin-film modules.
  </p>
  <p>
   It relies on third-party equipment manufacturers to produce its manufacturing lines to its specifications, which it then further customizes in-house.
  </p>
  <p>
   Resin and paper liner are the two primary materials used in its process, with resin accounting for more than half of its manufacturing costs. Its primary paper suppliers are located in the US and Europe, and it purchases paper based on pricing and required lead times. It is currently in the process of removing paper liner from its production process to further reduce its manufacturing costs.

   STR has 12 commercial encapsulant formulations.

   The company's customers are solar module manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia, including

   Deutschland,
   <company id="139319">

   , and Global Wedge (which together accounted for 56% of STR's revenues in 2013). Its largest customer, First Solar accounted for 18% in 2013 (although in 2014 it informed STR that it would source encapsulant from an alternative supplier).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The 67% decrease in revenues in 2013 was mainly due to a 58% decrease in sales volume and about a 20% decrease in its selling prices. Pricing is impacted by the competition faced by its customers, the quality and performance of its encapsulant formulations, overall supply and demand levels in the industry and its customer service and technical support. The company's unit volumes declined due to lost market share, resulting from the loss of First Solar as a customer, financial distress of certain key customers, and continuing intensified competition in the encapsulant market, including pressure on pricing and terms and competitive technologies entering the marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, STR's net loss decreased by 91% in 2013 due to the absence of goodwill impairment, and intangible asset impairment charges present in 2012 resulted from a reduction in sales and a decline in the market capitalization of its common stock. In addition, it benefited from the savings associated with prior cost-reduction actions including the indirect headcount reduction actions made during 2013 and 2012, including ceasing production at its East Windsor, Connecticut, facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash used in operating activities declined in 2013 driven by the trade secret settlement received in 2012 that did not recur in 2013, reduced net sales, and lower gross profit compared to the prior year. In addition, it incurred $2.6 million of restructuring payments during 2013 and received less working capital benefit, primarily from a decrease in the amount of inventory reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $800,000 for 2013, primarily due to cash received for prior state tax receivable relating to the final gain on the sale of the QA business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales and profitability have declined significantly since 2011, driven by a rapid shift of solar module production from the US and Europe to Asia, the loss of First Solar, and the financial distress of certain of its key customers, intensified competition and steep price declines resulting from excess capacity throughout the solar manufacturing industry.
  </p>

  <p>
   STR has been consolidating its manufacturing operations to reduce costs and to align with lowered demand for its products. (In 2011 it closed its St. Augustine, Florida, production facility.) The company has also been trying to combat the high costs of raw materials related to its EVA resin, which accounts for up to 55% of its sales, by exploring other sourcing possibilities. While cutting back on its US and Spanish production plants, STR has added new floor space in Malaysia to expand the capacity of its production facility there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Confident that demand for its encapsulants will increase, STR is banking on the idea that packaging and protecting circuits in PV panels will always be necessary before installing them in outdoor environments. Encapsulants are also customized for the customer's manufacturing process, making it more difficult to shop around for cheaper alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is focused on Asia, especially China, as a new market of module manufacturers; its growth there has been rapid under a strategy it calls "One Plus China." STR wants to expand its presence in the Asian market, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. It has increased its net sales in the Asia/Pacific region and is creating local Chinese operations teams.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of an excess capacity existing in the current solar panel industry, the company has worked to cut manufacturing costs in order to make it more competitive. It has looked to slash the costs of its raw materials as well, primarily that of its EVA resin, and has sought to find other vendors to increase its sourcing opportunities.

  <p>
   The company's quality assurance services division had offered inspection and testing to consumer products retailers and makers worldwide. STR had been offering quality assurance services since 1973. It spun off the unit to pay down debt and focus on its solar operations, selling the QA unit to Underwriters Laboratories for $275 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   STR Holdings, which traces its roots back to 1944, when it was founded as a plastics R&amp;D firm, completed a $123 million initial public offering (IPO) in late 2009. The company used the funds to repay debt and to terminate the advisory services and monitoring agreement with DLJ Merchant Banking Partners (DLJMB). Prior to the public offering, DLJMB and affiliated investors (including company directors) owned a controlling stake in STR Holdings, acquired through an investment in Specialized Technology Resources in 2007. DLJMB affiliate
