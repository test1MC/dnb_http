   Celera spent years mapping the human genome, and has put that knowledge to use. Formerly a researcher, the firm is now focused on developing diagnostics and providing clinical services. Its genotyping products are used to track genetic mutations that indicate drug resistance in HIV, screen for cystic fibrosis, and identify the best matches for organ transplants. The company's Berkeley HeartLab (BHL) and 4myheart businesses provide cardiology testing and disease management services, respectively.

   Celera made an attractive acquisition target due to its portfolio of genetic markers associated with specific diseases ranging from arthritis and breast cancer to hepatitis and HIV. Once markers are identified, the company works to develop diagnostic tests and, ultimately, target medicines based on a patient's individual genetic makeup.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celera's BHL business offers about 25 individual clinical laboratory tests designed to characterize and monitor cardiovascular disease and lipid or metabolic disorders. The company enjoys some cross-pollination of its segments by using components manufactured by its products business for some of the BHL tests. Meanwhile, the 4myheart unit offers personalized care management for cardiovascular patients, including web-based treatment tracking and compliance systems for both physicians and patients.

  <p>
   Celera is working to discover new associations between protein and gene variations and the diseases they cause. The field of personalized medicine, where physicians can determine a course of action based on genetic test results, is key to the company's strategy. Some of its discovery and development efforts are conducted through collaborative efforts with other diagnostic, medical, and pharmaceutical companies.

  <p>
   The company was formed in 1998. Formerly part of
   <company id="11167">
    Applied Biosystems
   </company>
   , Celera split off as an independent company in 2008.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The story of Celera Genomics begins not with
   <company id="11167">
    Applera
   </company>
   but instead with Dr. J. Craig Venter. In the early 1990s, the scientist labored on behalf of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which was trudging along in its effort to map the human genome as a member of the Human Genome Project (HGP). The launch of the first commercial gene sequencing machines piqued Venter's interest, but he left the NIH after clashes with leader Dr. Francis Collins and others over how to proceed with the mapping.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Venter caught the attention -- and the funding -- of venture capitalist Wallace Steinberg, a former Johnson &amp; Johnson researcher whose HealthCare Investment Corp. funded the likes of
   <company id="10176">
    MedImmune
   </company>
   and
   <company id="16995">
    Human Genome Sciences
   </company>
   (HGS). Steinberg gave Venter control over The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) to continue his genomic research his way; HGS, headed by William Hasseltine, would commercialize TIGR's discoveries and funnel funds back to the institute. In 1995 TIGR scored its first big success: Venter and Nobel Prize-winner Dr. Hamilton O. Smith mapped the complete Haemophilus influenzae, the pesky bacterium behind ear infections (but not the flu).
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later Steinberg died, and the friction between his two brain trusts, primarily over control of research findings, led to a split. TIGR gave up $38 million in continued funding from HGS to gain its freedom and the right to publish its genomics research. By this time the institute had fully mapped the H. pylori bacterium and was working on maps for the syphilis, cholera, and malaria bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Applera, then known as Perkin-Elmer, entered the picture. In the 1990s the firm had been building disparate operations -- analytical instruments and applied biosystems. Led by former
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   executive Tony White, it shifted toward biotechnology with its buys of drug candidate screener Tropix in 1996, gene expression technology developer GenScope in 1997, and genetic analysis system maker
   <company id="15708">
    PerSeptive Biosystems
   </company>
   in 1998. That year Dr. Michael Hunkapiller, president of the applied biosystems unit, approached TIGR about using its new sequencing technology that was some 10 times faster than existing equipment. Hunkapiller and Venter soon announced to the world they would map the complete human genome in three years (to beat the HGP's 15-year effort that began in 1990) for a fraction of the cost (the HGP's budget was about $3 billion). Celera Genomics was born.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Celera scientists were busy mapping in 1999, their employer was busy establishing a genomics company for the future.
   <company id="11010">
    Pharmacia
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   , among others, signed five-year database licensing deals. Perkin-Elmer, meanwhile, sold its analytical instruments unit to EG&amp;G (now
   <company id="10490">
    PerkinElmer
   </company>
   ) and became PE Corp. It established PE Biosystems (now
   <company id="59695">
    Applied Biosystems
   </company>
   ) for its remaining operations and transferred some units (including the bioagriculture and GenScope) to Celera. It then took PE Biosystems and Celera public as tracking stocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Celera crowed that it had completed mapping one person's (later revealed to be Venter's) DNA, but the HGP scoffed, pointing to errors. That month President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair announced they would not support the patenting of human genes; the announcement was a blow to Celera's and other gene researchers' business plans, and the entire biotech sector stumbled. To keep the strong economy upbeat, clarifications of the leaders' statements were later issued, and the market recovered (temporarily). Celera and the HGP even agreed to work together to issue the definitive map.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the rancor was far from over. While the HGP opted to make its map available to the public online, Celera began publishing fragments in early 2001 in Science. (The map will be completely published in some 60 years.) While the controversy over gene patents and map access and the number of genes in the human genome raged, and Hasseltine and other biotech leaders talked up other areas of genomics, Celera moved on. In 2001 it teamed with its parent (which had become Applera in 2000) and sibling to begin its own drug discovery efforts, focusing particularly on SNPs. To aid this work, the threesome teamed with
   <company id="100512">
    The SNP Consortium
   </company>
   to map SNPs and learn how they are passed from one generation to the next; this work was completed in 2002. Celera then bought Axys Pharmaceuticals to expand its drug development efforts. Late in 2001 and in early 2002, it sold the agricultural genomics operations of AgGen to
   <company id="99950">
    Paradigm Genetics
   </company>
   and the unit's animal genomics and genotyping business to MetaMorphix to focus on its human genomics work.
  </p>
  <p>
   Venter stepped down as president in 2002 and formed his own research institute and science foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celera bought out Applied Biosystems' share of their Celera Diagnostics joint venture in early 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2007 Applied Biosystems helped Celera prepare for its new life with a trousseau of acquisitions including Berkeley HeartLab ($193 million) which added heart disease diagnostics to its product portfolio as well as a sturdier commercial infrastructure for bringing new products to market. Applera also spent $33 million to give Celera Atria Genetics, a developer of testing products used to identify organ and bone marrow transplant matches.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make room in its hope chest, Celera handed its soon-to-be-former sister
   <company id="59695">
    Applied Biosystems Group
   </company>
   its genomics databases, which detail the genomes of mice, fruit flies, various bacteria, and other life forms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celera was split off from Applied Biosystems in 2008. When Celera was losing money, having it as a so-called track stock (common stock that tracks the performance of its parent company, without taking on any of its debts or assets) was helpful to Applied Biosystems (formerly Applera) tax-wise, but when the group became healthy enough to operate on its own, the parent knew it was time to set it free. As Celera had been trading publicly since 2000, the split-off wasn't considered an initial public offering and existing Celera shareholders received an equal number of shares of the independent company.
