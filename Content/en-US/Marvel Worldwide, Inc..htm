   Marvel Worldwide is ready to reveal its secret identity: It is the world's largest publisher of comic books, with a library of some 5,000 characters, including Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, and X-Men. It earns money from sales of advertising and subscriptions, and from other publishing operations, including custom comics and digital media activities. In addition to subscriptions, Marvel's comics are sold through specialty comic shops, and traditional retail locations such as book stores and newsstands. Along with film production and licensing, Marvel Worldwide is one of three main operating units of character-based entertainment firm
   <company id="42835">
    Marvel Entertainment
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   The firm was founded in 1932 as Western Publishing and issued its first comic book in 1939. Two years later Captain America was introduced to fight Nazis, and Stanley Martin Lieber (Stan Lee, the co-creator of Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and X-Men) came on board.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Marvel Entertainment Group in 1986. Financier Ronald Perelman bought into MEG in the late 1980s, and the company went public in 1991. Over the next few years, MEG acquired trading-card and confectionery maker Fleer, an interest in Toy Biz, rival Malibu Comics Entertainment, Welsh Publishing Group, Panini stickers, and the distribution operations of Superhero Enterprises. In 1994 the company signed a deal with
   <company id="47365">
    Planet Hollywood
   </company>
   to create comic-themed Marvel Mania restaurants. (Its first location opened at Universal Studios in 1998, but was closed the following year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 MEG bought trading-card competitor SkyBox International. Costs related to acquisitions, consolidation of operations, and a slump in sales of sports cards gave MEG a loss for the year. With comic sales falling, in 1996 MEG cut its staff, eliminated 20 weak comic titles, and refocused on character licensing. Later that year MEG filed for Chapter 11. Bondholders led by then-chairman Carl Icahn seized control of the firm in 1997 from former chairman Perelman (who MEG unsuccessfully sued for mismanagement). Repeated attempts to hammer out a restructuring plan fell short and left the company with little choice but to accept an acquisition plan from Toy Biz. The acquisition went through in 1998, and the combined company was called Marvel Enterprises. Most of MEG's operations went into the Marvel Publishing division. (Before the acquisition, MEG sold its Fleer Confections division to Canada's

    Concord Confections
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Marvel Enterprises sold off MEG's Fleer/SkyBox trading card business and sticker-maker Panini. It also granted
   <company id="56367">
    Sony Pictures
   </company>
   the rights to create a Spider-Man movie franchise. In 2000 the company entered a joint venture with independent movie studio Artisan Entertainment to create products based on about 15 Marvel characters, including Captain America, for the motion picture, television, home video, and Internet markets. That year, the company also launched its Ultimate Marvel line of comics, an attempt to attract new readers through a modernization of the Spider-Man and X-Men tales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company saw Spider-Man sling his way onto the big screen and become one of the biggest comic book movie adaptations ever. The next year Marvel expanded into the trade book publishing market with a new line of original young adult novels based on Marvel characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   As parent Marvel Enterprises shifted its focus away from toys and more towards producing films, television shows, and video games based on Marvel characters, it changed its name to Marvel Entertainment in 2005 to reflect its more show biz identity. Marvel Entertainment continues to publish comics and other related content through Marvel Publishing. In late 2009 Marvel Entertainment was acquired by Disney.
