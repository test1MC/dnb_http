   Lytx (formerly DriveCam) has its electronic eyes on your driving skills. The company designs, manufactures, and sells video surveillance equipment used by commercial fleets to improve driver and traffic safety. Video cameras installed in vehicles are used to record accidents and otherwise monitor drivers' actions, with an eye toward controlling insurance costs. In addition to video monitoring, the company's Driving Behavior Management System incorporates driving performance management software and driver counseling. Customers include utility, waste management, and transit companies, as well as operators of taxi, ambulance, and bus fleets. The company also has a product that monitors teen drivers.

  <p>
   The company ended 2013 with orders hovering around the $100 million mark for the second straight year. Lytx claims it has been profitable for four years in a row and added 55,000 new subscriptions during 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   It attributed the growth to global expansion, strategic partnerships, and sustained growth within its existing customer fleets. It has also been helped by higher demand for its products and services within the mid-market, government, waste, transportation, and logistics spheres.
