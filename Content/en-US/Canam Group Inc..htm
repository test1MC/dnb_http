  <p>
   Canam sells its products through its sales and distribution network as well as through its subsidiaries or subcontractors. It primarily serves non-residential construction markets which include the commercial (stores, shopping centers, offices, hotels/motels, warehouses), industrial (fabrication plants), and institutional (schools, hospitals, buildings: public, religious, recreational, entertainment, and transportation-related) sectors.

  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, Canam's net revenue increased by 30% and its net income surged by 60%, mainly due to higher sales of structural steel and building products and services. The growth was also due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchanges due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   Canam mainly focuses on expanding its presence in additional markets apart from the fabrication of steel components sectors. It plans to grow in the North American construction market by capitalizing on its design, fabrication and marketing expertise and promoting the company through trademarks such as Canam, Goodco, Z-Tech, Hambro, InteliBuild, Murox, and United Steel Deck.
