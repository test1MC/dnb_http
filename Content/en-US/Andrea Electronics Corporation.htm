   Andrea Electronics wants to make a big noise with its Anti-Noise technology. The company's Anti-Noise products include software that increases voice clarity and reduces background noise, plus headsets that enhance audio in high-noise environments. Andrea Electronics also offers voice recognition products for voice-activated computing applications, such as word processing. The company designs its products for audio- and videoconferencing, call centers, in-vehicle communications, and personal computing. Andrea Electronics sells directly and through distributors, software publishers, ISPs, and other resellers. The company gets most of its sales in the US.

   Frank Andrea quit boxing in 1913 to work for Guglielmo Marconi, a pioneer in wireless communications. Andrea started Andrea Radio Corp. in 1934 and became one of the world's first television makers in 1938. The company went public in 1960. When Andrea died in 1965, his son Frank Jr. took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   An influx of cheaper Japanese goods in the 1970s pushed the company into selling intercom systems for industrial and military use (the
   <i>
    Mercury
   </i>
   space capsule used an Andrea communications system). The founder's grandsons, Douglas and John, eventually signed on to help, and in the 1990s the family set its sights on noise cancellation technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered a six-year deal with
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop Grumman
   </company>
   in 1993 to develop noise canceling headsets for military applications and introduced its first commercial noise cancellation product in 1995 (the ANC-100 Computer Headset). That year the company signed a deal (renewed in 1997) with
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   to bundle its anti-noise products with IBM's speech recognition products. High-tech retailers, such as
   <company id="15490">
    CompUSA
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14790">
    Staples
   </company>
   , also signed agreements with Andrea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andrea expanded into audio input software technology in 1998 with its acquisition of Lamar Signal Processing. That year Frank Jr. retired after more than 50 years with the company. The Lamar acquisition contributed to a net loss for 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999
   <company id="59617">
    Clarion
   </company>
   began distributing Andrea gear, and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   agreed to offer Andrea headsets with its Encarta language learning products. The next year Andrea continued to secure patents for its noise-reduction technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Douglas Andrea was elevated to the company's co-chairman and co-CEO in 1998, after six years as co-president. He became the sole chairman in 2001. Andrea Electronics sold its aircraft communications unit in 2003. Douglas stepped back into the roles of president and CEO in 2005 with the termination of Paul Donofrio, who served about 18 months in those posts.
