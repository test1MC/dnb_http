   IHS (Information Handling Services) does more than handle information. The company's core competency is sourcing data and transforming it into critical information and insight that businesses, governments, and others can use. Its experts process information from a variety of sources to provide analysis, business and market intelligence, and technical documents, which it distributes in electronic formats. Its products include collections of technical specifications and standards, regulations, parts data, and design guides. The company also offers economic-focused information and analysis through its
   <company id="126036">
    IHS Global Insight
   </company>
   subsidiary. IHS primarily earns revenue through subscription sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has three operating segments: Resources, Transportation, and Consolidated Markets &amp; Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Resources includes Energy and Chemicals product offerings. This segment accounted for 40% of IHS' total net sales in fiscal 2015 (November year end).
  </p>
  <p>
   Transportation (35%) includes Automotive; Maritime &amp; Trade; and Aerospace, Defense &amp; Security product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consolidated Markets &amp; Solutions (25%) includes Product Design; Technology, Media &amp; Telecom; and Economics &amp; Country Risk product offerings.
  </p>

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   IHS, based in Englewood, Colorado, has more than 125 offices in 33 countries. The company generates more than two-thirds of revenue from US customers. Some 23% of sales come from Europe with 10% from the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves customers ranging from large entities such as multinational companies and governments to small companies and technical professionals that span many industries, geographies, and end markets. Its largest 1,000 customers account for almost two-thirds of its revenue, but no single customer represents more than 10% of its total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company serves various industries such as Academic/Education, Aerospace, Defense &amp; Security, Agriculture, Automotive, Business Services/Consulting, Chemicals, Construction, Energy &amp; Natural Resources, Financial Services, Government and NGOs, Insurance, Land Transport, Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Maritime &amp; Trade, Media and Advertising, Retail, Technology, Telecommunications, and Wood and Paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   IHS sales teams are organized within specific business lines to align with its customers by industry and workflow. It also uses dealers in certain locations to distribute its product offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expense was $44.7 million, $35.2 million, and $12.7 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and was primarily comprised of advertising for CARFAX.

  <p>
   <em>
    Note: The financials of the company have been restated to reflect organizational structure change and divestitures.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, net sales decreased by $46.5 million due to lower sales from Resources, partially offset by higher sales from Transportation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Resources revenue experienced lower subscription organic growth due to industry-wide dynamics. Transportation revenue increased driven by strengthening organic revenue growth and acquisitions in both its subscription and non-subscription offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, IHS' net income increased by 23% due to lower income from discontinued operations partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization charges. (In 2015 the company divested its OE&amp;RM and GlobalSpec product offerings).
  </p>
  <p>
   Depreciation expense increased as a result of higher capital expenditures for its various infrastructure and software development initiatives. Amortization expense rose due to continued acquisition-related activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   IHS' net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $15.4 million compared to 2014 primarily due to a change in deferred revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to bring together information, research, and analytics, and to deliver integrated solutions to customers in separate but interconnected industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions of companies in high growth markets that fill a gap in IHS's expertise have been a key part of the company's strategy. In the past decade, IHS has spent about $4 billion on 60 companies. The company also hires well-known experts in their fields for knowledge and market impact. Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-Prize winning oil industry expert, is vice chairman, and the company added a former US diplomat well known in energy circles to its ranks in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2015, IHS transitioned to a new operating structure to better align and focus its operations. The company is simplifying its mergers and acquisitions strategy to target fewer, larger deals, which will allow it to increase its productivity and integration efforts. In the absence of larger scaled acquisition opportunities, it plans to deploy capital towards its $500 million share buyback program to achieve a balance between scaling through acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2015, the company focused on commercial expansion and operational excellence by continuing to introduce new and enhanced product offerings and analytics, expanding customer relationships, and improving its internal systems and processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, the company conducted a complete review of its entire business portfolio. As a result, it determined that the OE&amp;RM and GlobalSpec product offerings no longer fit with its strategic goals, and hence it divested these product groups.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2016 IHS acquired Oil Price Information Service, an internationally referenced pricing reporting agency that serves the oil, natural gas, and biofuels industries, for $650 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired CARPROOF Corporation (a Canada-based company that offers products and services in vehicle history, appraisal, and valuation for the automotive industry) for $460 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year IHS acquired Rushmore Reviews, a provider of subscription-based information on drilling and completions in the oil and gas industry. Rushmore's benchmarking and analytics products complement IHS' well information assets and extends their reach globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made several acquisitions in 2014 to expand in businesses and geographies. One deal brought PacWest Consulting Partners into the IHS fold. The Houston-based company added intelligence and analysis in the unconventional oil and gas industry, which includes hydraulic fracturing (fracking).
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition of PCI Acrylonitrile, a provider of chemical market insight and consulting services for the global acrylonitrile and derivatives industry, strengthens IHS Chemical's global market coverage in the commodity and engineering plastics and fibers sectors
  </p>
  <p>
   The purchase of Global Trade Information Services, a provider of international merchandise trade data, supports the IHS Maritime business.
  </p>
  <p>
   IHS completed its acquisition of the DisplaySearch and Solarbuzz businesses of the NPD Group Inc. in 2014. The units added to IHS expertise in displays (such as computer monitors and TVs) and in solar energy.

  <p>
   IHS Group traces its roots to Rogers Publishing, a company formed by Thomas Rogers in the 1940s to publish engineering magazine
   <i>
    Design News.
   </i>
   In the 1950s Rogers Publishing branched into automated information retrieval systems, choosing microfilm as a publishing medium for reference information.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1959, Richard O'Brien, an executive with Rogers Publishing, developed a product catalog database for aerospace engineers. The flagship product, Vendor Specs Microfilm File (VSMF), was indexed to locate information quickly and was produced on microfilm to conserve space that was generally occupied by libraries of hardcopy documents. When Cahners Publishing bought Rogers in 1961, the technical services division, which included catalog operations, was spun off as a separate company and named Information Handling Services (IHS).
  </p>
  <p>
   An extended series of acquisitions helped to shape the company and bring it to the forefront of technical publishing. By the 1980s global giant TBG had become Information Handling Services' parent company and established the foundation for further growth. IHS Group was formed in 1989 as the holding company for new subsidiaries as the company expanded into other markets, including regulatory information, and entered the international arena through a series of acquisitions.
