   LifeScan works to keep its edge in a competitive diabetes care market, as well as to attract and retain customers, by conducting extensive product development efforts. LifeScan has recently launched new Animas products, such as the Ping glucose management system that combines the OneTouch and Animas technologies to allow for remote monitoring and operation of the insulin pump. The company has also developed new, high-tech versions of its OneTouch meters, such as its OneTouch Ultra line featuring smaller monitors and faster results. In 2015 it introduced the OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System to help users easily understand their test results. In addition, LifeTouch has introduced products in new markets to expand its geographic presence.
