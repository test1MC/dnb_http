   One of the world's oldest chip makers, Fairchild Semiconductor makes semiconductors for tens of thousands of customers in the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, industrial, mobile, and communications markets. Its diversified product line includes logic chips, discrete power and signal components, optoelectronics, and many types of analog and mixed-signal chips. The company subcontracts a small amount of its fabrication, assembly, and test operations to companies that include
   <company id="43493">
    TSMC

   ,
   <company id="52869">
    Amkor
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="43476">
    ASE
   </company>
   , among others. In September 2016 the acquisition of Fairchild by
   <company id="60890">
    On Semiconductor
   </company>
   for $2.4 billion was concluded.

  <p>
   Fairchild had been seeking a buyer and had interest from other chip companies. The combined On Semi-Fairchild firm would have revenue totaling about $5 billion and realize costs that are $150 million. With the September 2016 closing of the transaction, Fairchild became a wholly owned subsidiary of ON Semi.

   Fairchild is organized into three segments, each of which has a small set of top customers, common technology requirements, and similar design cycles. The Power Conversion, Industrial, and Automotive (PCIA) business focuses on the higher power requirements for motor control solutions, power supplies, power conversion, and automotive drive train applications. It accounts for about half of sales. The Mobile, Computing, Consumer, and Communication (MCCC) business focuses on mobile, computing, and multimedia applications with typically lower power requirements. It accounts for about 40% of sales. Finally, the Standard Discrete and Standard Linear (SDT) business makes core building block components for many electronic applications. It accounts for about 10% of sales.

  <p>
   Fairchild Semiconductor International gets about three-quarters of sales from customers in Asia/Pacific. Its manufacturing facilities are located in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US (in Maine, Pennsylvania, and Utah).

   The company has a worldwide direct sales force to serve major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronic design and manufacturing services customers. Fairchild also relies on a large network of distributors, including

  <p>
   Sales in 2014 ticked 2% higher to $1.43 billion, which the company attributed to lower demand for products used in mobiles devices, particularly from one customer, offset by growth in industrial, appliance, automotive, and computer markets. Higher operating costs and taxes combined to create a $35 million net loss in 2014, compared to a $5 million profit in 2013. Cash flow from operations stood at $193.7 million at the end of 2014, compared to $176 million in 2013.

   Fairchild's inventions sparked the mass production of integrated circuits in the 1950s. Acquisitions, including the power semiconductor operations of

   and
   <company id="99382">
    Intersil
   </company>
   , boosted the company's product line to more than 10,000 devices, including key components found in most electronic systems. Fairchild continues to introduce hundreds of its own designs each year. It holds some 1,400 US patents and 1,500 non-US patents. Its "building block" approach allows it to customize basic designs, cutting development costs and time to market.

   Buffeted by the ever-changing demand for semiconductors, Fairchild is in seemingly perpetual restructuring mode. In 2014, it record nearly $50 million in restructuring charges, up from $16 million and $14 million in 2013 and 2012. The 2014 costs included job cuts, factory closures, and asset impairment. The streamlining of its manufacturing operations included closing wafer fabs in Utah and South Korea (an older 5-inch wafer facility) and an assembly-and-test facility in Malaysia. The company expects to see returns from plant consolidation in 2015.

  <p>
   In 2014 Fairchild acquired Xsens Holding, a privately held, sensor company for nearly $58 million. The purchase of Xsens, a developer of 3D motion tracking technology and products, is to add complementary products to Fairchild's line of micromelectroechanical systems for navigation in small, lightweight devices.

  <p>
   Fairchild Semiconductor International began from a venture bankrolled in 1957 by businessman and inventor Sherman Mills Fairchild. The owner of aircraft and electronics businesses sponsored a group of young scientists eager to create new ways of making transistors. (The group -- the so-called Traitorous Eight from Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory -- included future
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore.) The eight co-founders pooled $3,500 of their own money in the beginning. Fairchild Camera &amp; Instrument invested $1.5 million in the fledgling semiconductor venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Noyce developed the monolithic integrated circuit (IC) on a small silicon wafer. Co-founder Jean Hoerni furthered the integrated concept by adding a collector, base, and emitter on one device.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1959 the crew won a patent for their planar "mesa process" of engineering transistors in silicon. The planar method, still used decades later, spawned the mass production of ICs (and thus hundreds of Silicon Valley companies) and enabled the PC revolution.
