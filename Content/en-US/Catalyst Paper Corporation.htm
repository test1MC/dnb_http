   No paper tiger, Catalyst Paper is a top North American producer of mechanical printing paper, and the region's only paper producer of the coated mechanical and soft-calendered varieties. Specialty papers (its core line), newsprint, and pulp are produced at a handful of mills, which have the capacity for turning out 1.5 million tons of paper annually. Specialty printing paper products generated 64% of Catalyst's 2012 consolidated sales revenue. Papers are sold to retailers, publishers, and commercial printers for use in phone directories, catalogs, newspapers, as well as consumer goods packaging. Pulp is sold to producers of tissue and other papers. Catalyst was taken private in 2017 by a trio of private-equity firms.

   Catalyst is selling assets to improve its financial position. In 2013 it sold its Snowflake assets and shares of Apache Railway to Hackman Capital for $13.5 million. The transaction will assist Catalyst in reducing its interest obligations and improve overall liquidity. Aided by the sale of the Snowflake assets and the sale of inventories and realization of accounts receivable associated with the Snowflake closure, Catalyst has been able to repay substantially all of its cash drawings under its ABL facility. The company is also looking for a buyer for the Elk Falls millsite after plans to sell it to a third party were unsuccessful.

   That year the company also agreed to sell its 50% interest in Powell River Energy Inc. and Powell River Energy Limited Partnership to Powell River Energy Trust, a

   affiliate, for $33 million. Powell River Energy Trust holds the other 50% stake in the Powell River Energy joint venture, which was originally established in 2001.

   The company was hit hard by the economic recession and the seismic shift to web-based publishing. Sales plummeted beginning in 2008 as retail spending dropped, print advertising followed suit, and fewer newspapers and directories were produced -- since they could be read online. Catalyst closed its linerboard operations at its Elk Falls mill in late 2008 and subsequently a Paper Recycling Division. It implemented cost-cutting measures across the board, including a salary freeze. Asset impairment, severance, and other restructuring costs took their toll; the company suffered a $396 million loss in 2010 -- its fifth consecutive year in the red and its worst on record.

   Catalyst's principal predecessor was British Columbia Forest Products Limited, which was a company formed in 1971.
