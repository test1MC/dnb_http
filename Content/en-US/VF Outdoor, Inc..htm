   The North Face is part of VF's outdoor and action sports division (or "coalition," as the parent company calls it). The division has carved out a niche in the outdoor market with the brands to buy for performance-oriented apparel, footwear, and gear. In addition to The North Face, its stable of brands includes

   The North Face markets its products through specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores located in Asia, Canada, Europe, and the US and in select department stores in the US. In addition, products are sold through over 100 VF-operated stores in the Asia, Europe, and the US and online. The brand is sold outside the US through agents, distributors, and nearly 400 The North Face partnership stores that are operated by independent third parties.

   The outdoor and action sports brands accounted for 56% of V.F.'s total sales in 2013, up 2% from 2012. Group revenue grew 8% with The North Face posting a 7% gain; Vans lead the group with a 17% jump. The group showed a 7% increase in the US and a 10% bump overseas.

   Brick-and-mortar stores move the bulk of The North Face apparel and equipment, however, V.F. also markets the brand online in the US and across Europe. The parent, recognizing that e-commerce accounts for a growing percentage of its earnings, has been working to launch additional sites that peddle The North Face in Asia and other European countries.

   Doug Tompkins (who later founded Esprit de Corp.) started The North Face in 1965 as a retail store devoted to mountaineering equipment and supplies. Tompkins sold The North Face -- whose name refers to the most treacherous side of mountains in the Northern Hemisphere -- in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s and 1980s, under owner Kenneth Klopp, the company blazed a trail of product innovation, designing geodesic dome tents and synthetic sleeping bags that became industry standards. However, its move into manufacturing during the late 1980s led to a series of disastrous missteps. In trouble, The North Face was acquired in 1988 by Odyssey Holdings International (OHI), a company headed by William Simon. The North Face shuttered its discount outlets, pared down its product line, and returned to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   OHI, however, filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993. The next year The North Face was purchased at auction by a group led by investment firm J.H. Whitney &amp; Company, which installed Simon as president. It went public in 1996 and debuted its Tekware line. The North Face spent approximately $10 million in 1998 to buy a minority stake in Italian boot maker La Sportiva and with it the US rights to La Sportiva footwear. With its clothing becoming noted as much for its fashion as its function, The North Face saw its stock peak north of $25 per share that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former EMI CEO James Fifield replaced Simon as CEO in 1998, and The North Face made a $5 million move from the San Francisco Bay area to Carbondale, Colorado -- just 30 minutes from Fifield's Aspen home. With its stock slumping, the company agreed in 1999 to a $17-per-share buyout by Fifield and buyout specialist Leonard Green &amp; Partners. But then The North Face revealed that it would have to drastically lower the glowing earnings it reported for 1997 and 1998. The buyout fell apart, and Fifield resigned as CEO; consultant Robert Bunje was named chairman, and turnaround veteran Geoffrey Lurie became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 1999 the company decided to close its Carbondale headquarters and return to California at a cost of $3.5 million. With distribution problems adding to its woes, The North Face racked up a giant loss for the year. In May 2000 with a likely Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing looming, The North Face sold 82% of its shares to VF for more than $150 million -- $2 per share plus the assumption of its debt; VF later bought the rest. With Lurie's mission accomplished, he resigned and left the company in the hands of then president Karl Heinz Salzburger, who later took up a position within VF's organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   To give it more control over its brand overseas, VF in 2007 reacquired the rights to license The North Face products in China and Nepal.
