   Allied Healthcare Products helps medical workers get oxygen flowing. The medical equipment maker produces respiratory equipment used in hospitals, surgery centers, ambulances, and other medical facilities, as well as in patient homes. Its products include anesthesia equipment, oxygen cylinders, and nebulizers used in home respiratory therapy, as well as emergency resuscitation products. It also makes medical gas system components installed in hospital walls during construction, as well as spine immobilization backboards and other items used in trauma situations. Allied Healthcare sells directly to hospitals and through equipment dealers in the US and abroad.

        <p>
   Though US sales account for most of revenues, about 20% of Allied Healthcare's business comes from international customers in areas including Canada, Mexico, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

        <p>
   More than half of Allied Healthcare's revenues come from the company's medical gas equipment business, which includes in-wall gas system components, gas regulators, oxygen cylinders, and suction equipment. Remaining sales are split evenly between the respiratory care and emergency medical product segments.

        <p>
   Allied Healthcare sells its products through a number of channels, including direct sales to hospital construction contractors and hospitals and indirect sales through medical equipment dealers and specialized distributors. International customers are served through a network of contracted agents, dealers, and exporters.

        <p>
   Revenues in 2012 for Allied Healthcare dropped by 7% to some $43 million due to lower domestic demand for emergency medical supplies and other products from government, hospital, and construction customers. The drop in demand was primarily attributed to typical fluctuation in government client needs, fewer hospital construction projects, and the irregular timing of orders from distributors. The company also reported a net income loss in 2012. As revenues and profits have failed to show steady growth over the last five years, Allied Healthcare has been conducting cost-reduction efforts.

        <p>
   Allied Healthcare counts on new hospital construction, renovations, and upgrades to support growth in its main gas equipment business, and as such, can be hurt by downturns in hospital spending. To offset its dependence on the hospital market, the company is also looking to expand sales of emergency medical and home respiratory care products by widening its offerings and distribution network in those fields.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's research activities include programs to develop new products, as well as improved versions of existing offerings. Allied Healthcare bolsters its R&amp;D activities by partnering with major research universities and keeping an eye out for potential acquisition opportunities.

        <p>
   Allied Healthcare Products began as the medical equipment unit of chemical company Chemetron. After buying Chemetron in 1977, steelmaker Allegheny International sold its chemical operations and in 1979 incorporated its medical division, creating Allied.
  </p>
        <p>
   As part of a divestiture program, Allegheny sold the division in 1985 to the Harbour Group, an investment firm known for acquiring small manufacturing companies through leveraged buyouts. Under Harbour's guidance, Allied expanded through acquisitions. In 1986 it purchased Oxequip Health Industries, a maker of medical gas systems and regulation devices. Allied then bought two more competitors in 1988 and went public in 1992, retiring its debt and significantly reducing Harbour's 90% interest.
  </p>
        <p>
   Allied continued expanding, entering the emergency medical products field (Life Support Products, 1993) and acquiring competitors Hospital Systems and B&amp;F Medical Products (1994). In 1995 Allied bought three more companies, including ventilator maker Bear Medical Systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the late 1990s, Allied had a run of bad luck: an employee strike, high post-acquisition costs, and a shrinking customer base. In 1998 sales were sluggish in the US (because of a slowdown in hospital construction projects and decreased Medicare reimbursements) and overseas (because of the expanding global economic crisis). The company responded by selling Bear Medical (1997) and Hospital Systems (1999) and closing its Ohio plant (1998).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Allied began to intensify its new product development efforts. Products introduced that year included an oxygen regulator made of brass. In 2003 Allied rolled out the SurgeX surge suppressing post valve designed to lessen chances of a fire.
