   BMCA has grown through acquisitions over the years. In 2009 it bought composite buildings products manufacturer Correct Buildings Products, adding to its outdoor decking lineup. The company is also taking advantage of the recovering housing and commercial construction markets, as evidenced by its reopening of plants that had been temporarily shuttered when sales dropped.

  <p>
   BMCA acquired rival roofing materials company
   <company id="10506">
    ElkCorp
   </company>
   in 2007 after winning a bidding war with
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   . The company integrated the ElkCorp brand with its own GAF brand to create the combined GAF-Elk brand. The deal was one of the largest acquisitions ever for the roofing industry.
