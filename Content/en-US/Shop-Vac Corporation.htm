   Shop-Vac serves several markets, including consumer, industrial, and commercial. The company sells its vacuum cleaners and accessories online and through home improvement stores, as well as via discount and hardware shops.

   With such a well-known brand name, Shop-Vac markets itself through word of mouth and by sponsoring tournaments whose participants are power-users of its products. The vacuum cleaner company partnered with FLW Outdoors, organizer of the world's largest fishing tournaments, in 2011 as a new sponsor. FLW Outdoors focuses on lucrative bass and walleye tournaments. The move gives Shop-Vac direct access to showcase its vacuums and accessories. Also, as part of the alliance, Shop-Vac is featured by FLW Outdoors in its weekly television program, on the tournament organizer's website, and in bass and walleye magazines.

   To ensure the company has capital to fund its growth, Shop-Vac in 2014 secured a $70-million senior credit facility from
   <company id="10634">
    GE Capital Corporate Finance
   </company>
   . It's using the money to grow its international business, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
