   Jockey International has nothing to do with horses and everything to do with the classic men's brief (its invention). The nearly 140-year-old company makes men's, women's, and children's underwear and loungewear. Its products are sold through thousands of department and specialty stores the likes of
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdale's
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105457">
    JCPenney
   </company>
   . Jockey licenses and distributes its apparel in 140-plus countries and holds several licensing agreements. Chairman and CEO Debra Waller and her family own the company. Jockey International was founded by Samuel Cooper in 1876 as a hosiery company intended to relieve lumberjacks of blisters and infections resulting from shoddy wool socks.

   specialize in making value-priced items for most of its products portfolio. This keeps profit margins razor thin. As a result, they rely heavily on cotton crops because the raw material accounts for a greater percentage of their total cost. For instance, high commodity prices for cotton sometimes swung to a low later in the year, making it difficult for Jockey to justify dropping prices for its products while it's still paying the higher cotton price. To this end, consumers who purchase Jockey products typically won't see price drops until the next year as cotton prices drop.
