   HTC Corporation designs and manufactures handheld wireless telecommunications devices, otherwise known as smartphones, based on
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   's Android and
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   's Windows Mobile operating systems. (HTC is a hardware platform development partner with Microsoft.) Originally a contract electronics manufacturer, the company now aggressively markets phones under its own brand. The HTC Dream was the first cell phone to feature the Android software operating system. Other devices include the Desire, Explorer, Rhyme, and Sensation. HTC's phones are marketed by wireless communications carriers including
   <company id="59771">
    T-Mobile USA
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While the company was once not well known to customers outside of T-Mobile, it now has phones available through more than 140 operators and distributors worldwide. HTC also sells through retail stores such as
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   , and to end users.
  </p>
  <p>
   HTC gets the vast majority of its sales from exports. The company maintains a sales and service presence in markets around the world, and has key operations centers located in China, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. In China, an emerging market for the company, HTC continues to expand distribution channels.

  <p>
   Stiff competition has erupted in the mobile phone industry, which has caused a pricing war. HTC found that sales for both the Windows and Android mobile systems were lower than expected, and developed its own platform, HTC Sense, which it can integrate with other operating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   HTC has established partnerships with key mobile brands, including leading European and US operators, and several fast-growing Asian operators. Many of the company's products are self-branded, while others are rebranded with the names of partnering mobile operators such as T-Mobile,
   <company id="56163">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   , to name a few. HTC also partners with other carriers and manufacturers, most notably

    QUALCOMM

   ,
   <company id="47982">
    Vodafone

   , and

  <p>
   The company's annual revenue has been declining precipitously year-over-year. It claimed about $6.7 billion in fiscal 2013, down from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2012 and $15.2 billion in fiscal 2011. Net income has also been declining year-over-year to the point that HTC claimed a net loss of $44 million for fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   Unlike some other smartphone makers, HTC prefers to compete through innovation and product diversification, rather than focus on slashing prices.
