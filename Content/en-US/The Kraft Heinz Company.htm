   , Kraft Heinz is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. In addition to its two namesakes, the company's portfolio of more than 200 brands (eight of them billion-dollar brands) include such iconic names as Oscar Meyer, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, Planters, Maxwell House, and Velveeta. Kraft Heinz has employees in more than 45 countries and sells its products in some 200. The company was formed in mid-2015 when Heinz and Kraft were merged; Heinz shareholders own 51% of the combined entity.

  <p>
   On an unaudited, pro-forma basis, Kraft Heinz would have reported some $29 billion in 2014 revenue, with Kraft providing $18 billion of that and Heinz providing about $11 billion. Net income would have been about $2.3 billion.

  <p>
   Kraft Heinz continues to work around its 'fewer, bigger, better' philosophy, focusing its new products and innovations on a core group of top brands. In 2017, for example, the company introduced frozen Velveeta products such as Velveeta Stuffed Grilled Cheese and Velveeta Cheesy Bites, which followed 2016's launch of Velveeta's Mini Blocks. Other recent brand expansions include olive and peach flavors of Philadelphia Cream Cheese and five new premium pasta sauces in the Classico line.

   Kraft Heinz's strategy also includes reducing expenses and growing through acquisitions. The company's management, steered by Brazilian private equity firm and stakeholder 3G Capital, has implemented multiyear cost-cutting measures across the business to reduce overhead by streamlining operations. Measures include closing seven plants in North America and consolidating operations in both existing and newly built modernized plants. Reducing employee headcount, which has fallen from about 46,000 at the time of the Kraft-Heinz merger to 42,000 in early 2016, is another key element of its strategy. The company expects these and other spending reductions to total $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   In line with 3G's approach to growth (centered on buying and consolidating large companies), the company is expected by some industry experts to leverage acquisitions of other major players in the food and beverage industry to expand internationally and bolster its product portfolio.
