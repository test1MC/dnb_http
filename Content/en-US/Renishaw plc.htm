   Renishaw is a stickler for detail. The company makes an assortment of test-probe and measurement systems used in industrial applications, especially those involving high-precision machining. Besides its core lines of touch-trigger and optical probes, Renishaw offers scanning, encoder, calibration, and spectroscopy systems designed to help manufacturers ensure fine tolerances in their machine-tooling processes. These products are also used to trace and translate objects into three-dimensional computer representations for CAD/CAM software. Customers in East Asia account for more than half of sales while those in the Americas tally about a quarter.

  <p>
   Renishaw's metrology products -- position measurement and calibration systems that help manufacturers maximize production -- account for 94% of its revenue. Health care products -- used in craniomaxillofacial surgery, dentistry, neurosurgery, chemical analysis, and nanotechnology research -- account for the rest.

  <p>
   From its main office in Gloucestershire, UK, Renishaw manages more than 70 offices in 33 countries. It makes its products in the UK, Ireland, India, Germany, USA and France. It has opened offices in Singapore and Vietnam to be closer to Asian manufacturers.

  <p>
   Renishaw posted revenue and net income increases around 30% in 2015 (ended June). Metrology revenue rose about 43% while health care revenue was off by about 4%. Sales in East Asia jumped some 91% in 2015 on large orders from customers in the consumer electronics markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased due to to the sales rise and absence of exceptional item costs.

  <p>
   Renishaw is investing in its manufacturing capabilities particularly when they can serve emerging markets for metrology products. It has boosted investment in plants at Miskin (Wales) and in Ireland, which increases capacity and reduces supply chain risk. The company also is working to develop new processes and products for the health care market.

    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   engine designer David McMurtry created the first touch-trigger probe in 1972 to measure minute piping for engines used on Concorde jets. Recognizing the invention's potential, McMurtry and fellow Rolls-Royce  engineer John Deer began making probes and other fixtures that they sold to engineering companies under the S&amp;A brand name. The probes were designed in McMurtry's garage and produced in Deer's home.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Rolls-Royce retained the probe's patent. So in 1973 McMurtry and Deer started Renishaw Electrical to license the probe design from Rolls-Royce. By 1974 Deer left Rolls-Royce to work full-time at Renishaw. (McMurtry worked full-time for Rolls-Royce until 1977 and as a part-time consultant until 1979.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1976 Renishaw acquired a half-interest in the Rolls-Royce patents stemming from McMurtry's designs. (Renishaw bought the other half in 1987.) Also that year the company moved into a former ice cream factory in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Renishaw bought a former textile mill, called New Mill, in Wotton-under-Edge. (After extensive renovation, the building became the company's central facility in 1985.) That year the company opened a manufacturing plant in Ireland and a sales and service center in the US. It established a subsidiary in Japan in 1982 and went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company established another subsidiary, this one in Germany, in 1986. Two years later it acquired Périféric, a French manufacturer of accessories for machine tools. Renishaw expanded steadily overseas during the late 1980s and 1990s, opening offices in Italy (1989), Spain and Switzerland (1991), Hong Kong (1993), Singapore and China (1994), Indonesia (1995), Brazil (1996), and India (1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company further expanded its New Mill site. The next year Renishaw added a subsidiary in Australia and an office in the Netherlands. David McMurtry was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand in Eastern Europe in 2002, adding an office in Hungary and subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Russia. Recognizing trends in international marketing, Renishaw launched Web sites in the Czech, Dutch, and Russian languages.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Renishaw established a new Chinese subsidiary, Renishaw Shanghai Trading. It set plans to open four new representative offices in China during 2006. That year the company opened a representative office in Bangkok. Renishaw also acquired itp GmbH, a German manufacturer of styluses and accessories for industrial measurement applications, for £4.8 million.
