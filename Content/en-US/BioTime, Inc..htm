   BioTime helps surgeons face down a long day in surgery. BioTime makes water-based solutions to prevent massive blood loss after traumatic injury, preserve organs for transplant, and replace blood during such procedures as cardiac bypass. BioTime's Hextend product is approved to maintain blood volume during surgery and is sold in the US and overseas via third parties. The firm is also developing PentaLyte, a version of the blood volume replacement product that metabolizes more quickly. BioTime has also expanded into the field of regenerative medicine; it sells a line of therapeutic stem cell research supplies. It is also working to develop its own line of biotech therapeutic candidates for degenerative diseases.

  <p>
   BioTime operates mainly through its seven subsidiaries. OncoCyte focuses on treating cancer, OrthoCyte treats orthopedic disorders and injuries, and ReCyte Therapeutics develops treatments for cardiovascular and ischemic disorders. The remaining units, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Cell Cure Neurosciences, LifeMap Sciences, and ES Cell International, all focus on stem cells in one way or another. LifeMap Sciences also sells human genome database kits.

  <p>
   BioTime reported a 10% drop in revenue for 2012 as sales of Hextend declined due to a drop in price of one of its competitors. It also completed a grant program and lost that revenue. Net loss increased 30% as the company spent money on R&amp;D and realized amortization of patents at its many subsidiaries. Cash flow held steady but it's operating with an accumulated deficit of more than $101 million.

  <p>
   Going forward, BioTime wants to focus on finding cell-based cures for age-related degenerative diseases. To that end, in 2012 it formed a subsidiary specifically to acquired stem cell companies and started shopping.
