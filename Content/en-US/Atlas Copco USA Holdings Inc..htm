  <p>
   Atlas Copco USA faces a number of challenges in the American marketplace. To counter its most significant -- maturity, the company pursues acquisitions that enhance its product offerings and distribution presence. In 2013 the company obtained California-based Pneumatic Holdings, a provider of light pneumatic construction tools including paving breakers, chipping hammers, rivet busters and rock drills. The acquisition strengthened its distribution and presence in the North American construction market.

   Atlas Copco USA in 2012 acquired Houston Service Industries (HSi), a Texas based manufacturer of centrifugal blowers, exhausters and control systems, to support its expansion across municipal wastewater markets. The deal provided Atlas Copco access to an expanded range of technologies used in low-pressure air and gas applications.
