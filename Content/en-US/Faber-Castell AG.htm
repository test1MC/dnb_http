The company also makes artist-quality coloring pencils and pastels, as well as markers, technical drawing pencils, and products for children. Its products are sold in about 120 countries. Faber-Castell has manufacturing centers in Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific region. Founded in 1761 as a pencil factory, the company is controlled by the founding von Faber-Castell family.

  <p>
   Cabinetmaker Kaspar Faber began making pencils in 1761 at his workshop in Stein, Germany (just outside Nuremberg). Little delineated Faber's business from other German pencil makers, who, as a group, produced inferior products because of a scarcity of graphite, a principal ingredient in pencils. The graphite was mined in northern England, and during this time, English pencils were the gold standard around the world. However, graphite was becoming scarce, and the pencil quality was diminishing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1839 Lothar Faber, Kaspar's great-grandson, took over the family business, then known as A.W. Faber. Lothar produced the first hexagonal pencil, and his commitment to quality helped make Nuremberg the center of German pencil production. (By the end of the century, 25 pencil companies were operating in the vicinity.) He also began embossing his pencils with the A.W. Faber company name, thus creating the first brand-name pencil in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   A.W. Faber began selling pencils in the US in 1843. (Lothar's brother, Eberhard, was sent to the US in 1841. He found the pencil business so promising that he branched out on his own, forming Eberhard Faber.) A foreign branch of the company was established in New York City in 1849, and others in London, Paris, St. Petersburg, and Vienna quickly followed during the year. Faber traveled the world, handing out samples and spreading the word. By the mid-1800s A.W. Faber was a well-known commodity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lothar bought a graphite mine in Siberia in 1856. The purchase turned out to be a major coup for the company and unequivocally put it in the lead. Although Siberian graphite had to be transported by reindeer to the nearest port, graphite from England had all but vanished, giving A.W. Faber the world's top graphite supply.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company name changed to A.W. Faber-Castell after the 1898 marriage of Lothar's granddaughter, Ottilie, to Count Alexander zu Castell-Rudenhausen.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1900s saw further development of Faber-Castell's international operations. By 1962 text markers (highlighters) and ballpoint and felt-tip pens were being produced in Australia and Austria, and by 1967 there were factories in Peru and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1978 Anton Wolfgang Graf von Faber-Castell succeeded his father, Count Roland, as the sole owner and managing director of the company. Also that year Faber-Castell began producing makeup pencils under private labels for the cosmetics industry. In 1980 the company built the world's largest rubber eraser factory in Malaysia. Faber-Castell Consulting (business administration consulting) opened its doors in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   A reconciliation of sorts occurred in 1987 when Faber-Castell bought Eberhard Faber's US operations. However, the company's US business (which made the ubiquitous Eberhard Faber yellow office pencil) was sold to Newell (now Newell-Rubbermaid) in 1994. The company opened a new US division called A.W. Faber-Castell USA in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faber-Castell debuted its Playing and Learning line of markers and crayons for children in 1998.The next year Faber-Castell's US subsidiary purchased Creativity for Kids, a Cleveland company that sells design activity kits (jewelry making, baking, gardening) for young children. Faber-Castell opened its first factory in China in 2001. The next year the company opened a factory in Malaysia, the largest manufacturing facility in Southeast Asia.
