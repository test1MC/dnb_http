   Business at Canada Bread Company is bigger than a bread box. The company makes and sells bakery products, both fresh and frozen, as well as specialty breads and some pasta and sauces. Most of its business is in fresh bread; brands include Dempster's (#1 in Canada), Ben's, and POM. Premium nutrition breads are sold under the Smart, BodyWise, and other labels. Wholesome Harvest, Tenderflake, and New York Bakery are Canada Bread's name brands for frozen unbaked, par-baked, and fully-baked goods. The company also offers private-label baked items for grocery and fast-food chains. Canadians generate the bulk of sales, followed by customers in the US and UK. Canada Bread was acquired by Mexico's

   in 2014.

   In May 2014 Mexico's largest commercial baking operations,

   Prior to its purchase by Grupo Bimbo, Canada Bread was looking to grow through stronger volume sales on lower costs. To that end, in 2013 it shuttered bakeries to improve efficiency and cut costs. It also closed a snack cake bakery in Quebec due to falling demand. Previously, Canada Bread took steps to cut overhead by building a new state-of-the-industry fresh bakery in Ontario to replace three less-efficient area facilities. (Commercial production started in mid-2011.) In the UK, it consolidated one facility and placed another on the sale rack. The company further trimmed costs by standardizing pans. Canada Bread once manufactured breads and rolls in 33 different sizes; it now uses 10 sizes.

   To build sales volumes, the company had expanded its core offerings as well as reached into new categories. Its rollout of Dempster's Rye breads resulted in a 20% uptick in the rye category. Other additions include Dempster's Tortillas and Olivieri name brand cannelloni pasta. Concurrently, Canada Bread has launched several marketing efforts; Dempster's nutritious breads featured hockey star Sidney Crosby, and New York Bakery bagel products were accompanied by a special promotion in the UK.

   In 2013 the company sold Olivieri Foods to

   Persuaded that bakery goods for the home can be more profitable than fare for fast-food outlets, Canada Bread sold its prepared sandwich unit to
   <company id="52767">
    Premium Brands Holding
   </company>
   in early 2011. The $8 million deal axed a business that supplies supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations in Quebec and Ontario, along with two regional production facilities and a distribution center. Canada Bread and parent (and meat processor) Maple Leaf Foods, however, keep a place cardholder at the counter; they inked an agreement with Premium Brands to continue to supply the sandwich-making operation. For Premium Brands, the deal complements its recent acquisition of US-based sandwich maker

    SK Food Group

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Canada Bread's move to sell its sandwich unit follows a dismal fiscal year in 2010. Despite a modest rise in year-over-year profitability in its fresh bakery business, demand for frozen bakery goods thawed considerably. The company reported roughly a 20% slump in consolidated earnings on a small decrease in total sales. Results were attributable to lost sales from some key North American customers coupled with the impact of the recession on UK consumer purchases of Canada Bread's premium baked items. (The company's last significant acquisition was for La Fornaia, a producer of specialty and handcrafted breads in the UK, in 2007.) In addition, financial expectations for the sandwich business failed to materialize, prompting its sale.
