  <p>
   In 2015, revenue increased 9% on prior year to €666.8 million following the acquisition of Waterlinx, a South African company. The pools division grew revenue 12% (7% organic), with the commercial pools division in particular up 23%. The irrigation division recorded a fall in revenue by 42%, relating to a divestiture of Irrigaronne, from its French agricultural irrigation operation, although accounting for the divestiture performance was otherwise positive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fluidra recorded double-digit growth in Spain (11%), while in France the divestiture shrunk revenue by 12%. Australia performed strongly, but Asia saw sales slump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 96% on prior year to €13.0 million, reversing a trend for decreasing revenue in recent years, due to higher sales and a decrease in financing costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities rose 12% to €53,000.

  <p>
   Fluidra re-organized its operation into three divisions: Europe, Expansion and Operations. The move is intended to streamline Fluidra's supply chain by grouping buying, production, storage and logistics under the same management. In Europe, growth rates are low so the company is looking to improve profitability via an increase in operational efficiency. The Expansion segment aims to increase Fluidra's presence in high-growth international markets. The Operations division works mainly in Spain, France, Israel and China and aims to increase cost efficiencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company divested Irrigaronne, its French agricultural irrigation business, in order to focus on core activities.

  <p>
   In 2015, in order to expand Fluidra's commercial pool sector, the company acquired Somhidros, Spain's leading fountain manufacturer, for around €1 million. In the same year, it acquired the chemical products distribution business of Price Chemicals. It also acquired Waterlinx Group, a South African pool manufacturer and distributor in order to strengthen its presence in the south of the continent and balance the seasonal nature of the business given its presence in the southern hemisphere.
