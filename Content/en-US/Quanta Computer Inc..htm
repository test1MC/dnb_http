   Quanta Computer's 2011 revenue fell just over 1% to NT$1.1 trillion (around $37 billion). Its net income, however, rose by 22% for the same period to NT$23 billion (about $780 million) as a result of strict cost controls it put in place. The company is focused on inventory reductions and yield rate improvements, among other measures.

  <p>
   The company is focusing its R&amp;D efforts on cloud computing, connectivity, and client devices. All three areas are part of a broader cloud computing initiative that involves the design and manufacture of data storage products and servers (for providing cloud-computing services), next-generation data networking products (for enabling uninterrupted cloud-computing connections and service coverage), and client devices (for accessing cloud networks).
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of notebooks, other areas of focus include mobile devices, automotive electronics, high-definition video conferencing, and satellite technology.
