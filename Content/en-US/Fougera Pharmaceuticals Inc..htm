   Fougera Pharmaceuticals (formerly Nycomed US) is focused on making specialty topical and dermatology medicines for North Americans. The company's E. Fougera &amp; Company division primarily makes generic topical steroids, antibiotics, and antifungals for both prescription and OTC markets, while the PharmaDerm unit develops, manufactures, and markets branded prescription dermatology products. Its smaller Savage Laboratories unit makes prescription topicals for the emergency care market. Fougera separated from former parent

   The company's PharmaDerm prescription products are marketed to health care professionals (especially dermatologists) through its direct sales force (located in New York), while Fougera &amp; Co.'s generic offerings are supplied by sales representatives (located in New Jersey) and through wholesale distributors and retail outlets. Savage Labs sells surgical lubricant Surgilube and emergency cardiology ointment Nitro-Bid to hospital pharmacies; it stopped marketing two other products, Crofab (antivenin for snake bites) and Digifab (an antidote for digitalis poisoning).

   Formerly owned by
   <company id="91125">
    ALTANA AG
   </company>
   , the company (then named Altana Inc.) was bought by Nycomed in 2007, along with ALTANA AG's other pharmaceutical operations, and was renamed Nycomed US. In September 2011 Nycomed International was acquired by Japanese drugmaker
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   for â‚¬9.6 billion ($14 billion); however, the autonomous Nycomed US business didn't fit into Takeda's global growth strategy and was excluded from the deal. Following Nycomed International's acquisition by Takeda, Nycomed US changed its name to Fougera Pharmaceuticals. The firm was owned by the same private investor group (including Nordic Capital,

   , Collier International, and Avista Capital Partners) that previously owned Nycomed International; the investor group sold Fougera to Sandoz less than a year later.
