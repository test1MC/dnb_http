  <p>
   In 2015 Bridon International acquired ScanRope (a Norway-based manufacturer of both steel and fiber deep water mooring systems) from the
   <company id="11156">
    Parker-Hannifin Corporation
   </company>
   . The deal strengthened Bridon International's position as the market leader in this segment.

  <p>
   The company was originally formed as British Ropes in 1924.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company invested Â£20 million ($31.7 million) in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant on Neptune Quay in Newcastle, UK. It wants to produce the largest ropes in the world at the plant, which is expected to start up by the end of 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company launched eight new products, as well as improved some of its existing products. Among the new products are extended and sheathed round balance ropes for the mining industry designed to have more flexibility and resistance to corrosion. A new Brystar rope has been designed with enhanced rope fatigue performance for the oil and gas industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite uncertainty in the markets, especially in the Eurozone countries, Bridon expects demand to remain positive during 2012 from such sectors as oil and gas. It expects growth in emerging markets to continue, which will offset any weakness from other areas.
