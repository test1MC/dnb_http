   Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) might wear a cheesy grin, but it churns up solid sales. The dairy cooperative transforms (a record) about 5.8 billion pounds of milk into butter, cheese, fluid milk, and other dairy products each and every year. A regional co-op with some 2,600 member/farmers in six states across the Midwest, AMPI operates 10 manufacturing plants. In addition to its State Brand and Cass-Clay brand, Associated Milk Producers also makes private-label products for food retailers, fast-food restaurants (including
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   ), and other food service operators. It also makes dairy ingredients for food manufacturers.

  <p>
   Members of Associated Milk Producers operate dairy farms in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

   The co-op reported sales of $1.8 billion in 2013 and earnings of $7.5 million. By comparison, AMPI had sales of $2 billion in 2011. Like other milk producers, AMPI has been contending with sluggish milk sales due to decreasing milk consumption since the 1970s. Sales of American-style cheese production totaled 400 million pounds in 2013, and remained the cooperative's top product category. Cheese and butter packaged for consumers at the cooperative's manufacturing plants grew. Cheese sales increased 7%, while butter sales rose for the eighth consecutive year, posting a 3% gain. Nearly 70% of AMPI's consumer-packaged business is sold to food service customers.

  <p>
   To position the cooperative for future growth, the board has narrowed AMPI's manufacturing focus. To that end, it sold the Cass-Clay Creamery and retail brand to Fargo, North Dakota in 2012 to
   <company id="113214">
    Kemps, LLC
   </company>
   , and its cheese sauce and pudding business in Dawson, Minnesota in November. Instead, it's strengthening its focus on cheese, butter, and powdered dairy products. Recent investments on its manufacturing infrastructure include $7.5 million to purchase and install 18 technologically advanced cheese vats to improve production efficiency and cheese yield.

   Historically, the co-op has made strategic acquisitions to extend its product line, adding ice cream, yogurt, dips, sour cream, and juice to its portfolio.

  <p>
   In 1969, faced with declining milk consumption and a subsequent drop in income, about 100 dairy cooperatives in the Midwest and the South merged to form Associated Milk Producers Incorporated (AMPI). AMPI elected John Butterbrodt, from a Wisconsin co-op, as the first president. Co-ops throughout the central US clamored to join, and AMPI became the largest US dairy co-op within two years of its formation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost from the beginning, AMPI became embroiled in the two main controversies involving dairy co-ops: monopolistic practices and political contributions. In 1972 consumer advocate Ralph Nader alleged that the three main dairy co-ops -- AMPI, Dairymen, and Mid-America Dairymen -- had illegally contributed $422,000 to President Nixon's reelection campaign in an attempt to obtain higher price supports (enacted in 1971) and an agreement that the administration would drop antitrust suits against the co-ops. Watergate investigators subpoenaed Nixon's tapes, and AMPI was accused of bribery, destruction of evidence, and attempting to achieve "complete market dominance." In 1974 it pleaded guilty to making illegal political contributions in 1968, 1970, and 1972. By 1975 three former AMPI employees had been convicted of various charges and Butterbrodt had resigned.
  </p>
  <p>
   The co-op spent the last half of the 1970s quietly reorganizing. In 1982 a suit for monopolistic practices, originally filed in 1971 by the National Farmers Organization (NFO), finally reached the federal courts. The case was decided in favor of AMPI and two other large co-ops, but before the year was out an appeals court reversed the decision, saying AMPI and its co-defendants had conspired to eliminate competitive sellers of milk. (The
   <company id="151183">
    US Supreme Court
   </company>
   subsequently upheld the appeals court ruling.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Business soured in the early 1990s, and despite successfully lobbying the Department of Agriculture to strengthen dairy price supports, AMPI posted losses. Despite heavy spending in Congress, AMPI watched decades of government support to dairy farmers fall away as the 1996 Farm Bill established free-market agriculture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with falling prices, deregulation, and foreign competition, in 1997 AMPI entered into consolidation talks with three of its dairy co-op brethren: Mid-America Dairymen, Milk Marketing, and Western Dairymen Cooperative. AMPI's Southern Region, which primarily produced fluid milk, decided to join the new co-op,
   <company id="40314">
    Dairy Farmers of America
   </company>
   ; members of its Northern Region, which focused on hard products, stayed put, renaming itself North Central AMPI to reduce confusion during the transition. However, the co-op officially readopted the original name in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   High butterfat prices in 1998 helped the co-op post record earnings during its first year after the separation. Amid wild consolidations within the dairy industry, in mid-1999 AMPI made a modest merger with the Glencoe Butter &amp; Produce Association. The small regional cooperative based in Glencoe, Minnesota, brought a cheese production plant and 1,000 new members to AMPI. In 2000 a Minnesota cooperative, the Fremont Cooperative Creamery Association, sold its plant and added its 40 members to AMPI rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMPI's 93,000-sq.-ft. plant in New Ulm, Minnesota, is the biggest butter barn in the US and was originally able to whip up nearly 20,000 pounds of butter per hour. However, a fire at the plant in 2004 melted nearly 3 million pounds of butter and left the facility badly damaged. AMPI has since rebuilt the plant. It reopened in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2012 AMPI sold its aseptic cheese and pudding business to

   for an undisclosed sum.
