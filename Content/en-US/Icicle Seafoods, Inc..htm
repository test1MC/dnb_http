  <p>
   One of North America's largest and most diversified seafood companies, Icicle Seafoods regularly seeks strategic opportunities to expand its business and boost its market share in processing salmon and other seafood products. To this end, the company in 2012 acquired Snopac Products, which operates a seafood processing plant in Dillingham, Alaska, and serves the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery. A processing vessel, the M/V Snopac Innovator, allows the company to also tap herring and pink salmon fisheries. Snopac's collective process capacity reaches more than 1 million pounds of round weight daily. Past purchases include salmon-farming company Smoki Foods, which added salmon fillets and value-added salmon products, and included Smoki subsidiary American Gold Seafoods. Buying American Gold Seafoods gave Icicle Seafoods a pair of hatcheries near Rochester, Washington, and 120 pens off Bainbridge Island, Port Angeles, Cypress Island, and Hope Island (all within the waters of Puget Sound).

   Icicle Seafoods has raised funds for growth through the 2010 sale of its Bellingham, Washington, surimi analog business to

   . Icicle Seafoods said the surimi operation was not strategic to its future.
