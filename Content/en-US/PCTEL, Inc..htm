   PCTEL wants to help its customers find the right connections. The company provides scanning receiver and antenna products to public and private telecom carriers and wireless infrastructure providers. Its products include a broad line of antennas (Bluewave, MAXRAD), scanning receivers (SeeGull), and interference management products (CLARIFY). The company also generates a small portion of revenues from licensing intellectual property related to its discontinued modem business. The company sells directly and through resellers, distributors, and OEM equipment providers. PCTEL serves a variety of markets in addition to telecommunications, such as transportation, public safety, health care, energy, and agriculture.

   Originally a provider of software-based modems that was incorporated in California in 1994 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998, PCTEL sold its soft modem operations to

    Conexant Systems

   <company id="58759">
   </company>
   n 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has historically used acquisitions -- including the purchases of cyberPIXIE (2002), Dynamic Telecommunications (2003), mobile antenna assets from
   <company id="12640">
    Andrew
   </company>
   (2004), and Sigma Wireless (2005) -- to expand its wireless product line. However, in 2007 the company jettisoned the UMTS antenna operations it gained from the Sigma acquisition, citing poor sales. The company acquired the antenna product lines of Bluewave Antenna Systems in 2008; the purchase included rugged antennas designed for the energy and utilities industries.

   Also in 2008 PCTEL completed the sale of its Mobility Solutions Group (Wi-Fi and cellular access software) to
   <company id="47699">
    Smith Micro Software
   </company>
   for approximately $60 million. The Mobility Solutions Group accounted for about 10% of PCTEL's revenues before the sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   PCTEL bought Wi-Sys Communications, a maker of GPS antennas, in 2009. The following year it bought Texas-based Sparco Technologies, a specialist in wireless networking products, for $2.4 million in a further effort to round out its product line and build its customer roster.
