   Kweichow Moutai's liquor will really put some hair on your chest. The company makes Moutai (sometimes known as Maotai in the West), the national liquor of China. Moutai is a type of baijiu, a 100 proof distilled spirit made of wheat and sorghum. Kweichow Moutai produces about 20,000 tons of Moutai every year -- the most expensive being an 80-year-old bottle that sells for hundreds of dollars. Moutai is exported to 100 countries, including the US. The distillery is located in Moutai Town in Kweichow Province in southwestern China. Moutai has been made in China for thousands of years, but the state-owned Kweichow Moutai company was formed in 1951.
