  <p>
   Silgan's core business is manufacturing metal food containers, which accounted for more 63% of the company's sales in 2015. The company's industry presence is reinforced by its success in winning multi-year supply arrangements with some of the world's blue chip consumer goods manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's products include steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products; metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products; and custom designed plastic containers, tubes and closures for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet care, agricultural chemical, automotive and marine chemical products.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through direct sales force and to a lesser degree through a network of distributors for its plastic container products. In 2015
   <company id="43903">
    Nestle
   </company>
   accounted for 12% of its net sales.

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $3.91 billion in 2014, Silgan saw its revenues dip 4% to $3.76 billion in 2015. Profits also fell 5% from $182 million in 2014 to $172 million in 2015. In addition, Silgan's net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $10 million to $335 million in 2015, primarily due to a changes in accrued liabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2015 was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translations of approximately $138 million and the pass-through of lower raw material costs in each of its businesses. Silgan was also affected by unfavorable financial impact from recent longer-term contract renewals in its plastic container business and the cessation its operations in Venezuela

  <p>
   The company plans to continue to increase its market share in its current business lines and related business lines through acquisitions and internal growth. Silgan has completed 35 business acquisitions since its founding in 1987. Moreover, manufacturers that have stopped making their own containers in order to cut costs have been a boon for Silgan. During the last 20 years Silgan pocketed the can-making facilities of Nestlé and Campbell Soup (its top two customers), Del Monte,
   <company id="52370">
    Dial
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="106836">
    Birds Eye
   </company>
   , Purina Steel Can, and
   <company id="59943">
    Pacific Coast
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Simultaneously, Silgan continues to streamline its manufacturing processes and consolidate its production footprint to cut costs; it has shuttered manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe and shifted production to lower-cost plants in Asia and elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company built a new metal food container manufacturing facility in Burlington, Iowa, to better optimize the logistical footprint of its metal container business in North America. In 2015 Silgan began building two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the US, including a near-site facility to a major customer and another facility to meet the growing needs of its customers and allow it to further reduce costs of its plastic container business.
