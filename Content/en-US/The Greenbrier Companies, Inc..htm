   On land and by sea: Greenbrier Companies' recipe for growth involves the manufacturing of freight cars and marine barges. Through its primary Manufacturing segment, Greenbrier produces 100-ton-capacity boxcars; intermodal and conventional railcars; center-partition, flat, and tank cars; and marine vessels. Its Wheels &amp; Parts segment repairs and services wheels and offers railcar refurbishment and parts in nearly 30 locations. Its Leasing &amp; Services unit manages a fleet of about 8,900 railcars. Alan James and William Furman founded The Greenbrier Companies in 1981.

  <p>
   Greenbrier's Manufacturing segment makes insulated and non-insulated tank cars used to transport ethanol, methanol, caustic soda, vegetable oils, bio-diesel, and other products. Its European railcar line includes pressurized tank cars for liquid petroleum gas, ammonia, and non-pressurized railcars for light oil, chemicals, and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to providing repair, refurbishment, maintenance, and wheel conditioning at 10 locations in North America, Greenbrier's Railcar Wheels &amp; Parts business produces doors and roofs and other related boxcar parts. Its Leasing &amp; Services segment offers full service leasing. Additionally, Greenbrier offers management services, such as billing and collection and fleet management.

   The company's biggest customers,
   <company id="44473">
    TTX Company
   </company>
   and CIT Group, accounted for 31% of total revenue in 2016. In addition,

   accounted for 21% of the company's total inventory purchases during 2016.

  <p>
   Greenbrier has enjoyed significant growth over the last four years. Helped by a burgeoning global demand for the manufacturing of freight cars and marine barges, the company saw its revenues climb 3% from $2.6 billion in 2015 to a record-setting $2.68 billion in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2016 was fueled by a massive 166% surge in Leasing &amp; Services revenue. This was the result of the sale of railcars that were purchased from a related third party and a 14% increase in management services revenue due to the addition of new management service agreements. This was partially offset by a 2% decrease in Manufacturing revenue due to a 4% dip in the volume of railcar deliveries. In addition, Wheels &amp; Parts revenue decreased by 13% due to lower wheel set, component, and parts volumes for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits fell 5% from $193 million to $183 million from 2015 to 2016 due to higher amounts paid on interest and about $15.8 million it spent on the disposal of equipment.

  <p>
   During 2015, Greenbrier substantially broadened its international presence. The company expanded into the South American markets through its investment in a new railcar manufacturing venture in Brazil, now known as GreenbrierMaxion. The company also entered into markets in the Middle East with an order for Saudi Railway Company (SAR). In 2016, the company additionally began production of railcars for the Saudi Arabian market for delivery beginning in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greenbrier received orders for over 32,000 railcars in 2015 and ended the year with a diversified railcar backlog of over 41,000 railcars, valued at nearly $5 billion. In 2016 it had a manufacturing backlog of 27,500 units with an estimated value of $3.19 billion.

  <p>
   Alan James and William Furman already owned a transportation-leasing equipment company when they founded The Greenbrier Companies in 1981. That year they bought Greenbrier Leasing Corporation, which owned and leased railroad flatcars. Greenbrier entered the railcar-manufacturing business with its 1985 acquisition of Gunderson, a unit of
   <company id="10540">
    FMC Corporation
   </company>
   . That year Greenbrier expanded its leasing business by buying subsidiaries of investment firm BRAE Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Greenbrier formed a partnership with Mitsui to sell Greenbrier's Autostack container systems (for transporting cars by rail) in Japan. Greenbrier went public in 1994 and entered the marine vessel industry.
