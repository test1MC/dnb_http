   Lion needed more room to grow than its native New Zealand could offer, so the brewer moved over to that larger country across the down-under water. It was a good move: In Australia, Lion is the #2 brewer, with more than 40% of the market, behind archrival

  <p>
   In 1988 Lion Corporation, maker of beers, wines, and spirits, merged with LD Nathan &amp; Co., a food and general merchandise retailer, to form Lion Nathan. But the company's history goes back to the 1840s in Auckland, New Zealand. That's when John Logan Campbell and William Brown, liquor wholesalers, set up the Hobson Bridge Brewery (later named the Doman Brewery). In 1878 brewer Louis Ehrenfried bought the Albert Brewery. The two combined in 1898 as Campbell and Ehrenfried; Ehrenfried's nephew Arthur Myers (grandfather of Lion Nathan chairman, Douglas Myers) ran the new company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Campbell and Ehrenfried (C&amp;E) merged with Auckland's Great Northern Brewery in 1914, forming Lion (named for one of Great Northern's brews). Consolidation took a big leap forward in 1923 when Lion and nine other leading brewers combined to form New Zealand Breweries in part to present a united front against prohibitionist forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Douglas Myers became CEO of C&amp;E in 1965 and bought out the family-held company in 1970. In 1981C&amp;E and bought 20% of Lion Breweries (Myers became managing director the next year). In 1988 Lion merged with LD Nathan to form Lion Nathan, New Zealand's largest brewer. The new company focused on beer, soft drinks, and hotels, selling non-core assets (including the
   <company id="103828">
    Woolworths
   </company>
   and Deka chains) for $800 million and, in 1990, buying 50% of Natbrew Holdings, which owned brewing assets in Australia. It also sold its market-dominating
   <company id="10359">
    Coke
   </company>
   bottling franchise and in 1989 completed an agreement with Pepsi to bottle and distribute its products in Australia. Three years later Lion Nathan bought the rest of Natbrew.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 the company added Hahn Brewery and South Australian Breweries to its operations. The company entered the Chinese market by purchasing 60% of the Taihushui brewery in 1995. In 1996 it increased its ownership to 80% and two years later opened its own brewery in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a plan to expand its international operations, Kirin bought 45% of Lion Nathan in 1998. In 2000 Lion Nathan sold its Australia
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi
   </company>
   facility, acquired a 28% stake in Australia's leading winery, Montana Group, and moved its headquarters to Australia. In order to expand outside its core beverage businesses, the company also purchased 43 hotels in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lion Nathan's desire to increase its wine business to offset flat growth in beer sales led the company to pursue Australia's Montana winery, and it out-dueled British drinks giant
   <company id="50001">
    Allied Domecq
   </company>
   (breaking stock exchange rules in the process) in February 2001 to gain control. In August Lion Nathan decided to wash its hands of the whole affair and unexpectedly sold its 43% stake in Montana to Allied Domecq. Still determined to break into the Australian wine business, in September 2001 it bought 15% of the much smaller Banksia Wines, a seller of premium wines that exports half its production to the UK; before the end of the year it had gained 85% control.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Lion Nathan acquired Australia-based vintner Petaluma. Also that year Lion Nathan signed a deal allowing
   <company id="47435">
    InBev
   </company>
   to license the Castlemaine XXXX beer brand in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 InBev returned the favor, signing a long-term agreement that allowed Lion Nathan to sell Beck's in Australia. In addition, the company in 2004 set up a joint venture with Bibendum Wine Limited to distribute Lion Nathan wine in Great Britain and Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2004 the company said it would buy the Changzhou Hua Xia Brewing as part of an expansion of its Chinese business. Later that year, however, Lion Nathan exited the rapidly consolidating beer industry in China when it sold its Chinese assets to China Resources Breweries, a joint venture between
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55206">
    China Resources Beer
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Lion Nathan became embroiled in a bitter corporate battle in 2005, arising from its takeover bid for Australian rival
   <company id="143140">
    Coopers
   </company>
   . Late in the year Coopers' shareholders rebuffed Lion Nathan's attempt to buy a controlling interest in the company, and by 2006 the deal was dead in the water.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Lion Nathan acquired US wine importer, Cumulus Wine (CWI), which set up a channel to sell premium Australian and New Zealand wines in the US. Kirin also formed a joint venture with
   <company id="58530">
    Bacardi
   </company>
   that year for the sales of its pre-mixed spirits in Australia. It made an $8 billion bid to take over the soft drink bottler,
   <company id="89492">
    Coca-Cola Amatil
   </company>
   , in 2008 as well. However, Amatil and
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   (which owns 30% of Amatil) both rejected the offer as having too many conditions.
