   One of Japan's top paper makers, along with
   <company id="52499">
    Nippon Paper Industries Co.
   </company>
   , Oji Holdings produces pulp and paper and converted paper products through about 120 subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Among the products it manufactures, converts, and sells are printing and writing papers; packaging and wrapping papers; carbonless paper; household paper goods; containerboard; and boxboard. It also makes paperboard containers, plastics, thermal papers, and disposable diapers. Other businesses manufacture chemicals for paper making and packaging equipment and manage company-owned forest assets. Formerly Oji Paper, Oji Holdings shifted to a holding company structure in 2012.

   Japan is Oji Holdings' largest market. Other sales are made in Asia/Pacific, Oceania, Europe, and the Americas.

   The change to a holding company structure in 2012 turned certain operating and indirect divisions into wholly owned subsidiaries, now under the control of Oji Holdings. Management can now make strategic decisions for the group in order to enhance efficiencies and allow the company to expand its overseas business.

  <p>
   Eiichi Shibusawa established Oji Paper in 1873 as Shoshi-Gaisha. Production began two years later at the company's mill in Oji. The company, which was partially funded by the Mitsui Group, was the first in Japan to use Western papermaking technology. During the 1890s the Mitsui Group granted the company additional funding to install the latest papermaking technology in Shoshi-Gaisha's facilities, but the Group removed Shibusawa from the company's management team soon after. The company was renamed Oji Paper Manufacturing Company in 1893. Oji Paper enjoyed great success and expansion under the management of the Mitsui Group and during WWI, as Japan's exports tripled, the company's sales substantially increased.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1933 Oji Paper acquired Fuji Paper and Karafuto Industries and soon was producing about 80% of the country's paper needs. The company prospered through WWII despite significant shortages of raw materials. During the Allied occupation that followed the war, the company was forced to split into three companies: Jujo Paper, Honshu Paper, and Tomakomai Paper. Tomakomai was renamed Oji Paper shortly after the split. Experiencing a shortage of imported pulp after the war, the company propositioned US government officials to create a company that would import pulp from Alaska. In 1953 the Alaska Pulp Company was established and began supplying pulp to Oji Paper and its affiliates.

   The company modernized its facilities during the 1960s, which led to cutbacks in its workforce; the cutbacks were followed by strikes and lockouts during that period. The 1970s brought acquisitions that included Kita Nippon Paper and Nippon Pulp Industries. The company also built mills in New Zealand (1971) and Brazil (1972). Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Oji Paper enhanced its line of specialty and consumer paper products; it added its own line of disposable diapers in 1989. The company also increased its newsprint output that year when it purchased Toyo Pulp Company. Despite apparent decreases in demand for newsprint from the late 1980s, the company continued to grow into the 1990s due to its higher reliance on other paper products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's acquisitions of Kanzaki Paper (1993) and Honshu Paper (1996) reinforced its influence in international paper markets. In 1999, amid a recession in Japan, the company began implementing major cutbacks on its operations that included reducing staff, eliminating or stopping some of its paper machines, and consolidating some of its divisions such as its self-adhesive products unit. The cutbacks proved successful, and Oji Paper bounced back to profitability in 2000. To keep operating costs low, the company is now expanding into Asia with new facilities planned or already open in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Oji Paper continued to restructure and cut costs as Japan's slumping information technology and advertising business negatively affected its paper business, and depressed sales of home appliances led to poor sales in its paperboard segment.

   In mid-2006 Oji made an (ultimately unsuccessful) unsolicited $1.2 billion bid for rival
   <company id="56853">
    Hokuetsu Paper Mills
   </company>
   . The deal made a stir because it is highly unusual for Japanese firms to make unsolicited takeover bids. Oji's takeover attempt eventually inspired competitors Nippon Paper and
   <company id="107509">
    Rengo
   </company>
   to combine forces around cardboard manufacturing, a segment that Oji had been leading.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company agreed to a partnership with
   <company id="56852">
    Mitsubishi Paper Mills
   </company>
   to combat increasing raw material costs and a shrinking domestic market. Mitsubishi plans to up its capacity at its mills to accommodate Oji orders while Oji has agreed to supply Mitsubishi paper with thermostatic recording paper from its Thailand subsidiary.
