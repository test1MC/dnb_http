   Omeros doesn't claim to soothe the soul, but it may be able to tame inflammation caused by surgery. The biopharmaceutical company is developing products based on its PharmacoSurgery platform, a combination of low-dose therapeutic agents applied directly to a surgical site to inhibit inflammation. Its first marketed product is Omidria, for use in cataract surgery. Omidria was launched in early 2015. Another candidate, OMS103HP, is in trials for its ability to improve joint function and reduce pain following ACL knee reconstruction surgery and arthroscopic meniscectomy (removal of knee cartilage tears). In addition to inflammation, Omeros maintains programs focused on blood clot issues and the central nervous system (CNS).

  <p>
   Omeros develops both small-molecule and protein therapeutics targeting inflammation, coagulopathies (impairment of blood clotting ability), and CNS disorders. The company has clinical-stage development programs with focuses ranging from Huntington's disease and schizophrenia to the prevention of problems related to urologic surgical procedures. In addition to its PharmacoSurgery platform, it has a proprietary platform capable of unlocking new G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug targets, as well as a platform used to generate antibodies.

  <p>
   The company has global marketing and distribution rights to Omidria, which it sells to surgeons and surgical facilities in the US through a team of 40 contract sales reps. Additionally, it distributes the product through a network of third-party wholesalers and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Omeros also hold the marketing and distribution rights for all of its drug candidates.

  <p>
   The company does not expect to report significant earnings until it begins broadly selling its recently introduced Omidria (and other products, upon approval). Omeros' revenue dropped in 2013 and 2014, following a period of increases. In 2014, net sales decreased $1 million to $0.5 million; this was due to the completion of its GPCR funding from

    Vulcan Capital
   </company>
   and Washington State's Life Sciences Discovery Fund, the final revenues from which Omeros recognized during 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The biopharmaceutical has yet to make a profit, and net losses have been growing for the past three years. Net loss increased $33.8 million to $73.6 million in 2014 on higher R&amp;D expenses related to clinical trials. Operating cash outflow also increased to $58 million due to changes in receivables and prepaid expenses.

  <p>
   Omeros' goal is to tap into the surgical trauma market, where it believes current standards of care are limited in effectiveness and don't address the multiple problems that can occur during and after surgery, from inflammation and pain to spasm and loss of function. Its PharmacoSurgery products combine therapeutic agents with standard surgical irrigation fluid and when applied directly to the tissue throughout the surgical procedure they are designed to preemptively block the molecular and biochemical signals that trigger problems such as inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company launched OMIDRIAssure, a reimbursement program designed to increase access to its Omidria treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond inflammation, Omeros maintains another set of product candidates focused on central nervous system disorders, including addiction and schizophrenia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Omeros retains all manufacturing, marketing, and distribution rights for each of its product candidates.
