   It isn't just about red ink or black ink at DIC Corporation -- it's about green, blue, and yellow, too. The company's printing inks and supplies unit (more than half of sales) produces offset, gravure, and news inks, coatings for paper and cans, printing supplies, and presses. It also makes imaging products (toners, drums, magnetic foils). DIC has three other business units: neo-graphic arts materials (pigments, imaging products, liquid crystal materials), synthetic resins (resins, additives, and chemicals), and chemical solution materials (compounds, building materials, adhesives, and plastics). All told, about 175 companies make up DIC's worldwide network of companies.

  <p>
   The company operates in five business segments: Printing Inks, Fine Chemicals, Polymers, Compounds, and Application Materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Printing Inks (50% of total sales) produces publishing inks, and inks and adhesives for packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Polymers (more than 20%) provides synthetic resins and resin-related products to a wide range of industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fine Chemicals (more than 15%) includes a wide variety of materials for digital devices, including LC materials and organic pigments for color filters (expected to be a growth area for DIC).
  </p>
  <p>
   Compounds (more than 5%) leverages resin and pigment dispersion and compounding technologies to provide products that respond to the expanding needs of the global digital printing, automotive, and electronics markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Application Materials (more than 5%) offers a diverse range of products, including industrial adhesive tapes, hollow-fiber membranes and modules, and co-extruded multi-layer films, which are made possible through the integration of DIC's proprietary coating, printing, molding, and other technologies.

  <p>
   DIC saw its revenue grow by 1.2% in 2015 to ¥820 billion. Globally, the company's production levels were modest or slightly lower. Moderate economic recovery persisted in North America and Europe; China and Southeast Asia decelerated gradually, although India showed economic improvement. Japan's economy grew gradually. Only the Fine Chemical segment reported revenue growth (up 5%), reflecting substantially higher sales of effect pigments and of pigments for use in cosmetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose by 48.4% to ¥37.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to a ¥14.4 billion gain on sales of non-current assets (up from ¥619 million in 2014) and from other rationalization measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from ¥46.4 billion in 2014 to ¥29.1 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   As the global shift to digital media has slowed growth in the printing industry, DIC's strategy is to expand its business lines into emerging markets while leveraging its cost advantages in current markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's DIC IO8 Plan is focused on growing its high performance materials' and packaging materials' products; pursuing strategic investment opportunities; restructuring its traditional publishing ink business (including closing plants); and creating new areas of business (such as as materials for printed electronics, gas-barrier materials, health foods, and algae-derived oils).
