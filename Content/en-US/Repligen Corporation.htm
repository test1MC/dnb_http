   Repligen replies to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry by supplying bio-engineered drug ingredients. Repligen's bioprocessing business develops and commercializes proteins and other agents used in the production of biopharmaceuticals. The firm also conducts drug research activities include development of a pancreatic imaging agent and potential therapies for bipolar disorder, Friedreich's ataxia (a debilitating early adulthood disease), and spinal muscular atrophy. While all of Repligen's own drugs are in the clinical development stage, it does receive royalty payments from

   (BMS) on sales of BMS' Orencia rheumatoid arthritis drug, as well as by licensing out its technologies.

  <p>
   Repligen receives the majority of its revenues from its bioprocessing business, which primarily sells Protein A, a recombinant protein used in the production of monoclonal antibodies and other biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Its primary customer in this area is
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   , with which it has a multi-year supply agreement.

  <p>
   Repligen's headquarters are in Massachusetts; it also has manufacturing facilities there and in Sweden.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for about 50% of revenue with Sweden and the UK contributing 35% and 10%, respectively.

  <p>
   Repligen uses its own direct sales force and partners including GE Healthcare, EMD Millipore, and Sigma Aldrich to sell its products to life sciences and biopharma companies.

  <p>
   The company has seen years of revenue growth, including a huge 128% spike in 2012, that continued into 2013 when Repligen reported a 9% increase, from $62 million to $68 million. Royalties and payments related to settling a legal matter contributed to the growth. Increased manufacturing efficiency and a good product mix, particularly in Sweden, helped the company post a 14% improvement in net income. Cash from operations also trended up with a $12.5 million increase due to deferred tax expenses, royalties, and long-term liabilities.

  <p>
   Repligen is developing RG1068, a synthetic human hormone designed to detect abnormalities in pancreatic duct function as part of a process to diagnose pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it sold its histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) portfolio to BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $2 million plus potential future payments if the drug is developed. HDI are currently used to treat depression and other psychological conditions but they are also being investigated to treat cancers, parasites, and inflammatory diseases.

  <p>
   In 2014 Repligen paid $24.5 million for Refine Technology to strengthen its bioprocessing business and expand its direct sales force. Two years later, it bought German manufacturer Atoll, which makes MediaScout pre-packed chromatography columns used in the clinical manufacturing of biologic drugs. The deal was valued at $22.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2016, the company acquired TangenX Technology Corporation from Novasep for $39 million. TangenX develops and markets tangential flow filtration (TFF) technologies, including the single-use Sius, which are used in the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals.
