   The company groups its products into two segments: video processing and cable edge. Video, which includes video processing and production products, accounts for 75% of revenue. The other 25% comes from cable edge products, which allow cable operators to deliver on-demand and data services.

   Harmonic sells its products through its direct sales force, and through independent distributors and integrators. Customers include cable television, direct broadcast satellite system companies, telecommunications firms, and broadcasters and media companies in the US and abroad. Revenue from Harmonic's largest customer,
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   , accounted for 16% of 2014 sales. Consolidation of ownership among cable TV and direct broadcast satellite system companies is shrinking Harmonic's customer base.

  <p>
   Harmonic posted it third straight year of sales declines in 2014 as they dropped 14% to $433.5 million. The company attributed the decline to customers holding off on video purchases in anticipation of new technologies hitting the market. Sales in the cable edge unit rose, aided by the late 2013 release of the company's NSG Pro CCAP products. which transmit digital signals.

   A big tax hit, on the top of lower revenue, helped knock Harmonic from a 2013 profit of $37 million to a net loss of $46 million in 2014. The company had a higher provision for income tax because of an increase in valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. Cash flow from operations dropped to $47 million in 2014 from $53.7 million in 2013.

   The company's development strategy is to stay one step ahead by identifying new features, products and systems that its customers want. It started selling VOS in late 2013. It's a software-based platform on which a range of video-related activities can be done. It runs on common datacenter hardware, providing users with lower cost and flexibility. Harmonic followed in 2014 with its Spectrum X media server system that uses the software-based platform for production and playout applications.
