   With Olympus products, you can take pictures of people or look inside of them. Although best known for its cameras, the company is a world leader in endoscopes and other medical equipment. Its medical systems group also designs and manufactures other endosurgery and ultrasound equipment. Olympus is neck-and-neck with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   as the #1 maker worldwide of digital cameras. Other imaging system products include binoculars, optical components, and digital audio recorders. The company's life science group makes medical microscopes and associated image capturers while its industrial unit handles non-medical microscopes, chemical analyzers, and industrial videoscopes. Olympus started in 1919 as Takachiho Seisakusho.

  <p>
   The company and its more than 130 subsidiaries and affiliates primarily manufacture and sell medical systems products (gastrointestinal endoscopes, surgical endoscopes, endo-therapy devices, etc.), scientific solutions products (biological microscopes, industrial microscopes, industrial endoscopes, non-destructive testing equipment, etc.), imaging systems (digital cameras, voice recorders, etc.), and other lines (biomedical materials, etc.). Its four reportable segments follow suit: Medical Systems Business, Scientific Solutions Business, Imaging Systems Business, and Other. The Medical Systems Business accounts for nearly 70% of all sales, while Scientific Solutions Business accounts for about 15%. Imaging Systems Business makes up most of the remainder.

   Headquartered in Japan, Olympus operates in North America (US and Canada), Europe (primarily the UK, Germany, and France), Asia (primarily Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Australia), Africa, and Central and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   North America accounts for about 30% of sales, followed by Europe (about 25%), Japan (another 25%), and Asia (nearly 20%)

  <p>
   Revenues have fluctuated for Olympus over the past five years. In fiscal 2014 revenue fell 4% to 짜713 billion as the company divested its Information and Communication segment. Declines in the imaging segment in the face of the shrinking compact camera market also led to the lower revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the dip in revenue, net income rose 70% to 짜13.6 billion, primarily due to investment earnings and an absence of loss on business restructuring. Cash flow from operations rose 187% to 짜72.4 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   The group counts on growing sales of its medical products, primarily its flagship gastrointestinal endoscopes and surgical devices (which it sees as the next big hope). Olympus looks to continue building upon its endoscopic tool assortment; the field has gained popularity because of minimally invasive procedures. It is also focused on adding new products to its scientific solutions lines, including laser-scanning microscopes and industrial videoscopes. In the waning imaging systems segment, Olympus has expanded its lineup of mirrorless cameras while working to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been investing in its sales force to boost business; It announced plans to grow its sales team by 1,000 during fiscal 2015. Olympus also works to discover methods to cut manufacturing costs. In fiscal 2014, R&amp;D costs totaled 짜66,796 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recently launched products include new gastrointestinal endoscopes (2013), the STYLUS SH-1 compact camera with zoom lens, a new lens kit, a double zoom kit (2014), and a fisheye pro lens (2015).
