   That spring in your step after a good night's sleep may be there courtesy of Leggett &amp; Platt (L&amp;P) -- the pioneer of steel coil bedsprings. Using primarily aluminum and steel, the company makes residential furnishings (innersprings, bed frames, furniture, and carpet), industrial materials (wire, steel tubing), and specialized items (automotive seating, quilting machinery, and docking stations for electronic devices). It also makes commercial fixtures (shelves and work furniture). Customers include furniture retailers, telecommunications firms, and makers of automobiles, construction products, bedding, and lawn gear. L&amp;P operates about 130 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   L&amp;P is an international diversified manufacturer comprised of nearly 20 business units that designs and makes a wide variety of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, and automobiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Residential furnishings (bedding, furniture, carpet underlay) accounted for more than 50% of its sales during 2015, while specialized products (for automobiles and commercial vehicles such as control cables, seating components) made up another nearly 25%. The rest came from commercial products such as work furniture and consumer products (almost 15% of sales) and industrial materials product sales (such as steel-rod wiring and steel tubing). In late 2014 the company sold most of its Store Fixtures business to
   <company id="103516">
    Lozier Corp
   </company>
   . for about $62 million.
  </p>

  <p>
   Missouri-based L&amp;P rang up nearly 70% of its sales in the US in 2015, while the rest came from Europe (10%), China (10%), Canada (5%) and Mexico (3%). Of L&amp;P's 130 manufacturing sites in 18 countries, 81 are located in the US while the others are in 18 foreign countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   L&amp;P's Residential Furnishing customers include finished bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers; retailers and distributors of adjustable and ornamental beds, bed frames, and carpet underlay; and contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies that use geo components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its specialized products are sold to automobile seating manufacturers, bedding manufacturers, various Leggett operations dealing with spring forming equipment, and telecommunications, cable, home service and delivery companies. The company's Commercial Products segment customers include office, institutional, mattress, and commercial furniture manufacturers and retailers. L&amp;P's Industrial Materials segment customers include many of the same customers as its Residential Furnishings and Specialized Product segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $31.5 million on sales promotions during 2015, up from $30.7 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   L&amp;P's sales have risen slowly and steadily over the past few years as the global economy continues to strengthen. While L&amp;P's sales have rebounded  more than 25% since 2009, they are still well below record highs of $5.5 billion attained in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales rose 4% to $3.92 billion during 2015 with growth across most product groups and geographic regions. Most of the top line growth was driven by 5% growth in Residential Furnishing product sales (including its ComfortCore pocketed coil innerspring product in the US), thanks to higher sales volumes and its acquisition of
   <company id="121501">
    Tempur Sealy
   </company>
   's three innerspring component production facilities. Its commercial product sales also improved 14% with higher demand for adjustable and fashion beds. Geographically, sales in Mexico, the US, and China grew by 30%, 4%, and 1%, respectively. Sales in Europe declined 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue growth in 2015 combined with gains from business dispositions caused L&amp;P's net income to triple to $325.1 million. The furniture maker's operating cash levels dipped 6% to $359 million despite earnings growth as it paid $82 million in foam litigation payments.
  </p>

  <p>
   Beyond fostering organic growth through product development, L&amp;P continues to acquire specialized furniture manufacturers to enter new higher-growth markets. In mid-2014, for example, the company bought
   <company id="121501">
    Tempur Sealy International
   </company>
   's three US innerspring component production facilities for $48 million, which extended the two companies' supply relationship so L&amp;P would become the exclusive long-term supplier in the US and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to streamline operations and boost profits, L&amp;P has also been narrowing its focus to sectors where it can be a market leader and achieve cost savings. To this end, in 2015 the company sold its steel tubing business unit for $25 million and sold the rest of its underperforming Store Fixtures business, which made custom-designed and standardized shelving, racks, and other products for large retailers, grocery stores, and discount chains. That year it also sold a small portion of its commercial vehicle products business.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, the company expanded its work furniture business globally after buying a 70% stake in European private-label manufacturer Trio Line Polska, which specialized in high-end upholstered office and commercial furniture, for $23 million. It planned to purchased the remaining stake in the furniture maker over the following five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 L&amp;P acquired four companies for a combined purchase price of about $28 million. The company expanded its Aerospace Products business with the purchase of two European companies that added small diameter, high pressure seamless tubing to its product portfolio and extended its capability in aerospace tube fabrication. L&amp;P also acquired Germany-based Kintec Solution -- a designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components -- which became part of L&amp;P's Furniture Hardware business for a purchase price of $16.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2012, L&amp;P bought out Western Pneumatic Tube (Western), a provider of aircraft parts, from private equity firm Tinicum Capital Partners for $188 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   L&amp;P's profit-centered strategy, launched in 2007, departed from its traditional growth through acquisition model, which resulted in the purchase of more than 100 companies since 1996. From 2007 onward, L&amp;P had reduced combined annual spending for acquisitions and capital expenditures by more than 70%. Indeed, up until early 2012, the company had not made a significant acquisition.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Carthage, Missouri, resident J. P. Leggett, an inventor with several patents, took his coiled bedspring to his businessman/manufacturer brother-in-law, C. B. Platt, in 1883. The two formed a partnership and began selling bedsprings (patented in 1885) to retailers that incorporated them into their mattresses (previous mattresses were made of cotton, horsehair, or feathers). They had two plants when they incorporated as Leggett &amp; Platt Spring Bed &amp; Manufacturing in 1901.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leggett was president until 1921, when Platt took over. Leggett's son got the nod in 1929, and though he headed the company for only three years, he initiated the production of both innerspring mattress springs (the original coiled spring had been the company's sole product) and coiled springs for upholstered furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   By this time L&amp;P was selling to manufacturers rather than retailers, and sales and profits took off along with the innerspring market, though the conservative company didn't open another plant until 1942. Another plant opening in 1947 was its last expansion until 1960. That year CEO Harry Cornell (grandson of J. P. Leggett), who joined the company in 1950, took the reins. By then L&amp;P had three plants and nearly $10 million in annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornell envisioned the company as a national low-cost supplier of furnishings components. He acquired a woodworking plant in 1960, giving the firm the ability to make wooden bed frames. Acquisitions steadily increased the company's range of products and its geographic scope, and by the early 1970s (the company went public in 1967) L&amp;P had nearly 20 plants and annual sales of around $50 million. The increasing size of the company, along with vertical integration (it began making its own wire in 1970), gave it economies of scale and cost advantages in the fragmented industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 bedding components accounted for about 70% of sales; just four years later -- as L&amp;P focused on finished furniture and furniture components -- they accounted for about 45%. The company also made investments in new plants, equipment, and products. By 1980 it had about 60 plants and sales of more than $250 million. L&amp;P introduced its continuous coil innerspring -- which contributed to the company's good performance in an otherwise slumping industry -- around the middle of the decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   The recession at the beginning of the 1990s hurt the company's sales, but L&amp;P bounced back with the economy and had more than $1 billion in sales in 1992. The next year the company added to its 135 plants with the acquisitions of Hanes Holding Company and VWR Textiles &amp; Supplies (bedding and furniture fabrics).
  </p>
  <p>
   About 75% of the company's 1995 sales increase resulted from acquisitions. The following year L&amp;P acquired almost 15 companies, including Pace Holdings (aluminum die-cast components). Cornell's nearly 50-year-old strategy continued through 1998 as the company purchased more than 40 businesses (about 30 furnishings-related) with aggregate annual sales of about $560 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   President Felix Wright added CEO to his duties in 1999, and Cornell remained chairman. Throughout 1999 L&amp;P bought 29 companies with a combined revenue of about $480 million. In 2000 the company kept up its buying habit, purchasing about 20 companies. By 2001, however, the firm began to reverse that trend, closing or selling off facilities it deemed unprofitable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, as sales improved, L&amp;P bought the assets of Ikex; the membership interests of Jarex Distribution, a Jiajiang, China, furniture mechanism facility; Toronto-based Westex International; and Mississippi's Everwood Products. It also purchased a Shanghai, China, fixtures facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   L&amp;P's acquisition of
   <company id="111707">
    America's Body Company
   </company>
   (ABC) in late 2005 gave the company a leg up in the commercial truck equipment segment of the industry and spurred the firm to restructure its operations. ABC designs, makes, and markets bodies for vans, flatbed trucks, utility work vehicles, and dump trucks, as well as interiors for vans and equipment for snow and ice control. L&amp;P folded the equipment maker into its existing van interiors operations to form its commercial vehicle products segment, which is estimated to generate some $250 million in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornell became chairman emeritus in 2006, when Wright resigned as CEO and took the title of chairman. President David Haffner became CEO as part of the succession. Since then the company has slowed its acquisitive pace. After making a dozen acquisitions in 2005 and a handful in 2006, L&amp;P made only three purchases in 2007: an office furniture component manufacturing business in China, a coated wire products producer, and a designer and assembler of docking stations for computer components in vehicles. It sold its prime foam division in early 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 L&amp;P sold five businesses with combined annual sales of about $780 million. The largest divestiture was the Aluminum Products segment. Also sold were Wood Products; Fibers; Plastics; and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products. Wright retired as chairman in 2008; he was succeeded by Richard Fisher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Coated Fabrics unit in 2009, followed by its Storage Products business unit in 2010.
