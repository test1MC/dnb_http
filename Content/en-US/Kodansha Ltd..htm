   The largest publishing firm in Japan, Kodansha has issued everything from
   <em>
    manga
   </em>
   (the comic books that have captured the attention of millions in Japan and elsewhere) to magazines to the works of Nobel laureates. Among its
   <em>
    manga
   </em>
   titles are
   <em>
    Blade of the Immortal
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Oh! My Goddess!
   </em>
   Kodansha's magazine catalog includes such titles as
   <em>
    Hair and Beauty
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Hot Dog Press
   </em>
   . The company's book publishing operations produce paperbacks, trade non-fiction, fiction, reference works, and children's books. The late Seiji Noma founded Kodansha in 1909, and his family (including president and CEO Sawako Noma, Seiji Noma's granddaughter) own and operate it.

  <p>
   Seiji Noma's love for speech and debate led him into the field of publishing. As an administrator at Tokyo University's law school, Noma established a debating society and began looking for a way to publish the speeches of the school's students and faculty. With Dai Nippon Printing, in 1909 Noma established Dai Nippon Yuben Kai and began publishing his first magazine,
   <i>
    Yuben
   </i>
   (Japanese for oratory).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dai Nippon Printing soon transferred the rights to Dai Nippon Yuben Kai and
   <i>
    Yuben
   </i>
   to Noma. To issue his second magazine,
   <i>
    Kodan Kurabu
   </i>
   (later
   <i>
    Kodansha,
   </i>
   named after Japanese kodan or sagas), Noma set up a second company, Kodansha, in 1911. Kodansha continued expanding its collection of magazines, persevering through recession and earthquakes. In 1925 Noma merged Dai Nippon Yuben Kai and Kodansha into a single company -- Dai Nippon Yuben Kai Kodansha (DNYKK).
  </p>
  <p>
   Seiji Noma died in 1938. In 1941 Seiji Noma's son-in-law Shoichi Noma (who had taken the Noma family name) began overseeing the company's operations. DNYKK had branched into book publishing before WWII, but the war would alter the company's operations dramatically. Pressured to choose between closing its doors or cooperating with the government's control of the press, DNYKK chose the latter course, and after the war the company's reputation would suffer because of it. Shoichi Noma and most of the company's management were labeled collaborators and forced to resign.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1949 the resilient Shoichi Noma returned to lead the company, which by then had shortened its name to Kodansha. He set about reviving the company, and his knack for issuing successful magazines like
   <i>
    Gunzo
   </i>
   and his foresight in involving Kodansha in mass book publication helped Kodansha resume its leadership role in Japanese publishing. The company secured its lead in the comic book market in 1959 when it began publishing
   <i>
    Weekly Shonen.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Sensing that US readers would be interested in reading the works of Japanese writers, in 1963 Shoichi Noma established a US subsidiary. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the company raised its profile internationally by setting up a number of scholarships and literary prizes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Shoichi Noma retired, and his son, Koremichi Noma, began overseeing Kodansha. Two years later the company published an encyclopedia about Japan written in English. Kodansha soon expanded into videos and computer software, and it also teamed with other Japanese publishers to establish a translation venture to export Japanese books in different languages.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Koremichi Noma's death in 1987, Sawako Noma, Koremichi Noma's widow, became CEO. During the 1990s Kodansha rode the wave of the
   <em>
    manga
   </em>
   (Japanese comic book) craze and became a leader in the genre. In 1998 the company entered into an electronic book distribution joint venture, followed by an online bookselling joint venture in 1999. Kodansha inched into broadcasting in 2000 by taking a 5% stake in Japanese digital broadcasting firm C-TBS.

  <p>
   In 2002 the company struck a deal with
   <company id="100896">
    Corus Entertainment
   </company>
   to develop children's programming.
