   Kingston Technology cuts a regal figure in the realm of memory. The company is one of the top makers of memory modules -- printed circuit boards loaded with DRAM or other memory chips that increase the capacity and speed of printers and computers. Kingston also makes flash memory cards used in portable electronic devices, such as digital cameras, MP3 players, and wireless phones. Kingston takes on some manufacturing chores for customers through a specialized factory in China that tests and packages memory chips before assembling them into customized memory modules.

  <p>
   Kingston has manufacturing operations in China, Taiwan, and the US. It has additional offices in Australia, France, Germany, India, New Zealand, the UK, and Vietnam. To address growing demand in Europe and the Middle East, the company added a turnkey logistics hub in Dublin, Ireland, and established its Asian headquarters in Taiwan.

   Kingston caters to an international network of distributors such as Hammer, Simms, and Entatech; resellers; and retailers such as

   , ebuyers, and Mymemory. OEM customers and business users include Equanet and Insight. The company also provides contract manufacturing and supply chain management services for semiconductor manufacturers and system OEMs.

   The memory device market is notoriously volatile, with swings in prices, global supply, and demand. The company has benefited from strong demand from business customers and consumers, as well as its line of SSDs. Trends such as virtualization and cloud computing are driving the switch to SSDs, which tend to be faster and more energy efficient, durable, and reliable than traditional hard disk drives. In a bid for a piece of cloud gaming action, Kingston's HyperX division released a cloud gaming headset in 2014 and plans to follow with another version in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kingston also restructures its distribution network in order to grow in Asia. In an effort to increase market share in Vietnam, in 2013 Kingston appointed two new distributors: Minh Thong Informatic (MTC) and Vinh Xuan Computer (SPC). MTC works with Kingston and covers assigned territory from Da Nang to the South market, while SPC distributes full-line Kingston Memory Products from Hue to the north market in Vietnam.

  <p>
   Kingston Technology was founded in 1987 by Shanghai-born John Tu and Taiwan-born David Sun, both of whom had moved to California in the 1970s. The pair met in 1982 and started a memory upgrade company called Camminton Technology in Tu's garage. Sales reached $9 million by 1986, when they sold the business to high-tech firm AST Research for $6 million. The two invested their money in stock market futures but suffered heavy losses when the market crashed in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year PC makers were producing computers that lacked the memory needed to run the latest, hottest software, so Tu and Sun sprang into action. With just $4,000 in cash, they started another company that converted inexpensive, outdated chips into memory upgrades. Tu, who was educated in Europe, wanted to call the company Kensington after the gardens in London. A mouse pad company had that name, so Kingston was chosen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tu had doubts about the new company and bet Sun a

   that it wouldn't survive the first year of operations. Sun won the car (which he later gave to a veteran employee who dreamed of owning one) and within two years the company sold nearly $40 million worth of products. In 1989 Kingston began making memory system upgrades; a year later it started producing processor upgrades.

   The company was #1 on

   magazine's list of fastest-growing private US companies in 1992. The next year Kingston began marketing networking and storage products. Its vendor-friendly policy paid off that year, when demand for semiconductors far outstripped supply. Suppliers kept shipping to the company even when orders for other buyers were delayed.

   In 1996

    SOFTBANK

   paid $1.5 billion for 80% of the company but promised to preserve its culture and retain all management -- including Tu and Sun -- and employees. Sun and Tu set aside $100 million for employee bonuses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Kingston opened its first foreign manufacturing facilities, in Ireland and Taiwan. Also in 1998, in a unique arrangement suggesting that SOFTBANK overpaid when it bought Kingston, Tu and Sun agreed to forgo SOFTBANK's final $333 million payment. The following year Tu and Sun bought back SOFTBANK's stake for about $450 million. Also in 1999 the company opened a manufacturing plant in Malaysia.
