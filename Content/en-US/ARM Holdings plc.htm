   ARM Holdings develops and licenses microprocessors based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC) -- a chip architecture that allows several tasks to be processed simultaneously. More than 425 chip makers, including
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   license ARM's intellectual-property designs to make their own processors for use in such products as digital TVs, handheld computers, mobile phones, and set-top boxes. ARM also provides related application and development software, as well as complementary services. Japanese tech firm
   <company id="42482">
    Softbank
   </company>
   acquired ARM in 2016 in a £24.3 billion deal.

  <p>
   ARM's technology is included in 85% of the overall smart phone market, 80% of digital cameras, and 32% of all electronic devices. Royalties are ARM's biggest source of revenue, representing more than 50% of net sales. The company depends on its semiconductor partners to make and market microprocessors based on ARM designs and, in some cases, to add value to the ARM MPU architecture to meet the specific applications of systems companies. Those royalties are based on the prices and sales volume of MPUs based on ARM designs. Its royalty stream reflects the condition of the semiconductor market in general.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARM operates through three divisions: Royalties (53% of revenues), Licensing (40%), and Software and Tools and Services (8%).

  <p>
   ARM has a global presence, including offices in France, India, Sweden, Taiwan, and the US. The company's single biggest market is the US, which accounts for 38% of revenue. China, South Korea, and Taiwan collectively account for 44%.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue for ARM rose about 22% in 2015 from 2014 with processor royalties leading the way with a 42% increase year-to-year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits also surged 27% for the year.

  <p>
   ARM succeeded in making its designs an industry standard by remaining platform-agnostic in working with a wide variety of hardware and software customers. It will create chip designs to work with any platform, regardless of how its various customers may compete with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the mobile phone market matures, ARM believes there are more sales to be had in more advanced features for the phones. It is working to develop chips that accelerate the creation and adoption of new smartphone technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARM also is developing products for the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient networking, servers, and security applications. The mbed Device Server would manage the large number of devices gathered in IoT networks. ARM has established partnerships with IoT and data analytics companies such as

  <p>
   In 2015 ARM bolstered its security technologies with the acquisition of Israel-based Sansa Security, a provider of hardware security IP and software for advanced system-on-chip components deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015 ARM added more Bluetooth assets when it acquired Wicentric, a Bluetooth Smart stack and profile provider, and Sunrise Micro Devices, a provider of sub-one volt Bluetooth radio intellectual property.

   UK-based Acorn Computer Group, founded in 1978 by
   <company id="133474">
    Cambridge University
   </company>
   physicist Hermann Hauser, developed the first commercial reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processor in 1985. Acorn worked with
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   on RISC technology, and in 1990 Styletheme Ltd. -- the result of the Acorn-Apple collaboration -- was spun off. That year VLSI Technology became a company investor and its first licensee. Also in 1990 Styletheme changed its name to Advanced RISC Machines (ARM).
  </p>
  <p>
   ARM debuted its first embedded chip core in 1991. That year Robin Saxby, a former executive at European Silicon Structures, became ARM's president and CEO. ARM opened its first foreign offices in 1994, in the US and Japan. In 1995 the company introduced its StrongARM core and software development toolkit. The high-performance StrongARM microprocessor was developed with
   <company id="10462">
    Digital Equipment
   </company>
   and licensed to
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   after Intel acquired Digital's semiconductor operations. ARM introduced a digital signal processor architecture in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="104903">
    IBM
   </company>
   licensed ARM technology in 1998. That year the company went public as ARM Holdings. In 1999 the company acquired Micrologic Solutions, a provider of consulting services for software and hardware development. The following year, ARM acquired Infinite Designs, a system-on-a-chip design firm, and French RISC designer EuroMIPS Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 COO Warren East succeeded Saxby as CEO; Saxby remained chairman. The company acquired Adelante Technologies Belgium, a maker of chip design tools that was formerly owned primarily by
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   , in 2003. The following year, ARM bought chip designer
   <company id="55344">
    Artisan Components
   </company>
   ; the deal raised some eyebrows in the market because ARM paid more than $900 million for Artisan, a price seen by some as far too high. Artisan Components became the Physical IP business of ARM after the 2004 acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding into the market for microcontrollers, ARM acquired Keil Elektronik and Keil Software for a total of £9 million in 2005. Microcontrollers are similar to microprocessors; they are usually at the heart of simpler electronic products, such as microwave ovens and computer printers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired
   <company id="131173">
    SOISIC
   </company>
   , a developer of semiconductor intellectual property incorporating silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, which helps chips run faster and with less energy consumption. ARM also signed a joint development agreement with
   <company id="106489">
    Soitec
   </company>
   , a supplier of SOI wafers that collaborated with SOISIC and was an investor in the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sir Robin Saxby (knighted in 2002 for his contributions to the UK high-tech industry) retired from the board in 2006, becoming chairman emeritus. He was succeeded as chairman by Doug Dunn, former CEO of
   <company id="47993">
    ASM Lithography
   </company>
   and a board member since 1998.
