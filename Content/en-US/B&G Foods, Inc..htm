   Peter Piper picks more than a peck of peppers from B&amp;G Foods. The company makes, markets, and distributes jalape√±os, beans, maple syrup, fruit spreads, and other shelf-stable foods and household goods. B&amp;G's products are sold under brand names, many of which are regional or national best-sellers, including B&amp;G and Trappey (beans), Green Giant (frozen and canned foods), Ac'cent (meat flavoring), Spice Islands (seasonings), Ortega (Mexican condiments), Grandma's and Brer Rabbit (molasses), and Underwood (meat spread). They're sold through B&amp;G's subsidiaries to supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, and drug store chains, as well as institutional and food service operators in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

   B&amp;G Foods serves a single industry segment. The company balances its branded-product retail sales business with sales to institutions and food service customers, as well as making products under private labels for others. Many of its branded items boast leading regional or national market shares.
  </p>
  <p>
   The food company operates three distribution centers located in Texas, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. It has seven manufacturing and warehouse locations in Maryland, Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, New Jersey, and North Carolina. B&amp;G Foods stores products in facilities in Quebec and Maryland and houses its major sales offices in Arkansas and Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company distributes certain brands -- such as Cream of Wheat, Ac'cent, Underwood, Polaner, Static Guard, Mrs. Dash, New York Style, and Sugar Twin -- to similar food channels in Canada.

  <p>
   B&amp;G Foods has a unique sales strategy for each of its brands. To this end, the food company allocates brand-specific promotional spending. Its regional sales managers coordinate promotions with customers. The company's marketing department partners with the sales department to coordinate special account activities and marketing support the likes of public relations, media advertising, and couponing. Marketing executives typically use the radio, Internet, social media, and limited television advertising. B&amp;G Foods spent about $5.9 million in advertising in fiscal 2012 as compared to $4.3 million in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 120-year-old company sells, markets, and distributes its products through a multichannel system. It serves all major US food channels, selling and shipping to mass merchants, supermarkets, warehouse clubs, food service distributors and direct accounts, specialty food distributors, military commissaries, and non-food outlets the likes of drug store chains and dollar stores. To better serve
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , which accounts for nearly 20% of sales, B&amp;G Foods operates a sales office in Wal-Mart's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products primarily through broker sales networks to supermarket chains, mass merchants, food service outlets, warehouse clubs, non-food outlets, and specialty distributors. This network, incidentally, handles B&amp;G Foods' sales at the retail level. Regional sales managers sell its food items nationwide through national and regional brokers, with separate organizations concentrating on food service, grocery chain accounts, and special markets.

  <p>
   The company has seen its net sales rise during the past five years. Due to several recent acquisitions, B&amp;G Foods logged its highest net sales in 2012. Sales price increases and acquiring Culver Specialty Brands and the New York Style and Old London brands all contributed a 17% boost in net sales in fiscal 2012. B&amp;G Foods' net income rose 18% for the same reporting period, thanks to a jump in net sales partially offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. These expenses rose mainly due to increases in consumer marketing, selling, and warehousing expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2012, B&amp;G Foods logged cost increases (net of cost savings) for raw materials of less than 2% of the cost of goods sold, which were more than offset by rising sales prices. B&amp;G Foods anticipates cost decreases for raw materials in the marketplace during 2013. Through 2013, it's currently locked into supply and prices for a majority of its most significant commodities (excluding maple syrup, among others) at a cost decrease of $1 million.

  <p>
   The company's growth strategy involves four initiatives. It's working to expand its brand portfolio by purchasing complementary branded businesses. B&amp;G is focused on quickly developing and taking new products to market, as well. It works to leverage its multiple sales channels and distribution system and continues to focus in higher-growth customers and distribution channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its ailing seasonings business, B&amp;G in 2012 partnered with Crock-Pot maker
   <company id="16009">
    Jarden Corporation
   </company>
   to rollout a line of Crock-Pot Seasoning Mixes. Working through unit Jarden Consumer Solutions (JCS), B&amp;G has plans to expand the line, which initially includes single-serve packets named Hearty Beef Stew, Savory Pot Roast, and BBQ Pulled Pork.

  <p>
   The food manufacturer has acquired and integrated more than 25 brands into its company since 1996. In recent years B&amp;G Foods has focused on acquiring companies that serve the snack foods sector. Besides buying the New York Style, Old London, JJ Flats, and Devonsheer brands, the company has purchased the TrueNorth nut cluster brand from DeMet's Candy Company. Varieties include Almond Pecan Crunch, Chocolate Nut Crunch, and Cashew Crunch. It also acquired Robert's American Gourmet Food, LLC, which does business as Pirate Brands. The gourmet food company is known for its Pirate's Booty, Smart Puffs, and Original Tings. The company funded the acquisition -- at the tune of $195 million in cash -- using proceeds from a recently completed senior notes offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In line with its growth goals, in 2016 the company acquired
   <company id="109702">
    ACH Food Companies'
   </company>
   spice and seasonings business for $365 million in cash. Through the deal, the company added Spice Islands, Tone's, Durkee and Weber brands to its product line up. The acquisition significantly expands the company's existing flavor enhancing products, which include Ms. Dash, Ac'cent, and Emeril's seasonings.
  </p>
  <p>
   B&amp;G in mid-2015 bought the Green Giant and Le Sueuer frozen and canned vegetables brands from
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   for about $765 million. Green Giant became the company's largest product line and boost its revenue to about $1.4 billion. The deal fulfilled B&amp;G's long-term goal of moving into the frozen foods business.
