   The company operates as one of the segment of parent company
   <company id="133327">
    The Real Good Food Company
   </company>
   , and contributed 20% of total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 that company's net revenue increased by 9%, mainly due to increase in sales from territories of Europe (via Real Good Food Europe), the US, and Australia.

  <p>
   In 2004 Napier Brown acquired
   <company id="134210">
    James Budgett Sugars
   </company>
   and baking-ingredients company Renshaw Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
   Napier Brown itself was acquired by Real Good Food (a UK maker of chilled and frozen food products) in 2005 for some Â£67 million (about $87 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has suffered from the rising costs of fuel and raw materials. In a cost cutting measure, in 2009 the company combined its sugar (Napier Brown) and bakery ingredients operations (Renshaw) under the name Renshawnapier.
