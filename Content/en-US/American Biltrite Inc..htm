   American Biltrite (ABI), which makes and distributes commercial flooring and industrial rubber, has its hand in several different pots, some of which are sticky. Its Tape division makes adhesive-coated, pressure-sensitive tapes and films used to protect materials during handling and storage, as well as for applications in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, automotive, and electrical industries. ABI also designs and distributes wholesale jewelry and accessories to stores through its K&amp;M subsidiary, while its AB Canada subsidiary makes floor tile and rubber products. The founding Marcus family controls ABI.

  <p>
   Miah Marcus and Frank Bernstein set up the Ewell Rubber Co. in 1908 to make rubber heels and soles for the shoe-repair industry. In 1917 the firm revamped its Trenton plant to make rubber flooring (and later vinyl flooring). After WWII Ewell Rubber expanded rapidly. It adopted the American Biltrite Inc. (ABI) name in 1951 and went public in 1959. As part of an expansion program, ABI bought National Shoe Products Corp. (1960), Bonafide Mills (vinyl products, 1962), Noxon Mills (carpets, 1967), and Canada-based Consolidated Carpet (1968).
  </p>
  <p>
   After struggling financially in the 1970s, the Marcus and Bernstein families agreed to split up the company in 1982. The Bernsteins took Biltrite (US footwear) and the Marcuses kept the remaining ABI portfolio. Both entities went public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABI quickly added to its mix, acquiring a stake in jewelry supplier K&amp;M Associates in 1983 and pressure-sensitive tape maker Ideal Tape Co. in 1985. As part of its expansion strategy, ABI sold its Amtico division (floor tiles) to
   <company id="42832">
    Congoleum
   </company>
   in exchange for a 40% stake in Congoleum (1993) and acquired control of K&amp;M (1995). Strong competition in the tile market dragged down Congoleum's sales in 1997 and resulted in flat revenues for that year. Despite US economical strength, ABI's sales remained fairly flat in 1998 and 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 ABI increased its stake in Congoleum to 55%. To strengthen its floor holdings even more, the company also acquired Canada-based Janus Flooring, a maker of hardwood flooring, in late 2000, although it discontinued the Janus operations in 2003. In 2001 ABI had increased its control of K&amp;M to 95%. K&amp;M acquired certain inventories and receivables of
   <company id="46267">
    Swank's
   </company>
   ladies jewelry division and entered into licensing agreements with
   <company id="41002">
    Guess?
   </company>
   and Anne Klein.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2002 ABI held a controlling interest of roughly 70% in Congoleum. In 2003 Congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection after being hit by asbestos claims. In January 2004 Congoleum filed a pre-packaged plan of reorganization that would leave non-asbestos creditors unimpaired and also resolve all pending and future asbestos claims against the company. The plan has been amended around a dozen times and has yet to be confirmed before the court.
  </p>
  <p>
   Congoleum suffered several setbacks in 2006, including an explosion at one of its plants and lingering supply problems stemming from the 2005 hurricane season. That year the courts approved a settlement with insurance provider Century Indemnity that increases the amount of money set aside for victims to about $207 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rubber and tape aside, the stickiest situation for ABI has been the beleaguered Congoleum's bankruptcy. In 2009 the US District Court of New Jersey assumed authority over Congoleum's Chapter 11 case. Negotiations ensued in 2010, and the involved parties revised the plan of reorganization, settling on a $100 million settlement with nine insurance groups. As a result of the reorganization, ABI's 55% ownership in Congoleum was eliminated, but ABI continued to provide management services until 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut administrative costs ABI took itself private in 2012.
