   Ralph Lauren Corporation is galloping at a faster clip than when its namesake founder first entered the arena over 45 years ago. With golden mallet brands such as Polo by Ralph Lauren, Chaps, RRL, Club Monaco, and RLX Ralph Lauren, the company designs and markets apparel and accessories, home furnishings, and fragrances. Its collections are available at more than 13,500 retail locations worldwide, including many upscale and mid-tier department stores (
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   contributes 25% to RL's wholesale revenue). It operates 490-plus Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail stores worldwide as well as 580-plus concession-based shops-within-shops and 10 e-commerce sites. American style icon and founder Lauren is stepping down as CEO.

        <p>
   As part of its business, Ralph Lauren operates through three segments: Retail, Wholesale, and Licensing.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's Retail segment, which generated more than 50% of total sales in fiscal 2016 (ended April 2, 2016), sells directly to consumers through more than 460 retail stores in North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America; through concession-based shop-within-shops located primarily in Asia and Europe; and via its retail e-commerce channel in North America, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Wholesale (45% of sales) sells Ralph Lauren products to major department stores and specialty shops throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
  </p>
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren's Licensing segment (2% of total sales) sells unrelated third parties the right to operate retail stores and to use its trademarks in connection with making and selling designated products, such as apparel, eyewear, and fragrances in specified geographical areas for specified periods.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   New York-based Ralph Lauren operates in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The Americas accounted for more than two-thirds of sales in FY2016, while Europe and Asia generated 21% and 12%, respectively.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren primarily wholesales menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, accessories, and home furnishings. Through a limited number of premier fashion retailers, the company peddles its collection brands worldwide. In North America, department stores are a major wholesale customer. In Latin America, wholesale products are sold in department stores and specialty stores. In Europe, Ralph Lauren wholesales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country. Also part of its sales efforts, Ralph Lauren distributes products to licensed stores operated by franchisees in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   Some 44% of its licensing revenue in FY2016 was earned from four licensing partners:
   <company id="104228">
    Hanesbrands
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica Group
   </company>
   , Peerless, and
   <company id="41772">
    L'Oreal
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren spent $280 million on advertising and promotions in fiscal 2016 (ended April), compared to $275 million and $256 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren Corp. (RLC) has enjoyed healthy revenue and profit growth over the past few years as it's continued to expand its retail business and international reach.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's sales dipped 3% to $$7.4 billion in fiscal 2016 (ended April) mostly as its wholesale sales in the Americas fell 6% with lower sales across all of its major apparel and accessories businesses due in part to a decline in foreign tourist traffic in major metro areas. Retail sales fell by less than 1% as comparable store sales fell by 3%, though e-commerce sales picked up. Licensing revenue increased by 4%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales declines combined with increased restructuring charges in FY2016 caused RLC's net income to slide 44% to $396 million. The company's operating cash levels climbed 13% to $1 billion thanks to favorable changes in working capital tied to accounts receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances driven by payment timing.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren reiterated its long-term strategy in 2016, pledging to expand into more international markets (especially in Europe and Asia); extend its retail business reach by opening more direct-to-customer stores and e-commerce; expand its accessories and other product and brand offerings; and invest more in its operational infrastructure to support a global reach.
  </p>
        <p>
   With its eye on cutting operational costs and realigning its business with its long-term growth strategy, the company in May 2015 began reorganizing its channel and regional structure to a more streamlined, integrated global brand-based structure. Expecting a total cost between $70 million and $100 million in restructuring charges, some of Ralph Lauren's cost-cutting priorities during the year included a by-region-and-brand store and shop-within-shop performance review; a targeted review of corporate functions; and a consolidation of certain luxury lines.
  </p>
        <p>
   Introducing its innovative new product lines in high profile events, Ralph Lauren has also been an official outfitter of the US Olympic and Paralympic teams, as well as the US Open events in recent years, counting on its associations to translate into millions of dollars in sales of event-branded apparel and accessories. In 2014, for example, the company unveiled its high-performance Polo Tech shirts on the opening day of the US Open, which featured sensors knitted in the product to read biological and physiological information. In 2014, RLC dressed the US Olympic team for the Winter Games in Sochi. Outfits for the US team for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are already in development. (The company also dresses the on-court officials at the US Open and Wimbledon tennis tournaments.)</p>

        <p>In late 2015 CEO Ralph Lauren announced he was leaving the executive suite and named Stefan Larsson, the former head of
   <company id="11469">
    Gap's
   </company>
   Old Navy, as his replacement. Lauren will continue his involvement with his namesake firm as the chairman and chief creative officer.
  </p>
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren began buying out its licensees several years ago. In 2011, the company acquired its South Korean wholesale and retail distribution operation from licensee
   <company id="152206">
    Doosan Corp.
   </company>
   for about $47 million. It bought out its licensing partner
   <company id="104953">
    Dickson Concepts
   </company>
   in a deal valued at about $37 million in 2009. Dickson was a licensee for the Polo brand in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Ralph Lauren also acquired the children's wear and golf apparel inventory of former licensee, Naigai Co. Ltd., based in Japan.
  </p>
        <p>
   To support other high-growth business opportunities and initiatives, Ralph Lauren in 2012 began to wind down its Rugby brand retail operations. As part of the closure plan, 13 of the company's 14 global freestanding Rugby stores and its related domestic e-commerce site, Rugby.com, were closed during fiscal 2013, and the one remaining Rugby store was shuttered during fiscal 2014.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Ralph Lauren, a suave Manhattanite, was actually born Ralph Lifschitz in the Bronx, New York. It is said that his father, Frank, an immigrant Russian housepainter and muralist, informally changed the family's name to Lauren and inspired his son to recreate himself in the image of a mythic upper class.
  </p>
        <p>
   After high school Ralph, who formally changed his name to Lauren, became a salesman at
   <company id="43893">
    Brooks Brothers
   </company>
   and then a sales representative for Rivetz, a Boston tie maker. In 1967 he landed a job as a tie designer for Beau Brummel of New York. The company gave him his own style division, which he named Polo because of the sport's refined image. The next year Lauren started Polo Fashions to make tailored menswear. Partner Peter Strom teamed up with Lauren in the early 1970s. Although its designs received critical acclaim, Polo Fashions had a bumpy start as Lauren adjusted to the business aspect of his fashion label.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lauren's profile rose in the 1970s when he won three Coty Awards for design and produced costumes for the movie
   <i>
    The Great Gatsby.
   </i>
   In 1971 Lauren adopted his polo-player-on-a-horse logo and introduced a line for women. That year the first licensed Polo store opened (on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills), along with his first in-store boutique (at Bloomingdale's in New York City). He added shoes to the lineup in 1972, licensed his womenswear line the next year, and launched a licensed fragrance line in 1978.
  </p>
        <p>
   By 1980 Polo Fashions had become Polo Ralph Lauren. Encouraged by the success of the licensed products, Lauren led the designer charge into home furnishings, introducing his Home Collection in 1983. He opened his flagship store in New York City three years later. The company expanded upmarket with its Purple Label and downmarket with Polo Jeans denims and a line of paints in 1996.
  </p>
        <p>
   Following the stampede of fashion-house IPOs, Polo went public in 1997. The next year, moving to reduce expenses, the company restructured its divisions. In 1999 Polo paid $85 million for hip Canadian retailer Club Monaco to compete in the burgeoning youth market. It also opened RL, a fine-dining restaurant adjacent to its retail outlet in Chicago's famed shopping district.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2000 Polo purchased its European licensee, Poloco, for $230 million, giving the company greater control of its brand. Then, in a 50-50 joint venture with NBC and its affiliates, Polo formed Ralph Lauren Media Company to sell its products via the Internet as well as broadcast, cable, and print media. Also that year the company closed 11 underperforming Club Monaco locations and announced plans to shut down all of its jeans stores. To extend its European reach even further, Polo bought its Italian licensee, PRL Fashions of Europe, in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   Polo Ralph Lauren inked one of the most significant licensing deals in company history -- and what it considers to be a great match, to boot -- in 2005. The firm paired with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) to form a four-year global partnership and was designated the official apparel sponsor of the US Open through 2008. The agreement involved, among other things, an official shirt designed by Lauren for on-court officials, co-branded US Open/Polo Ralph Lauren merchandise, and joint marketing programs. In 2006 the company entered a licensing agreement with
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica
   </company>
   valued at more than $1.75 billion over a 10-year period.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's agreement with the USTA gave it the momentum to seal a deal with
   <company id="107368">
    The All England Club
   </company>
   and Wimbledon in 2006 that extends through 2010. Polo Ralph Lauren, as part of the agreement, became the exclusive outfitter of Wimbledon -- the first official designer in the 129-history of the games. Polo Ralph Lauren creates and outfits on-court officials and sells its Wimbledon collection at its freestanding stores, as well as through select retailers and Polo.com.
  </p>
        <p>
   Initiatives for 2007 included the launch of a new group named Global Brand Concepts formed to develop lifestyle brands for specialty and department stores, including
   <company id="10810">
    J.C. Penney's
   </company>
   American Living Collection. The group designs and markets new products, including accessories, home decor, and women's, men's, and children's apparel.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year Polo Ralph Lauren purchased the remaining 50% stake in Polo.com from both Ralph Lauren Media, a unit of
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   , and ValueVisions Media for about $175 million. The move gave Polo full control over its plans to develop its online presence domestically and abroad.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company brought its East Coast lifestyle brand to Asia when it opened its first freestanding flagship store in Tokyo in 2006. The next year Polo Ralph Lauren secured a foothold in the Japanese apparel and accessories market by purchasing the 50% balance of Polo Ralph Lauren Japan for some $23 million and making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The company also increased its stake in Impact 21 Co., a Japanese sub-licensee, from 20% to 97% in. Impact 21 operates the company's men's, women's, and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan.
  </p>
        <p>
   Founder Ralph Lauren stepped down as CEO in November 2015 but remained involved with the company as chairman and chief creative officer.
  </p>
        <p>
   During 2013, RLC brought several licensing arrangements in-house. In April 2013, it acquired the Chaps Menswear Business from
   <company id="11183">
    PVH
   </company>
   for about $18 million. In July, it bought the Australia and New Zealand licensed operations from its licensee for about $15 million.
