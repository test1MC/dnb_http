   ImmunoGen really has it out for cancer. Its antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) technology targets tumors, delivering an ImmunoGen cell-killing agent specifically to cancer cells. The firm uses its antibodies, along with its ADC platform, to create product candidates; it also out-licenses the ADC technology to other companies. (Breast cancer drug Kadcyla, produced by
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   , is the first marketed product using ADC.) ImmunoGen's lead compounds target conditions including lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition to its proprietary candidates, the company has some compounds that are being developed through partnerships and licensing agreements with companies such as
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   About 70% of ImmunoGen's business is derived from licensing its ADC technology to other pharmaceutical companies. Through the licensing agreements, ImmunoGen is entitled to upfront fees, milestone payments (as the candidates reach certain development or commercialization milestones), and royalties on commercial product sales derived from the licensed technology. It also receives some income by performing R&amp;D functions for its partners, as well as by supplying materials for clinical trials. The income from licensing, support, and supply agreements allows the company to fund its own R&amp;D efforts on proprietary candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has three wholly owned compounds targeting cancer in clinical-stage development: mirvetuximab soravtansine, coltuximab ravtansine, IMGN529. Its IMGN779 compound is in pre-clinical stage.

   The company is headquartered in Massachusetts, where it also has a manufacturing facility.

   ImmunoGen has collaboration or licensing agreements for its ADC technology with companies including
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda

    Novartis
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , Biotest, and Roche. Novartis, which has several compounds licensed from ImmunoGen, is the largest revenue producer accounting for more than 40% of sales.

  <p>
   Because of the nature of its work, ImmunoGen's revenues and profits fluctuate from one year to the next, depending on whether it enters new lucrative development agreements or receives any milestone payments from licensees. Revenue has grown in the past three years, and in fiscal 2015 (ended June), it rose 43% to $85 million due to licenses by
   <company id="10509">
    Lilly
   </company>
   and Novartis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though ImmunoGen is supported by some large pharmaceutical players, the company has yet to turn a profit; it expects to continue to incur financial losses until one or more of its drug candidates reach commercialization stages. As of the end of fiscal 2015, the company had an accumulated deficit of $708.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also reported an operating cash outflow of $55 million that year (an increase of nearly $2 million versus the prior year).
  </p>

  <p>
   ImmunoGen relies on collaborations for nearly all of its income. As such, its primary goal is to enter and maintain partnerships and licensing agreements, and then to use funding from those agreements to bring its own candidates through development and commercialization stages. In early 2014, the company entered into a right-to-test agreement with CytomX; the following year, it entered into a similar agreement with Takeda.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also works to gain as many patents as possible for compounds discovered using its R&amp;D technologies, thus broadening its potential to develop or license out new products. As of mid-2014, ImmunoGen had more than 450 issued patents and another 570 pending patent applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a strategic review of its operations, ImmunoGen announced plans to cut 17% of its workforce in September 2016. The cuts were in the general administrative and technical operations areas and are expected to save the firm some $11 million annually, thereby allowing it to focus on late-stage trials of its ovarian cancer candidate.
