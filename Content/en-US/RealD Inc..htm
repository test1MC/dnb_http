   Thanks to RealD, a new era of 3-D movies is upon us. The new crop of feature films projected by RealD's three-dimensional digital projection equipment is dispelling the schlocky image of such 1950s fare as
   <em>
    It Came from Outer Space
   </em>
   .  Recent films that have used RealD's 3-D technology include
   <em>
    Kung Fu Panda 2
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Toy Story 3
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Despicable Me
   </em>
   <em>
    .
   </em>
   The firm has outfitted more than 15,000 movie screens in some 60 countries with its 3-D systems. Its products are also used by engineers, industrial designers, and scientific researchers for applications such as consumer electronics, education, aerospace, defense, and health care. (RealD has even helped pilot the Mars Rover.) The company was purchased by equity investment firm Rizvi Traverse in 2016.

   RealD Cinema Systems are currently deployed on about 20,200 theater screens in 68 countries worldwide. The company is working with their motion picture exhibitor licensees to deploy RealD Cinema Systems on up to 2,700 additional screens. Of those additional 2,700 screens about 1,100 screens are domestic installations and roughly 1,600 are international installations.

   to grow its consumer electronics business. It plans to incorporate its technology in plasma and LCD televisions, DVRs, gaming consoles, and laptop and desktop computers.

   Among the overall industry challenges the company faces is that much of its potential success is dependent on forces outside its control, such as the quality of output from Hollywood. And while the movie-going public is currently embracing 3-D movies, fickle audiences may tire of the technology, and the studios may produce fewer films as a result. In addition, the company is counting on the growth of its nascent consumer products business, the success of which has yet to be seen.

   In the meantime, RealD plans to continue development of its proprietary technologies as it seeks to improve the overall experience of its RealD Cinema Systems. The company has already patented technologies that will enable consumers to enjoy 3D content without wearing any eyewear.
