   TG Therapeutics is a drug development and commercializing firm that can change hats quickly when necessary. It is currently developing two therapies targeting hematological malignancies: glycoengineered monoclonal antibody TG-1101 (ublituximab) targets a specific epitope on the CD20 antigen found on mature B-lymphocytes, while TGR-1202 is an oral P13K delta inhibitor. While its current focus is on cancer drugs, TG Therapeutics -- like most drug development companies -- has acquired, developed, and spun-off other types of candidates in an effort to build a pipeline of potentially revenue-generating commercial products. Previous candidates included a vitamin B-12 nasal spray and a treatment for involuntary tremors.

  <p>
   TG Therapeutics also has a pre-clinical program to develop inhibitors of IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) and an antibody research program to develop anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies. Additionally, it actively evaluates complementary products, technologies, and potential partners for in-licensing, acquisition, or investment.

  <p>
   As of 2015, the company's revenues are derived from an exclusive license agreement with Ildong Pharmaceutical for the development and commercialization of ublituximab in South Korea and Southeast Asia. Through the agreement, TG received an upfront payment of $2 million; it is also eligible for sales-based milestones and royalty payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its founding, the company has not generated any profit. Its net loss increased 172% to $55.8 million in 2014 as research and development expenses and general and administrative costs related to non-cash compensation rose. Those losses, as well as an increase in restricted cash and a decrease in accounts payable, contributed to an operating cash outflow increase of 226% to $35 million that year.

   TG Therapeutics is seeking opportunities to partner with or acquire other companies. It is also exploring new possible technologies and products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to conduct additional phase I, II, and III clinical trials for its TG-1101 and TGR-1202 therapies. In mid-2014 it announced a phase III clinical trial for TG-1101 in previously treated patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It also exercised its option to license the global rights for TGR-1202 through an exclusive agreement with Rhizen Pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   Among the company's other agreements with partners is the 2014 exclusive licensing agreement with
   <company id="13469">
    Ligand Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for the development and commercialization of Ligand's interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 inhibitor technology, currently in pre-clinical development for the potential treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. In 2015 TG Therapeutics established a global collaboration with Checkpoint Therapeutics, a unit of
   <company id="162850">
    Coronado Biosciences
   </company>
   , to develop and commercialize Checkpoint's anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company sold 2.7 million shares of its common stock to
   <company id="104073">
    JP Morgan Asset Management
   </company>
   's Global Healthcare Fund; gross proceeds were an estimated $18.1 million, which it will use to fund clinical development of its two primary therapies and for general corporate needs.
