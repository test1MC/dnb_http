   XenoPort sounds like something straight out of science fiction, but there's nothing fictional about XenoPort's job of improving drugs' ability to be absorbed by tissues in the body. The development firm uses genomics to identify transporter proteins. It then designs oral drug molecules to find and ride these transporters through the gastrointestinal tract to their destinations. Its marketed drug in the US is Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil), a treatment for restless leg syndrome and post-herpetic neuralgia. XenoPort and
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   jointly market gabapentin enacarbil tablets under the name Regnite in Japan. Arbor Pharmaceuticals is buying XenoPort for $467 million.

   The biopharmaceutical company is developing and commercializing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates with an initial focus on neurological disorders as well potential treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. and psoriasis.
  </p>
  <p>
   XenoPort is developing a second candidate, Arbaclofen Placarbil (AP) as a treatment for spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury and in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Spasticity is a symptom of certain disorders (such as MS) that cause overactive muscle contractions with the decreased ability to control those contractions.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through a contracted sales force which directly sells its product candidates.

  <p>
   The company's strategy is to seek collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies to accelerate development and commercialization of its product candidate pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   AP is the furthest along in Xenoport's pipeline of candidates, and most likely where the company will be focusing its research and development energy. It also intends to get Horizant approved for other uses, such as chronic pain following the resolution of shingles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also evaluating a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease with help from a grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. It has another few drug candidates in preclinical development. Xenoport focuses on improving drugs that have poor rates of absorption in the digestive tract, tweaking drugs that are nearing patent expiration, and finding new uses for already-approved drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   So far XenoPort's income has been derived from licensing and milestone payments from development partners (Astellas, GSK until 2012, and until 2009,
   <company id="109187">
    Xanodyne
   </company>
   ). Now that Horizant has been approved for sale, Xenoport expects its revenue to come from further development and commercialization of that drug, as well as from entering into additional collaborative agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by Georgia-based Arbor Pharmaceuticals for $467 million. This will allow XenoPort to further commercialize Horizant, expanding into new markets and gaining approval for additional indications.
