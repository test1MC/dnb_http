   There's more than air in the cross hairs at Crosman. A leading air gun maker, the company has more than 50 models of pellet and BB rifles and pistols, as well as crossbows, ammunition, and optical products (such as riflescopes and crossbow sights). Its guns are offered under the Crosman, Benjamin, Game Face, Sheridan, and Remington names (licensed), to name a few.

   Crosman controls about 50% of the global market share for air guns. To defend its strong position, the company focuses on new product development and works to deliver what its wholesale customers and retail consumers are asking for. Case in point, Crosman was a leading supplier of paintball guns during the game's heyday; since paintball's popularity has declined, however, the firm has exited paintball gun manufacturing and has embraced airsoft, a recreational shooting activity that uses plastic pellets. In 2014 Crosman introduced a new brand in the air gun category with two US Marine Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) airguns.

   In 2014 the company opened a new logistics facility in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of its strategy to accelerate order fulfillment in Europe, where Crosman's customer base is growing.
