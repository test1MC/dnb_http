   When your immune system isn't up to the job, Avacta Group has the answer. Avacta works in the development, production, and sale of its in-house Affimer technology. Affimers are an engineered and highly-targeted alternative to antibodies that can tackle an array of ailments, including cancer. Advantages over antibodies include rapid development, ease of manufacturing, and immune system bypassing. Avacta is scaling up as its technology gains traction. However, the company's biggest earner currently is animal allergy testing under its Animal Health business, which also tests for canine lymphoma. Avacta is based in Wetherby in the UK, and has labs in Cambridge and offices in London.

  <p>
   Avacta operates two business segments: Animal Health and Life Sciences. Animal Health, the larger of the two at two-thirds of revenue, provides tools and contract services to help diagnose animal ailments. The segment makes nearly 50% of its revenue from allergy lab tests, 25% from bulk sales of allergy kits, over 20% from immunotherapy vaccines, and 5% each from CRO studies and Other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life Sciences, accounting for the remaining one-third of revenue, applies the company's Affimer technology (an engineered alternative to antibodies) to tackle a range of maladies. Affimer therapeutics can be engineered to be inhibitors (blocking a biological process) or agonists (activating a biological process).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, revenue increased a solid 19% to £2.2 million. Life Sciences grew 59% to £0.7 million on the back on an increase in custom Affimer projects, while Animal Health grew 7% to £1.46 million due to higher existing allergy test sales. Avacta is currently loss-making due to the cash intensiveness of technology development, and in 2016 made a loss of £5.6 million, a slight increase on 2015. Administrative expenses increased by £1.0 million as the business scaled up, with new and expanded labs in Cambridge, and a higher headcount.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash position remains strong (at £19.5 million) however due to successful funding rounds, and has sufficient cash for at least two more years of operation.

  <p>
   The emerging success of Affimer technology is driving its position as a viable alternative to antibodies (a $75 billion market), and consequently Avacta is scaling up operations as its Affimer technology wins new customers. It doubled its floorpsace in 2016, and the company is optimistic about the results of trials of an Affimer-based cancer treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avacta sold off its Optim analytics business in 2015 in order to raise cash for the acceleration of its Affimer program. The business had revenue of around £1.6 million, and the sale is worth around $5 million.
