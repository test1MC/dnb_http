   KapStone Paper and Packaging keeps things under wraps. The company manufactures linerboard, a type of paperboard that is converted into laminated tier sheets and wrapping material. It also produces kraft paper (industry-speak for strong wrapping paper) for multiwall bags; saturating kraft (sold under the Durasorb brand) to produce mainly high pressure laminates for furniture, construction materials, and electronics; and unbleached folding carton board (Kraftpak), which is converted into packaging for consumer goods. KapStone counts 3,200-plus customers, including

  <p>
   KapStone operates some 21 corrugated products manufacturing plants, comprised of 13 box plants, six sheet plants, and two sheet feeder plants. The US represents about 80% of sales.

  <p>
   KapStone operates in two segments: Paper and Packaging (79% of net sales) and Distribution (21%). The Distribution segment was acquired in the summer of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paper and Packaging produces containerboard, corrugated products, and specialty paper. In 2015 KapStone produced 2.7 million tons, nearly 82% of which was sold to third party converters or shipped to its corrugated products manufacturing plants based in the US; about 18% was sold to foreign-based customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Distribution operates under the Victory and Golden State Container trade names and provides its customers comprehensive packaging products and services and distributes corrugated packaging materials. It also supplies specialty packaging materials, such as plastics, wood, void fill, tapes and stretch wraps.

  <p>
   KapStone has achieved extraordinary growth over the last few years, with revenues rising 21% from $2.3 billion in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $2.8 billion in 2015. The historic growth for 2015 was primarily attributed to additional revenue from its Victory Packagig acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, however, fell 38% from $172 million to $106 million from 2014 to 2015. This was due to a spike in freight and distribution expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   Previous acquisitions have helped to fuel KapStone's earnings and set revenue milestones. In mid-2015, it acquired

   , a Houston-based manufacturer and distributor of corrugated boxes and other packaging, for $615 million. The deal enhanced its presence in the important market of Texas.
