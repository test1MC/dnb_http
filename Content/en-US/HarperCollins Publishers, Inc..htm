   Brothers James and John Harper founded Harper &amp; Brothers in 1817. By 1853 it was the world's largest publisher, with
   <i>
    Harper's Weekly
   </i>
   magazine and books such as Herman Melville's
   <i>
    Moby Dick
   </i>
   (1851). In 1962 Harper merged with textbook publisher Row, Peterson &amp; Co. Modern best-sellers for Harper &amp; Row included
   <i>
    The Exorcist
   </i>
   (William Blatty, 1971) and
   <i>
    The Thorn Birds
   </i>
   (Colleen McCullough, 1977).
  </p>
  <p>
   News Corp. acquired Harper &amp; Row in 1987. News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch had bought 40% of UK-based publisher William Collins in 1981. When News Corp. bought the balance of Collins in 1989, Harper and Collins merged. Murdoch sold subsidiary Lippincott in 1990 to reduce debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 HarperCollins Interactive was launched to develop CD-ROM titles. HarperCollins announced in 1995 it would make 10,000 books available on the Online Bookstore via Murdoch-owned chat forum manager Delphi.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company sold its US educational publishing division to a Pearson subsidiary. Plagued by poorly selling books, HarperCollins named Jane Friedman CEO and made waves the next year when it canceled more than 100 planned titles. Also that year News Corp. took a $270 million charge (the largest in book publishing history) to restructure HarperCollins.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Murdoch came under fire when HarperCollins dropped a memoir by former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten. Critics saw this as protecting Murdoch's business interests in China. The next year the company bought
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst
   </company>
   's book operations (Avon Books, William Morrow &amp; Co.). It also bought the smaller Ecco and Amistad presses in 1999. The next year the company bought UK publisher Fourth Estate. In 2000 the company also struck a deal with BET.com (now
   <company id="99831">
    BET Interactive
   </company>
   ) to launch a books channel and bookstore featuring African-American authors. It also began handling billing, customer service, and other back office duties for Scholastic in 2000. That year the company also introduced Rayo, a new imprint targeting the Hispanic audience that will publish both English and Spanish books.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 HarperCollins announced its new e-book imprint, PerfectBound. The company struck a blow to rival
   <company id="43807">
    Random House
   </company>
   that year when it lured best-selling author Michael Crichton away from his publishing house of 30 years. Later that year, however, Random House won a bid for children's publisher
   <company id="15150">
    Golden Books
   </company>
   over HarperCollins and bid partner
   <company id="105997">
    DIC Entertainment
   </company>
   . HarperCollins' children's unit acquired the popular Berenstain Bears franchise in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company agreed to publish books for the Smithsonian Institution under the Smithsonian Books imprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company found itself in embroiled in controversy in late 2006. First, the publishers announced -- and then rescinded - the publication of O. J. Simpson's book
   <em>
    If I Did It
   </em>
   , reportedly about how he would have committed the murders of his ex-wife and her friend. The HarperCollins unit in charge of the book was Regan Books, headed by industry lightning rod Judith Regan. Regan was fired within a month of the controversy. The company then announced it would shut down the Regan Books imprint and would spread books currently under that imprint to others owned by HarperCollins.
  </p>
  <p>
   HarperCollins' 2007 hits included
   <i>
    The Dangerous Book for Boys
   </i>
   by Conn Iggulden and Hal Iggulden,
   <i>
    Next
   </i>
   by Michael Crichton, and
   <i>
    The Children of HÃºrin
   </i>
   by J. R. R. Tolkien. In addition, the company has seen
   <em>
    The
   </em>
   <em>
    Chronicles of Narnia
   </em>
   movie boost sales of books by author C.S. Lewis, including increased sales of
   <em>
    The Chronicles of Narnia
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 former CEO Jane Friedman left the company. She had been credited with the turnaround of the once struggling book publisher. Her savvy pointed the company toward imprints targeted at select demographics such as African-Americans (Amistad Press) and Latinos (Rayo); she also lured away best-selling authors Michael Crichton and Elmore Leonard from rival publishing houses.  Rumors surfaced that her firing of Judith Regan was in part responsible for Friedman's departure. (Regan was fired after she published O. J. Simpson's controversial book
   <em>
    If I Did It
   </em>
   , a title about how he would have committed the murders of his ex-wife and her friend.) Friedman was succeeded by Brian Murray, the former president of HarperCollins Worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Disappointing financial results caused HarperCollins to close its Collins Publishing Group, a major nonfiction division, and Bowen Press, a children's book imprint, in 2009. The move was made to cut costs in response to the economic decline that hit the publishing industry particularly hard, resulting in a significant decline in book sales. The HarperCollins division closures came after the company posted a quarterly revenue decline of more than $100 million.
