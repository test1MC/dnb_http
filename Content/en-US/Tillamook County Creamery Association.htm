   Hoping to put its name on the map in more ways than one, Tillamook County Creamery Association has developed a reputation for making cheese while it works to bring home some of its own cheddar. The cooperative, also known as Tillamook Cheese, makes and markets several types of dairy products, including butter, ice cream, sour cream, and yogurt. Most of the organization's production is devoted to making cheddar cheese. Established in 1909, the association makes other types of cheeses, including Colby, Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, mozzarella, and Swiss. Tillamook cheese products are available nationwide. The co-op is owned by some 140 dairy farmers in and around Tillamook County, Oregon.

   Tillamook banks on brand recognition. To get its name out, the cooperative launched a Loaf Love Tour. In 1966 modified

   vans called The Loafster and Baby Loaf the company promotes the Tillamook brand name by stopping at retail locations in neighboring states, such as Washington and Utah.

  <p>
   The company's 60-year-old cheese factory in namesake Tillamook, Oregon, generates lots of buzz. Each year the plant attracts about a million visitors for tours.

   Tillamook typically sells its products through retail stores the likes of

  <p>
   To serve a growing group of customers outside its primary Northwest market, Tillamook enlisted the help of a pair of co-packers to cut-wrap, and distribute its Tillamook cheese.

   Looking to serve a niche audience, Tillamook in 2012 rolled out a light yogurt line that's naturally sweetened with Truvia sweetener. It took two years for the dairy company to perfect the yogurt, which is made using no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial growth hormones, flavors, colors, or sweeteners.

  <p>
   It's also expanding a production facility in Boardman, Oregon, to accommodate whey processing capabilities, as the protein components derived from whey are increasingly recognized for their nutritional value. Whey is used in infant formulas, performance nutrition products, and items used to manage some of the impacts of aging. The more than 63,000-sq.-ft. expansion project is due for completion sometime in 2014.
