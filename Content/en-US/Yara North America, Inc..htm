   As part of a major industrial application initiative, in 2013 Yara North America launched a new Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) production and distribution line at its plant in Belle Plaine, Canada. DEF is a high purity urea solution used for NOx reduction in diesel vehicles. That year it also opened a storage facility in Virginia to provide fleets and retail outlets throughout the Mid-Atlantic region increased access to Air1® DEF, an operating fluid used by diesel-powered vehicles equipped with selective catalytic reduction technology to meet EPA 2010 emissions regulations. The Chesapeake terminal joins Yara North America's network of storage terminals in order to supply what is likely to become the largest DEF market in the world. By 2019, Integer Research estimates DEF consumption in North America will be 1.2 billion tons per year.
