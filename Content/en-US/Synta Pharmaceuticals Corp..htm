   Synta Pharmaceuticals doesn't fill stockings, but it might eventually fill the medical need of treating various ailments. The drug development company has had a handful of candidates in clinical and pre-clinical development stages. Its ganetespib compound is in limited clinical trials as a possible treatment for various types of cancer. Synta's preclinical research efforts include potential therapies for autoimmune diseases, transplant acceptance, respiratory conditions, and cancerous tumors. Looking to enter new areas of development, Synta plans to merge with private firm Madrigal Pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   Synta's ganetespib candidate has been evaluated for the treatment of about a dozen forms of cancer (including NSCLC, breast, and rectal), and as such, was Synta's lead contender for reaching commercialization. However, in 2015 the company terminated its GALAXY-2 trial of ganetespib and cut much of its R&amp;D activities related to the compound.

  <p>
   To help fund its development efforts, the company pursues strategic collaboration and licensing agreements with other drugmakers. For instance, Synta had a strategic agreement with

    Roche Holdings
   </company>
   for its preclinical development program targeting rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions; however, the partnership with Roche was terminated in early 2012. The firm may enter other favorable partnerships on select development programs, though it also plans to pursue commercialization of some candidates on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has no manufacturing facilities and relies upon contract manufacturing organizations to produce its supplies for clinical trials. As a development-stage firm, Synta has yet to turn a profit and doesn't expect to do so until it completes trials on (and gains

   approval to market) one of its candidates. Thus far, nearly all of the company's revenues have been derived from collaboration fees; it has also earned a few grants to fund its research from the likes of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company agreed to merge with Madrigal Pharmaceuticals; the combined firm will focus on developing novel small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular-metabolic diseases and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NASH). Madrigal's lead candidate, MGL-3196, is being studied for treating NASH and hypercholesterolemia. The combined company will be named Madrigal Pharmaceuticals.
