   Farm animals mean business for BRF - Brasil Foods. Among the world's largest food companies, the Brazilian provider of fresh and frozen meats operates its own farms, slaughterhouses, animal-feed units, incubators, and processing plants. The company's lineup comprises three thousand-plus items, including chicken, pork, some beef and dairy, as well as a slew of processed foods (representing 60% sales), such as butter, cheese, desserts, ready-to-eat meals, pasta, and pizza. Products are sold under many brands -- Perdigão, Sadia, Batavo, Chester, and Perdix -- at home and abroad. Founded in 1934, BRF - Brazil Foods was transformed by a $3.8 billion-merger of its former company, Perdigão, with rival

   in 2009.

   In 2005 the company agreed to a licensing and development deal with grain processor
   <company id="58878">
    Bunge Alimentos
   </company>
   . It sold Bunge its properties used for soybean crushing and oil refining, and at the same time secured a supply of soybean meal for its animal-feed plants from Bunge. These agreements resulted in the cessation of the company's soybean oil production and reflected its decision to focus on its food production. The company purchased 51% of dairy company Batávia S/A Indústria de Alimentos (Batávia) from

   do Brasil in 2006.

   It became the first Brazilian food company with industrial operations in Europe in 2007, with the acquisition of the Dutch processed-beef operation, Plusfood Groep, from Cebeco Groep for €30 million (about $40.5 million) in cash. That year it also entered the pet food market, introducing the Balance and Supper brands of dog food. It acquired dairy companies Cotochãs in 2008, Eleva Alimentos in 2007, and Batãivia in 2006, making it the second-largest milk provider in Brazil (after
