   Reflec likes to reflect on new ways to commercialize glow-in-the-dark products. The holding company operates through subsidiaries Reflecmedia and Reflec Evolution. Reflecmedia helped develop chroma key technology, which uses blue screen or green screen filming techniques to produce special effects for TV, film, and digital content producers. Customers include

   The company operates through two divisional investment businesses -- Reflecmedia, and Reflec Evolution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reflecmedia's blue screen technology was developed in a joint venture with the BBC more than a decade ago. BBC holds the patent, and Reflecmedia holds the license to make and market the technology worldwide. Its technology is more versatile and portable than the traditional blue or green screen technology, which requires a controlled studio. The company uses its Chromatte-brand fabric screen and Litering, an alternative to traditional blue screen and green screen technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reflec Evolutionis a contract powder processing that specializes in changing the state of specialty chemicals and plastics by reducing, enlarging, drying, mixing, and separating a variety of materials.

   Reflec looks for other markets to expand its products and technologies. In addition to selling to film and TV producers, the company has been marketing to corporations and small businesses, schools, and videographers.

  <p>
   In 2011 Reflecmedia began promoting the use of its technology for still photography. It uses its Chromatte screen as a backdrop and its LiteRing-brand light attached to a camera to illuminate an image and create the same effect as blue screen and green screen technology. Images are processed with a special computer software to superimpose any background behind the images.
