   To serve the growing number of consumers who snack rather than eat sit-down meals, Land O'Frost in 2013 rolled out its Minis product line. Minis are two inches in diameter and are marketed to be paired with crackers, served on a party tray, or eaten straight out of the package. Additionally, the new line is gluten-free and MSG-free, has zero trans fats, and are 100 calories or fewer per serving.

   Land O'Frost is also building a new headquarters as part of a planned move from Illinois to Indiana. The meat producer is investing some $6.4 million to construct a new 25,000-sq.-ft. facility that's due for completion sometime in 2014.
