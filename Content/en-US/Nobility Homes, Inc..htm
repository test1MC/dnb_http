   Florida's prince of prefab, Nobility Homes, is a leading player in the state's competitive manufactured-home market. Nobility has built and sold about 50,000 homes through about 20 retail Prestige Home Centers, Majestic Homes retail sales centers and on a wholesale basis to independent dealers and residential communities. Nobility offers some 100 models that range in price from about $30,000 to more than $100,000 and in sizes from about 700 sq. ft. to 2,650 sq. ft. The company also provides financing, mortgage lending and brokerage, and insurance services. Founder and president Terry Trexler and his family control nearly two-thirds of the company.

   Terry Trexler, formerly a general manager at a mobile-home manufacturing plant, founded his business in 1967 and named it Nobility Homes because he felt the name symbolized quality. The company, which went public in 1971, focused solely on manufacturing while selling its homes through independent dealers. In the 1990s, however, Nobility took control of its marketing. Trexler formed TLT, Inc., to develop communities that sold homes and land as packages to retirees.
  </p>
  <p>
   For many years, Nobility catered to the retirement market by offering small homes for empty nesters. Since 1991 Nobility has pursued entry-level buyers with families, expanding home sizes up to five bedrooms. The Trexlers invested in Prestige Home Centers, a mobile-home retailer, in 1994. To keep growing, Nobility began increasing the number of Prestige outlets in 1997. Also that year Nobility introduced a 30th-anniversary model, a design that proved to be popular enough to be added to its permanent line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company bought six retail locations in northern Florida from Lynn Haven Homes and Emerald City Homes. It also opened a new sales center, increasing the company's retail locations to 22. As consumer demand in the industry crept downward, Nobility closed three retail outlets in 1999. An industrywide inventory glut and tighter credit standards for qualified buyers continued to affect Nobility's bottom line in the early 2000s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reductions in both excess home inventories and repossessions at retail sales centers within the industry helped the company rebound in 2002 with increases in sales and profits, partly due to Nobility's aggressive pursuit of sales to outside park dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to weather the downturn in the US economy, the company has closed retail sales centers and 1 manufacturing plant in recent years. Nobility invested in two Floridian retirement communities in 2008; the company believes the affordable manufactured senior housing market is a growth opportunity.
