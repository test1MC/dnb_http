   When it comes to vehicle safety, Grote Industries provides illumination. The company manufactures a range of vehicle safety systems such as lamps, emergency lighting, reflectors, wiring harnesses, and mirrors. Other products include backup alarms, flashers, and turn signal switches. Grote's products are used on heavy-duty trucks, industrial and military vehicles, and agricultural machinery, as well as passenger cars and pickups. The company counts automotive OEMs and automotive aftermarket retailers among its customers and has operations in Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the US. The company was founded by William Grote in 1901 and is owned by the Grote family.

   Grote's products are used as original equipment on buses, semi-tractors and trailers, passenger cars, industrial vehicles, recreational vehicles, and agricultural machinery. They are sold in the heavy-duty aftermarket, the automotive retail environment, and the marine and recreational market.

   Grote has provided both interior and exterior LED lighting for such projects as the MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) and the MMPV (Medium Mine Protected Vehicle). Other products include Grote's LightForm flexible LED lighting strip, which is a super-thin, pliable film that allows users to bend lighting around corners and into small crevices. This LED product -- nicknamed a "light stamp" -- uses 98% less material than a standard LED marker and can be used as an automotive exterior lamp and/or reflective device.

  <p>
   The company's strategy for growth involves introducing and enhancing products in its portfolio. Over the years it has expanded its line of SuperNova NexGen LED lamps and introduced its Trilliant infrared light-emitting diode (IR LED) headlights for military vehicles. The lamp was designed to easily retrofit existing Trilliant LED WhiteLight lamps already deployed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Drawing on its extensive LED lamp experience, Grote Industries in 2013 introduced two new signal lamps specifically designed for mounting on agricultural, construction, and other off-highway equipment.
