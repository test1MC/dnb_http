   What do you do when you've conquered Wall Street? You become mayor of the city the famous financial district calls home. After leading his financial news and information company to success, Michael Bloomberg left to run the Big Apple. His namesake company remains a leader in the market for business media. Its core Bloomberg Professional Service offering is accessed through terminals that provide real-time financial news, market data, and analysis. The firm also has a syndicated news service, publishes magazines (including
   <company id="140920">
    <em>
     Bloomberg Businessweek
    </em>
   </company>
   ), and disseminates business information via
   <company id="109877">
    Bloomberg Television
   </company>
   , radio, and the Web. Michael Bloomberg founded the company in 1981; he owns a majority of the firm.

  <p>
   Bloomberg has employees in more than 190 locations around the world. It has four bureau headquarters, in New York; Washington, DC; London; and Tokyo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bloomberg's content is fueled by the Bloomberg News division, which employs 2,400 journalists in more than 150 bureaus and 70 countries. It has multimedia operations that include radio, television, and interactive divisions, as well as a syndicate that provides news to 420 publications in 65 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The flagship Bloomberg Professional Service serves some 320,000 subscribers in 175 countries.

  <p>
   Bloomberg relies primarily on subscription sales rather than advertising. Customers work in the financial industry and include banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, fund managers, and government agencies. The company charges a monthly fee per terminal for multiple system clients; its data can be accessed on PCs and mobile phones via the company's Bloomberg Anywhere offering. Bloomberg also distributes financial news and information through other media channels in an effort to build its brand and keep up with the competition.

  <p>
   In 2014 Bloomberg launched a data-driven content marketing solution designed for its advertising partners. The solution, called Bloomberg Denizen, combines journalistic expertise with data-driven consumer insight to create content that is micro-targeted towards the professionals most Bloomberg advertisers aim to reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   As more and more people get their news and information from non-traditional sources, including social media, even market leaders like Bloomberg can find themselves fighting over shrinking audiences.

  <p>
   By the mid-1970s ambitious Michael Bloomberg had worked his way up to head of equity trading and sales at New York investment powerhouse Salomon Brothers. He left Salomon in 1981, just after the firm went private, cashing out with $10 million for his partnership interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bloomberg founded Innovative Marketing Systems and spent the next year developing the Bloomberg terminal, which allowed users to manipulate bond data. In 1982 he pitched it to Merrill Lynch, which bought 20 machines. Regular production of the terminals began in 1984, and in 1985 Merrill Lynch invested $39 million in the company to gain a 30% stake. The company prospered during the 1980s boom, and over time the data, not the machines, became the heart of the business, which was renamed Bloomberg L.P. in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company weathered the stock market crash of 1987, opening offices in London and Tokyo. Bloomberg made its entry into news-gathering and delivery in 1990 when Bloomberg News began broadcasting on its terminals. The company built its news organization from scratch, hiring away reporters from such publications as
   <i>
    The Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Forbes.
   </i>
   Bloomberg bought a New York radio station in 1992 and converted it to an all-news format. The next year it built an in-house TV studio and created a business news show for PBS. A satellite TV station followed in 1994, along with the
   <i>
    Bloomberg Personal Finance
   </i>
   magazine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Bloomberg began offering business information via its website. The company also introduced the Bloomberg Tradebook, an electronic securities-trading venue designed to compete with Instinet. (In 1997 Tradebook was approved by the SEC for use in connection with some Nasdaq-listed stocks.) Bloomberg also started offering its services to subscribers in a PC-compatible format and selling its data to other news purveyors, such as LexisNexis (an online information service).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company went further into financial publishing, issuing
   <i>
    Swap Literacy: A Comprehensive Guide
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    A Common Sense Guide to Mutual Funds.
   </i>
   That year Michael Bloomberg bought back 10% of the company from Merrill Lynch for $200 million, giving Bloomberg L.P. an estimated market value of $2 billion. The company agreed in 1997 to supply the daytime programming for New York TV station WPXN.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Bridge Information Systems bought Dow Jones Markets from Dow Jones in 1998, Bridge surpassed Bloomberg in number of financial information terminals installed, bumping Bloomberg from the #2 spot into third place. But Bloomberg continued expanding its offerings through strategic agreements with Internet companies such as America Online and CNET Networks, and through the introduction of new magazines such as
   <i>
    Bloomberg Money
   </i>
   in 1998 as well as
   <i>
    On Investing
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Bloomberg Wealth Manager
   </i>
   in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1999 Bloomberg secured a deal with the Australian stock exchange that would allow its terminals to facilitate international order routing into the Australian market. The company also expanded its presence in the Spanish-language market through its agreement with CBS Telenoticias to produce a TV news program (
   <i>
    Noticiero Financiero
   </i>
   ). In 2000 Bloomberg joined with Merrill Lynch to make Merrill Lynch's institutional e-commerce portal available to Bloomberg customers. Michael Bloomberg left the company in 2002 to become mayor of New York City. He was replaced by Peter Grauer (chairman) and Lex Fenwick (CEO).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company left Park Avenue and moved into the new Bloomberg Tower on Lexington Avenue. The 53-story building is also home to retail and residential space. Fenwick left the company in 2008 to oversee Bloomberg Ventures (an offshoot of the company that pursues new business opportunities), and was replaced by Daniel Doctoroff, who took on the role of company president. Mayor Bloomberg was re-elected in 2005 and again in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10990">
    Merrill Lynch
   </company>
   sold its 20% ownership stake in Bloomberg back to Michael Bloomberg in 2009. Later that year the company acquired
   <em>
    BusinessWeek
   </em>
   magazine. In 2010 the magazine was relaunched as
   <em>
    Bloomberg Businessweek
   </em>
   . Also that year the company relaunched Bloomberg.com. The redesign was completed to reposition the site as the go-to resource for news, data, and intelligence for the global business community.  Doctoroff was promoted to CEO in 2011.
