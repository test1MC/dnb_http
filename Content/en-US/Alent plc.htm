   Alent has a talent for soldering on. The company makes engineered materials and specialty chemicals used by the electronics and automotive industry. Its engineered materials, sold under the brand
   <company id="110717">
    Alpha
   </company>
   , include solder bar, wire, and paste, as well as flux, stencils, and adhesives used by electronic manufacturers to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs). The specialty chemical division, better known as Enthrone, makes electroplating chemicals also used in PCB assembly and coatings for the automotive industry. The company's name is a combination of the first letters of its two brands, Alpha and Enthone. Alent formed in 2012 after former parent Cookson demerged to form two separate companies,
   <company id="93491">
    Vesuvius
   </company>
   and Alent.

  <p>
   Alpha is the larger of the two businesses, accounting for about two-thirds of sales. In addition to PCB assembly, its soldering products are also used by the semiconductor packaging industry. Solder is made from tin and silver, and the company uses about 12,000 tons of tin and 6 million ounces of silver every year. Enthrone makes more than 1,750 different kinds of electroplating chemicals and coatings used by the PCB assembly, semiconductor, and automotive industries.

  <p>
   Altogether Alent has almost two dozen manufacturing plants located around the world. Its products sold in more than 100 countries, but almost half of sales come from the Asia/Pacific region, where most of the world's electronics manufacturers are located. Europe and North America each account for about a quarter of sales.

   Alent serves the electronics industry, which is growing from demand for mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. Cars are also increasingly using more electronic components, and the company's protective and decorative coatings products are poised to grow as more automotive applications develop. The company is also looking at selling existing products to new industries, specifically the solar cell and light emitting diode (LED) segments.
