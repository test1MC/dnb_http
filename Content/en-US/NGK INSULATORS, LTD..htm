   Forget the three R's, NGK INSULATORS studies the three E's: energy, ecology, and electronics. One of the world's largest insulator makers, NGK produces insulators and other equipment for power transmission lines and substations. The company makes NAS (sodium sulfur) battery systems for electrical power storage. Its ceramics unit makes ceramic components (such as honeycomb substrates for catalytic converters and ceramic membrane filters) used in automotive and industrial process applications. NGK also makes actuators for printer heads, beryllium copper alloy components, and ceramic products used in making semiconductors.

  <p>
   NGK has manufacturing operations through almost 55 consolidated subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Japan is its largest market, representing nearly 40% of total sales, while Europe, North America, Asia and other regions, each represent around 20% of sales.

  <p>
   The company operates through three primary segments: Ceramic Products Business Group (57% of sales), Power Business Group (23%), and Electronics Business Group (20%).

  <p>
   NGK has enjoyed significant growth revenue increased by 2% in 2012, primarily due to increased sales derived from its Power and Ceramics business, partially offset by declines from its Electronics segment.

   In 2012 NGK subsidiary FM Industries bought

   's advanced components business, which supplies electrostatic chucks and critical chamber components for semiconductor processing equipment.

   NGK is targeting the alternative energy sector for growth for its NAS battery systems, which were developed to reduce power demand fluctuations by storing electricity when demand is low and supplying power when demand is high. The company sees its battery as a natural fit for wind and solar power systems that are used to supply additional electric power during peak demand periods. NGK has identified the electric power market in China as a key growth area for its stand-alone batteries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also looking to new automotive emissions regulations to encourage growth in its ceramics business, which makes filters used in catalytic converters to reduce exhaust emissions for gas and diesel engines. Other auto products it makes include diesel particulate filters and exhaust gas sensors.
