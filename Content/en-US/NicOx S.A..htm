   NicOx believes that nitric oxide can make meaningful donations to the health care industry. The company researches nitric oxide-donating drugs for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis (vascular inflammation), hypertension, and respiratory diseases; its primary focus, however, is in the eyecare space where it believes its development efforts can help with glaucoma, conjunctivitis, retinal diseases, and other areas. NicOx's compounds have been developed in partnerships with top pharmaceutical firms such as
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10187">
    Bausch &amp; Lomb
   </company>
   . Based in France, the company has established operations in targeted growth markets such as the US.

  <p>
   NicOx's products approved in the US include Sjö, a treatment for Sjögren's Syndrome, an autoimmune condition that destroys the saliva and tear glands and RetnaGene AMD, a lab test that determines a patient's risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In Europe the company markets AdenoPlus for advanced diagnostics of conjunctivitis, and Xailin for dry eye.
  </p>
  <p>
   NicOx's lead candidate is latanoprostene bunod, a compound developed with Bausch &amp; Lomb to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension. It has additional candidates in development, most created through partnerships.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is headquartered in France with R&amp;D operations in Italy and a growing presence in the US. Its North American headquarters is in Fort Worth, Texas.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NicOx has set up its own specialized sales and marketing teams in the US and in Europe.

  <p>
   Since the company didn't begin selling anything substantial until 2014, its previous revenues have been less than $1 million. The company has been racking up losses as it spends on R&amp;D like most early stage companies.

  <p>
   Going forward NicOx plans to seek in-licensing, collaborations, and acquisitions for growth in the US while looking for established partners with a local presence in Europe. To that end, it partners with
   <company id="99269">
    Sequenom
   </company>
   for RetnaGene AMD in the US and it licensed AdenoPlus from Rapid Pathogen Screening. Sjö comes from Immco Diagnostics and the company has a deal with an unnamed European pharmaceutical company to distribute its ophthalmic products in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

   To expand its reach geographically, the company in 2013 purchased Italian ophthalmic distributor Eupharmed for €3.5 million.
