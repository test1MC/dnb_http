   Its association with Ebro has given Riviana access to a global network of raw product sources, top technologies, product innovations, and research and development capability. The company continues to innovate, offering fully cooked, quick-to-fix rice mixes in single- and family-sized portions. It also regularly rolls out new products, such as its 2013 debut of Minute Maid-label multi-grain medley, ready-to-serve black beans and rice, and ready-to-serve fried rice mix.

  <p>
   Riviana's roots reach back to 1911, when Frank A. Godchaux consolidated 25 rice mills in southwestern Louisiana to form the Louisiana State Rice Milling Company. His family controlled the company until 1965, when River Brand Rice Mills purchased it and changed the name to Riviana Foods. In its early days, Riviana was tied to the commodities market, but it changed its focus to domestic retail in the late 1960s. Godchaux's descendants stuck with the company even when it was sold to a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive in 1976. Joe Hafner was named CEO in 1984, and Godchaux's grandsons led a management buyout of Riviana two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Riviana and grain cooperative Riceland Foods formed Rivland Partnership in 1989 to produce rice flour. In 1995 Riviana went public. Riviana teamed up with Tiger Oats to market rice products in South Africa in 1997 and began distributing Riceland's consumer products in the US and the Bahamas the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Riviana took over the marketing and distribution of S&amp;W brand rice from longtime customer Tri Valley Growers. That year it also acquired its longtime wild rice supplier, Gourmet House. Through its Belgian subsidiary, Riviana purchased Euryza Reis GmbH, one of Germany's largest rice milling operations, in 2000.

  <p>
   In 2003 Riviana acquired the rice specialties business of

    ACH Food Companies
   </company>
   , increasing its presence in the instant-rice category. Acquired brands included China Doll and Fiesta. That year it also purchased
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   ' European rice businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was acquired by Ebro Puleva in 2004 in a deal valued at $380 million and has since ceased production in south Louisiana, where the company was founded.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Ebro purchased the Minute Rice brand and operations for the US and Canada from Kraft and added them to Riviana's roster.
