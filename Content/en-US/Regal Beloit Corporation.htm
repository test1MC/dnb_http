  <p>
   Regal Beloit derives more than 70% of its sales in the US and has the bulk of its plants in Europe and Australia/New Zealand as well as the developing world. It has manufacturing, sales and service facilities throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia. It operates through a total of 181 manufacturing, service, and distribution facilities.

  <p>
   Regal Beloit operates through three segments. Commercial and industrial systems (48% of net sales) produces medium and large motors, commercial and industrial equipment, generator, and custom drives and systems. It serves the commercial HVAC, pool and spa, and oil and gas systems markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The climate solutions segment (30%) produces small motors, controls, and air moving equipment for applications in residential and light commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration, and water heaters. Finally, its power transmission solutions segment (22%) produces power transmission gearing, hydraulic pump drives, and large open gearing and specialty mechanical products, which are applied in material handling, industrial equipment, energy, and off-road equipment.

  <p>
   The company's primary customers include distributors and equipment makers. Staffing each business unit with its own sales organizations of internal staff and manufacturers' representatives, Regal Beloit sells its products directly to OEMs, distributors, and end users. The company's HVAC motor business is especially concentrated on a small number of OEMs, though no one customer represents more than 10% of sales.

  <p>
   Regal Beloit achieved unprecedented revenue growth in 2015, with revenues climbing 8% to reach a record-setting $3.51 billion. Profits also skyrocketed by more than 360% from $31 million in 2014 to $143 million in 2015 due to a major drop in expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was attributed to a massive 191% surge in power transmission solutions sales primarily due to additional sales form previous acquisitions.

  <p>
   The company has developed and acquired global operations in locations such as Mexico, India, Thailand, and China so that the company can sell its products in these faster growing markets, follow its multinational customers, take advantage of global talent and complement its flexible, rapid response operations in the US, Canada, and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regal Beloit is attracting additional customers and taking advantage of the environment-friendly zeitgeist by launching more high energy efficient products. Besides energy efficiency, Regal Beloit's product strategy calls for more development of embedded intelligence and variable speed technology.

  <p>
   Regal Beloit has grown mainly through acquisitions, which have given it a strong multi-product portfolio and have expanded its operations geographically. In the past two years, it has acquired more than 13 companies across North America, Europe, and Australia. Regal Beloit's electrical segment has particularly ramped up via acquisitions.

   In 2014 the company purchased Benshaw, a maker of custom low and medium voltage drives and soft starters, from
   <company id="10425">
    Curtiss-Wright Corporation
