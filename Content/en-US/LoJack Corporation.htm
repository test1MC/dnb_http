   LoJack's signature product helps police recover stolen vehicles -- a chilling thought for those driving hot cars. When a car equipped with a LoJack transmitter is stolen, its signal is activated and tracked by police. The company rents tracking computers to law enforcement agencies, then markets transponders to dealers and operators in 28 states and the District of Columbia, and roughly 30 countries internationally. It also sells products for tracking people, personal electronics, cargo, data, and commercial equipment. LoJack provides installation and maintenance of its units, which are manufactured by third parties.

  <p>
   LoJack is operational in more than 30 countries throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. The company also operates Canada's stolen vehicle recovery provider, with sales concentrated in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Revenue from North America accounted for 71% of sales in 2013.

  <p>
   LoJack's products have led to the recovery of more 400,000 vehicles worth more than $5 billion. When a car is stolen, a radio signal is transmitted to the automobile's unit, which activates its tracking signal. Law enforcement officers in patrol cars or aircraft, in participating jurisdictions, can follow the signal to the stolen vehicle. The units, which are covertly installed (with no antennas or markings on the vehicle) and use a radio frequency (RF) technology that can transmit through buildings and containers, yield a recovery rate of approximately 90%.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company operates through its two regional segments, North America and International, a third "Other" segment comprises SC-Integrity (SCI) and LoJack SafetyNet. LoJack owns approximately 60% of SCI, to which it licenses its LoJack brand name for cargo and data tracking and recovery products. LoJack SafetyNet is its search and rescue product for people at risk of wandering (such as those with Alzheimer's, autism, Down syndrome, and dementia). Potential wanderers wear a bracelet that sends an RF signal, which can be tracked by police equipment.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through distribution network of automobile dealers. About 53% of its products in the US were installed by third parties in 2013.

  <p>
   After experiencing a drop in revenue and a net loss of $8 million 2012, LoJack bounced back in 2013, when revenues climbed 6% to $140 million and it posted $3 million in positive net income.
  </p>
  <p>
   The increase in revenue in 2013 was driven by a 22% spike in international sales. Its product revenue increased by 20% as a result of boost in the number of units sold and a 2% increase in average revenue per unit. LoJack was also helped by a 9% in sales from Italy and 8% growth from its "All Other" segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   LoJack's positive net income for 2013 was due to the absence of impairment of goodwill, a gain on the sale of common stock, and tax benefits. The company experienced negative operating cash flow during 2012 and 2013.

  <p>
   Even with the reductions in North America, the company is looking to expand globally by growing its operations in Italy, partnering with licensees, and increasing its LoJack SafetyNet and SCI offerings. It has also launched its RF technology in Canada to replace cell technology. LoJack plans to continue its growth strategy by strengthening its traditional products, as well as expanding into newer markets. It plans to do this through acquisitions, technological advances, new product development, and global partnerships.
