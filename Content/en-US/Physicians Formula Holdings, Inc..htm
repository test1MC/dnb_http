   PFH and its parent company Markwins share similar sales channels and boast non-competing brands. PFH is looking to leverage an opportunity to broaden its customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also working to grow by regularly rolling out new products, as they tend to generate a larger portion of gross sales. PFH's forward momentum builds upon development and introduction of new products in less-served yet commonly needed categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also pursues opportunities in complementary categories, namely lip care, which it hasn't entered. A larger effort focuses on fending off rivals
