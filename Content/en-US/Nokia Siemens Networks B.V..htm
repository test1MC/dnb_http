   Nokia Siemens Networks wants to prove that titans don't have to clash. The 50-50 joint venture (established in 2007) combines the telecom carrier operations of diversified manufacturer

   with the network business of communications giant
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia

   . With a product portfolio spanning both wireless and wireline network equipment, the company offers systems and managed service packages tailored for such applications as broadband access, IP transport, communications software, and wireless data transmission. Nokia Siemens offers consulting, systems integration, and support. Its largest demographic is Europe, with nearly 40% of sales.

   Nokia Siemens' products range from technology for developed markets that need to upgrade their networks to emerging markets meeting demand for new services from existing providers and new companies. In fact, its second-largest geographic region is Asia/Pacific, accounting for about a third of sales. The region competes against fast-growing, China-based

   , which is gaining ground with its low-cost equipment. The company counts 600-plus network operator customers in more than 150 countries; its systems support more than 1.8 billion subscribers.

   Nokia Siemens has divested itself of unprofitable businesses. The company sold Expedience, its fixed-wireless broadband operations to a private Spanish technology company called CN TETRAGEN. Although a wireless broadband business, Expedience was expendable because it wasn't based on the widely adopted standards now part of Nokia Siemens' focus.
