   Taittinger has something to be bubbly about. When celebrations are afoot, the champagne and wine maker produces vintages for all. The company produces its champagne and wines in France and the US. It offers wines made from grapes grown in the Bordeaux, Bourgogne, Champagne, and Rhone regions of France and it owns Domaine Carneros, a California winemaker which plies about 200 acres in Napa and Sonoma valleys. About two-thirds of Taittinger's champagne production is sold overseas. In addition to wine the company offers spirits including brandies, scotch, gin, vodka, and liqueurs.

   The company purchases grapes and wines from selected and obtained through long-term contracts with independent winemakers and several co-operatives.

  <p>
   Taittinger traces its beginnings back to 1734 and the founding of a champagne house by wine trader Jacques Fourneaux. Champagne distributor and exporter Pierre Taittinger bought the Fourneaux firm in 1931. His sons François, Jean, and Claude joined the company in 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   Claude took over the helm after François was killed in a 1960 automobile accident. Under Claude, Taittinger increased its exporting efforts. The family began renovating the 18th-century Crillon hotel in Paris in 1979. In 1987 Taittinger formed Domaine Carneros, a joint venture with US wine distributor Kobrand. Taittinger family-controlled glassmaker Baccarat entered the fold of affiliate Société du Louvre in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1990s Taittinger and Louvre became the targets of US corporate raiders Asher Edelman and Guy Wyser-Pratte. As the Americans accumulated stakes in the companies -- with the intent to sell the Crillon and most of Louvre's other assets and spin off its economy hotels, keeping only the other luxury hotels and Baccarat -- the Taittinger family enlisted the aid of another French family. In 1997 the Peugeots (of automotive fame) began buying a 5% stake in Louvre to counter a takeover.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 French billionaire Albert Frère acquired about 11% of Taittinger and about 11% of Societe du Louvre through the holding company he controls, Compagnie Nationale a Portefeuille. Frère increased his stake in Taittinger to almost 25% in 2002.
