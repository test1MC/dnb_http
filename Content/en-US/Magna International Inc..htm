   The company, based in Ontario, Canada, operates segments along geographic lines to be more responsive to customers' needs. Its segments include North America (which generated 53% of Magna's total revenue in 2014), Europe (40% of revenue), Asia (5% of revenue), and Rest of World (2% of revenue). The "Rest of World" markets include developing regions such as Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.   Magna boasts almost 320 manufacturing facilities and roughly 85 product development, engineering, and sales centers in nearly 30 countries. Magna follows a decentralized mode of operation, meaning its businesses operate independently.
  </p>
  <p>
   By product, exterior and interior system sales generated 35% of Magna International's total revenue in 2014, while body systems and chassis system sales contributed another 22% to sales. The rest of its total revenue came from powertrain system sales (14% of total sales); complete vehicle assembly sales (8%); tooling, engineering and other services (8%); vision and electronic system sales (7%), and closure system sales (6%).

   Magna has enjoyed sizable revenue and profit growth since 2009 as demand for new cars continues to strengthen around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales rose 5% to a record $36.6 billion during 2014, mostly thanks to business growth in North America with the launch of new programs, and as light vehicle production in North America grew by 5% to 17 million units. Total sales were also helped by 18% sales growth in Asia driven by new program launches with Magna content (particularly in China) and higher light vehicle production in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue growth in 2014 drove Magna International's net income higher by 21% to a record $1.88 billion for the year. The company's operating cash levels climbed 9% to $2.79 billion during the year thanks to higher cash earnings.

   Magna International ranked as the world's second-largest parts supplier behind
   <company id="41437">
    Robert Bosch GmbH
   </company>
   and ahead of
   <company id="91247">
    ZF
   </company>
   as of mid-2015. To satisfy automakers' demand for more of a one-stop-shop in auto part manufacturing, the company regularly expands its product lines and expertise through acquisitions of auto parts manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   That said, it's also been selective on what auto part manufacturing businesses it wants to be in, favoring more profitable business lines and "key areas" of the vehicle. In August 2015, for example, Magna sold its interiors operations business, including some 36 manufacturing facilities and 12,000 employees, to Grupo Antolin for $525 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magna International often uses strategic partnerships to grow or complement its product lines and extend its reach into new geographic markets. In 2015, subsidiary body and chassis maker Cosma International effectively expanded Magna's reach and product offerings to customers in fast-growing China after it formed a joint venture with Chongqing Xingqiaorui. Also in 2015, Magna International partnered with Argus Cyber Security to offer automotive electronic systems that featured Argus' intrusion prevention system service and cloud-based monitoring service designed to prevent cyber-attacks. In 2014, Magna formed a 50/50 joint venture with Tata AutoComp Systems to provide seating systems to the Indian commercial vehicle industry.

  <p>
   In July 2015, Magna International purchased German transmission manufacturer Getrag for $1.9 billion, as part of its continued plan to expand its service and product lines for auto makers.

   Magna International has historically expanded its product lines through acquisitions of other auto parts manufacturers. In early 2011, Magna Seating acquired Germany-based Vogelsitze GmbH, which made seats for buses and passenger trains. In 2012, Magna obtained Verwaltungs GmbH, a maker of automotive vacuum, engine, and transmission pumps with two facilities in Germany and one in each of China and Bulgaria. Also in 2012, to strengthen its automotive pump operations, Magna purchased the remaining 50% interest it didn't already own of STT Technologies, which made transmission and engine related pumps for the North American market.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Magna International is rooted in a tool and die shop founded by Frank Stronach and friend Tony Czapka in Ontario, Canada, in 1957. Austrian-born Stronach immigrated to Canada in 1954. By the end of 1957, the business, called Multimatic, had 10 employees. Multimatic delved into car parts when it landed a contract in 1960 to make sun visor brackets for a General Motors division in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   To go public, Multimatic underwent a reverse merger in 1969 with Magna Electronics, a publicly traded maker of components for aerospace, defense, and industrial markets. (Stronach retained control of the company.) Annual sales reached $10 million that year. The company expanded its automotive operations during the early 1970s by adding more stamped and electronic components. Magna was renamed Magna International in 1973.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales increasing steadily among its auto parts businesses, Magna sold its aerospace and defense business (now part of
   <company id="103902">
    Heroux-Devtek
   </company>
   ) in 1981. The new Magna consisted of five distinct automotive divisions that made seat tracks, door latches, electronic components, and other auto parts. During the 1980s the company expanded by adding factories and product lines. It also capitalized on car makers' penchant for outsourcing labor and bypassing unions. By 1987, when sales reached $1 billion, the company was producing systems for every area of the automobile. Stronach didn't spend all his time on cars, however; he owned race horses and restaurants. He had opened restaurants, tried various publishing ventures (which failed), and even made an unsuccessful run for a Canadian parliament seat in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aggressive expansion during the 1980s eventually caught up with the company, and in 1989 Magna began to restructure, selling assets to pay off its debt. The company also was bailed out, in part, by two of its principal customers --
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   . Having recovered somewhat, Magna began acquiring small auto parts companies in Europe in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magna expanded its European presence with the purchase of Austria-based Steyr-Daimler-Puch in 1998, adding about $1 billion in annual sales. The deal steered Magna into the auto assembly business. Stronach also added Santa Anita Park to his holdings that year. In late 1999 the company's racetrack interests were spun off as
   <company id="103525">
    Magna Entertainment
   </company>
   , with Magna retaining a 78% stake. Stronach's horse,
   <em>
    Red Bullet
   </em>
   , won the 2000 Preakness. Later that year Magna sold its 50% stake in Webasto Sunroofs to privately-owned German auto parts maker Webasto.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 Stronach's daughter Belinda was named vice chairman and CEO. The company then prepared to spin off Magna Steyr and Intier (now Magna's interiors and seating divisions) as public companies; Intier was spun off later in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magna acquired rival automotive mirror maker Donnelly in 2002 in a stock-and-debt deal worth $320 million. The company divested its stake in Magna Entertainment in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Belinda Stronach stepped down as president, CEO, and director in order to make a bid for the leadership of Canada's new Conservative Party. Her father assumed the role of interim president in early 2004. Ms. Stronach's bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party was not successful. Mr. Stronach ran the company until 2005 when Magna adopted a co-CEO management structure with Donald Walker and Siegfried Wolf at the helm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magna and
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler
   </company>
   announced in 2004 that Magna would buy Daimler's drivetrain manufacturing subsidiary New Venture Gear for about $435 million. After approval by the European Commission, New Venture Gear was acquired by a newly created joint venture called
   <company id="105096">
    New Process Gear
   </company>
   , with Magna holding an 80% interest; Daimler held 20% until 2007, when Magna bought out its stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   Russian conglomerate Basic Element, led by Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, spent about $1.5 billion to purchase 20% of Magna in 2007. The transaction gave Magna entry to the Russian market, but late in 2008 Deripaska's bank,
   <company id="90775">
    BNP Paribas
   </company>
   , made a margin call that forced the businessman to give up his shares. In 2008 Magna International acquired Technoplast, a Russia-based manufacturer of plastic automotive interior and exterior parts, which bolstered its capacity in Eastern Europe and Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the heels of the General Motors bankruptcy filing in 2009, the German government selected Magna International as a partner for Adam Opel, and agreed to provide about €1.5 billion (around $2 billion) in bridge loans while GM and Magna finalized the contract. A trusteeship for Opel was arranged to keep European operations separate from the Chapter 11 proceedings of GM.
  </p>
  <p>
   Magna teamed up with Russian banking firm Sberbank to purchase a 55% interest in Opel and its UK-based
   <company id="103617">
    Vauxhall
   </company>
   unit. While GM initially agreed to the sale in September 2009, it backed out in November. The GM board decided to restructure Opel and its European operations instead, because business conditions were improving and the Opel brand was important to its global strategy. In Europe the decision was met with demands by the German government that its €1.5 billion in bridge loans be returned, as well as protests and planned work stoppages by the German labor union.
  </p>
  <p>
   The GM bankruptcy was brought on by the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. Magna responded by implementing cost cutting measures, which included reducing its headcount by approximately 11,500, representing a 14% cutback between 2007 and 2009. It also sold off some of its non-core assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder and chairman Frank Stronach stepped down in 2010, citing the trend toward more regulatory limitations on company management as one of the reasons. He gave up his controlling share in the company, and with it his voting control. The company purchased and cancelled all of its Class B shares held by the Stronach Group and issued Class A Common shares. This capital transaction ended the company's dual class stock structure. The former premier of Ontario, Mike Harris, took Stronach's place. Co-CEO Siegfried ("Sigi") Wolf also resigned, which made co-CEO Donald Walker the sole CEO of Magna International as of mid-2011.
