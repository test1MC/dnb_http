   When it comes to making pumps and motors, Franklin Electric would make Old Ben proud. The company keeps things flowing by making and distributing submersible and specialty electric motors, electronic drives and controls, and related items. Its fueling system products include electronic tank monitoring equipment, fittings, flexible piping, nozzles, and vapor recovery systems. Franklin Electric's products are used by OEMs that incorporate them in underground petroleum pumping systems, sewage pumps, vacuum pumping systems, and freshwater pumping systems. Some customers, such as independent distributors and repair shops, buy the company's products as replacement motors. Franklin Electric was founded in 1944.

  <p>
   The company has operations in Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, and the US. The US represents about 45% of its total sales.

  <p>
   Franklin Electric operates through its two segments of water systems and fueling systems. Water systems is the company's bread and butter, typically representing around 80% of total sales each year.

  <p>
   The company serves customers around the world in residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial, municipal, and fueling applications. Its products are sold worldwide by its sales force and independent manufacturing representatives. Water Systems and Fueling Systems products and related equipment are sold to specialty distributors and some original equipment manufacturers, as well as industrial and petroleum equipment distributors and major oil and utility companies.

  <p>
   After posting over $1 billion in net sales for the first time in its history in 2014, Franklin Electric saw its revenues dip 12% in 2015. This was fueled by decreased sales from both Water Systems (14%) and Fueling Systems (3%) segments. Sales declined in both the segments mainly due to fewer acquisitions compared to the previous year and foreign currency fluctuations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Water Systems sales in the US and Canada declined due to diminished demand for mobile dewatering equipment due to reduced demand in the oil and gas end markets and a decline in groundwater equipment sales due to weaker demand in the agriculture sector. Fueling Systems revenues declined in India and China due to the timing of tender awards made in India and the ongoing reduction in government-owned oil company procurements in China. Sales also declined in Europe due to a decline in the sale of storage tanks that support North Sea oil production.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2014 to 2015, Franklin Electric's net income spiked by 4% due to decreased restructuring cost and selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by decreased sales. In addition, its operating cash flow skyrocketed by more than 100% during that same time period due to favorable changes in receivables and inventory.

  <p>
   Franklin Electric continues to expand its pumping business through acquisitions. In 2014 Franklin Electric acquired Bombas Leão S.A., based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for approximately $31 million. Bombas Leão designs, manufactures, and distributes submersible groundwater pumping equipment. Also in 2014, Franklin Electric completed two acquisitions in India: Pluga Pumps and Motors Private Limited. Both businesses make groundwater motor and pumping equipment through 11 branch offices located throughout India.
