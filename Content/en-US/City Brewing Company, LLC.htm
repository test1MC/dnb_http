   City Brewing Company has been brewing beer in the same city since its predecessor's inception in the mid-1800s. The corner of Third and Mississippi streets in La Crosse, Wisconsin, once home to the G. Heileman Brewing Company (which brewed Old Style), is today City Brewing. The company brews 40 recipes for itself and more than a dozen contract-brewing customers. Alcoholic beverages it makes under contract include Mike's Hard Lemonade and

   and Rockstar energy drinks.

   Besides its La Crosse brewery, City Brewing runs breweries in Latrobe, Pennsylvania (a former Rolling Rock brewery) and Memphis, Tennessee (a former Schlitz brewery). From those facilities City Brewing can roll out a lot of barrels each year. The La Crosse plant has packaging capacity of more than 50 million cases; the Latrobe plant can make more than 20 million cases; and Memphis can pump out more than 60 million cases.
