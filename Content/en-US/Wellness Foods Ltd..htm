   The company has sold off some of its brands to concentrate on its core Orchard House &amp; Paradise Foods and Stream Foods brands in recent years. In mid-2014 it sold off its its Rowse Honey brand to Valeo Foods (the Irish owner of Jacob's cracker brand); and sold its Dorset Cereals brand line to Jordans and Ryvita for Â£50 million.

  <p>
   Since its inception in 2005, the company has grown by acquiring established health food manufacturers, traditionally one business a year. However, Wellness Foods' plans to expand through future acquisitions have come to a halt as it deals with declining profits amid a global economic downturn and changes in the executive suite.

  <p>
   Focusing instead on organic growth, Wellness Foods-owned Grove Fresh is targeting European consumers as it refreshes the brand message and packaging design (with
   <company id="140883">
    Elopak
   </company>
   ) of its fruit juices and beverages. It has also launched a variety of new products, including exotic fruit blends. Other subsidiaries have managed to sustain a following in developing regions. Through Rowse Honey, Wellness-Foods is the leading player in Nigeria's honey market.
