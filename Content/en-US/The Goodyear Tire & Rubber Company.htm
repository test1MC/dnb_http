   When the rubber hits the road, most years are good years for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber. Through a global alliance with
   <company id="57043">
    Sumitomo Rubber Industries
   </company>
   , Goodyear is working to unseat tire industry leaders
   <company id="41861">
    Bridgestone
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41240">
    Michelin
   </company>
   (by total sales). Goodyear sells mainly new tires under the Goodyear,
   <company id="111875">
    Dunlop
   </company>
   , Kelly, Fulda, Debica, and Sava brand names. Goodyear makes, markets, and sells Dunlop tires across the Americas, the EMEA, and the Asia/Pacific. In Japan, the tire makers own businesses that sell tires separately to OEMs and to aftermarket companies. Goodyear sells some 55% of its products outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Goodyear boasts more than 50 facilities across 20-plus countries, as well as about 1,100 tire/auto repair centers. The US and Germany are its largest markets, generating 45% and 12% of sales, respectively.

  <p>
   Goodyear and
   <company id="111875">
    Dunlop
   </company>
   brand tires are sold for replacement in EMEA through various channels of distribution, principally independent multi-brand tire dealers. In some areas, Goodyear brand tires, as well as Dunlop, Debica, Sava and Fulda brand tires, are distributed through independent dealers, regional distributors and retail outlets. In Asia/Pacific, tires are sold through licensed and franchised retail stores and multi-brand retailers through wholesale dealers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in four segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA); and Asia/Pacific. North America accounted for 47% of 2015 sales. It makes tires at six plants in the US and two in Canada. The segment offers automotive repair and maintenance through about 600 locations that operate under the Goodyear and Just Tires banners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The EMEA segment, representing 31% of 2015 sales, operates 14 tire plants in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, and Turkey. Besides serving the regions' auto, truck, and farm and construction equipment manufacturers, the segment's plants export tires to North America and other regions. The company owns about 80 retail outlets regionwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Asia/Pacific segment (12% of sales) makes tires via seven plants in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand. It sells tires under the Goodyear brand throughout the region, as well as the Dunlop brand in Australia and New Zealand. The segment has about 230 retail outlets in Australia and New Zealand that operate under the Beaurepaires and Frank Allen brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin American tire (10% of sales) makes tires at five plants in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. Outside the car market, the segment makes pre-cured treads for truck tires and retreads truck and aircraft tires.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Goodyear's revenues have gradually fallen the last four years, with revenues dipping 9% from $18.1 billion in 2014 to $16.4 billion in 2015. Its profits also nosedived by 87%, falling from $2.5 billion in 2014 to $307 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The recent revenue drop for 2015 was attributed to lower sales across all segments, unfavorable foreign currency translations, and unfavorable price and product mixes driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing. It also lost revenue from the divestiture of its farm tire business in the fourth quarter of 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Goodyear received income tax benefits of $1.8 billion in 2014, it paid tax expenses of $232 million in 2015, which contributed to its massive decline in profits. Goodyear's net cash provided by operations skyrocketed by 396% to $1.6 billion in 2015, mainly due to a major decrease in pension contributions and direct payments.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Goodyear's updated capital allocation plan for 2014-2016 reflects a  commitment to balancing all its priorities (returning cash to shareholders, investing in high-return growth projects and achieving investment grade metrics) to drive long-term shareholder value. The company also reaffirmed its 2014-16 financial targets, which includes income growth of between 10% and 15% per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its US pension strategy includes the accelerated funding of pension plans in conjunction with significantly reducing exposure in the investment portfolio of those plans to future equity market movements. The fixed income investments held for these plans are designed to offset the subsequent impact of discount rate movements on the plans' benefit obligation so that the funded status remains stable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, North America launched six new consumer tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, and Kelly brands, including the new Goodyear Wrangler Fortitude HT, Dunlop Signature HP, and Kelly Edge tire lines. North America's commercial truck tire business launched four new tires under the Goodyear Fuel Max tire line to serve long haul and regional customers as well as the Goodyear Endurance Waste Haul.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, the company opened a first development center in China which expanded Goodyear's capabilities in the Asia Pacific region and enabled it to increase the speed and efficiency of tire development in that important region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1898 Frank and Charles Seiberling founded a tire and rubber company in Akron, Ohio, and named it after Charles Goodyear (inventor of the vulcanization process, 1839). The debut of the Quick Detachable tire and the Universal Rim (1903) made Goodyear the world's largest tire maker by 1916.
  </p>
  <p>
   Goodyear began manufacturing in Canada in 1910, and over the next two decades it expanded into Argentina, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies. The company established its own rubber plantations in Sumatra (now part of Indonesia) in 1916.
  </p>
  <p>
   Financial woes led to reorganization in 1921, and investment bankers forced the Seiberlings out. Succeeding caretaker management, Paul Litchfield began three decades as CEO in 1926, a time in which Goodyear emerged to become the world's largest rubber company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Goodyear blimps served as floating billboards nationwide by the 1930s. During that decade Goodyear opened company stores, acquired tire maker Kelly-Springfield (1935), and began producing tires made from synthetic rubber (1937). After WWII Goodyear was an innovative leader in technologies such as polyester tire cord (1962) and the bias-belted tire (1967).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1980 Goodyear had introduced radial tire brands such as the all-weather Tiempo, the Eagle, and the Arriva, as it led the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thwarting British financier Sir James Goldsmith's takeover attempt in 1986, CEO Robert Mercer raised $1.7 billion by selling the company's non-tire businesses (Motor Wheel, Goodyear Aerospace) and by borrowing heavily.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recession, overcapacity, and price-cutting in 1990 led to hard times for tire makers. After suffering through 1990, its first money-losing year since the Depression, Goodyear lured Stanley Gault out of retirement. He ceased marketing tires exclusively through Goodyear's dealer network by selling tires through
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , Kmart, and Sears. Gault also cut costs through layoffs, plant closures, and spending reductions and returned Goodyear to profitability in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company increased its presence in the US retail market in 1995 when it began selling tires through 860 Penske Auto Centers and 300 Montgomery Ward auto centers. President Samir Gibara succeeded chairman Gault as CEO in 1996. That year Goodyear bought Poland's leading tire maker, T C Debica, and a 60% stake in South African tire maker Contred (acquiring the rest in 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Goodyear formed an alliance with
   <company id="57043">
    Sumitomo Rubber Industries
   </company>
   , under which the companies agreed to make and market tires for one another in Asia and North America. The next year Goodyear sold its Celeron Oil subsidiary, which operated the All American Pipeline, and acquired the remaining 26% stake in tire distributor Brad Ragan (commercial and retail outlets in the US) for $20.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Sumitomo Rubber Industries' North American and European Dunlop tire businesses in 1999. The acquisition returned Goodyear to its #1 position in the tire-making industry. However, the company recorded drastically low profits that year because it had cut tire production and was unable to meet supplier demands.
  </p>
  <p>
   To improve profitability, Goodyear increased tire prices in 2000 and began consolidating its manufacturing operations. Goodyear also announced plans to combine its commercial tire service centers with those of Treadco through a joint venture named Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems. Despite record sales in 2000, the company's profits hit some hard road, prompting Goodyear to lay off 10% of its workforce and implement other cost-cutting efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 the company announced that it would close its Mexican tire plant. The same year the company agreed to replace Firestone Wilderness AT tires with Goodyear tires for Ford owners as part of Ford's big Firestone tire recall.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 Goodyear announced that its recent job cuts and manufacturing consolidation resulted in an $85 million decrease in annual operating costs. Later in the year the tire maker became embroiled in an age discrimination lawsuit claiming unfair job evaluations for the company's older employees. Blaming a slow US economy, Goodyear announced plans to cut 450 jobs at its Union City, Tennessee, manufacturing plant. The job cuts were just the beginning of what would be a series of operational adjustments made as part of a Capital Structure Improvement Plan formally launched in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although Goodyear once owned about 10% of its Sumitomo Rubber Industries, it sold more than 20 million shares of its Japanese counterpart stock back to the tire maker in 2003. Later in the year as the company was embroiled in a lengthy debate with the
   <company id="126824">
    United Steelworkers
   </company>
   union it was announced that the Huntsville, Alabama, tire manufacturing plant would be closed. Goodyear also announced that it would cut 500 non-union salaried employees in North America. Later that same year it was announced that Goodyear was chosen by
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   to be the truck manufacturer's primary tire supplier in North America; Goodyear had a similar contract with
   <company id="43929">
    Mack Trucks
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="41393">
    Qantas Airways
   </company>
   announced in early 2004 that it chose Goodyear to provide tires for the Australia-based company's Jetstar Airways. Later in the year Goodyear acquired the shares of Slovenia-based Sava Tires it did not already own, and the company's Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe unit purchased the Sweden-based Dackia retail tire stores. The company announced more job cuts in the non-tire sector in 2004, affecting Goodyear's engineered products and chemical units.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Goodyear sold its stake in Goodyear Sumatra Plantations (rubber plantations in Indonesia) to rival
   <company id="41861">
    Bridgestone
   </company>
   for $62 million. Later that year the company sold its Wingtack adhesive resin business to Sartomer Company Inc. (a subsidiary of France's
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL S.A.
   </company>
   ) for about $65 million. As 2005 wound to a close, the company sold its farm tire business to Titan International for $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Goodyear called off plans to sell its Chemical Products division. Instead the company integrated its chemical operations with those of its North American Tire division to take greater advantage of operational synergies. The company did, however, move forward with plans to jettison its Engineered Products division. In 2005 Goodyear secured the services of
   <company id="121104">
    J.P. Morgan Securities
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   to help it explore opportunities for the sale of Engineered Products. The company struck a deal for
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   in 2007 to buy its Engineered Products division for about $1.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Goodyear sold its tire reinforcement wire business (located in Luxembourg and North Carolina) to South Korea-based Hyosung for $50 million. The same year it sold its farm tire business in Latin America to a Titan International unit for $99 million. In 2010 Goodyear had agreed to sell its farm tire business in Europe as well as Latin America to Titan, but the European part of the deal fell through, and Goodyear does not have a time frame for making that sale. (In 2005 Titan had purchased Goodyear's North American farm tire business.) Also in 2011 Goodyear closed a facility in Union City, Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intent on making more tires at lower-cost facilities, Goodyear relocated its tire-making operations from Dalian, China, to Pulandian, China, in 2012. Additionally, Goodyear is expanding or modernizing plants in Brazil, Chile, Germany, and the US.
