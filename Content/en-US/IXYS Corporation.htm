   The US Constitution does a pretty good job with transfer of power. So does IXYS, in a different context. IXYS (pronounced ike-sys) makes a variety of power semiconductors (including transistors and rectifiers) and power modules, which convert and control electric power in electronic gear. They are used in such equipment as power supplies and medical electronics. IXYS also sells microcontroller chips, display drivers, power management integrated circuits (ICs), gallium arsenide field-effect transistors, and proprietary direct copper bond substrate technology. The company's 2,500-plus customers include

   IXYS's power semiconductors generate about two thirds of its revenue. ICs supply 28% with system and RF semiconductors accounting for 7%.

   IXYS has manufacturing facilities in Germany, the Philippines, the UK, and the US. Its European headquarters is in Biel, Switzerland.

   After robust revenue growth in 2014, IXYS tacked on another 0.72% in 2015, reaching $338 million. An acquisition paid off with sales from the 8-bit microcontroller line and improved sales of solid state relays. Profits surged more powerfully than revenue in 2015, rising 292% to $23.7 million from $6 million. In 2015, the company held the line on operating expenses and sales and marketing costs and reduced research and development costs, all helping to boost the bottom line. Higher profit pushed cash flow from operations to $48 million in 2015 from $19 million in 2013.

   The semiconductor industry is traditionally cyclical, and a down cycle reduces demand for products that incorporate IXYS chips. Customers respond by placing fewer orders as they work through excess inventories. Most of IXYS' ICs go into business and industrial (rather than consumer) products, though its microcontroller chips and display drivers have applications in consumer electronics, home appliances, and security systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   While the company fabricates many of its own products, it outsources just over a third of its wafer production to Samsung Electronics and other chip makers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Continuing to expand into growth markets, IXYS climbed aboard the alternative energy bandwagon, making solar cell arrays and modules for charging portable batteries. Other applications for its solar cell chip include RFID tags, wireless sensors, smoke detectors, and test equipment. The company's power semiconductors are used in inverters to convert voltages from solar panels and windmills for the electric utility grid. Silicon-based solar cells are manufactured with processes similar to standard semiconductor devices.
  </p>
        <p>
   IXYS takes advantage of market downturns -- and the disastrous effects they have on other semiconductor companies -- to expand its own product lines.

   IXYS's recent acquisitions have centered on microcontroller capabilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, the company bought RadioPulse for about $16 million. RadioPulse develops wireless network technology devices that combine microcontroller and RD chips, complementing IXYS's microcontrollers. With RadioPulse, IXYS adds a number of system-on-chip (SoC) products designed for low-power, high performance, and cost-effective applications that include home and building automation, industrial control and monitoring, energy management, and consumer electronics.

   In July 2013 the company acquired
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics Co
   </company>
   's. 4- and 8-bit microcontroller lines. The acquired product lines include MCUs for various consumer, medial, automotive, telecom and power management applications. IXYS' wholly-owned subsidiary ZiLOG (acquired in 2010) will offer the 4- and 8-bit microcontrollers acquired from Samsung, as well as its current MCU product offerings.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 IXYS acquired
   <company id="13211">
    ZiLOG
   </company>
   for about $62 million. ZiLOG's product portfolios complement IXYS' power management and digital control offerings. IXYS also bought the LED and LCD display driver business of
   <company id="132597">
    Leadis Technology
   </company>
   for about $4 million. The LCD display drivers are used in
   <company id="41820">
    Nokia
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103887">
    Sony Ericsson
   </company>
   smartphones, and the LED driver chips complement IXYS' existing display and backlighting product portfolios. Demand for LED lighting is growing as applications expand to include lighting for commercial, outdoor, and residential markets. LCDs are used in electronic displays, another market with a lot of growth potential.

        <p>
   IXYS was formed in 1983 by
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   veteran Nathan Zommer. In 1989 the company acquired the rectifier and discrete semiconductor product manufacturing unit of
   <company id="40615">
    ABB
   </company>
   , giving the Swiss-Swedish construction giant a stake in the company.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the company merged with struggling chip maker Paradigm Technology. Paradigm was founded in 1987 by Norm Godinho and Frank Lee, static random-access memory (SRAM) innovators who previously had founded
   <company id="13785">
    Integrated Device Technology
   </company>
   (IDT). Bucking the trend to manufacture overseas, Paradigm built a plant in California, saddling itself with $30 million in debt. The company was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1994, but emerged in 1995 with a new public offering, entering the market for chip modules. Its financial difficulties continuing, the company sold its manufacturing facilities in 1997 and agreed to the merger with IXYS in 1998 to stave off mounting losses and likely liquidation. The deal gave ABB a hefty stake in the combined company, which took the IXYS name and Paradigm's publicly traded status. The merger also gave IXYS an SRAM product line.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 IXYS bought privately held radio-frequency power systems specialist Directed Energy, Inc. (DEI), enhancing its presence in industrial and telecommunications markets. In 2002 the company acquired specialty chip maker
   <company id="44027">

   </company>
   in a deal initially valued at about $55 million. Two years later ABB sold off its remaining 16% stake in IXYS.
