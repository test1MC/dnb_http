   Chemistry is&#160;key to any successful relationship, and&#160;good chemistry is what Huntsman is all about.&#160;Huntsman International&#160;operates in five business segments: polyurethanes, advanced materials, textile effects, performance products, and pigments. The company manufactures surfactants (used in cleaning and personal care products) and performance chemicals like polyurethanes, propylene oxides, and propylene glycol. Its polyurethanes segment is the company's largest, representing 39% of 2011 sales. Huntsman ranks among the largest makers of titanium dioxide, the most commonly used white pigment, with 15% of the world market. Huntsman International operates the business of parent

        <p>
   Huntsman's revenues increased by 21% in 2011&#160;due to higher average selling prices in all of&#160;its segments,&#160;driven by&#160;higher raw material costs, improved demand and the strength of major European currencies against the US dollar, as well as higher sales volumes in all of its segments. For polyurethanes MDI, sales volumes increased primarily in response to improved demand in the insulation, automotive, and composite wood panels sectors and methyl higher tertiary butyl ether sales volumes primarily due to a planned maintenance outage at company's Port Neches, Texas facility during 2010. Performance products' sales volumes increased mainly due to higher demand for ethyleneamines and ethylene glycol.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income increased by 41% in 2011 due to higher revenues, a decrease in equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates for 2011, and&#160;a drop&#160;in the loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2011 as a result of higher net repayments of indebtedness in 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   Huntsman&#160;has seen an upward trend in revenues&#160;since 2009 mainly due to higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes in all segments as the result of increased demand across almost all product groups thanks to a&#160;worldwide economic recovery.

   Huntsman announced a major restructuring of its Textile Effects unit in Switzerland in 2011, part of its strategy to improve its global competitiveness. The company planned possible closures and layoffs that could affect its&#160;workforce in Basel.&#160;Restructuring was projected&#160;to be completed by the end of 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 Huntsman&#160;acquired the chemicals business of Laffans Petrochemicals in Ankleshwar, India. Laffans, which manufactures amines and surfactants, was integrated into&#160;the&#160;performance products division and will bolster&#160;Huntsman's growth strategy in Asia.

        <p>
   Founder and chairman Jon Huntsman, a cancer survivor, has directed hundreds of millions of dollars of company profits and his own money to educational and charitable causes and medical research. He donated $100 million to fund the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the

  </p>
        <p>
   His son Jon Huntsman Jr. was elected governor of Utah in 2004. The younger Huntsman was a director of Huntsman International and had been chairman and CEO of Huntsman Family Holding Co., which is one of the larger stakeholders in the Huntsman companies. Jon Huntsman Jr. resigned that position and placed his ownership stake in a blind trust for the duration of his term. In 2011 he resigned as the US ambassador to China to make a run (unsuccessfully)&#160;as a candidate for president.

        <p>
   First exposed to the use of plastics in the manufacture of egg cartons, Jon Huntsman spent three frustrating years at
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   . Then he and his brother Blaine raised $300,000 and received a $1 million loan from Hambrecht &amp; Quist to found Huntsman Container in 1970. When chemical supplies began to run short, Huntsman sold the company to Keyes Fiber in 1976.
  </p>
        <p>
   After six years, half of which had been spent doing missionary work for the Mormon Church, Huntsman took over polystyrene operations and set his sights on an underused Shell plant in Ohio. With oil and gas titan Atlantic Richfield's backing, Huntsman convinced Shell and a bank to lend him the balance of the purchase price and formed Huntsman Chemical in 1982.
  </p>
        <p>
   With the acquisition of Hoechst Celanese's polystyrene business in 1986, Huntsman became the #1 producer of styrene in the US. In 1987 Huntsman sold 40% of Huntsman Chemical for $52 million and then acquired a New Jersey polypropylene plant from Shell. Huntsman reentered the packaging business in 1989 by acquiring Keyes, the European firm that had once been a part of Huntsman Container.

        <p>
   In 1991 hamburger dynasty
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   succumbed to environmentalist pressure and ceased to use the Huntsman-developed polystyrene clamshell containers; as a result, Huntsman lost about 10% of its business. The company acquired packaging assets from
   <company id="10668">
    Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber
   </company>
   in 1992 and named the new subsidiary Huntsman Packaging. The next year Huntsman bought 50% of Chemplex Australia Limited from Consolidated Press Holdings (controlled by Australian tycoon Kerry Packer).
  </p>
        <p>
   Huntsman and Packer joined forces again in 1994 to buy most of Texaco's unprofitable petrochemical operations (renamed Huntsman Corporation) for $1 billion, which doubled Huntsman's size and added 24 plants in 12 countries. Also that year Huntsman bought
   <company id="16569">
    Eastman Chemical's
   </company>
   worldwide polypropylene business. The next year it formed a joint venture with Texaco to operate Texaco's worldwide lubricant-additives line, and Huntsman reacquired the 17% stake held by the former
   <company id="10674">
    Great Lakes Chemical
   </company>
   , which had been the only stock in the company held by outsiders at that time.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Huntsman placed all of his businesses under a single entity, the Huntsman Corporation. The company bought the last of Texaco's chemicals operations in 1997, moving Huntsman into the propylene oxide market. Huntsman also bought packaging maker Rexene that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Huntsman sold its polystyrene and styrene monomer businesses in the US and Europe to
   <company id="57496">
    NOVA Chemicals
   </company>
   in 1998; it retained its expandable polystyrene unit when federal regulators objected to its sale. In 1999 the company doubled its size with the purchase of
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   ' polyurethane, aromatics, titanium dioxide, petrochemical, and olefins businesses. (Huntsman established Huntsman International, a joint venture with ICI in which Huntsman owned a 70% stake, to manage these assets. Huntsman later agreed to buy ICI's 30% stake, which transaction was completed in 2003.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Huntsman sold Huntsman Packaging to
   <company id="99789">
    J. P. Morgan Partners
   </company>
   in a deal worth $1 billion. Also, Jon Huntsman stepped down as CEO (but remained as chairman). He was succeeded by his son, Peter Huntsman. Late in the year Huntsman acquired
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
   </company>
   ' thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) business for about $120 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Hamstrung by about $2 billion in debt, higher raw material costs, and a depressed chemicals market, Huntsman stopped paying interest on debt and sought a financial restructuring.
  </p>
        <p>
   In June 2002 Huntsman restructured its debt through
   <company id="43826">
    Credit Suisse First Boston
   </company>
   's Global Opportunities Partners (now MatlinPatterson Global Opportunity Partners) by creating a holding company that owns Huntsman International and Huntsman Polymers. MatlinPatterson owns 49.9% equity of the newly created HMP Equity Holdings. The Huntsman family owns the rest and continues to run the company.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2002 Huntsman restructured its business segments. The new categories were: polyurethanes (polyurethanes and PO), base chemicals (olefins and aromatics), pigments (titanium dioxide), and performance products (surfactants, ethyleneamines, and other performance chemicals). The most significant change was the split of the former specialty chemicals segment into two: polyurethanes and performance products. The former tioxide segment was renamed pigments, and the former petrochemicals segment was renamed base chemicals.
  </p>
        <p>
   In May 2003 Huntsman completed its purchase of four of
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   's chemical groups by buying the British chemical giant's 30% stake in Huntsman International for about $400 million. That deal (along with the buyout of the remaining 9% of Huntsman International from JP Morgan Partners and MidOcean Capital Investors) again gave the Huntsman family 100% control of all the Huntsman companies. At the time Huntsman was the world's largest private chemical company.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, MatlinPatterson Global Opportunity Partners (which grew out of the two other investment groups) owned 49.9% equity of the newly created HMP Equity Holdings (which owned Huntsman International and came into being in 2002). The Huntsman family owned the rest and controlled the company. The agreement with MatlinPatterson saved Huntsman from having to enter bankruptcy. But contingent on MatlinPatterson's giving full control to the Huntsman family was the eventual move to take the company public. Huntsman International spent much of 2004 preparing for such a move, which became official in February 2005. The IPO was the US chemical industry's largest up to that point that decade.
  </p>
        <p>
   The parent company&#160;terminated a $10.5 billion&#160;agreement to be acquired by&#160;specialty chemicals maker
   <company id="138217">
    Hexion
   </company>
   in 2008.&#160;The&#160;offer had come after nearly a year of Huntsman restructuring and divestment of its basic chemicals operations.&#160;Hexion and private equity behemoth
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Management
   </company>
   , which controls Hexion, tried to back out of the deal, however,&#160;amid the global economic crisis. After&#160;several months of deliberations and lawsuits, perhaps mollified by what amounted to a $1 billion break-up fee, Huntsman terminated the transaction, and the companies went their separate ways.
  </p>
        <p>
   Huntsman International reported a net income of $180 million on revenues of almost $9.3 billion in 2010.&#160;The results represented a 21% increase in revenues&#160;from the&#160;nearly $7.7 billion reported&#160;in 2009 and a $590 million jump in net income from the previous year's loss of $410 million. Higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes in all the company's segments contributed to the marked increase in revenues and net income. The company is focusing on growth in Asia and other emerging markets, as well as on reducing its debt, as a basis for long-term growth.
