   For power management company Eaton, diversified operations are key to a healthy business. Helping customers manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power with efficiency and safety, Eaton provides an array of products, from automation controls and wiring devices, across five industry segments. It also manufactures components for the vehicle and aerospace sectors, and sells clutches and brakes under the Airflex brand. The company has a worldwide reach, and came into its current being following the acquisition of
   <company id="10405">
    Cooper Industries
   </company>
   in 2012 in a $13 billion mega-deal.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eaton organizes its business into five primary segments: Electrical Products, Electrical Systems &amp; Services, Hydraulics, Aerospace and Vehicle. The two electrical segments together pull in about 60% of sales, with the remainder spread among the other three segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Electrical Products segment specializes in electrical and industrial components, power supply and circuit protection, and lighting products. Electrical Systems &amp; Services focuses on the distribution and security of power distribution. Hydraulics makes connectors, filters, hoses, motors, pumps, and valves, as well as electronics and software for mobile and industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Vehicle segment caters for original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers of trucks, cars and agricultural equipment through the manufacture of drivetrain systems and performance-improving components. Lastly, the Aerospace segment designs and manufactures components that power cockpit interfaces, engines, fuel systems, hydraulic systems, and motion controls for commercial and military aircraft.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eaton sells products and services to customers in more than 175 countries, and has employees in more than 60. The US is Eaton's biggest market at over 50% of total sales; Europe pulls in just over 20% of revenue. Canada, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region make up the remainder.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the Electrical and Electrical Services segments, sales are made directly to original equipment manufacturers, utilities, and certain other end users, as well as through distributors, resellers, and manufacturers' representatives. In Hydraulics and Aerospace, products are sold and serviced through a variety of channels.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   A faltering global economy and shrinking marketplace hit Eaton's revenue hard in 2015: total sales shrank 7.5% to $20.9 billion. All five segments saw sales fall, with the biggest losses coming in Hydraulics and Electrical Systems and Services, which both fell by around $0.5 billion. As the smaller segment Hydraulics saw the more dramatic percentage fall, of 17%, which comprised a 10% decrease in organic revenue with a further 7% due to negative currency translation. Weakness in the oil and gas markets was the main factor in Electrical Systems' poor performance. Sales also dropped across Eaton's five main geographies, with losses concentrated in Europe. Despite the weakness in sales, net income actually rose in 2015 on prior year to $1.9 billion, but this is largely explained by a costly litigation settlement that hit the bottom line in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations followed in the footsteps of net income, dipping a bit in 2014, but rebounded about 25% in 2015 to $2.4 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The brightest point was in Aerospace, which recorded organic growth of 1% for the year because of growth in commercial and military aftermarkets, although this growth was dragged negative by unfavorable currency movement.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Eaton's primary concern is navigating the difficult market conditions that have caused a slump in profits, and to that end in 2015 announced a three-year, $400 million restructuring program to counter headwinds and reduce its cost structure. This involved workforce reductions at plants in Kansas and Ohio, and the closure of its Aurora, Ohio plant; most of the job losses were in the struggling Hydraulics segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Eaton sold its Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses to
   <company id="90795">
    Safran
   </company>
   for $270 million in order to better focus on the Aerospace segment's core competencies.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Activity on the once-frenzied acquisitions front has slowed given tough economic conditions. Eaton made two small acquisitions in 2015, of Ephesus Lighting and Oxalis Group, which recorded sales of $23 million and $9 million respectively over the past twelve months.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1911 Joseph Eaton and Viggo Torbensen started the Torbensen Gear and Axle Company to make an internal-gear rear truck axle that Torbensen had patented in 1902. The company moved from Newark, New Jersey, to Cleveland in 1914. After Republic Motor Truck bought Torbensen (1917), Eaton formed the Eaton Axle Company (1919), repurchased Torbensen (1922), and by 1931 had bought 11 more auto parts businesses. In 1932 it became Eaton Manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Depression flattened auto sales, and Eaton's profits fell. WWII sparked demand that helped the company recover. Joseph Eaton died in 1949. During the 1950s and 1960s, Eaton diversified and expanded geographically. It bought Fuller Manufacturing (truck transmissions, 1958), Dole Valve (1963), and Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing (locks and forklifts, 1963). Eaton's international business grew, with foreign sales increasing from almost nil in 1961 to 20% of sales by 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eaton sold its lock business in 1978 and bought Cutler-Hammer (electronics), Kenway (automated storage and retrieval systems), and Samuel Moore (plastics and fluid power). Downturns in the truck and auto industries forced Eaton to close 30 plants and trim 23,000 jobs between 1979 and 1983. The company reported its first loss in 50 years in 1982 and decided to diversify into high technology and to expand operations overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 1984 to 1993 Eaton spent almost $4 billion in capital improvements and R&amp;D. In 1986 it bought Consolidated Controls (precision instruments), Pacific-Sierra Research (computer and defense systems), and Singer Controls (valves and switches).
  </p>
  <p>
   Eaton's acquisitions in the 1990s included Nordhauser Ventil (automotive engine valves, Germany), Control Displays (flight deck equipment), Heinemann Electric (hydraulic/magnetic circuit breakers), and the automotive switch business of
   <company id="10778">
    Illinois Tool Works
   </company>
   . The company moved into the semiconductor equipment business, marketing ion implanters; the product line was part of specialty controls. In 1994 Eaton tripled the size of its electrical power and controls operation with its $1.1 billion purchase of
   <company id="11627">
    Westinghouse
   </company>
   's electrical distribution and control business. The next year it bought Emwest Products (electrical switch gear and controls, Australia) and the IKU Group, a Dutch auto-controls firm. It purchased CAPCO Automotive Products (truck transmissions, Brazil) in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its repositioning, the company in 1997 sold off its appliance control business to Siebe PLC (later known as
   <company id="90103">
    Invensys
   </company>
   ) and a majority stake in its high-tech defense electronics subsidiary, AIL Systems, to management. It purchased Fusion Systems for about $293 million, widening the product offerings of its semiconductor equipment operations. The next year Eaton sold its heavy-axle and brake business to
   <company id="10433">
    Dana
   </company>
   and its suspension business to Oxford Automotive. Eaton closed and consolidated plants and laid off more than 1,000 workers in its semiconductor equipment operations in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company increased its share of the hydraulics market in 1999 by spending $1.7 billion for
   <company id="11510">
    Aeroquip-Vickers
   </company>
   . To help pay for the purchase, Eaton sold its engineered fasteners business to TransTechnology, its fluid power division (cooling systems for cars and trucks) to Borg-Warner (now
   <company id="14127">
    BorgWarner
   </company>
   ), and its mobile agricultural hydraulic cylinder business to
   <company id="150120">
    Hyco International
   </company>
   . Eaton also unloaded Vickers' machine tool controls business later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Eaton sold its specialty power resistor business to industrial products maker
   <company id="90189">
    Halma
   </company>
   . That year its Aeroquip unit acquired the fluid connectors business of
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   , and Eaton spun off its
   <company id="100876">
    Axcelis Technologies
   </company>
   subsidiary, fully exiting the semiconductor equipment business. As part of its bid to reduce debt, the company sold its automotive electronic switch division and its commercial and residential air conditioning and refrigeration division, in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eaton sold its naval controls unit (shipboard integrated electrical power distribution and control systems) to
   <company id="11879">
    DRS Technologies
   </company>
   for $92 million in 2002. Later in the year Eaton signed a deal with
   <company id="41854">
    Volvo
   </company>
   to manufacture heavy-duty transmissions for the company's South American truck market. Eaton also bought the product lines and the intellectual property of the Aerospace Division of Mechanical Products Inc. In 2003 the company completed the acquisition of
   <company id="116515">
    Delta PLC
   </company>
   's electrical division for $215 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Eaton acquired
   <company id="13007">
    Powerware
   </company>
   , an uninterruptible power supply and power management system manufacturer, from Invensys for $560 million. The following year the company acquired Walterscheid Rohrverbindungstechnik GmbH, the tube connecting systems business of
   <company id="90167">
    GKN plc
   </company>
   , for about $48 million. It also bought the Chinese hydraulic hose fitting maker Winner Group Holdings Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005 Eaton spent $30 million for Brazil-based Pigozzi, a maker of powertrain products (transmissions, rotors, etc.) for agricultural machines such as tractors and harvesters. It bought Mexican manufacturing company Morestana, further strengthening its Latin American holdings. Morestana, formerly a subsidiary of
   <company id="52689">
    DESC
   </company>
   , made hydraulic lifters for automotive manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the domestic front, Eaton bought the industrial filtration business of
   <company id="44187">
    Hayward Industries
   </company>
   in 2005. Hayward Filtration operated plants in Asia, Europe, and South America and had annual sales of about $100 million. It sold its products to the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and utilities industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eaton also made moves to build up its aerospace fluid and air division with two acquisitions in 2005. First it bought that division of
   <company id="57756">
    Cobham plc
   </company>
   for $270 million, and then it bought a similar operation from
   <company id="10490">
    PerkinElmer
   </company>
   . The acquisitions rounded out Eaton's aerospace business, allowing the company to provide a more complete fluid and air system package.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again in the field of filtration products, Eaton decided to go head-to-head with
   <company id="11156">
    Parker Hannifin
   </company>
   in the quest to acquire
   <company id="119753">
    domnick hunter
   </company>
   . Parker Hannifin had already reached an agreement to purchase the British manufacturer of filtration products when Eaton jumped into the fray with a bid that topped Parker Hannifin's. In the end, Parker Hannifin upped its own bid and Eaton dropped out of the running. In 2006, however, Eaton struck again in the industrial filtration market when it bought the Ronningen-Petter business unit of
   <company id="110250">
    Dover Resources
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Eaton continued its string of acquisitions when it purchased Synflex, a maker of thermoplastic tubing and hoses, from materials giant
   <company id="40729">
    Saint-Gobain
   </company>
   . Later that year Eaton bought almost all of China-based Senyuan International Holdings, which made circuit breakers and other electrical components.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2006 Eaton agreed to acquire the aerospace business of
   <company id="57320">
    Argo-Tech
   </company>
   for $695 million in cash and assumed debt, a move that complemented the fuel systems business picked up in the acquisition of Cobham Aerospace. Argo-Tech's aerospace business made high-performance aerospace engine fuel pumps and systems, airframe fuel pumps and systems, and ground fueling systems for commercial and military aerospace markets. The transaction closed in 2007. Prior to the closing, AT Holdings (the parent company of Argo-Tech)  was reorganized to exclude the company's cryogenics line and other non-aerospace businesses from the sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines to
   <company id="14127">
    BorgWarner
   </company>
   . The division's products included high-pressure solenoids for automated transmissions, and rail diesel and gasoline engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Eaton sold its automotive mirror controls business to funds managed by Englefield Capital LLP for $111 million. The company continued its international growth through acquisitions, as well. In 2008 it bought the Moeller Group, a German provider of electrical components and industrial controls, for $2.2 billion. A few months after the acquisition Eaton offered about 17 million shares to the public in order to pay down some of its debt and help finance its acquisition of Moeller.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also bolstered its medium-voltage motor control products offerings in 2007 when it bought SMC Electrical Products. Later that year, the company acquired the small systems business of
   <company id="112816">
    MGE UPS SYSTEMS
   </company>
   from
   <company id="42920">
    Schneider Electric
   </company>
   for $612 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2008 Eaton filled product gaps in its uninterruptible power supply (UPS) portfolio through joint ventures and acquisitions, spending in excess of $2 billion in the expansion. The majority of the acquisitions focus on the electrical sector, including Phoenixtec (Taiwan), Babco Electric, Pulizzi Engineering, Balmen Electronic (Spain), Power Protection (Prague), and Aphel Technologies. As part of its deal for the Moeller Group, Easton gained a 50% stake in Micro Innovation Holding AG. Micro Innovation is recognized for manufacturing human machine interfaces, programmable logic controllers, and input/output devices. In 2009 Easton scored the remaining 50% ownership of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eaton expanded its automotive product line by acquiring Kirloskar Oil Engines (India), and by entering into a joint venture with Nittan Global Tech to manage the global design and production of engine valves. Taking over Integ Holdings (UK), the parent company of valve and manifold maker Integrated Hydraulics, also boosted Eaton's Hydraulics business in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Eaton obtained
   <company id="138698">
    Wright Line Holding
   </company>
   to round out its product lineup. Wright Line is now a subsidiary and manufactures customized enclosures, rack systems, and air flow management systems for IT data centers. That year Eaton also bought privately held CopperLogic, which made electrical and electromechanical systems. The purchase bolstered the already extensive product offerings in its electrical business and expanded sales of its Moeller brand components for the control, components, and automation markets in North America. Additionally, Eaton acquired the Tuthill Coupling Group, a division of
   <company id="44503">
    Tuthill Corporation
   </company>
   , for an undisclosed amount. Tuthill Coupling Group made pneumatic and hydraulic couplings and leak-free connectors used in industrial applications. That deal enhanced its fluid conveyance business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired German industrial hydraulic systems maker Internomen Technology Group to expand its filtration product line. The deal added sales and distribution subsidiaries in India, China, and Brazil. The company also bought electrical equipment distributor and engineering services provider C.I. ESI de Colombia that year to expand its presence in Colombia, particularly among electrical equipment makers and distributors.
