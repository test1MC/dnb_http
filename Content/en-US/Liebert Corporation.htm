  <p>
   The company's operations date back to 1946, when entrepreneur and inventor Ralph Liebert established Capital Refrigeration Industries. Capital specialized in refrigeration equipment for emerging technologies. Cooling mainframe computer rooms assumed more importance as the company grew. Ralph Liebert built the first prototype for cooling electronics and previewed it for
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   . The computer company made arrangements for Liebert to unveil the new system at the World Computer Conference in 1965. The presentation led to a batch of orders and the creation of Liebert Corp.
