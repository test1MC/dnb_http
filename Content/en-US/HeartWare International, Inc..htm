   HeartWare International makes hardware for your heart. The firm's proprietary heart pump is an implantable device designed for patients suffering from advanced-stage heart failure. The pump, branded as HVAD (for HeartWare Ventricular Assist System), is used for people who can't undergo a heart transplant or who are on a waiting list for a heart to become available. The HVAD is small, fits above the diaphragm (not the abdomen, like other VADs, which makes it less invasive) and can generate up to 10 liters of blood flow per minute. HeartWare is a development-stage company; the HVAD is approved for sale in Europe and Australia. Medical device maker

  <p>
   In mid-2016 HeartWare was acquired by medical device firm Medtronic for $1.1 billion. It joined Medtronic's Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division. Medtronic, which has a strong portfolio of cardiovascular devices in its portfolio, will be positioned to advance HeartWare's HVAD pipeline to the market.

  <p>
   HeartWare is also developing a Miniature Ventricular Assist System (MVAD) to further reduce the invasiveness of the implant procedure. A second product in the company's pipeline is an implanted electronics device, called a Transcutaneous Energy Transfer (TET) system, which would eliminate the need for an external battery pack.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   HeartWare's products are approved in about 50 countries, including the US and nations in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Headquartered in Massachusetts, the company also has facilities in Florida (manufacturing), Minnesota (innovation center), and Germany (distribution and customer service). Since its 2013 acquisition of CircuLite, it also rents space in New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for nearly 60% of sales.

  <p>
   The company markets its products through a direct sales force. In some European markets, it also uses medical device distributors.

  <p>
   Revenues has generally been on the rise for the past five years. In 2015, revenue fell 1% to $277 million despite higher product sales due to negative impacts of foreign exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   HeartWare has incurred net losses every year since its inception, including 2015 when its net loss increased 275% to $73 million. This was due to higher spending in the areas of R&amp;D, marketing, and administration. At the end of 2015 the company's accumulated deficit totaled $421.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow has been declining. In 2015 it dropped to $0.5 million, a 97% decline from the prior year.

  <p>
   HeartWare lost CE marking in Europe for its CircuLite Circulatory Support System (acquired in 2013). The following year, the firm discontinued the manufacture of the CircuLite micro pump to instead focus on its MVAD pump.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been successful in expanding the HVAD line's market penetration in the US, as evidenced by higher product sales.
