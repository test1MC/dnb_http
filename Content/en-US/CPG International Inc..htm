   When it comes to CPG's building products, appearance is key. Through its AZEK, Scranton, and Vycom operating segments, CPG is a leading manufacturer of synthetic building products and other materials used in residential remodeling and construction, as well as by commercial and industrial clients, in the US and Canada. Its core AZEK unit manufactures PVC-based residential products such as trim, deck, rail, moulding, and porch materials made to look like wood and other natural materials. CPG's Scranton unit makes polyurethane bathroom partitions and lockers for commercial and institutional end-users, while Vycom makes PVC plastic sheeting for industrial uses. CPG's TimberTech unit makes decking and railings.

   and was converted into a limited liability company.

  <p>
   CPG is focused on capitalizing on the economic and functional advantages of its products relative to wood, metal, and other synthetic products. It grows its product offerings partly through acquisitions of (and partnerships with) complementary businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company formed a partnership with
   <company id="136260">
    Boise Cascade
   </company>
   Building Materials Distribution to distribute TimberTech products throughout California and the Carson City area of Nevada.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 it acquired TimberTech, a decking and railing manufacturer and a subsidiary of Ohio-based Crane Group Co. CPG combined TimberTech with its AZEK business to boost its strength as a leading manufacturer in the trim, decking, and railing market. Both have strong distribution channels in the US and Canada.

  <p>
   CPG filed to go public in 2011. The company intended to use a significant portion of the proceeds that it raised in its IPO (up to $150 million) to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. However, the IPO never went through and the company was acquired in 2013. Prior to this deal CPG was majority owned by
   <company id="43091">
    AEA Investors
   </company>
   , which acquired its stake in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company got its start in the mid-1980s as a plastic sheet manufacturer; it subsequently expanded its product offerings during the 1990s to include bathroom partitions and, later in the decade, residential building products.
