   Would a perfumer by any other name smell as sweet? Inter Parfums certainly hopes not. Most of the fragrance developer and manufacturer's revenue is generated by sales of its prestige fragrance brands, including Karl Lagerfeld,

   , Lanvin,
   <company id="57416">

   , Repetto,
   <company id="102683">
    S.T. Dupont
   </company>
   , and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, among others. (The company owns the Lanvin and Jean Philippe brand names.) It also sells moderately priced perfumes, personal care products, and cosmetics for specialty retailers, such as

   The New York-based fragrance company rings up nearly 40% of its sales in Europe. North America contributes more than a quarter of total revenue, followed by Asia with more than 15%. Inter Parfums has distribution centers in New Jersey, and Paris, France.

   Inter Parfums' European subsidiary, publicly-held Paris-based
   <company id="162268">
    Inter Parfums, S.A.
   </company>
   , makes and markets the company's prestige fragrance lines (82% of 2013 net sales). The European arm has distribution operations in Germany, Italy, and the UK. The fragrance maker's three wholly-owned subsidiaries in the US are Jean Philippe Fragrances, Inter Parfums USA, and IP Beauty (formerly Nickel USA). Asia, with its seemingly insatiable thirst for luxury brands, is a fast-growing market for Inter Parfums, accounting for 17% of sales in 2013. To strengthen its position in prestige fragrance, in July 2013 the company signed a 10-year exclusive license agreement to create, produce, and distribute perfumes and related products under London-based luxury lingerie brand, Agent Provocateur.

   <company id="102913">
    Burberry
   </company>
   was the company's most significant license, with Burberry products accounting for 23% of net sales in 2013 (down from 50% in 2011). However, Burberry bought out its license rights at the end of 2012, terminating its agreement with Inter Parfums in the second quarter of 2013.

   The company-owned Lanvin brand accounted for 15% of sales in 2013, with licensed brands Montblanc and Jimmy Choo, representing 15% and 13% of net sales, respectively.

   Following three consecutive years of sales and profit growth, Inter Parfums reported a 14% decline in 2013 sales, to $563.6 million, and 70% plunge in net income, to $39.2 million. The company blamed lower sales in all of its markets, with Europe and North America posting the largest reversals. The termination of the
   <company id="102913">
    Burberry
   </company>
   license in the second quarter of 2013 depressed sales and profits for the year.

   While the loss of the
   <company id="102913">
    Burberry
   </company>
   business was a significant blow to the fragrance maker, Inter Parfums is sticking to its strategy of focusing on high-profile prestige brands. Indeed, prestige scents accounted for 82% of 2013 sales (versus 90% in 2011) and many of its licensing agreements extend to 2020 and beyond. Recent licensing deals include an agreement with France's Repetto, a maker of dance and dance-inspired shoes and accessories, that expires in 2024. The first fragrance from the new partnership launched in 2013. Other growth initiatives include extending its global distribution footprint, and building its specialty retail business. The company is also looking to expand beyond fragrances to fragrance-related and personal care products under some of its existing brands.

  <p>
   Jean Madar and Philippe Benacin founded Jean Philippe Fragrances in 1985 to make knockoff fragrances in the US, and took it public three years later. Jean Philippe bought fragrance and cosmetics rights from Jordache Enterprises in 1990. The next year it bought Inter Parfums S.A., a French affiliate Madar and Benacin founded in 1983. Jean Philippe took that subsidiary public in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company aggressively expanded its markets and product line. In 1994 Inter Parfums S.A. acquired trademarks for a variety of fragrances from Parfums Molyneux and Parfums Weil, and Jean Philippe bought the worldwide trademark for Intimate and Chaz from
   <company id="48062">
    Revlon
   </company>
   . From Chesebrough-Pond's, Jean Philippe acquired rights that year to Cutex nail enamel and lipsticks (later relinquished) and Aziza eye makeup, which brought it greater access to mass-merchandise channels such as
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later Jean Philippe launched Romantic Illusions, a collection of eight perfumes packed in cartons designed to look like romance novels. Sales declined in 1996-97, partly due to increased US competition, economic turmoil in Russia, and lagging sales in Brazil. (The company closed its Brazilian subsidiary in 1998.) Also in 1998 Jean Philippe developed a line of medium-priced fragrances (not knockoffs).
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Jean Philippe decided to take the name of its primary sales vehicle, subsidiary Inter Parfums S.A., adding an Americanized "Inc." to the end. France's
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH
   </company>
   , which bottles
   <company id="92686">
    Christian Dior
   </company>
   and Givenchy perfumes, upped its stake in Inter Parfums to 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inter Parfums launched its Paul Smith line of fragrances in 2000 and announced plans for a new line of bath products under the Burberry name. Two years later the company purchased certain mass-market fragrances and inventories of bankrupt and now-defunct rival
   <company id="14614">
    Tristar Corporation
   </company>
   and also signed a license agreement with Diane Von Furstenberg to market her fragrance and beauty products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2004 Inter Parfums acquired a 68% interest in Nickel S.A., a men's skin care company with 1,700 outlets in Western Europe and the US, as well as men's spas in Paris and New York. The acquisition cost Inter Parfums approximately $8.3 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inter Parfums signed an exclusive worldwide licensing deal in 2006 with sports manufacturer and retailer
   <company id="14526">
    Quiksilver
   </company>
   for a namesake and Roxy line of personal care products. As part of the deal, Inter Parfums developed and distributed Roxy fragrance, sun care, skin care, and related items, and Quiksilver sun care and other products. The two parties agreed to early termination of the agreement in mid-2010 (about six-and-a-half years earlier than originally scheduled).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company replaced
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH's
   </company>
   YSL Beauté as the licensing contractor for Van Cleef &amp; Arpels in 2006. Inter Parfums inked the deal to add a jewelry brand to its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2011, Inter Parfums signed a 13-year license agreement with Repetto, known for its dance and dance-inspired shoes and accessories.
