   PT&amp;P maintains a 24-hour emergency on-call engineering and manufacturing service that offers a guaranteed response time of 30 minutes to emergency requests submitted online. Other services include 3D printing that shows customers the design in a full-3D image of a product before it is made at the factory, stress analysis, and engineering. The company's proximity to the Houston Ship Channel, one of the largest ports in the world, makes it a convenient supplier to projects around the world.

   It operates through four subsidiaries. Pipe Shields manufactures insulated pipe supports for commercial and light and heavy industrial applications, as well as pipe riser clamps. U.S. Bellows creates metallic and fabric expansion joints for use in chemical and petrochemical refining, exhaust, HVAC, and waste water applications.

   Sweco Fab makes pressure vessels, bellmouth reducers (used in the cooling process of petrochemical refining), and pig launchers. "Pigs" are inspection gauges used to perform various operations on a pipeline without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline. Pigs get their name from the squealing sound they make while traveling through a pipeline. Fronek Archor/Darling produces hydraulic and mechanical snubbers that are used for controlling shock and vibration.
