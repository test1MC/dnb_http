   With pork and turkey from the US, flour from Haiti, and sugar from Argentina, Seaboard has a lot on its plate. The diversified agribusiness and transportation firm has operations in some 45 countries in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Africa. Seaboard sells its pork and poultry in the US and abroad. Overseas it trades grain (wheat, soya), operates power plants and feed and flour mills, and grows and refines sugar cane. Seaboard owns a shipping service for containerized cargo between the US, the Caribbean, and South America; it has shipping terminals in Miami and Houston and a fleet of about 20 vessels (two owned, the rest chartered) and ships to ports worldwide. Seaboard is run by descendants of founder Otto Bresky.

  <p>
   Seaboard ranks as one of the nation's top five pork producers based on sows in production. It's also a top-10 pork processor based on daily processing capacity. In the US, Seaboard is a leading producer and processor of pork with operations in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, Utah, and Montana. (It has the capacity to produce about 4 million hogs annually.) Despite what some consider to be an industry oversupply of pork, Seaboard has significantly expanded its pork business with an emphasis on private-label preseasoned pork products. It markets some of its pork products under the Prairie Fresh (in the US), Seaboard Farms (international), and Daily's brands. The company has an agreement with Missouri-Based Triumph Foods to process and market all of Triumph's pork products. Seaboard owns 50% of Butterball
  </p>
  <p>
   Overseas, the company operates mainly commodity merchandising, grain processing, sugar production, and electric power generation (in the Dominican Republic). In addition to shipping and the trading of sugar, pork and commodities, Seaboard grows and processes citrus and sugar and has distillery operations in Argentina; it manufactures ethanol and has trucking transportation operations in the US. It also owns jalape√±o farms in Texas and Honduras.

  <p>
   Kansas-based Seaboard is a global company that serves several segments, such as agribusiness and ocean cargo transportation, in about 45 countries, specifically in the Americas, the Caribbean, and Africa. Its largest market is Central and South America and the Caribbean, representing nearly 40% of annual sales. Africa and the US are other big markets for the company.

  <p>
   After several years of consistent sales growth, Seaboard stumbled in the past two years. After a 3% dip in 2014, sales dropped 14% to $5.6 billion in 2015. Lower commodity prices struck Seaboard's revenue, particularly in its commodities trading segment, down 14%, and pork, off 22%. Sales were also lower in all its geographic markets. Higher cargo volumes produced more revenue in the marine segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seaboard's net income fell 53% in 2015 to $171 million from the reduced revenue and higher expenses. For the year, the company generated $42 million more in cash, up to $416 million, compared to 2014.

  <p>
   Seaboard has been expanding its processing and delivery infrastructure, at home and abroad, to be as efficient as possible. It has also been moving into non-food related operations, including fuel alcohol and electricity generation in Argentina and refined coal processing in the Oklahoma.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seaboard isn't going quite whole hog, but it is expanding its pork production capacity with new production plants in Iowa (in partnership with Triumph) and in Missouri (through its Daily's brand).

  <p>
   In September 2014, Seaboard's processed meats division sold a 50% stake in Daily's Premium Meats to its processing partner, Triumph Foods, for $72.5 million, making Seaboard and Triumph co-owners of the business. The sale provided additional capital to expand production and geographic reach of the Daily's brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2013, Seaboard acquired a 50% stake in a flour milling business in Gambia for about $9.1 million.

  <p>
   Otto Bresky founded his company as a flour broker in 1916. He acquired his first flour mill in Atchison, Kansas, in 1918 and the following year purchased the Imperial Brewery Co. in Kansas City and converted it to a flour mill. Over the next four decades, Bresky ground out a series of acquisitions of milling companies. In 1928 he purchased Rodney Milling Co. and retained the name as the identity for the family business. The company then purchased Ismert-Hincke Milling Co. (1938) and the Consolidated Flour Mills Co. (1950). In 1959 Rodney Milling merged with publicly traded Hathaway Industries and changed its name to Seaboard Allied Milling Corp.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Seaboard Allied became one of the first millers to shift flour milling from the source of the raw materials (the wheat fields of the Great Plains) to the population centers in the Southeast and on the East Coast. In 1962 Seaboard Allied built a flour mill in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It then purchased George Urban Milling Company in Buffalo, New York (1965), and built a flour mill in Jacksonville, Florida (1966). But Bresky's expansionist strategy did not stop at the Atlantic Seaboard. The company acquired a flour mill in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 1966 (a joint venture with Continental Grain Co.), then constructed flour mills in Freetown, Sierra Leone (1968), and Georgetown, Guyana (1969).
  </p>
  <p>
   Bresky retired in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Harry. A chip off the old block, Harry acquired a flour mill in Cleveland, Tennessee, and built flour mills in Buchanan, Liberia, and in Sapele, Nigeria, that year. In 1978 Seaboard Allied acquired Mochasa, Ecuador's leading producer of animal feed, and launched Top Feeds, a mixed-feed plant in Sapele.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing stiff competition in the mill business from agribusiness giants, in 1982 Seaboard Allied sold all its US flour mills to
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   . The company changed its name to Seaboard that year and began expanding outside the US. In 1983 the company formed Seaboard Marine, a shipping business in Florida, to serve its increasingly far-flung enterprises.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to geographic diversification, the company expanded into new agribusiness areas. Seaboard acquired Central Soya's poultry unit in 1984, and it bought the Elberton Poultry Company the next year. Seaboard commenced shrimp farming operations in Ecuador in 1986 and in Honduras in 1987. Two years later Transcontinental Capital Corporation (Bermuda), a subsidiary, began supplying power from a floating power barge to the Dominican Republic.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seaboard entered the hog business in 1990 by acquiring a pork-processing plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. It opened a hog-processing facility in Guymon, Oklahoma, in 1996 and closed the Minnesota plant. That year the company bought a stake in Ingenio y Refinerio San Martin del Tabacal, an Argentina-based sugar cane and citrus company. It then acquired flour-mill, pasta-plant, and cookie operations in Beira, Mozambique.
  </p>
  <p>
   After serving as CEO for more than 30 years, in 2006 Harry Bresky stepped down as CEO (but remained as chairman) and turned over the company's reins to his son, Steven. Harry Bresky died in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Seaboard acquired a 50% stake in
