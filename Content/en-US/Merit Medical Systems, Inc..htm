   When it comes to medical devices, this company believes its merits speak for themselves. Merit Medical Systems makes disposable medical products used during interventional and diagnostic cardiology, radiology, gastroenterology, and pulmonary procedures. The company's products include catheters, guide wires, needles, and tubing used in heart stent procedures, pacemaker placement, and angioplasties, as well as products for endoscopy, dialysis, and other procedures. Merit Medical sells its products as stand-alone items or in custom-made kits to hospitals and other health care providers as well as to custom packagers and equipment makers worldwide.

        <p>
   The company's largest operating segment -- accounting for more than 95% of sales -- is its cardiovascular division, which makes cardiology and radiology devices for the diagnosis of arterial and vascular disease, among other conditions. Offerings include stand-alone devices, custom procedure trays and kits, inflation devices, and catheters. It also includes embolotherapy products, which use bioengineered microspheres to create targeted vascular occlusion (the blockage of blood vessels) and drug delivery.
  </p>
        <p>
   Merit Medical's much smaller endoscopy segment makes devices for gastroenterology and pulmonary treatments, including minimally-invasive treatment of throat and biliary constriction from malignant tumors. The endoscopy operations are conducted through Merit Medical's Endotek subsidiary.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also conducts selected manufacturing of custom medical kits and components for third parties through its OEM division.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Though the US accounts for more than 60% of sales, the company is focused on growth in overseas markets. It experienced a 37% increase in international sales during 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   Headquartered in South Jordan, Utah, Merit Medical has a major manufacturing and distribution center in Ireland. It also has manufacturing centers in Texas and Virginia in the US, as well as in the Netherlands and France.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Marketing and sales efforts in the US and abroad are conducted through a direct sales force of about 200 representatives, as well as through independent distributors and manufacturers. Products are marketed to hospital and clinic-based medical professionals in fields including cardiology, radiology, gastroenterology, pulmonary medicine, vascular surgery, pain management, and thoracic surgery.

        <p>
   Continuing on its growth trajectory over the last five years, Merit Medical's revenues grew by 10% in 2012 thanks to increased sales from its cardiovascular and endoscopy segments. The increase in sales of guidewires, hemostasis valves, catheters, and custom kits and trays attributed to growth in the Cardiovascular segment, and a rise in sales of the EndoMAXX esophageal stent helped to grow revenue in the Endoscopy segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income has fluctuated, however, as Merit Medical has worked to balance costs with earnings. The company's net income decreased by 14% due to higher operating expenses, primarily from the expansion of its sales and marketing force, as well as higher R&amp;D costs. In 2011 jumped by 85% in 2011 due to increased sales volumes, higher gross margins, and a lower effective income tax rates.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Though a sizable part of Merit Medical's strategy is growth by acquisition, the company also invests about 5% of its annual income in research and development efforts. In 2012 the company got FDA clearance to market the Merit Laureate hydrophilic guide wire, as well as its 30-60um QuadraSphere Microspheres and its ONE Snare endovascular system. Also in 2012, the company made several investments to expand its international sales and distribution network, especially in emerging markets such as Brazil, India, and Russia.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In early 2016, Merit Medical acquired the HeRO Graft product line for end-stage renal disease from CryoLife for $18.5 million. The HeRO Graft is a hemodialysis access graft used in patients who have catheter-dependent because of vein blockage. As part of the deal, Merit Medical gained worldwide marketing rights, customers, equipment, and inventory.
