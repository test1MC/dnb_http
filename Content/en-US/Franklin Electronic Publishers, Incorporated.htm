   Barry Borden, Russell Bower, and Joel Shusterman founded Franklin Computer as a PC maker in 1981. Despite initial success, the company soon ran into a legal buzz saw when it was hit with a $2.5 million judgment in a copyright infringement suit brought by Apple Computer (now called Apple). The company filed for bankruptcy in 1984, and Morton David replaced Borden as CEO. Emerging in 1985, Franklin began concentrating on handheld computers.

   In 1986 the company went public and introduced its Spelling Ace dictionary. It adopted the Franklin Electronic Publishing name in 1990. Two years later Franklin launched its first medical product, the Med-Spell dictionary. It introduced its BOOKMAN electronic book product line in 1995. Franklin acquired a license to sell personal organizers under the ROLODEX trademark in 1996. It unveiled its REX personal organizer the following year.

   David resigned as CEO in 1997. Andrew Cross replaced him in 1998 but was replaced by Barry Lipsky the following year. The company sold the REX product line to Xircom in 1999.
