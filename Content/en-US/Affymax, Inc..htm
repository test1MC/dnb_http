   Affymax is training peptides to give red blood cells a pep talk. The biotechnology firm is researching and developing drugs based upon peptides, which can help regulate biological processes. Its leading drug candidate, Omontys (peginesatide), was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2012 as a treatment for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. Affymax believes Omontys, which was developed and commercialized through a partnership with Japan's
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   , will prove to be cheaper and longer lasting than the EPO stimulants currently used on dialysis patients. However, the product was recalled in 2013 due to adverse reactions to the drug.

  <p>
   Up until it gained approval to market Omontys, the development stage company earned all of its revenues from its partnership with
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda
   </company>
   . Omontys is a synthetic peptide-based erythropoietin (EPO) agent, designed to stimulate red blood cell production like EPO itself. The Japanese firm equally shares rights to market Omontys in the US with Affymax.

  <p>
   Affymax's revenues jumped by 98% in 2012 thanks to $60.3 million in milestone payments from Takeda related to
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval of Omontys, the European Medicines Agency' acceptance for review of the Marketing Authorization Application submitted by Takeda, and commercial progress on the Omontys product launch, and other factors. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other reimbursements from Takeda.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss grew by 52% in 2012 due to an increase in operating expenses as the result of the impairment of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments resulting from a product recall, and higherselling, general ,and administrative costs stemming from higher commercialization expenses (including setting up a field sales force).
  </p>

  <p>
   Takeda pays Affymax milestone payments based on clearing development and regulatory hurdles; it will also pay royalties on sales of the drug. Affymax must in turn make some payments to
   <company id="20013">
    Nektar Therapeutics
   </company>
   , from which it originally licensed the compound. In addition, Nektar and Takeda handle manufacturing of the raw ingredients and finished Omontys product, respectively; Affymax has no manufacturing capabilities of its own.
  </p>
  <p>
   The companies originally planned to market the drug as Hematide, but later changed its name to Omontys. Takeda also has full rights to develop peginesatide for international markets and is pursuing regulatory approval for the drug in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Affymax uses all of its income to support its research and development of Omontys and to prepare Omontys for its commercial launch. While the company originally had several candidates in its pipeline, it has since pinned all of its future on Omontys. Affymax also dropped efforts to develop the drug for other forms of anemia to focus on the chronic kidney disease application. Like many drug developers, Affymax has yet to turn a profit and doesn't expect to do so until it has established successful commercial operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, in a major setback in 2013 Affymax and Takeda announced a nationwide voluntary recall of Omontys, and suspended all promotional and marketing activities related to the drug after reports of serious allergic reactions were reported by some patients receiving Omontys.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a related move, that year Affymax granted Takeda an exclusive worldwide license to market Omontys in return for Takeda taking full responsibility for the drug, the recall, and the investigation by the FDA.

   Affymax was originally founded in 1988 in the Netherlands and was acquired by what was then Glaxo Wellcome eight years later. In 2001 a team of venture capital firms bought Affymax and its associated intellectual property from Glaxo Wellcome successor
