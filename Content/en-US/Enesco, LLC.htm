   Enesco collects cash from collectibles. The company is a global marketer of porcelain and cold-cast collectibles (such as figurines and cottages), giftware (including ornaments, music boxes, and plush animals), garden accessories, and home décor (tableware and sculpture). Enesco's 25,000-item products portfolio includes the Cherished Teddies line of figurines and Gregg Gift faith-based items, as well as licensed brands, such as

   ,

    Gund
   </company>
   , and Pooh &amp; Friends. It sells products through some 44,000 card and gift retailers, home décor chains, mass merchants, and catalogs in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The company is owned by Balmoral Funds.

   In late 2015 private equity firm Balmoral Funds purchased Enesco to adfor an undisclosed sum. Balmoral said the purchase would expand its consumer products portfolio but it only currently owns electronics and boat manufacturers in that space.

  <p>
   An influx of working capital has allowed the collectibles marketer to more aggressively move ahead with its strategic plans to leverage opportunities in the marketplace. To this end, Enesco opened a new showroom in Las Vegas in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enesco's avenue for growth has been primarily through licensing deals. In 2014 Enesco entered a licensing agreement with Suzy Toronto, the creator of the Wonderful Wacky Women artwork, to produce mugs, stationery, bags, and totes. Enesco's Gregg Gift faith-based division boasts a licensing deal with the Vatican Observatory Foundation to create a broad assortment of merchandise inspired by the Vatican collections. The collection includes rosaries, crucifixes, nativity scenes, ornaments, figurines, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company renewed its agreement with Jim Shore until 2019. Alongside licensing deals, Enesco plans to grow through strategic acquisitions and internal brand development.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2014, the company rested its Boyds brand (with the option of bringing it back later), due to a drop in quality and the rising costs of manufacturing and materials.

   To fuel future growth, Enesco in mid-2012 completed a new $82 million senior bank facility led by

  <p>
   Enesco filed for bankruptcy in January 2007. A month later, investment firm EGI Acquisition, an affiliate of Tinicum Capital Partners II, bought Enesco and its unsecured liabilities and took the company private.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1958.
