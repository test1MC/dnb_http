   Synthomer (formerly Yule Catto) focuses on supplying water-based polymers and synthetic latex, which it supplies to such markets as coatings, construction, adhesives, and textile and paper industries. It operates through its Synthomer and Revertex units, which have manufacturing plants across Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Rim, and South Africa and produce about 800,000 metric tons of polymers annually. In 2011 it almost doubled in size by acquiring emulsion polymer supplier Polymer Latex Deutschland (PolymerLatex). Shortly afterward, Synthomer sold noncore pharma chemicals unit Uquifa. Malaysian plantation company

   owns nearly 19% of the company.

  <p>
   Although the company is based in the UK, Yule Catto's heritage can be traced back to the first Lord Catto's swashbuckling exploits in Malaysia in the 1800s. Catto's arrival was part of an influx of British interests that occurred shortly after English adventurer James Brooke was appointed "Rajah" of the principality of Sarawak (in present-day Malaysia) in 1841. The present-day incarnation of Yule Catto was first registered in 1908 as a rubber plantation in Malaysia called Malaya General Company Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1971 the company acquired Yule Catto Ltd and changed its name to Yule Catto &amp; Co. Ltd. In 1982 Yule Catto &amp; Co. re-registered as a public company and added "plc" to its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rubber remained a staple for Yule Catto well into the 20th century, accounting for nearly half of the company's earnings in 1984. By 1990, however, rubber represented only a tenth of its sales. As a result of poor sales figures and a lagging economy, Yule Catto sold its Malaysian rubber plantations in 1990 to concentrate on more-profitable interests such as chemicals, building materials, and textiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yule Catto strengthened its place in the building-materials market in 1992 when it acquired Transplastix (architectural glazing). German synthetic rubber producer Synthomer Chemie GmbH joined the fold in 1993. In a cost-cutting move, Yule Catto closed its Dutch building-materials subsidiary, Nijs en Vale, in 1994. The next year it bought a 49% stake in Dhahran Harco Chemical Industries, a Saudi Arabia-based producer of synthetic resins.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company added PFW Aroma Chemicals (the Netherlands) to complement Yule Catto's other fragrance entities, such as Oxford Chemicals. With the 1998 purchase of Holliday Chemicals (organic fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals), Yule Catto expanded its sales base in France, Italy, Spain, and the US. The company also organized its specialty chemicals business into three units: polymer, performance, and pharma and fine chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Yule Catto formed Uquifa to bring its UK fine-chemicals operations together. Chairman Lord Alexander Catto retired that year; he was succeeded by director Anthony-Richmond Wilson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yule Catto added new plants in Spain (fine chemicals) and Malaysia (synthetic laytex) in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yule Catto's polymer unit (about half of sales) has grown primarily through the acquisition of Harlow Chemical, but the deal did substantially increase the company's debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company expanded its nitrile capacity in Malaysia and acquired a dispersions company in Vietnam while selling off noncore performance chemical units to pay down debt. To raise cash, in 2008 Yule Catto sold its Holliday Pigments subsidiary, which mades ultramarine pigments, to Rockwood Specialties for about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2012 Yule Catto changed its name to Synthomer to align itself with its most well-known brand.
