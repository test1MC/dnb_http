   Aleris is a global leader in the manufacture of aluminum rolled products. The company's rolled and extruded products unit makes aluminum products for manufacturers operating in most major industries (including aerospace, automotive, building and construction, distribution, molding and tooling, and transportation). To raise cash, in 2015 the company sold its North American and European Recycling and Specification Alloys businesses to an affiliate of Signature Group Holdings for $525 million. Facing a tough commodity market, in 2016 Aleris agreed to be acquired by China's Zhongwang International in a $2.3 billion deal.

  <p>
   The company saw a continuous decline in revenues for four years prior to 2015. Revenues recovered by 1% to $2.9 billion due to a 5% decline in Europe and a 2% decline in North America, partially offset by a3% growth in Asia-Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aleris' revenue decline in Europe was due to a stronger US dollar, while the drop in North America was due to lower aluminum prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income saw a decline in over last five years except in 2014. Net income decreased by 44% to $49 million in 2015 due to the decline in benefit from income taxes and higher restructuring charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aleris' operating cash flow has followed the revenue trend of the last five years. In 2015 it reported operating cash flow of $120 million compared to no operating cash flow in 2014 due to a change in inventories.

   The company plans to continue to grow their core business and enhance its product mix, supply higher value alloys targeting aerospace, automotive and other transportation industries. It also intends to expand the company's global operations where we see the opportunity to enhance its manufacturing capabilities, grow with existing customers, gain new customers or penetrate higher-growth industries and regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's research and development organization includes three locations in Europe, one in Asia, and one in North America, focused on new product and alloy offerings and process performance technology.

That year it also sold its extrusions business to Sankyo Tateyama (a Japanese building products and extrusions manufacturer) for $33.5 million.
