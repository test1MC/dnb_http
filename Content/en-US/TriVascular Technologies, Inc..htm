   TriVascular has a triple-A solution. The firm produces medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA, a ballooning of the main vessel delivering blood to the abdominal cavity). It uses principles from other industries, including aerospace and automotive, to develop unique solutions for unmet medical needs. Its only current product, the Ovation System, treats AAA through minimally invasive endovascular aortic repair (EVAR); the device can be customized to each individual patient's specific anatomy. TriVascular sells its product in the US, Germany, and the UK. The firm was formed in 1998 and went public in 2014; in early 2016 TriVascular was acquired by
   <company id="51718">
    Endologix
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company raised $78 million in its IPO, with plans to use the proceeds to repay debt, expand its sales and marketing efforts, and for R&amp;D.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 TriVascular agreed to be acquired by fellow AAA specialist Endologix in a $211 merger transaction. The combined firm will offer Endologix devices AFX and Nellix and TriVascular's Ovation, creating a portfolio of three complementary products. Launches of new products are also planned in 2016.

  <p>
   TriVascular conducts its own R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and manufacturing. It has the capacity to significantly expand its manufacturing capabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company leases office, R&amp;D, and manufacturing space in Santa Rosa, California. It also leases space in Dallas; Dresden, Germany; Milan, Italy; and Nyon, Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, the Ovation System is sold in about two dozen countries in Europe and North America. The US accounts for about 70% of revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany, TriVascular sells the Ovation System directly to hospitals and physicians. It has a direct sales force of 60 representatives and about 10 clinical specialists.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other international sales (in markets including Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey) are conducted through distributors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Since it began commercializing the Ovation System, TriVascular's revenues have seen strong growth. Revenue increased 63% to $31.8 million in 2014 on higher product sales, especially in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company's net loss increased 15% to $58 million that year as R&amp;D and administrative expenses rose. TriVascular expects to continue reporting net losses for the foreseeable future as it works to expand the market for its products. Its accumulated deficit totaled $295.9 million at the end of 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased to $53 million that year.
  </p>

  <p>
   TriVascular's two primary pillars for growth are expanding the market for its Ovation System (by training professionals and broadening awareness of the product) and expanding its product portfolio (with a focus on AAA treatments).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched its CustomSeal technology in Europe; the CustomSeal polymer O-ring helps physicians put  Ovation System grafts in place. Later that year, TriVascular gained
   <company id="144161">
    FDA

   approval for CustomSeal in the US. In 2015, the FDA approved two additional Ovation graft products.
