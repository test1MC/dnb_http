   Aura Systems is charging ahead with its AuraGen electric generator, which can produce 8,500 watts of power from an idling car engine. Companies in the telecommunications, utilities, and oil and gas industries use the AuraGen to generate mobile power; the military version of the AuraGen is marketed as the VIPER. RV maker

    Country Coach
   </company>
   announced plans in 2004 to install the AuraGen on its Prevost model. Aura Systems also is entitled to royalties from

    Daewoo Electronics
   </company>
   for use of electro-optical technology found in projection TVs. The company gets about 80% of its sales in the US.

   Aura Systems started in 1987 as a military/aerospace company engaged primarily in the Star Wars satellite defense project. In 1989 the company decided that instead of leaving all its eggs in the Star Wars basket, it would develop commercial products using electromagnetics technology. Further moving away from military markets, its AuraSound unit began building speakers in 1990. Two years later it began receiving licensing royalties from Daewoo Electronics for its electro-optics technology.

   To catch the wave of the surging PC market, in 1994 Aura created NewCom to produce sound, video, and multimedia computer products. That year Aura created Auratech (industrial tools) as a joint venture with Detroit Tool Center (bought outright in 1995). Aura developed an electromagnetic actuator for the auto industry in 1995. The company's acquisition of Japan-based MYS Corporation in 1996 helped expand Aura's line of high-end speakers. The company took NewCom public in 1997.

  <p>
   In 1998 Aura began commercial production of its AuraGen electromagnetic actuator. It sold its MYS unit the next year, and debt-laden NewCom shut down when Deutsche Financial Services terminated the company's credit line. The company also lost its NASDAQ listing in 1999 when it couldn't meet that exchange's standards. In 2000 Aura's auditors issued a warning about the company's future as a going concern; the auditing firm -- Pannell Kerr Forester -- later resigned.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aura's hopes of collecting royalties from Daewoo became more complicated in 2001 when that company came to be run by its creditors.
