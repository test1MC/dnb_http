   When "the die has been cast" for this company, metal components get fabricated. PMS Diecasting is a fabricator of die cast metal components. The company's machining centers are engaged in the broaching, drilling, reaming, and tapping of parts made primarily from zinc. PMS Diecasting also makes zinc die cast toolings, chrome handle ends, center cleats, support pins and mounting brackets. The company's other services include bead blasting and vibratory finishing and drying. Employee-owned PMS Diecasting serves customers in the automotive, domestic appliance, general hardware, heating and ventilation, and leisure products industries, among others.

  <p>
   Widely regarded as one of the best equipped zinc diecasting facilities in Europe, the company uses robotics wherever possible to streamline its processes and maximize the consistent quality of our work.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's casting equipment and its metal dies involve large capital costs, which can limit high volume production.

  <p>
   PMS has made a significant investment in GoTools Ltd which has the latest computer numerical control equipment to manufacture tooling which delivers a quality casting but also ensures its demanding cycle times are achieved to keep the casting cost as low as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its advanced technologies include 3D Laser Scanning, 3D Portable Laser Scanning, Avocet, Gripple, Gripple Angel Hanger, and Loadhog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Laser scanners capture the entire part geometry for inspection or reverse engineering purposes, covering both freeform surfaces and geometric features. Laser scanners are used with coordinate measuring machines and the resulting digital copy forms the backbone of a powerful digital inspection process that streamlines inspection processes, reduces time to market and cuts development costs.
