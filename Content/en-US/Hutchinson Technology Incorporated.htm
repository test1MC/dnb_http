   Suspensions at Hutchinson Technology have nothing to do with getting kicked out of school. The company is a top global maker of disk drive suspension assemblies. These support the read-write head above the spinning magnetic disk in hard drives, typically at a height of about a millionth of an inch -- 3,000 times thinner than a piece of paper. The company's products include conventional assemblies, trace suspension assemblies, and accessories such as base plates and flexures. Hutchinson serves OEMs primarily in Asia, which accounts for most of its revenue. The company generates minimal sales from biomeasurment devices for the healthcare market.

  <p>
   Hutchinson Technology maintains manufacturing plants in the US in Minnesota and Wisconsin. A smaller plant is located in Thailand. While it makes most of its products in the US, Asia accounts for the majority of sales. The US contributes less than 5% of sales.

   Hutchinson markets its products through a direct sales force and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   A small number of customers account for most of its business because of consolidation within the disk drive industry. In fact, SAE Magnetics/TDK,

  <p>
   The demand for disk drives is cyclical and heavily impacted by economic conditions. As such, Hutchinson has seen a dramatic drop in sales and net income since the economic recession hit in 2008. In fiscal 2013 (ended September) revenue remained flat after dropping about 10% the prior year. That year it shipped 404 million suspension assemblies, compared with 392 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also reported a net loss that year of $35 million, slightly better than the $48 million loss in 2012. It was able to reduce the loss by cutting the cost of sales; R&amp;D expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; debt refinancing costs, and insurance recoveries from flooding in Thailand, the company's largest market.

  <p>
   Industry consolidation and what Hutchinson terms supply chain alignment -- such as Western Digital's 2012 purchase of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies -- is reducing the number of Hutchinson's customers. In some cases, consolidation has also given customers the ability to make their own suspension assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to stem the flow of red ink, Hutchinson has reshaped its business with the goal of being the industry's lowest-cost producer of suspension assemblies. It has lowered its overall cost structure by improving operating efficiencies and transitioning more assembly production from the US to Thailand and continuing to consolidate its US operations. The Wisconsin plant is scheduled to be wound down by 2015. The move allows Hutchinson to be closer to its customers in Asia but also enjoy the lower costs of operating there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hutchinson has used its technical expertise to expand into the medical sensing device market. Products include two medical monitoring products for hospital use, the hand-held InSpectra StO2 Spot Check, and the InSpectra StO2 Tissue Oxygenation Monitor. Hutchinson believes its products could tap into what may become a multi-billion dollar market.

  <p>
   Jeffrey Green (chairman) and Jon Geiss founded Hutchinson Industrial in 1965 in Geiss' hometown of Hutchinson, Minnesota. The company set up shop in a converted chicken coop and began providing photoetching services. Its first big contract was to provide circuit boards for mainframe computer maker Sperry (now
   <company id="11548">
    Unisys
   </company>
   ). Geiss left the company in 1982, the year it changed its name to Hutchinson Technology. During the early 1980s the company expanded operations to produce disk drive products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hutchinson Technology's continuing development of suspension assemblies for ever-smaller read-write heads, which increased disk drive performance, led to a shift to nano head assemblies (a billionth-of-an-inch measurement). In 1995 it began making assemblies for pico heads, measuring a trillionth of an inch.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened new production facilities in 1996, but pricing pressures caused income to dip. Also that year longtime president Wayne Fortun was named CEO. Fiscal 1998 turned out to be an unhealthy year for the company as softness in the disk drive market mixed with a technology transition led to a loss. Hutchinson responded to continuing weak demand in 1999 by consolidating production operations and cutting staff; the company returned to profitability that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hutchinson's stint in the black proved short-lived. Slumping demand for suspension assemblies, due in part to improvements in hard disk technology, led to more layoffs and consolidation in 2000 and 2001. In 2001 the company licensed its trace suspension assembly technology to rivals Magnecomp International and NHK.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2002 Hutchinson won FDA clearance to sell a fiber-optic medical device used to measure oxygenated blood in tissue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company returned to profitability in 2002. In 2003 Hutchinson signed long-term contracts with certain disk-drive manufacturers. The following year the company inked joint development and supply agreements with two leading customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Richard Penn, the company's VP of operations since 2003, was promoted to SVP and named president of the Disk Drive Components division, Hutchinson's main line of business, in late 2005.
