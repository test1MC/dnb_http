   Utility Trailer Manufacturing likes to play it cool. The company is one of the largest manufacturers of refrigerated trailers (aka reefers) in the US. The company also produces dry freight trailers, flatbeds, side skirts, and its branded Tautliners curtain-sided trailers. Its refrigerated trucks include special designs for the whole food distribution and fast-food markets, such as trucks with separate chambers for frozen and dry goods. A handful of factories in the US makes its more than 140 brands of trailers and vans, which are distributed through a network of 100 independent dealers. The privately held company is family operated.

   Utility has also tackled rising fuel costs and the onslaught of environmental regulations impacting the transportation industry by shifting its manufacture to lightweight trailers. It has launched several new models including an improved refrigerated trailer, followed by a lighter weight, composite material-based dry freight van, the first in the industry to earn
