   Cymer operates with a laser-light focus. The company is a top maker of excimer lasers, light sources used by chip makers to pattern advanced semiconductors. Its products let semiconductor manufacturers produce smaller, faster microchips. Cymer supplies deep-ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) light sources to lithography tool manufacturers, who integrate the light sources into wafer steppers and scanners supplied to chip makers. Cymer also provides replacement parts and support through OnPulse, with sales based on the number of pulses used by customers on the light sources covered under the program. In 2013 the company was taken private by

   Netherlands-based ASML, one of the world's leading makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, acquired Cymer in February 2013 for â‚¬1.95 billion (about $2.5 billion). The purchase will aid ASML in its pursuit of next-generation chips for smartphones and tablets.

   Cymer has made most of the excimer laser systems now in use, and continues to introduce advances (such as systems that use krypton flouride instead of argon fluoride light sources) that are on the technological forefront. Its technological differentiation plays up the ever-shrinking features of semiconductors and the growing need for photolithography systems to operate within specific nanometer dimensions.

   Most of its products are manufactured in the US, though refurbished replacement parts are produced in South Korea. The company also maintains customer support field offices located across China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US.

   - represented almost 60% of sales. Customers in the US represented about a third of sales.

   Chip makers are looking for ways to extend current technologies as the circuits gets smaller and closer together. Cymer's technologies are a part of that effort. In 2014, Cymer  increased the yield of silicon wafers made with EUV technology to 500 per day, meeting a target set by its customers. The 2015 productivity target is 1,000 wafers per day. In 2014, Cymer and ASML received orders for the fourth-generation NXE:3350B systems. Two previously delivered XE:3300B systems were to be upgraded to NXE:3350B level performance.
