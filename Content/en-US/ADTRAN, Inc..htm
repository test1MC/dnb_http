   ADTRAN turns copper and fiber into gold. The company offers more than 1,700 network access products and systems used to enable Internet access, telephony, data transport, and video over voice and data networks, from traditional copper wire to optical. ADTRAN sells its switches, routers, multiplexing systems, and other carrier-grade equipment to wireline and wireless service providers such as
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10315">
    CenturyLink
   </company>
   . Its enterprise networking equipment ranges from modems to larger integrated access devices for multiple users, access routers, multiplexers, firewalls, and radio equipment. ADTRAN sells directly and through a network of distributors to a mostly US-based clientele.

  <p>
   ADTRAN continues to adapt its line of carrier products to serve customers in the academic, corporate, and government markets. Its carrier networks division accounts for about 83% of sales. The enterprise networks division, which makes up the other 17% of sales, offers products to build voice, data, and video networks within a customer's site or among distributed sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key products include the NetVanta Business Application Server, which is based on
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft's
   </company>
   Windows platform, and can handle up to 200 concurrent calls. NetVanta routers support 3G data services. The NetVanta line is designed to help customers streamline business processes and improve customer service using existing communications systems.

  <p>
   The company has a manufacturing plant for some lower-volume, higher-mix products in Alabama. It also maintains research and development centers in Arizona and Massachusetts, and international locations in Canada, Germany, and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 70% of ATRAN's sales are in the US with another 19% from Germany (mostly from
   <company id="43401">
    Deutsche Telekom
   </company>
   ).

   ADTRAN serves the telecommunications carrier market with a direct sales force for major accounts, and it supplies competitive and independent providers directly and through telecom equipment distributors, such as
   <company id="48020">
    Ingram Micro
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="42267">
    ScanSource
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="101209">
    SYNNEX
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, three customers,
   <company id="10315">
    CenturyLink
   </company>
   , Deutsche Telekom, and
   <company id="151491">
    Windstream Corporation
   </company>
   , each account for more than 10% of revenue.

   ADTRAN's revenue continued to decline in 2015 with a 5% drop from 2014. Revenue came in at $600 in 2015, compared to $630 million the year before. The company hit peak revenue of $717 million in 2011. For 2015, a weakness in sales of IP gateway products to the competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC) and multiple system operator (MSO) markets drove revenue down.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income tumbled some 58% to $18.6 million in 2015. Profit for that past three years had been in the mid-$40 million range. The sales decrease as well as an increase in the cost of sales led to the lower profit for the company.

  <p>
   The move toward software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) has switched much of networking to software and away from hardware, a trend that's affected ADTRAN. The company is adapting by devoting more of its resources to join the move to software and introduce new networking boxes that can handle the requirements of high speed (a gigabit and more) networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than 80% of ADTRAN's engineering staff is working on software-based projects and embedded designs and it is building -- via software - virtualized functionality in its hardware. The company is in the process of moving its latest passive optical network (PON) technologies from the lab to the market.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reflect and further develop the changes, ADTRAN has changed its revenue reportng structure.It reports financial performance based on two new reportable segments - Network Solutions and Services &amp; Support. In addition to the new reporting segments, it will also report revenue for three categories - Access &amp; Aggregation, Customer Devices, and Traditional &amp; Other Products. The company said the new structure better match its market opportunities and technology development initiatives.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are also a component of the company's plan, and in 2012 ADTRAN acquired the fixed line broadband access products business of
   <company id="156280">
    Nokia Siemens Networks
   </company>
   . The purchase boosted the company's presence in key markets, particularly overseas, and expanded its selection of equipment used to deliver high-bandwidth services such as streaming video. The deal also resulted in ADTRAN equipment becoming part of Nokia Siemens Networks' third-party product selection.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to build its line of wireless networking products for businesses, the company acquired Burlington, Massachusetts-based
   <company id="105925">
    Bluesocket
   </company>
   in 2011. Bluesocket operates as a business unit of ADTRAN within its enterprise networks group.

  <p>
   Mark Smith, Lonnie McMillian, and John Jurenko founded ADTRAN in 1985 to capitalize on the breakup of
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   . Smith established modem maker Universal Data Systems in 1970, and became a VP at Motorola (now
   <company id="11023">
    Motorola Solutions
   </company>
   ) when it acquired Universal Data in 1979. After 15 years at Universal Data, he left to start ADTRAN. Smith chose the name ADTRAN (from "advanced transmission") to be near the top of alphabetical listings. ADTRAN soon won customers among the regional Bells and other phone companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADTRAN introduced its high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL) phone transmission products in 1993. By 1994 -- the year it went public -- the company had made a dent in the market, including continuing pacts with
   <company id="10200">
    BellSouth
   </company>
   and Sprint (now
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint Nextel
   </company>
   ). Also in 1994 ADTRAN began a five-year, $50 million expansion of its research, engineering, and assembly facility in Huntsville, Alabama.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 ADTRAN started focusing on foreign sales and distribution channels. (It later developed technology to meet overseas standards.) The company also diversified its product development by entering the wireless communications market in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADTRAN introduced its first line of microwave-based transmission products in 1998. Also that year the company opened an engineering and design center in Phoenix. The company won new supplier contracts from Bell Atlantic and GTE (which combined to form
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon Communications
   </company>
   ) in 1998 and from Sprint in 1999. Also in 1999 the company expanded into Europe when it opened an office in Zurich.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smith went on medical leave in 2000; president and COO Howard Thrailkill took the CEO reins until Smith returned to his post in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADTRAN bolstered its carrier networks division when it acquired resilient packet ring (RPR) and metro Ethernet technologies from Luminous Networks in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 ADTRAN moved into the unified communications market with its acquisition of Objectworld Communications Corporation for $1.5 million in cash. The following year the company unveiled its NetVanta line, largely based on Objectworld's product portfolio.
