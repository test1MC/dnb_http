   Not afraid to play the heavy, Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) is the world's largest shipbuilder and among the top five manufacturers in heavy industries. Started in 1972, HHI's shipbuilding division builds containerships, tankers, bulk/petrochemical carriers, drill ships, and specialty vessels. HHI also offers offshore construction and exploration services, and it has expanded into robotic systems and large industrial pumps and presses. Additionally, HHI makes diesel engines and engine parts for industrial and marine applications. Other HHI offerings include electric systems (circuit breakers, switchgear, transformers) and construction equipment (excavators, forklifts, and loaders).

  <p>
   HHI operates through several business divisions: Construction Equipment, Electro Electric System, Engine and Machinery, Green Energy, Industrial Plant and Engineering, Offshore and Engineering, Financial Services, Oil Refining, and its bread and butter, Shipbuilding.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Construction Equipment segment is capitalizing on China's infrastructure market, flooded with government stimulus funding. HHI's excavators claim more than a 10% share of China's excavator market. The company operates manufacturing plants in China as well as India that position HHI to capture an increasing share of the countries' construction equipment growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Offshore and Engineering business operates a 292-acre offshore yard and fabrication shop for engineering and construction of offshore oil and gas facility projects. The Industrial Plant and Engineering business works on industrial plant projects for power generation, desalination, and oil and gas processing and capitalizes on burgeoning work in the Middle East and South America. Despite a drop in marine engine and power engine demand pressured by the slow economy, the Engine and Machinery business continues to benefit from HHI's move into China, India, and other developing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another small business of HHI is its Electro Electric Systems segment, which manufactures and installs electrical systems in power plants, locomotives, subways, and marine vessels. The business' performance is buoyed by the increase in replacement electrical equipment for renovating and upgrading power transformers and other facilities in North America, as well as building new facilities in the Middle East and other rapidly modernizing regions.

  <p>
   Research and development is also bolstering HHI's reach into profitable niche markets related to its established presence. Shipbuilding, HHI's largest business, represents roughly 35% of sales and revenues. In fiscal 2013, its net sales decreased 1% compared to 2012. The primary cause of the marginal dip in sales was a decrease in sales from its Oil Refining and Offshore and Engineering segments.
