   MannKind seeks to improve the well-being of, well, mankind. The biopharmaceutical company focuses on developing and commercializing therapeutic products to treat diabetes and cancer. Its lead product, AFREZZA (launched in the US in 2015), uses its Technosphere inhalation system technology to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The system consists of a special inhaler that releases deep into the lungs a formula of dry powder insulin that could raise insulin levels more quickly and with less discomfort than other methods. The company is also developing therapeutic cancer vaccines that could be injected directly into a patient's lymph nodes.

  <p>
   To facilitate the delivery of its Technosphere-formulated drugs, MannKind developed an inhaler called MedTone that uses single-use, disposable, plastic cartridges containing the drug-loaded powder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pipeline products include Epinephrine (for anaphylaxis), Treprostinil (for hypertension), and Palonosetrn (for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy), all of which utilize its Technosphere system.

   Headquartered in California, MannKind also has manufacturing and development operations in Connecticut.

  <p>
   MannKind holds the global development and commercialization rights for AFREZZA, which it markets through a growing direct sales force. It plans to begin marketing directly to consumers, including airing a television commercial. The drug is available from pharmacies throughout the US.

  <p>
   In the past, Mannkind has generated revenues from licensing agreements, but it has not generated any revenue since 2013. To continue operating, the company has sold equity securities and convertible debt securities, as well as borrowing funds and receiving milestone payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net loss increased 86% to $368.4 million in 2015 due to increased operating expenses such as product manufacturing and property and equipment impairment. As of the end of the that year, the company had an accumulated deficit of $2.9 billion.

  <p>
   After receiving a

   </company>
   delisting notice due to its sinking stock prices, MannKind announced plans a reverse stock split in 2017 to stay on the exchange.

  <p>
   MannKind is searching for partners to help market AFREZZA in the US and other key markets after former partner
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   announced plans to stop selling the drug in 2016. AFREZZA is the sole inhaled insulin product on the market, but shortly before it was introduced, a new class of oral diabetes drugs was brought to the market. This likely had an impact on AFREZZA's sales, which underwhelmed Sanofi.
  </p>
  <p>
   MannKind was so committed to getting AFREZZA approved that it halted clinical testing of most of its other product candidates in order to reserve its cash flow. The firm was developing seven different compounds for diabetes, cancer, and obesity; it halted all of them except AFREZZA and two cancer candidates. MannKind kept the intellectual property and assets related to all of its drug candidates in case it decides to restart development activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 the company released a new version of AFREZZA which is designed to provide patients with increased dose flexibility. MannKind is also seeking to expand abroad, and has filings planned in nations including Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil.
