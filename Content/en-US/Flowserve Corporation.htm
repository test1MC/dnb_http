   Flowserve is positively pumped about flow control equipment. Its engineered product division (EPD) makes pumps and mechanical seals, while the industrial product division (IPD) makes pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems. The flow control division (FCD) makes valves and actuators that control the flow of liquids and gases. Flowserve also provides services that include installation, diagnostics, repair, and retrofitting. Flowserve's client base includes customers in the chemical, oil and gas, power generation, and water management industries. The company operates in more than 50 countries.

  <p>
   In addition to making its 50+ branded products in about 30 manufacturing facilities around the world, the company operates a network of 125 Quick Response Centers (QRC) that provide aftermarket equipment services. The US generates nearly 35% of its total sales while Europe brings in nearly 40%; Asia, 12%.

  <p>
   Flowserve divides its operation across three segments. The engineered product division (EPD) generates around 50% of its total sales each year, while the flow control division (FCD) brings in around 30%. The industrial product division (IPD) accounts for the remainder of revenue.

  <p>
   The company sells its products and services to more than 10,000 companies. About 40% of its sales come from the oil and gas industry. Its products support global infrastructure industries, including the oil and gas, chemical, power generation (including nuclear, fossil and renewable), and water management sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flowserve distributes its products through direct sales teams that are assigned to specific regions, industries, and products. The company also uses distributors and sales representatives to supplement its direct sales force. About 40% of its sales come from the oil and gas industry.

  <p>
   Flowserv's revenues dipped by 6% from 2014 to 2015. This was due to a 12% decline from each of its EPD and FCD segments. Both segments experienced lower demand for its products within the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the chemical and general industries. Sales dropped 11% across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; it also experienced a 26% drop in sales from other international countries in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits also fell 48% from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a spike in selling, general and administrative expenses related to realignment programs and acquisition-related costs. In addition, Flowserve has seen its operating cash flow fluctuate over the years; after climbing in 2014, cash flow decreased by 27% in 2015.

  <p>
   Organic growth, acquisitions, technology and innovation, and joint ventures continue to fuel Flowserve's performance. Flowserve believes that incorporating advanced technologies into its products will increase the appeal of its product portfolio. To that end, Flowserve has been concentrating on the commercialization of new technologies and has partnered with universities and other experts through consortiums to expedite the development time for new products and services. The company spends about $35 to $41 million on product development each year.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company enhanced its industrial product division through the purchase of SIHI Group B.V. (SIHI), based in the Netherlands. SIHI is a global provider of engineered vacuum and fluid pumps and related services, primarily servicing the chemical market, as well as the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and other process industries. Flowserve paid $342 million as part of the deal that strengthened its extensive portfolio of products and services through the addition of its engineered vacuum and fluid pumps, as well as the associated aftermarket services and parts.
