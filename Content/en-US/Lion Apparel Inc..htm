   Lion Apparel increases its product portfolio and attracts additional clients through the use of acquisitions. In 2012 it bought BullEx Digital Safety and HAAGEN Fire Training Products, two providers of fire and safety training systems and centers. The Albany, New York-based BullEx and The Netherlands-based HAAGEN companies were integrated into a new division called the LION Training Resources Group. In 2011 Lion Apparel snapped up Wisconsin-based Safeguard America, a maker of the FireGuard brand of protective structural firefighting gloves and apparel.
