   The company bolsters its operations through the opening of additional facilities and through acquisitions. As a part of its focus on providing point-of-sale expertise to targeted customers, in 2014 Menasha Packaging purchased Pennsylvania-based Strine Printing Company in a deal that enhanced its graphic packaging, merchandising, and fulfillment capabilities and boosted its presence on the East Coast.

  <p>
   In 2013 it obtained Rand Diversified, a POP-focused display firm, in a deal that extended its presence along the East Coast and enhanced its expertise in the areas of contract packaging and fulfillment for over-the-counter pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies. Menasha Packaging in 2012 fortified its traditional packaging operations with the pickup of The Strive Group, an integrated merchandising supply chain company based in the important metropolitan region of Chicago.
