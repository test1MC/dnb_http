   Flush with tradition, Thomas Crapper restores antique bathrooms and continues to make the Victorian and Edwardian sanitary ware that long ago made its name. Founded in 1861 by the eponymous Thomas Crapper, this venerable plumbing-fixtures company supplied the private facilities of King Edward VII and King George V. It was acquired by a rival in 1963, but later resumed business as an independent company. Products include cistern pulls and chains, wooden toilet seats, cast-iron and copper bathtubs, sink basins, shower rails, and towel racks. The company admits that its name inspired a slang word for the toilet, but disclaims responsibility for other vulgarities.

   Thomas Crapper continues to trade on the name of its famous founder and embraces the rich history of the company and its products. In fact the company is obstinate in creating historically accurate bathroom fixtures. Although the company may use modern materials and methods when necessary, its dedication to creating historically accurate products is apparent in all aspects from production (everything is made in the UK) to distribution (mostly online and through catalogs with a few select retailers) to price.
