   Traditionally the company generated a small portion of its revenues marketing to the public safety market through its command systems division. That unit, which does business as Positron Public Safety Systems, provided radio dispatch consoles, mapping and vehicle location applications, and 911 call handling systems. In 2008 IPC sold those operations to
   <company id="52565">
    West Corporation
   </company>
   for $167 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   IPC filed to go public in 2008, but it withdrew its registration later that year.
