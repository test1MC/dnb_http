   The Emission Control Technologies segment accounted for 35% of the parent company's revenues in 2012. Faurecia also got 27% of its revenues from North America that year. North American revenues were up 19% in 2012 as the result of growing light vehicle production, Faurecia's commercial momentum (

   The company is taking advanced of the increased public to control pollutant emissions, especially in the developing world which has seen a rapid growth in automobile use.

   In 2013 Faurecia Emissions Control Technologies established a new joint venture with Suzhou PowerGreen Emission System Solution Co. Ltd, to jointly manufacture emissions control systems in Shanghai for Guangxi Yuchai Machinery, one China's largest commercial engine makers.

  <p>
   Faurecia Exhaust Systems capitalized on the accelerating recovery after the automotive industry's near-collapse in 2009. In late 2010 Ford announced plans to retool its assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, and produce a new fuel-efficient vehicle. Faurecia Exhaust Systems has responded with a $5 million investment to ramp up a neighboring manufacturing plant. The move nearly doubles its plant's workforce as well as gains $2.5 million in state tax incentives.
