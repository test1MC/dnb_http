   Tokyo Electron America (TEA) is the North American sales and field engineering arm of
   <company id="53860">
    Tokyo Electron Limited
   </company>
   (TEL), the world's second-largest supplier of semiconductor production equipment (behind
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   ). As part of its focus, TEA sells and services the equipment made by its parent company, which also includes machines for probing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductor production equipment, electronic components, wafers, and flat-panel display fabrication equipment. TEL/TEA is also delving into the new market of nanotechnology equipment. Tokyo Electron's sales to customers in the US account for about 12% of its total global business.

   TEA serves at its parent's sales and service subsidiary. TEA operates its $300 million research center -- the TEL Technology Center America -- in conjunction with the

    University at Albany

   in New York State as part of its R&amp;D activities.

   To increase its market share and remain competitive, TEA opted to outsource its service parts logistics in recent years. Previously, TEA had handled more than 50,000 parts internally. It enlists the help of UPS Supply Chain Solutions to serve as its logistics provider.

   The late 2013 announcement that TEA's parent plans to merge with top competitor
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   may mean a change in how TEA operates in the near future if the deal is approved by multiple regulators for completion.
