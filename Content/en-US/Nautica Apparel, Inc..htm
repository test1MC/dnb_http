   Explorers once sailed the ocean blue, unmindful that their legacy would live on in a global apparel brand. Launched under the spinnaker logo in 1983, Nautica designs, makes, and retails men's sportswear, outerwear, underwear, swimwear, and sleepwear. It also licenses the Nautica name in the US for women's and children's clothing and nonapparel (fragrances, footwear, furniture). Nautica, which is owned by brand behemoth
   <company id="11572">
    V.F. Corporation
   </company>
   , is marketed to department store and boutique wholesale customers, as well as sold through some 80 VF-operated Nautica retail outlets and website. Independent licensees sell the lineup through some 150 Nautica stores, mostly in Asia, the Middle East, and North and South America.

   iBathrobe and activewear company State-O-Maine was founded in 1971. Harvey Sanders, once a company sales trainee, took over as CEO six years later. In 1984 Sanders bought a small sportswear maker called Nautica for $500,000 and then changed State-O-Maine's name to Nautica Enterprises to focus on the new brand. While Nautica's own stores stayed healthy, sales through other retailers were the real wind pushing its expansion. The company doubled the size of its store-within-a-store operations two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nautica formed a joint venture in 1997 to begin marketing apparel in Europe. The next year the company bought back its denim business from licensee Seattle Pacific Industries. Nautica also sold its private-label sleepwear business in 1998 and launched two new lines: NST-Nautica Sport Tech (activewear and accessories for young men, discontinued in early 2001) and Nautica Ladies Robes and Sleepwear.

   In 1999 the company signed licensing agreements with Marchon Eyewear for eyewear and Unilever for fragrances. Nautica also launched the Nautica Jeans Company brand that year. The John Varvatos contemporary line of menswear joined the list of Nautica brands in 2000. The company also opened four outlets dedicated to jeanswear. Designer John Varvatos partnered with parent VF Corporation in early 2005, when VF sold a 20% interest to Varvatos to fund the formation of John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc., of which Varvatos serves as president and CEO.

   In April 2001 Nautica ended its licensing agreement with Hampton Industries to market children's wear under the Nautica label; Nautica then established a subsidiary, Nautica Children's Company, to bring the line in-house.

   In 2001 Nautica also bought upscale denim product maker, Earl Jean. In 2003 the company deftly moved its Earl Jean headquarters to New York City in order to better compete within that segment of the apparel market; both moves made the product all the more attractive to potential buyers, which in 2003 included

   and VF Corporation, the latter eventually winning the bid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eager to reach into niche markets, Nautica in 2005 inked a deal with fragrance firm Coty to develop, make, and market fragrance and beauty products under the Nautica name.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened its first free-standing stores in Bangalore and New Delhi, India in May 2006.
