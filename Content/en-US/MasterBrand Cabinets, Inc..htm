  <p>
   Buoyed by the recovery in the housing market and, consequently, increasing demand for its cabinets, MasterBrand plans to invest about $8 million to expand its production facility in Ferdinand, Indiana. The funds will be invested in equipment to add additional capacity and expand the product offering at the 500,000-square-foot facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   MasterBrand's strategy for building momentum counts on a sustained investment in products and customer service. The company regularly rolls out net products, such as its series of new door designs, color palettes, and features touted to help consumers customize their kitchen at a lower price.
