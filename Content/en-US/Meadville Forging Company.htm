   Meadville makes more than 25 million wheel hubs a year, which represents more than half of the US domestic auto market for automobiles and light trucks. It does not supply directly to the auto industry, but rather works with first-level suppliers like

    Delphi

   and
   <company id="11484">
    Timken
   </company>
   .
  </p>

   Meadville operates 13 forging press systems from 1,000 to 4,000 tons. It uses electric induction heating to ensure uniform controlled temperature to reduce scale formation, improve surface quality, and extend die life. The company offers in-house services from start to finish, and uses the latest technology including pulse-plasma ion-nitriding, heat treating with oil quench capabilities, and robotics in machining. It conducts spectrometry testing on all shipments of raw steel to ensure the quality of the metal.
