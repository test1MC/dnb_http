   No longer called monkey bars or jungle gyms -- they're "playscapes" and Playworld Systems makes them, along with a lot of other things that would probably make you wish you were a kid again. The company manufactures a variety of structures for climbing, sliding, skating, and exercising under the brand names PlayDesigns, Playworld, NEOS (electronic playground systems), and LifeTrail (outdoor exercise stations). Playworld customers include schools, parks and recreation departments, retirement communities, churches, and residential housing developers. In addition to its various products, Playworld offers playground owners advice about budgeting, needs, and risk management. In 2016 playground manufacturer
