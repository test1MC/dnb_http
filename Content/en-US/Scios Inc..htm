   Scios goes straight to the heart of the matter. The company, a subsidiary of health care giant
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , develops treatments targeting cardiovascular disease. Its flagship product Natrecor is an intravenously administered drug approved by the FDA for treating patients with acute heart failure who also experience shortness of breath with minimal activity. When the drug was introduced in 2001, it was the first new treatment for heart failure in more than 14 years. The drug is not without controversy, about both its long-term health effects and the company's marketing of it. Scios maintains the drug is safe and has launched a large clinical trial.

   Scios has its roots in California Biotechnology, an R&amp;D lab started in 1981 by E.F. Hutton investor William Baker and scientist John Baxter. Two years later the company went public. It changed its name in 1992 to Scios ("to know" in Latin) and merged with Nova to create Scios Nova. Nova brought its sales of psychoactive drugs and a broader research portfolio (anti-inflammatories and small-molecule synthesis) to the union. In 1993 Scios Nova spun off its neurological research unit as

    Guilford Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Auriculin, its lead product candidate, had been shown to reduce the need for dialysis, and in 1995 the firm signed a deal with biotech company
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   to market Auriculin worldwide. After shortening its name to Scios in 1996, it suspended development of Auriculin in 1997 after disappointing results in human trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Undeterred, the company pushed ahead with new products. In 1997 Scios teamed with
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   to research treatments for Alzheimer's disease and partnered with
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   to develop cardiac hormone BNP. The next year the firm teamed with
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   to market Natrecor. Scios also agreed to promote popular antidepressant Paxil in the US for SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline or GSK). That year it suspended some trials of Fiblast after safety questions arose. Scios suffered another setback in 1999 when the FDA denied approval for Natrecor, and Bayer backed out of its development agreement. It trimmed 30% of its workforce and sold some facilities. These troubles also led to a proxy fight in 2000 with frustrated minority shareholders. The FDA's approval of the drug, though, in 2001 proved to be a big boost.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its pipeline, in 2001 Scios stopped selling the psychiatric drugs it had licensed from GSK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scios was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2003.
