   American Electric Technologies (AETI) tames wild and woolly wiring. Its technical products and services segment makes low- and medium-voltage switchgears for land- and offshore-based oil and gas drilling, as well as refineries and municipal power companies. The electrical and instrumentation construction unit makes electric power delivery and control products and provides technical field services and electrical and instrumentation construction services. American Access Technologies makes zone-cabling cabinets for telephone lines, data networking, and security systems.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AETI has sales, support, and manufacturing operations in Beaumont, Texas; Keystone Heights, Florida; and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. It has minority interests in three joint ventures located in Xian, China; Singapore, Indonesia; and Macae, Brazil.
  </p>

  <p>
   AETI operates through three segments: technical products and services (72% of sales), electrical and instrumentation construction (17%), and American Access Technologies (AAT; 11%).

  <p>
   The company's customers include oil and gas companies, including off-shore and land drilling, production operators, marine vessels, pipelines, and refineries. It also serves traditional power generation, transmission, co-generation and alternative energy markets, including wind, geothermal, biomass, and solar.
  </p>
  <p>
   AETI markets its technical products and services through direct contact with potential customers by its internal sales organization consisting of eight full-time sales and support employees. The AAT segment markets its zone-cabling products through an exclusive marketing agreement with Chatsworth Products.

  <p>
   AETI's balance sheet has been hampered by the unpredictable nature of the offshore oil drilling sector. While its total sales increased by 33% from 2010 to 2011, it suffered net losses for two straight years. However, the company saw improvement in 2012 when its revenues increased 4% from roughly $52 million to $54 million as it posted a profit of $2.3 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth in 2012 was driven by a 35% surge in sales from its technical products and services segment due to higher demand in mid and downstream oil and gas products and services. This was offset by a 41% and 22% decrease from its electrical and instrumentation construction and AAT segments, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   AETI's positive net income for 2012 was the result of a decrease in operating expenses and provision for income taxes.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company decided to exit the water/wastewater business and focus its electrical and instrumentation construction efforts on markets that are more closely aligned with its overall strategy. Also that year, AETI formed the Automation Group with the acquisition of Texas-based Amnor Technologies, which serves markets that include offshore drilling, marine automation, CCTV systems, and military vessel security with automation and control system technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding outside the US, AETI has created BOMAY Electric Industries, a joint venture with Baoji Oilfield Machinery in China, to build electrical systems for oilfield drilling rigs. In addition, the company has a joint venture with Wiscom Systems to manufacture power converters and inverters for the Chinese wind and solar markets. AETI also has a 49% stake in the Singapore-based M&amp;I Electric Far East, a distributor of electrical and energy-related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   AETI has taken advantage of existing relationships in Brazil, where the chemical oil and gas market is booming. It owns AETI Alliance Group Brazil (AAG), a joint venture with local oil and gas services firm Five Star Services. AAG manufactures its power, distribution, and control systems at Five Star's production facility. Extending into Brazil even further, AETI in 2012 acquired Assort Services LTDA, based in Rio de Janeiro. Assort provides electrical system commissioning, emergency electrical equipment services, and power system upgrade services for the offshore oil and gas market. The deal enabled AETI to accelerate its customer service reach across the Brazilian Campos Basin and other deep water regions.
