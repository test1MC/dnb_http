   You might say the company is the pathfinder star for a giant in the beverage business. Constellation Wines U.S. (CWUS) oversees the domestic winemaking operations of its parent, New York-based

    Constellation Brands
   </company>
   . No matter the state of your pocketbook or degree of wine connoisseurship, CWUS offers a complete range of US-made vintages. They include super-premium and luxury wines (Estancia, Inniskillin, Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi, and Wild Horse), premium wines (Blackstone, Woodbridge), emerging wines (Barossa, Red Guitar), and specialty and value wines (Arbor Mist, Cook's, Wild Irish Rose, Vendange). CWUS operates 18 wineries and production facilities, most of which are in California.

  <p>
   The company is pursuing a strategy focusing on premium and above wines. To that end, it sold its Inglenook, Paul Masson, and Almenden operations to
   <company id="54506">
    The Wine Group
   </company>
   for $134 million in cash in 2009. Constellation used the funds to pay down debt so that it could better concentrate on premium wine -- which it did with that year's final integration of the operations of Clos du Bois, the #1 superpremium US wine brand, as well as the luxury brand, Wild Horse. (Both labels were acquired from
   <company id="10075">
    Fortune Brands
   </company>
   in 2007.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to increase efficiencies, the winemaker has consolidated its distribution in key markets, signing multiyear agreements with large US beverage distributors

   To fill a gap in its portfolio of pinot noir brands, Constellation Brands in 2012 acquired the Mark West wine brand from Purple Wine Company for about $160 million. In 2011 the company acquired the remaining 50.1% of Ruffino S.r.l., making Ruffino a wholly owned business.

   In late 2007 Constellation Brands acquired Beam Wine Estates, the wine business of Fortune Brands, for $885 million. The deal brought the leading labels of Clos du Bois and Wild Horse into Constellation's already well-stocked portfolio. Five Sonoma County, California, wineries and vineyards with a total of 1,500 acres were also included in the acquisition.
