   If you are feeding your pet anything other than table scraps, you've likely come across Big Heart Pet Brands. Formerly Del Monte Corporation, the company is the leading provider of branded pet food and snacks in the US; its portfolio includes Milk-Bone, Meow Mix, Natural Balance, Kibbles 'n Bits, Gravy Train, and Snausages, among others. Its products are available through grocery stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, specialty pet stores, and supercenters primarily in the US. In early 2014 the company sold its canned fruit, vegetables, and broths business and changed its name from Del Monte to Big Heart Pet Brands. In early 2015 it was acquired by

  <p>
   Fred Tillman adopted the name Del Monte (originally the name of a coffee blend made for the fancy Hotel Del Monte in Monterey, California) in 1891 for use at his newly formed Oakland Preserving Company. Brand-name labeling was becoming a significant marketing tool, and Del Monte ("of the mountain" in Spanish) became known for high value.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1899 Oakland Preserving merged into the California Fruit Canners Association (CFCA) with 17 other canneries (half of California's canning industry). The new company, the largest canner in the world, adopted Del Monte as its main brand name. CFCA merged with other California canneries in 1916 to form Calpak and created national demand for Del Monte products through mass advertising. The company's first ad appeared in the
   <i>
    Saturday Evening Post
   </i>
   in 1917.
  </p>
  <p>
   Calpak expanded into the Midwest in 1925 by acquiring Rochelle Canneries (Illinois). That year it established British Sales Limited and Philippine Packing Corporation. In later years the company expanded into the Philippines. It weathered slow growth during the Depression, but WWII jump-started Calpak's operations -- in 1942 about 40% of the company's products went to feed US troops -- and the postwar boom kicked it into high gear.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought control of Canadian Canners Limited, the world's second-largest canner, in 1956, gaining entry into the heavily protected British market. In the 1960s a venture into soft-drink products ended in failure. Calpak changed its name to Del Monte Foods in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   RJR Industries bought Del Monte in 1979 as part of a diversification strategy. In 1989, after its buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the newly named, debt-laden RJR Nabisco began selling assets, including Del Monte's Hawaiian Punch line in 1990 and its tropical fruit unit.

    Merrill Lynch
   </company>
   and Del Monte executives bought Del Monte's domestic canning operations in 1990, but the transaction loaded the new company with debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce debt, during the 1990s Del Monte sold its dried-fruit operations, its pudding division (to
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   ), and its Mexican subsidiary.
   <company id="51545">
    Texas Pacific Group
   </company>
   , an investment partnership known for recruiting specialists to revive companies, acquired a controlling interest in Del Monte in 1997. It installed Richard Wolford, former president of
   <company id="10303">
    Dole
   </company>
   Packaged Foods, as CEO. That year the company bought Contadina's canned tomato products from
   <company id="41815">
    Nestl√©
   </company>
   (which kept the right to use the Contadina brand on refrigerated pasta and sauces).
  </p>
  <p>
   Interested again in expanding in foreign markets, in 1998 it bought back from Nabisco the rights to the Del Monte brand in South America, and it purchased
   <company id="13122">
    Nabisco
   </company>
   's canned fruits and vegetables business in Venezuela. In 1999 the company completed its IPO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, after years of building its pet food business, Del Monte sold is consumer food business in the US to Singapore-based
   <company id="144800">
    Del Monte Pacific
   </company>
   for $1.675 billion and changed its name to Big Heart Pet Brands.
