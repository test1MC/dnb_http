   SPX Corp. controls the ebb and flow of multiple industries. The company operates in a couple of areas: thermal equipment and services (cooling, heating, ventilation) and industrial products and services (compactors, power systems, broadcast antenna systems, aerospace components). SPX serves core markets which include infrastructure, processing equipment, and diagnostic tools. In turn, these markets support electricity, processed foods and beverages, and vehicle services. It operates in 20-plus countries with a sales presence in 100 countries. In mid-2015, SPX spun off its flow technology operations (pumps, valves, other fluid handling devices).

  <p>
   SPX operates through 45 facilities in more than 20 countries. The center for its Asia/Pacific operations resides in Shanghai, and its European outpost is located in Manchester, UK. It generates almost 75% of its net sales from the US.

  <p>
   After the late 2015 spin-off its SPX Flow operations, the company reorganized its operations into the three segments of Power (56% of net revenue), HVAC (31%), and Detection and Measurement (13%).

  <p>
   SPX serves the HVAC and industrial, residential and commercial, and power generation sectors. It also targets the power transmission and distribution market.

  <p>
   SPX's revenues dropped significantly from 2014 to 2015 as its sold its SPX Flow operations at the end of 2015. The company also posted a net loss of $83 million in 2015 associated with the loss of income from the spin-off. (Note: its 2014 annual report was restated due to the selling of these operations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   SPX experienced Power segment declines in 2015 due to a reduction in revenues associated with the segment's large power projects in South Africa as a result of revised estimated revenue. A decrease in organic revenue in 2015 was also mainly due to lower sales of power generation equipment and power transformers due to weak demand within the power generation market.

  <p>
   Acquisitions and divestitures are a large part of SPX's growth strategy. In late 2015 SPX spun off its flow technology operations into a standalone publicly traded company:
   <company id="61808">
    SPX Flow Technology
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Paul Beardsley and Charles Johnson founded SPX in 1911 as The Piston Ring Company. The company, which had its start making piston rings for major automakers, expanded through a series of acquisitions. In 1931 it changed its name to Sealed Power to reflect the increasing diversity of its products. Expansion continued after WWII, and the company went public in 1955. By 1959 Sealed Power made half of its sales from replacement parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following further diversification and international growth in the 1960s and 1970s, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1972 and changed its name to SPX Corporation in 1988.
