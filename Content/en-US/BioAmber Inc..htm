   BioAmber has discovered quite a few new uses for those waves of grain that can help reduce US dependence on oil. The development-stage company uses the sugars found in wheat and corn to create biosuccinic acid, a chemical building block used as an alternative to petroleum-derived succinic acid. Biosuccinic acid can be used in polyurethane, food additives, lubricants, cosmetics, and personal care products, among other products. Formed in 2008, BioAmber has one contract manufacturing plant in France that has produced almost 500,000 pounds of biosuccinic acid for about a dozen customers. Seeking further growth, the company went public in the US in mid-2013.

  <p>
   BioAmber plans to use the net proceeds from its $80 million IPO to build two more plants, one in Sarnia, Ontario, and the other in Thailand.

   Through its subsidiary Bluewater BioChemicals, BioAmber signed an agreement with Japan's
   <company id="101812">
    Mitsui Chemicals
   </company>
   to jointly build the Canadian plant along with subsidies from the Ontario government. In addition to making biosuccinic acid, the plant will also make bio-BDO, a biochemical used in fiber, plastic, and polyurethane. BioAmber expects the Ontario plant to cost about $125 million with initial construction expected to finish in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The plant in Thailand is expected to be built with Mitsui Chemicals and a subsidiary of
   <company id="153611">
    PTT Chemical
   </company>
   , Thailand's top chemical company, with the hope that PTT will be the plant's main customer. The Thai plant, while still in development, is expected to cost about $200 million. BioAmber also plans for a fourth plant in either the US or Brazil. (Biosuccinic acid can be made from sugarcane, and Brazil grows plenty for its mandatory ethanol program).
  </p>
  <p>
   The technology behind biosuccinic acid was developed by the Dept. of Energy, and BioAmber has  licensing agreements with the DOE, as well as DuPont, Celexion, Cargill, Mid-Atlantic Technology Research and Innovation Center (MATRIC), and Agro-industrie Recherches et DÃ©veloppements (ARD), the French company that owns BioAmber's plant. Besides Mitsui Chemical and PTT, BioAmber has commercial agreements with German chemical company Lanxess (to develop biosuccinic acid-based plasticizers), Belgium plastics and chemical maker Solvay (to use biosuccinic acid in making biodegradable polyvinyl chloride, or PVC), and French sugar producer Tereos (as a possible feedstock supplier).

  <p>
   As a startup, BioAmber has yet to make any significant revenues and is dependent on partnering with larger firms to establish itself and either own or license the technology needed to make biochemicals.
