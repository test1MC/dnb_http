  <p>
   Transcrypt was started in 1978 to make embedded voice privacy and specialized signaling add-on devices for land mobile radios (LMRs). In 1991 a group led by John Connor (former chairman) acquired the company and began diversifying its product lines. By 1993 Transcrypt was developing digital products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing caused a major shift in the LMR industry, as agencies responding to the tragedy had difficulty communicating because their various two-way radios were not standardized. After the bombing, the
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   ordered new communications compatibility among law enforcement agencies. Manufacturers soon adopted the APCO 25 standard for LMRs. Transcrypt launched its APCO 25 line in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Transcrypt bought E.F. Johnson, a struggling two-way radio maker three times its size. The purchase added significant manufacturing capacity, an established distribution system, and a well-known brand name to Transcrypt's competitive arsenal. It also resulted in red ink for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   E.F. Johnson enabled Transcrypt to bid on larger contracts. Demand for its technology by other communications equipment manufacturers grew. But in 1998 Transcrypt was forced to restate 1997 and 1996 financial results, prompting an SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits (the company agreed to settle in 1999). Telemetry executive Michael Jalbert took over as chairman and CEO in 1999, and Transcrypt closed its Hong Kong office. The next year Motorola licensed radio technology from E.F. Johnson, and BearCom agreed to distribute Transcrypt's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, in an effort to return to profitability, Transcrypt discontinued lower-margin commercial products to focus on equipment for the public safety market. The company also used other cost cutting measures, including layoffs, to bring down expenses that year. In 2002, Transcrypt International changed its name to EFJ, Inc. The company's name was later changed to EF Johnson Technologies, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired 3e Technologies International (3eTI) in 2006, adding to its wireless LAN and mesh networking offerings. The deal was valued at $36 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010,
   <company id="128276">
    Francisco Partners
   </company>
   took EF Johnson private in an all-cash transaction valued at about $40 million. Chairman and CEO Michael Jalbert was replaced by 20-year technology veteran Norman Stout on an interim basis when the deal closed. The company later named Andy Adams, a veteran of
   <company id="10709">
    Harris Corporation
   </company>
   and
   <company id="16514">
    Belden
   </company>
   , as its permanent CEO. Stout remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2011, EF Johnson sold 3eTI  to UK-based
   <company id="107426">
    Ultra Electronics Holdings
   </company>
   for about $30 million.
