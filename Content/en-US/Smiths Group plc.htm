  <p>
   Smiths Group has operations in more than 50 countries, with a network of dealers and distributors in many more. North America accounts for more than half of its revenues and around a third of employees.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   About three-quarters of Smiths Group's end users are hospitals, with the remainder comprising the alternate care market, such as homecare, clinics, and other surgery centers, as well as OEM relationships. It has a direct sales presence in more than 20 countries and distribution arrangements in 100 others.

  <p>
   Smiths Group's revenues jumped 2% from 2015 to 2016. This was due to increases across almost all its divisions, including Smith Detection (13%), Flex-Tek (6%), Smiths Medical (5%), and Smiths Interconnect (4%). The company also experienced sizable increases in Japan (9%) and France (5%). (Note: growth rates may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Smiths Group believes that investing in new product development across all lines is a key driver of future sales and continued margin growth. It is also trying to drive more growth through bolt-on acquisitions that add to its technologies and extend its geographic reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   John Crane's business strategy is focused on sustaining a cycle of growth and productivity. It is built around four core priorities: to profit from core products and services, build-out selected growth markets, drive continuous productivity and expand across the energy value chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smiths Medical's primary focus is on improving patient outcomes and reducing the total cost of care by helping healthcare providers solve their clinical needs efficiently and economically. This drives investment in new product development, manufacturing optimization, and improvements in supply chain, marketing, and distribution models.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smiths Detection's strategy is one of balanced growth supported by continuous improvement. Operational savings achieved through ongoing cost control initiatives and elimination of waste will be reinvested in focused development of products and software systems, as well as improvements in aftermarket coverage and service levels. Future product development will be driven increasingly by greater customer insight. Product development priorities remain competitive differentiation and ease of installation, service and upgrade. Operational improvements will be based on value engineering, quality improvements, and continuous improvement initiatives to drive out waste and reduce lead times.

  <p>
   In mid-2016, Smiths Group agreed to purchase
   <company id="114592">
    Morpho Detection
   </company>
   , a maker of law enforcement biometric identification systems, products, and services, for $710 million. Smiths Group is purchasing Morpho from French high-tech industrial firm
   <company id="90795">
    SAFRAN
   </company>
   in an effort to gain additional market share in the always growing security market. After completion of the acquisition, Morpho will be merged with Smiths Group's Detection division.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After opening a clock and watch shop in London in 1851, Samuel Smith waited 20 years before expanding with a second shop. Smith's own clock ran out only four years later, and his son, Samuel Jr., took over the business and began opening additional shops.
  </p>
  <p>
   The skills of watchmakers came into new demand when the age of the automobile was born in the early 1900s. Samuel's son Allan had a hand in inventing the "mileometer," or odometer. The next advance came when King Edward VII stated a desire for a device that showed the speed he was traveling; the first British speedometer was fitted to the king's Mercedes in 1904. That year Smiths opened a motor accessory department at one of its shops on the Strand. People next took to the skies, and Smiths added airplane instrumentation. In 1914 S Smith and Sons (Motor Accessories) Ltd was formed and Samuel Smith became the company's first chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWI the company manufactured shell fuses, wire rope, lighting sets, spark plugs, and signaling lamps. Smiths bought the rights to the industry-standard airspeed indicator from its inventor in 1917. By the 1920s the company's offerings included speedometers, motor clocks, lighting sets, mechanical horns, carburetors, gauges, batteries, and carjacks; its broad range of products enabled it to weather the Great Depression.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, Smiths anticipated WWII, and in 1937 began making plans to disperse production away from London -- an obvious target. By 1940 the company was turning out aviation clocks at its new factory outside Cheltenham. During the war Smiths once again concentrated on equipping fighting vehicles and airplanes.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war the company had four main businesses: motor accessories, aircraft instruments, clocks, and industrial instruments. It also branched out geographically, opening subsidiaries in Australia and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1958 Smiths ventured into the medical equipment business by buying a controlling interest in Portland Plastics and its Surgical Plastics subsidiary. The company changed its name to Smiths Industries Ltd. in 1965.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s the company developed its distribution business through acquisitions as its clock and watch business dwindled. By the end of the decade, Smiths no longer made clocks. In 1981 Sir Roger Hurn became CEO and began restructuring the company. Smiths announced in 1983 that it would stop supplying original equipment for the European motor industry and began buying small, relatively unknown companies to add to its avionics, medical equipment, and industrial products offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Smiths acquired Lear Siegler for about $350 million, establishing itself as a supplier to major aircraft makers and the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   . Other notable purchases included medical products makers Deltec (1994) and Graseby (1997). In 1998
   <company id="11377">
    Southwest Airlines
   </company>
   selected Smiths to supply all of its
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   737s with flight management computers. Also that year, Keith Butler-Wheelhouse replaced Hurn as CEO, who left the company to accept the chairman position with Marconi (formerly GEC and later
   <company id="41750">
    telent
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought seven companies in 1999, bolting on three companies to its UK and US aerospace operations (Stewart Hughes, Signal Processing Systems, and Strategic Technology Systems), two companies to its medical division (Biochem International and Hemex Medical), and two companies to its industrial business (Entraco and Transtector).
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its buying spree in 2000, Smiths acquired
   <company id="90103">
    Invensys
   </company>
   's aerospace division, BAE Systems' Marconi actuation systems business, TI Group (mechanical and aerospace engineering) and
   <company id="13046">
    Orbital Sciences Corp.
   </company>
   's Fairchild Defense electronics (defense electronics, avionics and mission management systems) unit. The company changed its name to the Smiths Group late that year. In 2001 Smiths spun off 80% of its automotive fluid-handling specialist, TI Automotive Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company sold its marine propulsion business (John Crane-Lips) to the Finnish company Wärtsila for about $300 million. The next year Smiths sold its polymer sealing business to Sweden's
   <company id="90930">
    Trelleborg
   </company>
   for about $925 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Smiths landed a $1.6 billion contract to supply landing gear and flap control systems for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. The same year, Smiths spent more than $400 million on five US aerospace operations, including Dynamic Gunver Technologies Inc.(aircraft engine components), Cyrano Sciences Inc. (sensors), TRAK Communications Inc. (antennas), SensIR Technologies Inc. (detection devices), and Integrated Aerospace Inc. (landing gear products and external fuel tanks).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Smiths acquired Medex, a US-based maker of medical infusion equipment, for $925 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Smiths Group sold Smiths Aerospace to
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   for $4.8 billion. The deal represented a payoff for the investments Smiths Group made in its aerospace business over the last few years as it took advantage of a consolidation phase in the industry. Smiths Group shareholders got a payoff of their own as virtually all of the deal's proceeds were paid out as a dividend to Smiths Group shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the aerospace deal, Smiths Group and GE announced they would form a joint venture that would combine Smiths Detection with certain assets of GE Security's Homeland Protection business. The new business, Smiths GE Detection, would be based in London; Smiths Group would hold a 64% stake, GE would hold 36%. Later in 2007 the two companies called off the joint venture plans, saying that their respective businesses would best be served by remaining independent.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smiths Interconnect acquired Interconnect Devices, Inc. (IDI), a manufacturer of application-specific spring probe connectors, in 2010. The acquisition gave Smiths Interconnect a major plant in Suzhou, China and increased sales capabilities there and possibly in parts of Europe, where IDI has limited presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2011 the division acquired Power Holdings from Bertram Capital in an all-cash deal for $235 million. The holding company is comprised of Virginia-based Power Distribution Inc., manufacturer of power distribution, monitoring, and switching equipment, Michigan-based Marelco Power Systems, Inc., maker of controls, integrated power supplies and magnetic products, and California-based ONYX Power, Inc., producer of inverters, transformers and other ciritical power equipment for corporate data centers. The deal continued the company's goals of product and distribution growth.
