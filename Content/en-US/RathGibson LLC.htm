  <p>
   Upon emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, the company's name was changed to RathGibson LLC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bankruptcy in 2009 came on the heels of a record 2008. The problem was caused by demand dropping by half coupled with a tremendous debt load. The company suffered a significant decrease in orders in 2009 due to the global economic crisis and was forced to seek protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   A series of earlier deals expanded the company's operations. Rath Manufacturing bought Gibson Tube in 1999 to produce an expanded line of commercial and sanitary tubing; the company took the RathGibson name in 2005. It acquired Greenville Tube in 2006, adding to its offerings and geographic scope.
