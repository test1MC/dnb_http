   Oneida knows its place at the table. The world's largest manufacturer of stainless steel and silver-plated flatware, Oneida designs and supplies flatware, dinnerware, and crystal for both consumers and the foodservice and institutional markets. Its facilities dot the US, Canada, Mexico, the UK, and Australia. Flatware accounts for more than half of sales. Other tabletop items include cutlery and kitchen utensils and gadgets, as well as baby keepsake gifts. Subsidiary Kenwood Silver operates about 15 Oneida outlet stores. Private equity firm Monomoy Capital, which bought Oneida in 2011, operates Oneida as an operating subsidiary of

   The world's largest maker of stainless steel flatware, Oneida operates under Monomoy's

   , which was established in 2013, alongside Anchor Hocking.

   It markets and distributes tabletop products, such as flatware, dinnerware, crystal stemware, glassware, and kitchen tools and gadgets.

        <p>
   The partnership is anticipated to enable both companies to extend their offerings beyond the tabletop, which has suffered a decline in demand in recent years due to more casual eating and entertaining styles. Under new ownership, Oneida and Anchor Hocking look to move into other areas of the home, as well as consolidate distribution channels (both sell to the same markets), streamline costs, and muscle more premium shelf space in stores.

        <p>
   In 1848 John Humphrey Noyes founded the Oneida Community in upstate New York. The quasi-Christian utopian group emphasized self-perfection and communalism, including the all-for-one/one-for-all practice of "complex marriage." Group members made animal traps, chain, silk items, and silver cutlery. Internal strains forced a split between two factions in 1879, and the following year the community was re-established as the Oneida Community, Ltd., a joint-stock company operated by the society's former members.
  </p>
        <p>
   By the 1920s the firm had sold off its other manufacturing businesses to concentrate on silverware. In 1935 the company became Oneida in order to differentiate itself from its lower-quality subsidiary manufacturers. It was a defense contractor during both World Wars and the Korean War, making goods ranging from surgical instruments to parachute parts to hand grenades. In the 1960s Oneida's Chateau line helped lead to the popularity of stainless flatware. The firm diversified by purchasing industrial wire maker Camden Wire in 1977 (sold twenty years later). By the 1980s it was selling about half of all flatware in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   Aiming to become a source for all tablewares, Oneida acquired THC Systems (marketer of china and porcelain dinnerware under the Rego tradename) in 1996. Oneida obtained exclusive distribution rights for Schott Zwiesel crystal in 1997 and Cristalleria Artistica La Piana in 1998. Also in 1998 the company bought Australian tableware leaders Stanley Rogers &amp; Son (flatware) and Westminster China (porcelain). New product delays and weak sales in Asia hurt 1998 earnings. Insider Peter Kallet was tapped as CEO that year.

   Oneida rang in 1999 with a restructuring to thin its ranks. The company received a $637 million buyout bid from glassware rival Libbey in June 1999 but rejected the offer; Libbey withdrew its offer the next month. Oneida began selling online in 2000. That year the company also bought dinnerware and tableware companies Sakura and Delco International as well as UK flatware company Viners of Sheffield Limited.
  </p>
        <p>
   Starting in 1999 with the closure of its Canadian flatware manufacturing facility, Oneida has gradually redirected its focus from manufacturing to sourcing. In 2003 the company shut down its Mexican flatware manufacturing facility, sold off a dinnerware manufacturing facility operated by Buffalo China, and closed down its Italian and Chinese holloware manufacturing facilities. In early 2004 Oneida sold its Buffalo China dinnerware manufacturing assets to Niagara Ceramics Corporation. In August 2004 the company sold its Encore subsidiary (marketer of tabletop products and home accessories to the supermarket industry) to Bradshaw International.
  </p>
        <p>
   In March 2005 Kallet resigned as president and CEO and was succeeded by director Terry Westbrook. Kallet continued to serve as chairman of the board until he retired later that year. James Joseph took over as CEO in August 2007.
