   The very technology of the halogen bulb gives the company a competitive edge over more traditional incandescent and fluorescent lighting products. A halogen lamp is an incandescent lamp, but with a tungsten filament that is housed in a transparent package along with a halogen element such as iodine or bromine. The resulting chemical yields a longer bulb life, and halogen lamps can be made in smaller sizes for use in optical systems.
