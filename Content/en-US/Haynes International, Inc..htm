   Haynes International is an ally of companies that use alloys. Haynes develops and manufactures nickel- and cobalt-based alloys. The company specializes in high-temperature alloys (HTAs) able to withstand extreme temperatures and corrosion-resistant alloys (CRAs) that stand up to corrosive substances and processes. HTAs are used in jet engines, gas turbines used for power generation, and waste incinerators, while CRAs have applications in chemical processing, power plant emissions control, and hazardous waste treatment. HTAs account for about three-quarters of the company's sales. The aerospace industry is the biggest market for Haynes, accounting for 43% of its business.

  <p>
   Haynes' alloys are produced in a variety of formats, including sheet, coil, and plate (which together account for about two-thirds of sales); it also produces tubulars, both seamless and welded, bar, billet, and wire. The company also provides such support services as technical assistance and product analysis.

  <p>
   Haynes has manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana; Arcadia, Louisiana; and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The US accounts for nearly 60% of net sales. Other major markets include Europe (22%) and China (8%).

  <p>
   The company's products are sold primarily through its direct sales organization, which includes 13 service and/or sales centers in the US, Europe, and Asia. About 78% of its net revenue is generated by its direct sales organization, and the remaining 22% are generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents.

  <p>
   Haynes has experienced steep revenue declines over the last two years, with revenues falling 6% from $483 million in 2013 to $485 million in 2014. Profits also plunged 83% from $22 million to roughly $4 million over that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2014 were attributed to a 15% decrease in land-based gas turbines segment revenue due to reduced customer demand and customers' maintaining reduced inventory levels within the supply chain. In addition, its chemical processing segment revenue decreased by 9% during the year.

  <p>
   Haynes strategy is to grow through developing new products and applications for existing alloys; expanding into new, emerging markets; expand through strategic acquisitions and alliances; and to invest in its manufacturing facilities and equipment. It is also open to growing through acquisitions. In late 2014 it announced it was purchasing Leveltek Processing, located in LaPorte, Indiana. Leveltek provides turnkey stretch leveling services for retrofit and new cut-to-length lines.
