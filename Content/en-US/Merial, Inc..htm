   Merial keeps animals merry. It makes a variety of drugs and vaccines that treat and prevent disease in pets, livestock, and wildlife. Used by veterinarians, farmers, and pet owners in some 150 countries, the company's lead products include Ivomec and Eprinex, anti-parasitics for livestock; Frontline flea and tick treatments for cats and dogs; and heartworm prevention drug Heartgard. Merial focuses on four treatment areas: anti-infectious drugs, pain medicines, parasiticides, and vaccines. The firm sells its OTC products wherever pet supplies are sold and its prescription medications through veterinarians.

   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Inghelheim
   </company>
   in exchange for that firm's OTC products business.

  <p>
   Merial often collaborates with other drug or biotech firms to develop new products. For example it has an agreement with PR Pharmaceuticals to use that company's sustained-release technology in the development of animal health products. Merial also collaborates with Bioject Medical Technologies on the development of a needle-free injection device for pet vaccines and with Imugene, for that company's vector technology in the development of vaccine candidates for avian and swine flu.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added avian and swine vaccines to its line-up with the launches of Vaxxitek and Circovac; vaccines to fight Blue Tongue Virus and epizooty (diseases affecting many animals at the same time) in Europe; and, Zactran, an antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in livestock. In 2013 it added Previcox, an anti-inflammatory and pain reliever for dogs.

  <p>
   Merial sells its products worldwide. Major markets include the US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, China, Australia, Brazil, and Japan. Emerging markets contributed about a quarter of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes its products at nearly 20 manufacturing sites around the world; key locations are in France, the US, Brazil, and China. In late 2014 Merial agreed to buy a Puerto Rico manufacturing facility from
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   ; the site will now make Merial's Heartgard and Heartgard Plus products. Merial operates more than half a dozen research and development centers with major sites in France and the US.

  <p>
   Just like manufacturers of drugs for humans, Merial is vulnerable to patent expirations on its lead products. Top-seller Frontline's active ingredient, fipronil, has expired in several of Merial's markets, though it stills enjoys protection in the US. The company combats patent expirations by researching and developing new products and by obtaining patents on other components of the product (Frontline's actual formulation is still patent-protected.) New products approved in 2013 include Broadline, for external parasites in cats, NexGard, a chewable to repel fleas and ticks in dogs, and Longrange, a cattle dewormer.
  </p>
  <p>
   With more and more of its revenues coming from emerging markets, Merial is investing in manufacturing capacity to address specific needs in those areas. In China, for example, the company is developing a new site in Nanchang for avian and other local vaccines. It has also upgraded it French production facility to make new EU-compliant packaging.

  <p>
   Along with R&amp;D efforts, Merial has grown its product lines over the past few years through strategic acquisitions. In 2012 it purchased Newport Laboratories, a US-based producer of vaccines for pigs and cows to strengthens its swine market segment. The following year parent Sanofi acquired the animal health division of Dosch Pharmaceuticals in India. It operates as part of Sanofi Synthelabo India but works to register Merial's animal vaccines in India.

   Merial was founded in 1997 through the merger of the animal health businesses of Merck and the Rhone Merieux, a predecessor to Sanofi. It was held as a 50/50 joint venture until 2009 when
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   sold its shares to Sanofi for about $4 billion, in order to satisfy antitrust regulators when it acquired Schering-Plough. The dust had barely settled when Merck and Sanofi sought to rekindle their relationship through a new joint venture. In 2010 they announced plans to merge Merial with Merck's new animal health business,
   <company id="138726">
    Intervet
   </company>
   (included in the Schering-Plough purchase). The 50/50 joint venture would have created one of the largest animal health companies in the world. But after spending a year planning, the two companies called off the deal in 2011, citing the complexities of anticipated divestitures that would be needed to satisfy antitrust regulators.
