   3D Systems helps product designers and engineers bring their concepts to life. The company's stereolithography apparatuses (SLAs) and other machines create 3-D prototypes of everything from toys to airplane parts. Its SLAs rapidly produce 3-D objects designed in CAD/CAM software in a process called solid imaging, which uses a laser to sculpt plastic resin materials into physical models. Its ThermoJet solid object printer also fabricates plastic models using a modified ink jet printing system. Additionally, 3D Systems sells the raw plastic and metal consumable material used in its machinery. Customers have included

   3D Systems reported $666 in revenue in 2015, a 2% increase from 2014. Services revenue from on-demand parts and from software services, which reflected the bigger portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Cimatron in 2015. Products revenue dropped on lower sales of 3D printers and an unfavorable foreign currency impact.

   The company recorded a loss of $655 million in 2015 from an $11 million profit in 2014. A good chunk of the loss came from a 537 million write down of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the company's geographic reporting units.

  </p>
  <p>
   • botObjects, a 3D printer maker. Using botObjects technology 3D Systems released the CubePro C, a desktop full-color 3D printer. The deal adds a full-color with ultra thin-layer and high-speed technology the company's consumer and professional 3D printing portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   • Nearly two-thirds of Wuxi Easyway Model Design and Manufacture Co. Ltd. of China, a manufacturing service bureau and distributor of 3D printing and scanning products in China.
  </p>

   3D Systems was founded in 1986 by Charles Hull, a veteran of Bell &amp; Howell and
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   , who pioneered the stereolithography modeling method. 3D Systems shipped its first product in 1988. It went public that year; Ciba-Geigy (now
   <company id="53105">
    Ciba Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   ) took a stake. The technology attracted attention, but market reception was lukewarm. In 1991, 3D Systems hired automation software executive Arthur Sims as CEO. Sims added system maintenance and outsourcing services, but sales and earnings remained low.
