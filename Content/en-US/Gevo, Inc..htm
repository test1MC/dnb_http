   Putting sugar in a gas tank is generally not a good idea, but Gevo has figured out a way to make it beneficial. A renewable chemical and biofuels company, Gevo produces isobutanol, a multi-purpose chemical derived from glucose and other cellulosic biomass extracted from plant matter. Its isobutanol can be used as a blendstock (additive used during the refining process) for gasoline and jet fuel production and as a chemical used in the production of plastics, fibers, and rubber. Gevo does not yet produce isobutanol on a commercial scale, but it is in the process of building its customer and partnership base in preparation of commencing production. In 2016 the company was seeking strategic alternatives.

  <p>
   Gevo is a leading renewable chemicals and next-generation biofuels company. Gevo converts existing ethanol plants into bio-refineries to make the fuel additive isobutanol.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gevo, Inc. segment is responsible for all research and development activities related to the future production of isobutanol, Gevo Development/Agri-Energy is responsible for the current production of ethanol, isobutanol, and related products.

   , and
   <company id="105888">

  <p>
   Gevo has a joint venture with Redfield Energy to retrofit Redfield's existing ethanol plant into an isobutanol plant with a production capacity of 38 million gallons per year. The retrofitted plant began the commercial production of isobutanol in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gevo (through its Agri-Energy subsidiary), also retrofitted its own ethanol plant in Luverne, Minnesota and began producing isobutanol in 2012. The plant's initial capacity is expected to hover around 18 million gallons of isobutanol per year. The company's long-term plans include ramping up production by 2014 to around 350 million gallons annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Gevo is working to get its production operations online, it is also making an effort to secure demand for its product by pursuing potential customers and partners. The company has already signed nonbinding agreements with some customers, including rubber-producer
   <company id="138078">
    LANXESS
   </company>
   and oil and gas company
   <company id="110697">
    Total Petrochemicals
   </company>
   , both of which also hold a small ownership stake in Gevo (Total Petrochemicals holds an indirect stake.). Other potential customers include
   <company id="52509">
    Toray Industries
   </company>
   , a fiber and plastic maker, and
   <company id="11520">
    United Airlines
   </company>
   , which would purchase jet fuel made with the company's isobutanol. The company's partners would include petroleum companies that produce and sell petroleum made with the company's isobutanol, and
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   , which would supply biomass to Gevo.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Gevo announced the continuation of a partnership with Land O'Lakes Purina Feed, a subsidiary of
   <company id="40272">
    Land O'Lakes, Inc
   </company>
   . The companies will collaborate on R&amp;D efforts to upgrade isobutanol distiller grains for applications in animal feed markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is relying on the successful coordination of its customers, partners, and commercial production operations to generate income and, ultimately, become profitable. Gevo has been unprofitable since its inception, mainly because it has been focused primarily on research and development of isobutanol and has not generated enough income to offset its expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Signalling its intent to produce and sell isobutanol from renewable feedstocks in 2013 Gevo opened a new demonstration-scale paraxylene plant for renewable paraxylene in Silsbee, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding geographically, in 2012 the company signed a deal with the Malyasian government to develop a cellulosic biomass isobutanol facility in Southeast Asia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Gevo's revenue decreased by 62% in 2012, due to declined sales of ethanol and related products (due to lower then planned production of isobutanol; partially offset by higher grant, research and development program, and other revenues.  The increase in grant revenues came from agreements with the
   <company id="150260">

   , the
   <company id="129948">
    Department of Agriculture
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   It's net loss increased by 26% in 2012 due to lower revenues, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses (primarily due to ongoing patent litigation with DuPont's Butamax unit).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Formed in 2005, the company went public in early 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to its IPO, Gevo was owned by entities affiliated with Khosla Ventures (more than 40%), Virgin Green Fund (15%), and other investment firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gevo plans to use the majority of the proceeds raised in its IPO (about $150 million) to acquire and refurbish production facilities. The company's ideal facilities are existing ethanol plants that it would either acquire or gain access to through joint ventures with other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using its IPO funds, Gevo entered a joint venture with Redfield Energy in 2011 to retrofit Redfield's existing ethanol plant into an isobutanol plant with a production capacity of 38 million gallons per year. The retrofit, using Gevo technology, will start in late 2011 and commercial production of isobutanol will begin in late 2012.
