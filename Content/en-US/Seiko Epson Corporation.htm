   Seiko Epson (doing business as Epson Corp.) makes its mark on paper and glass. A top printer manufacturer, the company produces dot matrix, ink jet, laser, and thermal printers, as well as components and ink cartridges. Its product portfolio also includes projectors, scanners, and PCs; electronic devices and components, including semiconductors and LCDs; and precision products, such as lenses and factory automation equipment such as robots. Epson has manufacturing facilities in more than 25 countries and sales offices around the world. The company generates more than third of its sales in Japan and China. Other Seiko companies include

  <p>
   Epson generates two-thirds of its revenue from its Printing Solutions Business segment, which includes printers and its professional printing products and services. The Visual Communications Business segment, 17% of revenue, develops and makes LCD projectors, high-temperature polysilicon TFT LCD panels, and smart eye wear. The Wearable &amp; Industrial Products Business segment produces watches and sensors, robotics, and microdevices, and accounts for 16% of revenue.

  <p>
   Seiko Epson operates facilities -- manufacturing sites, sales offices, and research and development centers -- around the world. Regional offices are in the US, China, the Netherlands, and Singapore. About three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from international customers.

  <p>
   Seiko Epson's revenue inched 1% higher in 2016 (ended March) from 2015 on small increase in printer sales and a 4% rise in visual communications sales. Sales in the wearables business shrunk 2%. Sales of the company's ink-tank printers helped push revenue higher, although lower sales in Europe and the Americas offset growth. In visual communications, sales of Seiko Epson 3LCD projectors rose in 2016. The company's revenue also benefited from currency rates that made the Japanese yen weaker to the US dollar. Seiko Epson reported a 60% drop in profit due to higher costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated by operating activities increase to ¥113 billion in 2016 from about ¥109 billion in 2015, despite lower profit. Factors such as depreciation and amortization and a lower tax bill boosted cash flow.

   Third-party makers of printer cartridges have cut significantly into a large portion of business for printer makers like Seiko Epson. The company's introduction of inkjet printers that use ink from a tank, not a cartridge, helped boost its printer sales. The tanks last longer and can refilled. They have a higher initial cost, but a lower lifetime cost because users don't pay as much for ink. The new printers have sold well in emerging markets. In fact, the company is building a new plant in Japan to make printheads for the printers; it also will produce 3LCD projectors.

   Although robotics makes up a relatively small portion of its revenue, Seiko Epson sees big things in store in a worldwide push for manufacturing automation. The company introduced a compact six-axis industrial robot that can work in small spaces. It takes up 40% less floor space than an earlier Epson model and works in faster cycles.

  <p>
   Seiko Epson strengthened its inkjet textile printing business with two Italian acquisitions. The deals were for Fratelli Robustelli and For.Tex S.R.L. Epson Seiko expects a 25% annual growth rate in textile printing.

  <p>
   In 1881, 21-year-old Kitaro Hattori, who had begun working in the jewelry trade at age 13, opened a Tokyo watch shop and called it K. Hattori &amp; Co. In 1892 Hattori started a factory in Seikosha to manufacture wall clocks and, later, watches and alarm clocks. K. Hattori &amp; Co. went public in 1917. In 1924 it began using the Seiko brand on its timepieces. Kitaro's son Ganzo formed Daini Seikosha Co., precursor of

   </company>
   , in 1937.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed Daiwa Kogyo Ltd., a maker of mechanical watches, in 1942. In 1959 Daiwa Kogyo merged with the Suwa plant of Daini Seikosha to form Suwa Seikosha. Shinshu Seiki (renamed Epson in 1982) was established in 1961.
