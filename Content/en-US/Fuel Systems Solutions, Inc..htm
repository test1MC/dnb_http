   Fuel Systems Solutions was going green before green was the way to go. Founded in 1957, the holding company operates through two subsidiaries, BRC and IMPCO Technologies, as a designer and manufacturer of alternative fuel components that allow engines in vehicles and industrial equipment to operate on cleaner burning gaseous fuels, such as propane and compressed natural gas (CNG). BRC's customers include some of the world's largest automotive OEMs, and IMPCO's customers include some of the leading engine OEMs. Products include fuel injectors, electronic controls, compressors, and auxiliary power systems. The group also offers services ranging from system integration to environmental certification. In mid-2016 the company was bought by Canada's Westport Innovations, which then changed its name to
   <company id="101629">
    Westport Fuel Systems
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BRC has operations in Italy and, through subsidiaries or joint ventures, manufacturing and conversion plants in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, and Pakistan. US-based IMPCO has operations in Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, and the US. Division IMPCO Automotive develops and manufactures LPG and CNG bi-fuel injection systems (based on the technology of BRC) specifically for the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Italy-based BRC generating the majority of sales, it's no surprise that Europe is its largest market, accounting for about 40% of sales. North America contributes 25% of sales, while Asia/Pacific and Latin America account for 19% and 17%, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's alternative fuel components and systems are based on its gaseous fuel technology for both CNG and propane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of propane and butane. This technology is designed to help Fuel Systems Solutions meet the growing demand for alternative fuel products, which is being driven by stricter emissions standards and government and consumer calls for energy independence.
  </p>
  <p>
   BRC (also known as the FSS Automotive segment), which generates about 70% of the company's sales, serves the passenger and light-duty automobile sectors with such transportation brands as BRC, GFI, TA Gas Technology, and Zavoli. IMPCO (FSS Industrial) generates the remaining 30% of sales. The IMPCO industrial brand can be found in everything from heavy-duty forklifts and sweepers to auxiliary power units in locomotives and power generation stationary engines.

  <p>
   Fuel Systems Solutions sells its products through its own sales force and a worldwide network of more than 400 distributors and dealers in more than 65 countries. It mostly focuses on OEM and aftermarket distributors in the transportation, industrial, and power generation markets. Many domestic distributors have been Fuel Systems Solutions customers for more than 30 years, and many of its export distributors have been customers for more than 20.

  <p>
   Fuel Systems Solutions has experienced a fall in revenues over the years. Revenues were down 6% from $418 million in 2011 to $394 million in 2012. The company also suffered its first net loss ($16 million) in six years in 2012 due to $22 million in impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decrease for 2012 was driven by an 8% fall in FSS Automotive sales, an 11% drop in North America, and a 26% fall from the Asia/Pacific region. Fuel Systems Solutions was also hurt by the weakening of local currencies compared to the US dollar throughout 2012.

  <p>
   The company is growing its alternative fuel-oriented business largely through acquisitions of smaller companies with complementary product or technology portfolios. In 2012 Fuel Systems Solutions acquired the assets of the CUBOGAS CNG compressor division from
   <company id="105904">
    Dresser
   </company>
   Italia. The CUBOGAS brand added a new line of CNG compressor and packaging products for a wide range of applications to the company's portfolio. It also allowed the BRC division to capitalize on the scale and efficiency of the former Dresser CNG compressor business. It launched the new CUBOGAS brand in mid-2013.

  <p>
   In 1957 Herb Dills and Dick Babberstock founded tool-and-die company IMPCO. They invented a kit used by farmers to convert gasoline engines to propane engines. By the late 1980s IMPCO was the #1 alternative-fuels conversion-kit maker worldwide, but it was challenged by firms with more advanced technology. IMPCO planned to buy new technology from AirSensors, which had developed electronically regulated carburetion and fuel-injection systems. (AirSensors was founded in 1978 and went public in 1986.) Instead, in 1989 AirSensors bought privately held IMPCO, which was more than 20 times its size.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saddled with heavy debt from the purchase, AirSensors struggled during the early 1990s. It posted a profit in 1993, in part because of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which required 70% of vehicles purchased by the US government to be low-polluting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 AirSensors bought 51% of European alternative-fuels company Technisch Bureau Media (later IMPCO Technologies BV). The next year it acquired Garretson Equipment (conversion equipment for small engines) and Ateco Automotive (AirSensors' distributor in Australia). In 1997 the company began installing natural gas systems for
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   models equipped with bi-fuel systems (work with gasoline or natural gas) and changed its name to IMPCO Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   IMPCO helped train Chinese officials and auto experts in converting buses and taxis to natural gas in 1998. That year it bought the business of
   <company id="14886">
    Thermo Power's
   </company>
   Crusader Engines (propane- and natural-gas-powered industrial engines). In 1999 it bought the remainder of IMPCO Technologies BV.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 IMPCO formed an alliance with Alcoa's Thiokol unit for joint development of hydrogen fuel storage tanks for the emerging automotive fuel cell market. Later that year
   <company id="58192">
    Hyundai
   </company>
   selected IMPCO for the development of a hydrogen storage and fuel delivery system for Hyundai's prototype Santa Fe fuel-cell-powered SUV.
  </p>
  <p>
   IMPCO spun off its
   <company id="106220">
    Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies
   </company>
   subsidiary in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   IMPCO purchased a 50% stake in fellow alternative fuel system company BRC of Italy in 2003 and agreed to buy the other 50% the next year. BRC founder Mariano Costamagna became IMPCO's president and CEO in January 2005, and IMPCO took full ownership of BRC in March 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year the company reorganized into a holding company structure, changing its name from IMPCO to Fuel Systems Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 IMPCO, now a subsidiary, made headway in the US transportation market by signing a distribution agreement with CleanFUEL USA, a manufacturer of alternative fuel dispensing equipment. CleanFUEL will distribute and install IMPCO's dual propane and gasoline fuel system to GM and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , enabling their vehicles to run on propane.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other investments in 2009 included purchasing
   <company id="12375">
    Teleflex
   </company>
   's alternative fuel components and auxiliary power systems business for about $15 million. The acquisition, which strengthened Fuel Systems' position in transportation and industrial markets, followed Fuel Systems' deal for FuelMaker Corporation. FuelMaker, a specialist in CNG technology and refueling products, complemented Fuel Systems' turn-key refueling equipment portfolio. Fuel Systems also purchased Italy's conversion kit maker Distribuidora Shopping. Turning its attention to South America, Fuel Systems became the sole owner of Brazil-based WMTM Equipamentos de Gases when it acquired the remaining 50% stake from its former partner, White Martin Gases Industriais.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company bought North American-based EvoTek. Although relatively small, the $7 million investment nets EvoTek's CNG and LPG conversion systems, used by such customers as BAF Technologies, a subsidiary of
   <company id="153500">
    Clean Energy Fuels

   . Fuel Systems also completed its purchase of Productive Concepts International (PCI) for $11.1 million. PCI supplies CNG fuel delivery and storage systems for
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors

   vans and boasts vehicle modification and systems integration expertise for a number of alternative fuel ends.
