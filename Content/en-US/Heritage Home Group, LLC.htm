   Heritage Home Group (formerly Furniture Brands International) may sound old, but it's a relatively new company formed from the ruins of a furniture-making empire. Heritage Home's portfolio includes a bevy of established furniture brands including Broyhill, Thomasville, Drexel Heritage, Lane, Henredon, La Barge, and Maitland-Smith, among others. The group designs, manufactures, sources, and sells home furnishings, some through its own Thomasville retail stores. Heritage Home Group was formed in late 2013 by private equity firm

   , which acquired the assets of Furniture Brands International out of bankruptcy for about $280 million.

   acquired the assets of Furniture Brands International out of bankruptcy substantially free and clear of any liens and claims. Under its new name, ownership, and leadership, Heritage Home Group has a clean slate from which it aims to build a profitable, growing company. KPS said it intends to operate the entire business and that virtually all current employees would be offered jobs. The company relocated to Highpoint, North Carolina in April 2014.

  <p>
   Furniture Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September 2013. The company blamed continued weakness in the housing industry, coupled with weak consumer spending, for its liquidity crunch. The furniture maker listed assets of about $547 million and debt of $550 million in its Chapter 11 filing. A group led by KPS Capital Partners bought the assets out of bankruptcy and renamed the business Heritage Home Group.

  <p>
   Although already a diversified firm, INTERCO's purchase of Ethan Allen in 1980 took the company in a direction that would eventually become its only business. INTERCO (now Furniture Brands International) traces its roots back to the pairing of two shoe manufacturers and made a name for itself by running men's shoemaker and retailer Florsheim, which it acquired in 1953. It added other operations, including department stores and apparel, beginning in the 1960s. The Ethan Allen purchase gave INTERCO 24 furniture factories and 300 retail outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company grew its furniture business later in 1980 by purchasing Broyhill Furniture Industries, which was founded by J. E. Broyhill as Lenoir Chair Company in 1926. The Broyhill line first became popular during the 1930s. The Broyhill family built the company into the largest privately owned maker of furniture, with 20 manufacturing facilities when INTERCO bought it.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986, after acquiring furniture maker Highland House (Hickory), INTERCO made its largest acquisition in the home furnishings and furniture market when it gained control of the Lane Company for approximately $500 million. Founded in 1912 by Ed Lane to make cedar chests, Virginia-based Lane had grown into a full-line maker of furniture with about 15 plants in operation. The acquisition of Lane lifted furniture and furnishings to 33% of INTERCO's total sales in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, INTERCO hadn't neglected its shoe business, adding Converse in 1986. Richard Loynd, the Converse CEO, served as INTERCO's CEO from 1989 to 1996. In 1988, under a takeover threat by the Rales brothers of Washington, DC, the company retained the investment banking firm of Wasserstein Perella, which advised payment of a special dividend, for which INTERCO borrowed $1.8 billion via junk bonds. To repay the debt, the firm began selling off assets, including its apparel businesses and Ethan Allen. However, the sales yielded low prices and some businesses failed to attract buyers.
  </p>
  <p>
   After fighting off the hostile takeover, INTERCO filed bankruptcy in 1991 -- one of the largest bankruptcy cases in US history. It also filed a malpractice suit against Wasserstein Perella when it emerged from Chapter 11; the suit was settled the following year, and Apollo Investment Fund acquired a large stake in the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   INTERCO sold the last of its 80-year-old shoemaking business with the spinoff of its Florsheim and Converse units in 1994. The company acquired Thomasville Furniture from Armstrong World Industries for about $330 million in 1993, a purchase that made it the leading shaker in residential furniture. Founded in 1904, the Finch brothers had run Thomasville until Armstrong acquired it in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   W. G. "Mickey" Holliman became CEO in 1996, and INTERCO's board decided to change the company's name to Furniture Brands International. In 1997 Apollo Investment Fund, its largest shareholder, sold its nearly 40% stake. The next year Furniture Brands and retailer Haverty Furniture signed a deal (terminated in 2003) whereby Haverty's would allocate up to half its retail space for Furniture Brands' items.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company started selling kitchen and bathroom cabinets under the Thomasville brand in Home Depot. In 2001 Furniture Brands bought Drexel Heritage, Henredon, and Maitland-Smith units from LifeStyle Furnishings for $275 million. Overall economic pressures, as well as the residential furniture industry's shift to offshore sourcing (in countries with lower labor costs), led Thomasville to shut down 21 domestic manufacturing facilities in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall, Furniture Brands-owned companies closed 31 domestic manufacturing facilities between 2001 and the end of 2005. In August 2006 Broyhill and Thomasville both closed domestic manufacturing plants in North Carolina. Beginning in 2007 the company abandoned the Lane/Broyhill retail concept.
  </p>
  <p>
   Holliman left the company and was replaced by Ralph Scozzafava in January 2008. Scozzafava, who had been an executive at Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., was elected chairman of the board of Furniture Brands in May. In July, the company transitioned to an operating company model and moved its headquarters to a new location in St. Louis, not far from its previous head office. To better focus on the residential rather than business furnishings market, Furniture Brands sold its business furniture division, Hickory Business Furniture (HBF), to
   <company id="13626">
    HNI Corp.
   </company>
   for about $75 million in 2008. In December it laid off some 15% of its domestic workforce, amounting to about 1,400 jobs, which included both management and hourly employees.
