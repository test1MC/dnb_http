   Altera is a fabless semiconductor company that specializes in high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs) -- integrated circuits (ICs) that OEMs can program to perform logic functions in electronic systems. PLDs are an alternative to custom-designed ICs, and offer a quick, reduced-cost chip. The company's products are used by its more than 12,500 customers worldwide in communications network gear, consumer electronics, medical systems, and industrial equipment. Altera outsources fabrication of the devices to top silicon foundry
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
   </company>
   . Customers outside the US represent most of the company's sales. Altera became a part of Intel in a $16.7 billion deal in late 2015.

  <p>
   Altera classifies its products by life-cycle stage into new, mainstream, and mature and other products. New products are the company's most advanced products, generally used in next-generation electronic systems. Mainstream products are a bit older and not dependent on design wins. Mature products are for the oldest systems that continue to be used. Altera's mature and other products category also includes software, licensing of intellectual property (IP) cores, and configuration and other devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, new products accounted for 54% of revenue, followed by mature products at 25%, and mainstream, 21%. Its field programmable gate array products category brought in 84% of revenue.

  <p>
   Altera has facilities in Canada, China, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. China is the company's largest marketing, accounting for about a third of sales; the US and Japan generate 15% and 14% of sales, respectively.

   The company markets its products directly, as well as through a network of independent sales representatives and distributors. Distributors make up nearly three-quarters of the company's sales with

  <p>
   Altera reversed two years of declining sales with a 12% increase in 2014. The $1.93 billion in revenue came from significant growth in Altera's new product segments, especially its nanoscale 28nm and 40nm offerings. Net income also turned around in 2014, rising 7% to $472.6 million on improved revenue and greater income from interest. The company closed out 2014 with $666.2 million in cash flow from operations, up from $590 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Among the PLD types made by Altera, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are the most popular device of choice, representing about 85% of sales in the PLD category. Altera's share of the FPGA market is estimated at around 39%, and the company considers market share important to long-term growth prospects.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal with Intel should provide Altera with the resources to maintain development of its technology as well as access to the latest manufacturing technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its offerings frequently compete with chief rival
   <company id="15245">
    Xilinx
   </company>
   (the two companies dominate the market for PLDs), and makers of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a type of customized chip used for many of the same functions as PLDs. Altera PLDs' competitive position claims greater functionality and reduced power consumption at a lower price.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to China for growth opportunities, Altera inked deals with
   <company id="133257">
    Baidu
   </company>
   , the Chinese search engine company, and the China Mobile Research Institute (CMRI). With Baidu, Altera will conduct research on using FPGAs and neural network algorithms to develop more accurate and faster search results. The Altera-CMRI partnership will seek to bring to prototype stage a wireless network infrastructure based on the Centralized Radio Access Network architecture leveraging network function virtualization.

   Altera stayed out of the acquisition market in 2014, but it made two in 2013. It bought Enpirion Inc., a provider of products known as PowerSoCs (power system-on-chip), and TPACK, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   <company id="43138">
    Applied Micro Circuits
   </company>
   . TPACK's business was FPGA-based OTN (optical transport network) products targeting packet and optical networking equipment suppliers.

   Altera (short for "alterable") was formed in 1983 by a group of former
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   managers. The company introduced the world's first erasable programmable logic device (PLD) in 1984 and the first high-density PLD the following year. In 1988 Altera went public and bought a stake in
   <company id="10428">
    Cypress Semiconductor
   </company>
   . Altera trotted out new generations of chips in 1988, 1991, and 1992 (the company's first electrically erasable read-only memory). In 1994 it acquired
