   The folks at CF Industries make a lot of fertilizer, and they like to spread it around. The international agricultural firm manufactures and markets nitrogen and nitrogen fertilizers. It is North America's top producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers and #2 in the world. The company's ownership of fertilizer producer
   <company id="10787">
    Terra Industries
   </company>
   helps it keep its dominant position. CF Industries' nitrogen products include ammonia, granular urea, AN (ammonium nitrate) and UAN (urea ammonium nitrate) solutions. The company supplies approximately 20% of the nitrogen used by US farmers.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   CF Industries operates four nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes in the central US region, one in Medicine Hat, Alberta, and one in Courtright, Ontario; and a network of fertilizer distribution terminals and warehouses, located primarily in major grain-producing states across the US Midwest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has UK nitrogen manufacturing plants in Ince and Billingham.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US contributed 81% of CF Industries' total revenues in 2015; Canada, 11%; and other countries, 8%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer (ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN, and other) in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upon selling the phosphate business, CF Industries began to supply
   <company id="111313">
    The Mosaic Company
   </company>
   with ammonia produced by its PLNL joint venture. The contract to supply ammonia to Mosaic from its PLNL joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between its former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other company operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   CF Industries' warehouses can stock more than 322,000 tons of urea. Its ammonia terminals can hold more than 1.2 million tons, and its UAN Solution terminals have more than 1.1 million tons of storage capacity, with it AN segment has a 245,000 ton storage capacity. In 2015 it sold 13.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers.

  <p>
   CF Industries serves customers in the agricultural, industrial, and lawn and garden businesses. The company ships via barge, rail, pipeline and truck. It also serves customers through its export capability from Donaldsonville, Louisiana. The principal customers for nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users.

  <p>
   The company has seen a declining trend in net revenues over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net revenues decreased by 9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales in the ammonia segment decreased due to lower selling prices partially offset by higher sales volumes. The remaining decrease in ammonia was due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volume as the result of weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions. Sales volumes were lower due to the weak Fall application season in North America as a result of poor weather conditions in the Midwest.
  </p>
  <p>
   UAN segment revenues declined due to lower prices and sales volumes. The decline in UAN average selling prices was due to excess global supply availability weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. Sales volumes went lower as customers delayed purchases in the declining pricing environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales in the granular urea segment decreased due primarily to a decrease in average selling prices as ther result of the excess global supply availability weighing on global nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. Granular urea exports from China were at a record high in 2015 and Russian exports have increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the excess global supply. Sales volume was flat compared to the prior year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total net sales in the AN segment increased due to higher sales volumes partially offset by a 10% decrease in average selling prices. These results included the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased net sales by $117.0 million, or 48%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 CF Industries' net income decreased by 50% due to lower net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities declined by 15%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is working to bring online new production that will increase its capacity by roughly 28%. It plans to take advantage North America's low-cost production base, underpinned by plentiful and low-cost natural gas.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also held 50% of KEYTRADE AG, a Switzerland-based global fertilizer trading company. To raise cash, in 2015 CF Industries sold its interest in this joint venture to KEYTRADE.
  </p>
  <p>
   In light of its weak 2013 financials, in 2014 CF Industries entered preliminary discussions with Norway-based nitrogen fertilizer giant
   <company id="132754">
    Yara International
   </company>
   regarding a potential merger of equals deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another major strategic move that year, CF Industries sold its phosphate business to Mosaic for $1.4 billion. CF Industries will supply Mosaic with its share of the ammonia produced by the company's 50%-owned production facility in Trinidad and Tobago. As part of a long-term agreement, the company will supply Mosaic with ammonia from its Point Lisas Nitrogen joint venture, and between 600,000 and 800,000 tons of ammonia per year from its Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex beginning no later than 2017.

  <p>
   In 2016 it entered into a strategic venture with
   <company id="57218">
    CHS
   </company>
   , a leading North American cooperative and one of their largest customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company entered into a definitive agreement to grow both internationally and domestically via a combination with select businesses of
   <company id="163398">
    OCI N.V.
   </company>
   The combination transaction includes OCI's nitrogen production facility in Geleen, Netherlands; its nitrogen production facility under construction in Wever, Iowa; its approximately 79.88% equity interest in an ammonia and methanol complex in Beaumont, Texas; and its global distribution business and the assumption of approximately $2 billion in net debt. Under this agreement CF Holdings will become a subsidiary of a new holding company (New CF) domiciled in the Netherlands
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its nitrogen business, in 2015 CF Industries bought the outstanding interests it did not already own in GrowHow UK Limited for $580 million. GrowHow owns and operates nitrogen production facilities in Ince and Billingham in the UK. This acquisition increased CF Industries' annual marketable nitrogen volume by 450,000 short tons of gross ammonia; 600,000 short tons of ammonium nitrate; and 200,000 short tons of NPK compounds.

  <p>
   CF Industries was organized in 1946 as Central Farmers Fertilizer Company. The company changed its structure from a cooperative to a holding company when it began to trade publicly in 2005. It had been owned by eight regional agricultural co-ops, including
   <company id="40272">
    Land O'Lakes
   </company>
   , GROWMARK, and CHS. Following the IPO, the co-ops' stakes were largely reduced.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 CF Industries acquired major fertilizer producer
   <company id="10787">
    Terra Industries
   </company>
   , positioning itself as a nitrogen bellwether in the global fertilizer industry and the top nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer manufacturer in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 CF Industries acquired about 34% of Canadian Fertilizer Limited (CFL) for C$910 million. CFL owns and operates Canada's largest nitrogen fertilizer production complex with a production capacity of approximately 425,000 gross tons of ammonia and 275,000 tons of urea per year. Natural resources conglomerate
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore
   </company>
   bought Canadian grain company
   <company id="139854">
    Viterra
   </company>
   , which owns the 34% of CFL. To placate Canadian regulators, Glencore sold certain Viterra assets.
