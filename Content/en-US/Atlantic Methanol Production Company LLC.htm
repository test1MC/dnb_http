   Atlantic Methanol Production Company (AMPCO) must have adopted "Waste not, want not" as its motto. It tries not to waste the natural gas that is a by-product of its parent companies' production processes. A joint venture between
   <company id="11082">
    Noble Energy
   </company>
   (45% ownership),
   <company id="56989">
    Marathon Oil
   </company>
   (45%), and SONAGAS, the National Gas Company of Equatorial Guinea (10%), the company operates one of the largest methanol plants in the world. The plant, off the coast of Equatorial Guinea, produces about 1 million tons of methanol annually -- 2% of the global market. AMPCO also distributes using three vessels and five terminals in Europe and US, where it sells most of its production.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AMPCO's plant, located on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea, has the capacity to produce 3,000 metric tons per day of methanol. It maintains storage at its production site at Punta Europa in Equatorial Guinea as well as in the US (Louisiana and Texas), the Netherlands, and the UK.

  <p>
   The global demand for methanol is about 60 million metric tons per year, of which Equitorial Guinea supplies 2% from its single plant. Methanol is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of several everyday products, including adhesive resins for plywood and pressboard, polyester fibers and packaging, paints and coatings, plastics, and fuels and fuel additives. Some of methanol's fastest growth areas are in the acetic acid and fuels areas, including biodiesel. Other applications include using methanol for fuel cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   Feedstock for AMPCO's plant is supplied from natural gas production from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea (operated by
   <company id="56989">
    Marathon Oil
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11082">
    Noble Energy
   </company>
   ) under a contract that runs through 2026.

  <p>
   The company manages its marketing and sales from its US-based headquarters in Houston. It markets in Europe through an agent, solvadis methanol, in Frankfurt, Germany.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While no separate financials are available Noble Energy reported that 2013 net income derived by Noble Energy and AMPCO increased primarily due to a 19% jump in the average realized sales price of methanol.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   AMPCO is reporting an increase in demand from Asia, the US, and Western Europe for methanol. There is also an expanding demand for methanol in the oilfield services sector along the coast of West Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up with demand, in 2013 AMPCO contracted with
   <company id="56915">
    Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
   </company>
   for two new methanol carriers.

  <p>
   Noble Energy, Marathon Oil, and SONAGAS formed the JV in 1997.
