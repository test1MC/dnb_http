   Vera Bradley reported $508.9 million in revenue for fiscal 2015. That was a decrease of about $27 million compared to the previous fiscal period. In fiscal 2015, the company's net income also decreased by $20.3 million compared to fiscal 2014. The primary reason was due to decreased sales and increased expenses partially offset by decreased income tax expense.
