   BSH Home Appliances, part of its German parent's North American operations, is organized by product category -- laundry, dishwasher, cooking, and refrigeration -- to focus on BSH's core competences.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes products specifically for the American market, instead of importing products from Germany. Refrigerators, washers, and dryers sold in the US are about 50% larger than comparably priced models in Europe and Asia. BSH Home Appliances also imports certain products, such as the Tassimo single-cup brewer, for sale at retail stores and online in the US.

  <p>
   Based in California, BSH Home Appliances serves North American consumers and homebuilders for its German parent. Its products are made in the US at its plants in North Carolina and Tennessee.

  <p>
   As part of BSH's rebound strategy, it is focused on selling more of its energy efficient offerings. The appliance maker also plans to invest an additional $50 million in its dishwasher business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though it has seen mixed results in North America, mostly due to currency conversion rates, BSH Home Appliances' parent believes the economic recovery will continue in the region. Accordingly it has opened a new design center in New York and extended its agreement with distributor Purcell Murray through 2017.
