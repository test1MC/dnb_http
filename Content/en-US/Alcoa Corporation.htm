   To improve shareholder returns, in 2016 Alcoa Inc. separated into two public companies,
   <company id="10068">
    Arconic
   </company>
   (a value-added company making high-end aluminum products), and an upstream company -- Alcoa Corp., one of the world's top producers of alumina (aluminum's principal ingredient from bauxite) and aluminum. Alcoa's portfolio comprises of six businesses: Bauxite, Alumina, Aluminum, Cast Products, Rolled Products, and Energy. These assets include the largest bauxite mining portfolio in the world (with 45.3 million bone dry metric tons of production a year); a low cost, globally diverse alumina refining system; and an aluminum smelting portfolio.

  <p>
   Alcoa has a global network of 15 casthouses, allowing it to customize the majority of its primary aluminum production to customers' precise specifications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its rolling mills provide it with a cost-competitive and efficient platform to serve the North American packaging market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Alcoa's portfolio of energy assets (1,658 MW generating capacity) provides third-party sales opportunities, and the operational flexibility to either support metal production or capture earnings through third-party power sales. In 2015, some 55% of Alcoa-generated power was sold externally.

  <p>
   To make Alcoa more resilient to the volatility of the commodity markets, the company has been closing inefficient plants an upgrading manufacturing efficiency at others. Since 2010, the company has closed, divested, or curtailed 35% of its total smelting operating capacity and 25% of its total operating refining capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Value-added products (aluminum products that are cast into specific shapes to meet customer demand) grew to 67% of total Cast Products shipments in 2015, compared to 65% in 2014, and 57% in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2016 spinoff of
   <company id="10068">
    Arconic
   </company>
   also allowed the company to focus all of its attention on its core upstream alumina and aluminum businesses.

  <p>
   Alcoa traces its history to 1888, when founder Charles Martin Hall and backers (led by Captain Alfred E. Hunt) of his 1886 aluminum reduction (electrolysis) discovery set up The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
