   Ballard Power Systems makes emission-free proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and systems used in electric buses, forklifts, and as backup power for telecom networks. The stacked thin cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen fuel with oxygen, leaving only water and heat as by-products. Ballard's fuel cell stacks are incorporated into batteries from

  <p>
   Ballard's revenues have fluctuated over the years; after rising in 2014, revenues decreased by 18% in 2015 mainly due to a dip in Technology Solutions revenues. This segment was hurt by the absence of licensing and engineering services revenues under previous licensing agreements and by a spike in engineering resources to corporate research and product development activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has posted seven straight years of net losses, its most recent being $5.8 million in 2015. In addition, Ballard has posted at least five straight years of negative cash flow mainly due to exorbitant expenses and impairment losses.

   Ballard is focused on expanding its fuel cell development and commercialization geographical footprint. In 2016, the company signed an equipment supply agreement, valued at $12 million, with Guangdong Synergy Hydrogen Power Technology Co., Ltd. (Synergy) in China, to provide FCvelocityTM-9SSL fuel cell stacks for range extension applications in commercial vehicles in China.
