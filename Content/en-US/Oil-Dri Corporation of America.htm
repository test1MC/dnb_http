   , as well as private label cat litters for others. Its litters are sold by mass merchants (
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   ), supermarkets, pet stores, wholesale clubs, and other retailers. ODC also makes sorbents for oil, grease, and water; bleaching and clarification clays; agricultural and sports fields; and animal health and nutrition products.

        <p>
   The company operates its business through a pair of reportable segments. The Retail and Wholesale Products Group, which generated 65% of sales in FY2015 (ended July 2015), serves mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstore chains, pet specialty retail outlets, dollar stores, retail grocery stores, environmental service companies, sports field product users, and distributors of industrial cleanup and automotive products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its other segment, Business to Business Products Group, accounted for the remaining 35% of sales. It sells products to processors and refiners of edible oils, petroleum-based oils, and biodiesel fuel, as well as to makers of animal feed and agricultural chemicals and marketers of consumer products.
  </p>
        <p>
   ODC's subsidiaries consist of Oil-Dri Canada ULC, Oil-Dri (U.K.) Limited, and Oil-Dri SARL. Outside the US, ODC's Canadian subsidiary, Favorite Products, makes and sells branded and private label cat litters in the Canadian market. In Europe ODC has operations in the UK and Switzerland.

        <p>
   ODC is a global company that makes and sells its products in the US, Canada, the UK, and Switzerland. Some 96% of the company's business came from domestic operations in FY2015, while foreign subsidiaries generated the remaining 4%.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   ODC's largest Retail and Wholesale customer is Wal-Mart, which accounted for 18% of the company's total sales in FY2015 (down from 20% in FY2010) Within its Business to Business Products Group, Clorox accounted for 6% of total sales in FY2015.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has been spending less on advertising in recent years. It spent $5 million on advertising in FY2015, compared to $9 million and $8 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   ODC's annual revenues have been steadily growing over the past few years, while its annual net income levels have been more volatile with changes in commodity prices, though profits still have trended higher since 2011.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's revenue changed course in fiscal 2015 (ended July 31, 2015), however, with revenue declining by 2% to $261 million mostly as its Retail and Wholesale product sales fell with new products launched by competitors. Its Business to Business product sales also declined during the year due to less demand for fluid purification products from edible oil producers and less demand for co-packaged coarse cat litter (the coarse litter market has been in decline over the past few years).
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite revenue declines in FY2015, ODC's net income spiked 36% to $11 million mostly as its cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses receded during the year. The company's operating cash levels climbed 66% to $27 million for the year thanks to higher cash earnings and the company's efforts to decrease its inventory.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company relies on new product introductions and acquisitions to grow its business and post profits. ODC generates most of its revenue by selling products across mature categories that have either stalled or declining sales growth in recent years. To this end, the company works to create product extensions for existing products while also introducing new products as a way to meet the needs of emerging customer groups and chase after technological trends and product market opportunities.

        <p>
   Oil-Dri was founded in 1941 by Nick Jaffee, a former auto parts salesman. With $3,000 borrowed from his mother, he started Oil-Dri and offered clay (fuller's earth) as an absorbent, instead of the traditional sawdust, to clean up oily garage floors. Son Richard joined the firm in 1958. Oil-Dri introduced its first cat litter, Cat's Pride, two years later. Nick died in 1962. That year the company branched into agricultural products. It went public in 1971. In 1981 Oil-Dri signed a long-term contract to supply Clorox with absorbents for its cat litter brands. It entered the edible-oil processing market in 1985 and the market for polypropylene sorbents (used to contain major oil spills) in 1990.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 Richard's son Daniel became CEO. Also in 1997 Oil-Dri shut down its Oil-Dri Transportation Co. In 1998 the company bought pet-treats maker Phoebe Products and AMCOL's fuller's earth business. One big setback hit the company in 1998 -- the loss of what had been its biggest customer, Sam's Wholesale Club. Oil-Dri managed to offset the loss with increased sales elsewhere.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company bought its Jonny Cat cat litter business from Clorox in 2002. The acquisition included a manufacturing complex and mineral reserves in California that has enabled the company to expand its distribution of cat litter within the western US. Also that year, Washoe County, Nevada, denied a permit for Oil-Dri to mine clay for producing cat litter. As a result, the firm stopped providing Wal-Mart's Special Kitty cat litter to the western US and to several northeastern US distribution centers.
  </p>
        <p>
   In February 2004 Oil-Dri sold its dog treats manufacturing business.
