   VF Imagewear is a
   <company id="11572">
    V.F. Corporation
   </company>
   division (or "coalition," as VF calls it) that consists of VF's Image business (56% of revenue) and Licensed Sports business (44%). While the Image business focuses on occupational apparel and uniforms under the Red Kap and Bulwark brand names, the Licensed Sports unit makes and markets high-profile athletic apparel and includes the Majestic brand business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some 70% of the Image business comes from industrial laundries, resellers, and distributors that supply customized workwear to employers for production, service, and professional personnel.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Tennessee-based VF Imagewear operates its business throughout North America.

  <p>
   Besides supplying workwear, the occupational apparel unit runs large-scale uniform programs, which allow for convenient ordering via customized websites, for the likes of FedEx, Continental Airlines, Air Canada, AT&amp;T, and other corporations. It also caters to government organizations, such as the National Park Service and the New York City Transit Authority.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the NFL and MLB, the sports apparel unit counts the MLB Players Association, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, and major colleges and universities among its licensors. Also interesting to note, all of the MLB's 30 teams exclusively wear Majestic uniforms on the field.

  <p>
   The Imagewear coalition reported a 4% increase in revenue with Red Kap and the licensed sport group leading a strong year for all segments.

   Unique to the uniforms business is that sales are tied to employment levels in the industrial and service sectors, which have suffered during the economic downturn. Because it serves industrial laundries and distributors, rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is one of its advantages. One uniform-friendly area that has grown is security. To this end, VF Imagewear inked an $85 million contract from the
   <company id="131218">
    US Department of Homeland Security
   </company>
   's Customs and Border Protection for the supply of uniform items and services. In 2013 VF Imagewear was awarded a $50 million contract with the US Department of Homeland Security to outfit its
   <company id="150382">
    Transportation Security Administration
   </company>
   agents.
  </p>
  <p>
   VF Imagewear has also expanded its Majestic brand for Major League Baseball and its National Football League business by licensing more clothing categories while exploring additional distribution channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is working to grow its business through several initiatives. It's looking to extend the capabilities of its products and services to new industrial and service apparel distribution channels, markets, and geographies. VF Imagewear is also reaching into consumer channels with its traditional business-to-business workwear brands while expanding its college and university fanwear program. Its also looking to add women's sports apparel.
