   Jazz Semiconductor makes most of its semiconductors using jazzy materials and processes. The company serves as a contract manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal chips from its 320,000-sq. ft. silicon foundry in California. While it uses plain old silicon for some products, most of its chips for networking and wireless applications call for fabrication in silicon germanium (SiGe) and other compounds. Jazz Semi uses BiCMOS (bipolar complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) and other process technologies to make analog and mixed-signal devices. Israeli parent
   <company id="43835">

   and Jazz operate together under the brand name TowerJazz.

  <p>
   Both Jazz Semi and Tower are specialty foundries, in the second tier of the world foundry services market. Their respective specialties -- radio-frequency (RF) devices made with compound semiconductors and power management semiconductors for Jazz; CMOS image sensors and non-volatile memory devices for Tower -- are seen as complementary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes chips that go into broadband modems, cell phones, digital TVs, gaming devices, routers, switches, and wireless LAN devices, among other products.
