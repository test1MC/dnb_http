   What would air conditioners be without compressors? Probably just hunks of lifeless metal and plastic. Fortunately, Bristol Compressors is well aware of this. The company manufactures compressors that are used inside residential and light commercial air conditioning units and heat pumps. Compressors turn refrigerant (freon) from a cool gas into a hot, high-pressure gas that is then passed on to the condenser. The company sells its products -- under the Benchmark and Bristol brand names -- to HVAC original equipment manufacturers and wholesale distributors. Originally a unit of Johnson Controls, Bristol Compressors is owned by private equity firm Garrison Investment Group.

   Bristol has experienced a series of layoffs over the past decade that has reduced its headcount from more than 2,000 employees to around 700 today. With a focus on safety, quality, and operational effectiveness, Bristol Compressors has transformed its operations to support global customers' continuous improvement expectations in quality assurance and supply. In 2014 the company launched The Beast, an aftermarket compressor unit designed for the North American market. In 2013, it launched Benchmark X14 14 SEER compressor.
