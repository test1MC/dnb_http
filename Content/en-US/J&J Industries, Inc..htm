   Cover-ups, the commercial flooring kind, are J&amp;J Industries' fort√©. The company, doing business as J + J Flooring Group, boasts one of the largest privately held mills in the industry for manufacturing commercial carpeting. Used in business, institutional, and industrial spaces, the J&amp;J lineup comprises broadloom and modular carpet, backing systems, and adhesives. Products are made and marketed under two main brands: Invision (broadloom and modular carpet for commercial interiors) and Kinetex (durable, textile composite used to cover hard surface products). J&amp;J also provides installation and used carpeting recovery services.

  <p>
   The company continues to evolve with industry trends. In response to customer demand for function and fashion, J&amp;J has created its Invision brand to market its front and back office carpet under one banner.
  </p>
  <p>
   To grow, in early 2016 J&amp;J merged with Engineered Floors, another commercial carpeting provider.
