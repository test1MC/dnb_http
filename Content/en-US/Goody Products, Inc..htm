   Goody has the tools to help even the Bride of Frankenstein have a good hair day. Goody Products manufactures hair care accessories, brushes, combs, and travel storage products. It sells them through food, drug, and discount stores, such as
   <company id="10440">
    Target

   ,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

   . The firm makes products under the Goody, Ace, Stayput, Ouchless, TherapySolutions, Styling Therapy, ColourCollection, and StylingSolutions trademarks. The Goody brand set root in 1907 when Henry Goodman and his son, Abraham, began selling rhinestone-studded hair combs off a pushcart in New York City. Since 1993 it has been owned by

   The company has manufacturing and distribution facilities in Georgia and an office in Ontario, Canada. Manufacturing of the company's products was sent to Goody's other factories and outsourced to China in 2009.

  <p>
   Goody Products, as part of Newell Rubbermaid's Home Solutions segment, helps to contribute some 28% of its parent's revenue alongside key brands Rubbermaid, Levolor, and Calphalon.

   The company's portfolio of brands comprises namesake Goody, Goody StayPut, Ouchless, Goody Luxe, Goody Mosaic, Styling Therapy, and Goody ColourCollection.

   It also opened a new Design Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2014 to not only accelerate growth but boost its capabilities in both design and innovation. Strategically located, the center enjoys a collaborative, educational community alliance with

   Goody Products targets the female head of household. Previously, Goody launched a major marketing campaign to support its debut of Styling Therapy brushes, which contain special substances that help control dandruff, add shine, and protect hair color. Since the marketing campaign, Goody has seen sales of Styling Therapy products rise.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While Newell Rubbermaid does not break out Goody Products' financials separately, the Home Solutions segment logged a 2.5% increase in net sales in fiscal 2013. Indeed, core sales rose some 3%, thanks to mid-single-digit growth in the Rubbermaid Consumer business following more focused merchandising activities, successful new product launches from Levolor, and distribution gains from Calphalon. Overall, the segment's North American and international sales increased about 3% and 6%, respectively, excluding currency impacts.
