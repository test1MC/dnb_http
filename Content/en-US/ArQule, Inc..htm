   ArQule is pursuing drug research in the molecular biology field, with a focus on cancer cell termination. The biotechnology firm works independently and with other drugmakers to discover new potential drug compounds based on its cancer-inhibiting technology platform. ArQule is developing a portfolio of oncology drugs, with a handful of anti-cancer compounds undergoing clinical trials. Its lead product candidate, in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development together with development and commercialization partner,
   <company id="140780">
    Daiichi Sankyo
   </company>
   , is tivantinib, an oral, selective inhibitor of the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Under terms of ArQule's partnership deal with Daiichi Sankyo, the two firms collaborate on the development of tivantinib in the US, Europe, and several other international markets.
   <company id="56869">
    Kyowa Hakko
   </company>
   has development rights to the compound in Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Tivantinib is in late stage clinical testing and is the closest to being marketed of all ArQule's candidates.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's pipeline also consists of ARQ 621, designed to inhibit the Eg5 kinesin motor protein, ARQ 736, designed to inhibit the RAF kinases, and ARQ 092, an AKT (serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor.

        <p>
   The company's revenue grew by 62% in 2011 thanks to $4 million from its license agreement with Kyowa Hakko, $5.1 million from its Daiichi Sankyo AKI program and $10 million from its license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the development of ARQ 092. Offsetting these increases was a decrease of $1 million in revenue from its Daiichi Sankyo tivantinib program.
  </p>
        <p>
   Chemed's loss dropped by 64% in 2011 due to cut in research and development expense primarily because of a $1.8 million decrease in outsourced clinical and product development costs related to its Phase 1 and 2 programs for tivantinib, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses.

        <p>
   ArQule is hoping that its proprietary oncology technologies will help it advance effective new drugs to market. In addition to its own internal development efforts and its existing collaborations, it looks for other strategic alliances, in the form of licensing agreements, acquisitions, or collaborations.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the company and Daiichi Sankyo agreed to develop a new AKT inhibitor called ARQ 092. The partners are collaborating with the National Human Genome Research Institute of the
   <company id="100358">
    National Institutes of Health
   </company>
   to clinically develop ARQ 092.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also has agreements with
   <company id="11175">
    Wyeth
   </company>
   (now
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   ) to discover and develop Alzheimer's disease treatments and with

    Solvay
   </company>
   now part of
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for irritable bowel syndrome. In fact, ArQule partnering with other, larger pharmaceutical companies for its development efforts is a key component of ArQule's strategy. Past and present partners include Daiichi, Kyowa,

   ,
