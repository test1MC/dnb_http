  <p>
   The company was formed in 2000 when Petrochem bought Carless (which traces its history back to 1859, and coined the word "petrol" for its petroleum distillate) from Spanish giant
   <company id="41831">
    Repsol
   </company>
   and merged the two companies' operations. Petrochem Carless underwent a management buyout (backed by
   <company id="90253">
    Lloyds Banking Group
   </company>
   ) in 2005, and the European Commission approved a move by a Lloyds unit (TSB Development Capital) to buy it outright in 2010.
