Bankrate culls information from about 4,800 institutions, covers nearly 600 local markets across the US, and distributes content to about 175 media partners. Other Bankrate sites include InsureMe.com and NetQuote, which sell leads to insurance agents and carriers, and CreditCardGuide.com, a credit card comparison website.
