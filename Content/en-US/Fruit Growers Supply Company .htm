   Shipping cartons are the real fruit of labor for Fruit Growers Supply (FSG). The non-profit cooperative association supplies affiliate

   and other agricultural businesses with packing materials, fertilizer, and related implements. Offerings include a range of equipment used to grow, pick, package, and transport many commodity cash crops. FSG also provides packing services and custom design and installation of irrigation systems. It owns and operates some 335,000 acres of timberland along the West coast (a source of box material and income), a carton manufacturing and supply plant, and seven retail operations centers. FGS is owned by 6,000-plus citrus growers and shippers in the US.

  <p>
   To serve the agricultural community, FGS operates six operation centers which feature central buying and warehousing capabilities, specialized ordering, and custom design irrigation departments in California and Arizona. It also operates the Ontario Carton Plant in California. Its Northern Operations own and manage 277,863 acres of forestland owned in fee in Siskiyou, Shasta, and Lassen Counties in northern California; 21,410 acres in Jackson, Douglas, Lane, Linn, and Klamath Counties in south western Oregon; and 28,663 acres in Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Lewis, Pacific, and Skamania Counties in Western Washington.

  <p>
   In addition to cartons, FGS operates a pallet-manufacturing subsidiary, United Wholesale Lumber, which is supplied by its timberland resources. The association is one of the largest landowners in California; its timberland (which also spans Oregon and Washington) is overseen by a forestry-trained staff that manages timber sales, logging, and reforestation. Although the association branched out to corrugated cardboard cartons, it maintains timberland as a renewable resource to help reduce overhead expenses. This investment allows FGS to operate without additional capital investment from its members.

FGS sells to non-member vineyards and ranch owners, too, enabling it to defray plant operating costs. Its operations centers provide over-the-counter sales, customer service, and support for irrigation systems as well as wind machines used to protect fruit crops from cold damage.

   Growing its milling operations, in 2013 FGS announced plans to build a small log mill in Yreka, California, to process small diameter logs into lumber for use in the making of pallets, as well as for other agricultural and non-agricultural purposes.
