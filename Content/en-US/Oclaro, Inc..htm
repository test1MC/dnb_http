   And you thought splitting hairs was tedious. Oclaro (a combination of the words "optical" and "clarity") integrates the light-processing functions of optical networking components onto silicon chips, which it then puts into communications products such as transceivers, transponders, transmitters, receivers, and modulators. Typical devices for dividing wavelengths of light combine several components, such as tunable lasers, lenses, and filters. Oclaro sells its optical components to telecommunications and data communications systems and components vendors; other customers come from the laser systems, life sciences, industrial printing, and consumer electronics industries.

  <p>
   Oclaro has research and development and chip fabrication facilities in California (its headquarters), Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the UK. It has in-house and contract manufacturing sites in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the US, with sales offices in most of the major world regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gets around 85% of sales from outside the US. Asia is its largest market, generating 53% of revenue.

  <p>
   In addition to using a direct sales force in certain large markets (China, Germany, Japan, Thailand, the UK, and the US, among others), Oclaro also sells through international sales representatives and resellers to extend its reach to smaller markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Customers include major makers of telecommunications equipment:

   Oclaro's revenue has bounced up and down in recent years, but mostly down after the company hit peak sales of $586 million in 2013. Revenue rose 20% to $408 million in 2016 (ended July) from $341 million in 2015, boosted by a 92% jump in sales of its 100 Gb/s client side transceivers and line side discrete components.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lurched from a loss of $57 million in 2016 to a profit of $8.6 million in 2016. Besides higher revenue, the company didn't have losses from discontinued operations in 2016 that it did the year before. The company also has lower costs due to a restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow turned positive at $6.2 million in 2016 after a negative flow of $46 million in 2015.

   Oclaro has been trying to get handle on expenses over the past three year through a restructuring effort. It simplified its operating footprint, reduced its cost structure, and focused research and development on its core products, optical communications. It wound down the effort in 2016, spending just $400,000 on restructuring, down from $4 million and $13 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the restructuring, Oclaro transferred its final assembly and test operations in Shenzhen, China to a Malaysian facility of Singapore-based contract manufacturer
   <company id="99785">
    Venture Corporation
   </company>
   . The company also divested some operations.

   In 2009 Bookham merged with rival Avanex in a stock-swap transaction and changed its name to Oclaro. The merger gave the company greater vertical integration, allowing it to control product development from chip and component design through subsystem manufacturing. It also made Oclaro one of the top suppliers to the metro and long-haul networking market and helped it diversify into new growth markets such as biotechnology, medical instrumentation, and consumer electronics.
