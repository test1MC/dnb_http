   Mattson Technology supplies plasma and thermal processing equipment used in the process to make computer chips. Its systems include equipment that deposit materials onto silicon wafers, prepare wafers for photoresist, and etch patterns onto wafers. Top customers Global Foundries (a contract manufacturer of semiconductors) and
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   (an OEM) together account for more than two-thirds of sales. Mattson has been purchased for $300 million by E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center, a private equity firm based in Beijing.

  <p>
   E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center offered to acquire Mattson in December 2015. By March 2016 Mattson shareholders had approved the deal and it was concluded in May 2016.  E-Town Dragon is a national investment body with $18.9 billion to carry capital investment costs related to semiconductor manufacturing. About 17% of Mattson's revenue comes from China and another 43% is from China.

  <p>
   Products are made at two manufacturing plants in Germany and the US (at its California headquarters). Sales and customer support offices are spread across about 16 locations throughout the world, including China, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US.

  <p>
   In 2015 customers in Taiwan made up 43% of sales; China accounts for 17%, the US for 15%, and Taiwan, 10%.

   Mattson Technology uses a direct sales force and distributors in countries where it doesn't have a sales office. For example, Canon Marketing (a division of
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   ) sells its products in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because it costs a lot of money for semiconductor manufacturers to install and integrate Mattson's equipment into their operations, the company has a limited core customer base, with Samsung and Global Foundries accounting for the majority of sales. Its equipment ranges in price from $700,000 to more than $4 million, making the cancellation or delay of any orders financially significant to the company.

   The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical and heavily dependent on sales of computers, consumer electronics, and mobile devices. Revenue dipped 3% to $172 million in 2015 from $178 million in 2014. The company received lower revenue from the sale of its etch systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 4% to $10.5 million in 2015 from 2014. The company reduced costs for research and development, personnel, and outside services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mattson reversed cash flow to a positive $10.7 million in 2015 from a negative $7.6 million in 2014 due to higher net income and changes in working capital.

  <p>
   Although Mattson Technology uses cost reduction measures, it's largely dependent upon improvement in the semiconductor equipment industry and improvement in the economy as a whole, in order to increase sales and improve profitability. In late 2011 it initiated a restructuring initiative to cut costs and return to profitability. Over the past few years it closed manufacturing and R&amp;D plants and reduced headcount.
