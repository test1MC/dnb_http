   The company grows through organic innovations and acquisitions. In 2013 Avery Weigh-Tronix introduced its latest floor scale, the Stainless Steel ProDec, for environments that require strict sanitation. The new platform scale, based on the company's industry-recognized ProDec model, was designed with the food and chemical industry in mind. The scale is available with capacities ranging from 2,000 lbs to a more heavy-duty 10,000 lbs.

   Avery Weigh-Tronix is a part of ITW's Test and Measurement group. Since joining ITW in 2007, Avery Weigh-Tronix has ramped up its portfolio of automated weighing systems. In 2009, for example, the company added a self-service truck scale. The device eliminates the need for an onsite scale attendant, collecting the legal for trade driver and truck weight information, accurately and efficiently. A wireless, trade-approved, scale weighting system for forklifts was also introduced.

   Although several of Avery Weigh-Tronix's predecessor companies, such as Avery and Salter, date back to the 18th century, Avery Weigh-Tronix was formed in the 21st through the merger of Weigh-Tronix and Avery Berkel.
