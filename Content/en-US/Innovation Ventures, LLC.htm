   Coffee isn't the only energy-producer consumers thirst after. Innovation Ventures is a holding company that owns Living Essentials LLC, marketer of two-ounce energy drink, 5-hour Energy. Unlike other carbonated energy drinks, 5-hour Energy doesn't contain any sugar and only has four calories, thanks to its small size that packs quite a punch. 5-hour Energy is a blend of vitamins, amino acids, and caffeine, and comes in several flavors, as well as a decaf and extra-strength formula. 5-hour Energy drinks are strategically placed at the checkout counter, rather than the beverage aisle, at most major grocery, drug, and convenience stores in the US, Canada, and overseas. It's owned by entrepreneur Manoj Bhargava.

   Through its Living Essentials business, Innovation Ventures sells its products throughout North America. 5-hour Energy is available in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, Ireland, South Africa, and Spain. The company is expanding into Mexico, Portugal, Panama, and South Korea.

   Rather than selling its product as a beverage, the company markets its 5-hour Energy drink as a pick-me-up impulse item at the checkout counter among gum and magazines. It targets supermarkets and convenience stores as a way to drive growth and better compete with the crowded energy drinks business. The company sells its products through the likes of

   , among others.

  <p>
   Since 2009, the company has invested some $395 million in marketing the 5-hour Energy product line, spending a large portion of the money on TV commercials. It aims to expand its customer base to a more diverse demographic.

   The 5-hour Energy maker is expanding production, extending its product line, exporting to more global markets, and considering strategic acquisitions, having sold $450 million in notes in 2012 that are due in 2019. The company is looking to turn around a $4.6 million drop in sales to mass merchants in 2012. It's banking on growth projections ($2.5 billion by 2016) within the US energy shot market despite some negative press in 2012 that its products were potentially dangerous.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its business, 5-hour Energy works to seek out and cease counterfeiting of its energy shot product. In 2012 the company filed suits in the US federal district courts in both California and New York, later identifying and shutting down the counterfeiters' factory.

  <p>
   The company generated $595.8 million in sales in 2012, during which it sold about 1.4 million bottles of 5-hour Energy each day. Its gross profit margins have averaged 80% for the period of 2007 to 2011.
