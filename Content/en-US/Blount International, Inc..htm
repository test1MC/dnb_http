   Folks at Blount International have their work cut out for them. The manufacturer produces cutting chain, guide bars, sprockets, and accessories for chainsaws, concrete-cutting equipment, and lawnmower blades. Blount's lineup is sold under brands Oregon, Carlton, Tiger, and Windsor to outdoor equipment OEMs, including

   </company>
   , and the replacement and retail markets. Other subsidiaries supply log splitters, post-hole diggers, and other agriculture add-ons. End users are professionals and consumers engaged in forestry, lawn and garden, farming, and construction activities. The company's manufacturing facilities dot Brazil, Canada, China, and the US. About two-thirds of Blount's sales are made outside the US. In early 2016 it was acquired by private-equity firms American Securities and P2 Capital Partners.

  <p>
   Blount sells its products across two segments: forestry, lawn, and garden (FLAG), and farm, ranch, and agriculture (FRAG). The former segment represents about 70% of its total sales each year, while the latter accounts for the remainder.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also operates a concrete cutting and finishing (CCF) equipment business that is reported within the "corporate and other" category. This business manufactures and markets diamond-cutting chains, assembles and markets concrete cutting chain saws, and purchases other concrete cutting products that are marketed to the construction and utility industries.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a global sales and distribution network of over 300 distributors, 30,000 dealers, direct sales companies, and mass merchants, which sell to the global forestry, lawn and garden; farm, ranch, and agriculture; and construction products end markets. The company also sells through nearly 100 original equipment manufacturers.

   After posting a decline in 2013, Blount saw its revenues rebound for 2014, increasing 5% to peak at a record-setting $945 million. Profits also skyrocketed over 650% from $5 million in 2013 to $37 million in 2014. Its operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years, rising sharply in 2013, but declining by 15% during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was driven by a 5% increase from its FLAG segment due to a rise in demand across most geographic regions, especially South America (increased by 8%) and North America (7%). Its FRAG operations experienced a 3% increase in 2014 due to higher unit sales volumes (led by increased sales of log splitters and tractor attachments) and higher average selling prices across North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blount's surge in profits for 2014 was attributed to the improved revenue coupled with lower expenses related to the impairment of acquired intangible assets along with charges related to restructuring activities.

  <p>
   Blount has also fueled its momentum by strategically expanding its product portfolio and customer base through acquisitions. In 2014 the company acquired Arizona-based Pentruder. As part of the transaction, the company became the exclusive distributor of Pentruder high-performance concrete cutting systems in North and South America. Pentruder now operates under Blount's concrete cutting and finishing (CCF) equipment business.
