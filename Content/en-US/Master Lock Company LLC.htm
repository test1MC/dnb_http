Today, it continues to manufacture and market padlocks, as well as steering wheel locks, cable locks and U-locks, window and door locks and alarms, electronic access control solutions, and other products for the home and security applications in the automotive, consumer goods, commercial, education, and government markets.

   The parent company's Security &amp; Storage segment's revenues decreased by 1% in 2013, due to a decline in revenues from storage products primarily due to the timing of promotions by the business's largest customer. The Security &amp; Storage segment contributed 14% of the total revenues of

   Master Lock was founded in 1921 by locksmith and inventor Harry Soref, and during prohibition it operated out of the abandoned Pabst Brewery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company's colorful history includes providing padlocks for many of the establishments that served outlawed booze during prohibition, as well as for New York City federal agents to lock down many of those same establishments. Additionally, Soref had advised Harry Houdini about keys that could be used to help the magician escape from handcuffs in his stage acts.
