   Columbus McKinnon's machinery products can be extremely uplifting -- literally. Founded in 1875, the company is one of North America's largest producers of equipment for lifting, positioning, or securing all kinds of large materials. Columbus McKinnon's hoists, cranes, actuators, and steel lifting and rigging tools are used in construction, general manufacturing and industrial machinery, forestry, mining, and even wind energy. Well known in the marketplace, its brand names include Coffing, Duff-Norton, Shaw-Box, and Yale (made by

   </company>
   ). Hoists are the company's biggest seller, generating almost 60% sales. In addition to OEMs, the company sells to hardware distributors and rental outlets.

  <p>
   New York-based Columbus McKinnon operates 19 principal manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, Hungary, Mexico, the UK, and the US. It has a network of roughly 38 sales and service offices in 23 countries and nine warehouse facilities spanning five countries. The US accounts for about 64% of sales, followed by Europe with 25%.

   Hoists account for 59% of the company's total revenue, while chain and rigging tools account for 13%. Other products include industrial cranes (5%), actuators and rotary unions (11%), digital power control and delivery systems (8%), elevator application drive systems (2%) and other products (2%).

  <p>
   The company's sales increased 3% in fiscal 2015 (ended March) versus the prior year, to $597 million. The growth was fueled by a 15% bump in industrial cranes sales, particularly within the US. Columbus McKinnon's net income, however, fell 28% from 2014 to 2015 to $20 million. This was attributed to additional costs associated with acquisitions and losses affiliated with unfavorable foreign currency translations.

  <p>
   Columbus McKinnon's sights are set on South America and China, where industrial opportunities are expected to be strong. Its direction is supported by a number of product introductions relevant to developing economies, including lightweight high-speed industrial air hoists, forged lifting attachments, and hand hoists and lever tools, made at lower-cost facilities in China.
