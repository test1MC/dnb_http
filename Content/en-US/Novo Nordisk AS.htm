   Until there is a cure for diabetes, Novo Nordisk will stay busy, and as long as diabetes is on the rise, it will likely stay profitable. It is one of the world's leading producers of human insulin, insulin analogues, injection devices, and education materials. It makes modern insulin analogues Levemir and NovoLog (which mimic natural insulin regulation more closely than human insulin) and Saxenda, which treats obesity. The firm also has products in the areas of hemostasis management (blood clotting), human growth hormone, and estrogen replacement therapy. The not-for-profit Novo Nordisk Foundation, through its Novo A/S subsidiary, controls the voting power in Novo Nordisk.

  <p>
   The company operates in two business segments: diabetes care (which covers insulins, oral anti-diabetic drugs, and obesity) and biopharmaceuticals (which covers hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, and hormone replacement therapy). Novo Nordisk is the world's leader with 47% of the total insulin market in volume, as well as 46% of the market for modern and new-generation insulins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Drawing upon its familiarity in working with chronic disorders, Novo Nordisk has built up a stable group of non-diabetic biopharmaceuticals. NovoSeven is used to treat hemophilia in patients who have developed inhibitors to other treatments, and to treat patients who develop hemophilia later in life. Norditropin is the company's liquid human growth hormone which is given to children and adults with a growth hormone deficiency. It has extended the line of products to include easier-to-use injection devices. Its line of female hormone replacement therapies are used to reduce symptoms of menopause.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Novo Nordisk has production facilities around the globe, but keeps the production of its active pharmaceutical ingredients close to home in Denmark. As with most biopharmaceutical enterprises, Novo Nordisk engages in alliances with medical institutions and other drug companies to further its research and marketing activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its primary markets are North America (about 50% of revenues), China, Japan, and major countries in Europe. The company's business in other markets including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, and Turkey is also growing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has seen revenue growth over the past five years. In 2014 revenue grew 6% to DKK 88.8 billion as North America and China sales rose. Both the diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals segments have seen increased sales, primarily driven by modern insulin and two products -- Levemir and Victoza (which together account for more than three-fourths of the sales growth). In biopharmaceuticals, a 6% increase in Norditropin sales in North America as well as increased demand for the pre-filled FlexPro device helped boost revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 5% to DKK 26.4 billion in 2014, largely due to the increased revenue. Cash flow from operations grew 22% to DKK 31.7 billion as a result of the higher profits and a decline in income tax paid.

   Novo Nordisk has worked to keep its pipeline of products robust and productive. In 2014 it was granted marketing authorization for type 2 diabetes treatment Xultophy in Europe, while in the US its Saxenda obesity treatment was given approval. The company launched recombinant factor VIII (NovoEight) in Japan and in some European nations for the treatment of hemophilia. Other launches that year include the NovoFine Plus 32G 4mm ultra-thin universal pen needle and its Ryzodeg insulin in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its production capabilities, the company opened a new modern insulin manufacturing facility in Russia in 2015. In 2014 it acquired a manufacturing facility in New Hampshire and began building new laboratories in its R&amp;D campus in Måløv, Denmark. Novo Nordisk has also broken ground on two new production facilities -- one in Clayton, North Carolina, and another in Kalundborg, Denmark -- both of which should be operational by 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the anti-IL-20 treatment for rheumatoid arthritis failed to show effectiveness in phase 2 trials, Novo Nordisk discontinued its inflammatory disorders operations. It didn't expect to make any product launches in that area before the late 2020s.

   Further boosting its portfolio of diabetes and obesity intellectual property, the company is acquiring two US biopharmaceutical research firms (Calibrium and MB2) for undisclosed amounts.

  <p>
   Novo Nordisk was formed by the 1989 merger of Danish insulin producers Novo and Nordisk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon after Canadian researchers first extracted insulin from the pancreases of cattle, Danish researcher August Krogh (winner of the 1920 Nobel Prize in physiology) and physician Marie Krogh, his wife, teamed up with H. C. Hagedorn, also a physician, to found Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium. One of their lab workers was an inventor named Harald Pedersen, and in 1923 Nordisk hired Pedersen's brother, Thorvald, to analyze chemicals. The relationship was unsuccessful, however, and the brothers left the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Pedersens decided to produce insulin themselves and set up operations in their basement in 1924. Harald also designed a syringe that patients could use for their own insulin injections. Within a decade their firm, Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium, was selling its product in 40 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Nordisk introduced a slow-acting insulin in 1936. NPH insulin, launched in the US in 1950, soon became the leading longer-acting insulin. Nordisk later became a major maker of human growth hormone.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII Novo produced its first enzyme, trypsin, used to soften leather. It began producing penicillin in 1947 and during the 1950s developed Heparin, a trypsin-based drug used to treat blood clots. The company unveiled more industrial enzymes in the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Novo began selling its insulin in the US through a joint venture with E. R. Squibb (now part of
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ). The next year Novo was the first to produce human insulin (actually a modified form of pig insulin), and in 1983 Nordisk introduced the Nordisk Infuser, a pump that constantly released small quantities of insulin. Two years later Novo debuted the NovoPen, a refillable injector that looked like a fountain pen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novo was the world's #2 insulin maker (and the world's largest maker of industrial enzymes) when it merged with #3, Nordisk, in 1989. By combining their research and market share, they were better able to compete globally with then-#1
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   . After the merger, Novo Nordisk introduced the NovoLet, the world's first prefilled, disposable insulin syringe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novo Nordisk introduced drugs for depression (Seroxat, 1992), epilepsy (Gabitril, 1995), and hemophilia (NovoSeven, 1995). The company entered a joint marketing alliance with
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   subsidiary LifeScan, the world's #1 maker of blood glucose monitors, in 1995. It also began working with
   <company id="43931">
    Rhône-Poulenc Rorer
   </company>
   on estrogen replacement therapies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eli Lilly raised a new challenge in 1996 with the FDA approval of Humalog (the US's first new insulin product in 14 years), which is absorbed faster, giving users more flexibility in their injection schedule. (Novo Nordisk's own fast-acting insulin product, NovoLog, received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval four years later.) A 1998 marketing pact with
   <company id="11326">
    Schering-Plough
   </company>
   signaled Novo Nordisk's desire to boost sales of its diabetes drugs in the US, where Eli Lilly had historically dominated.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Novo Nordisk split its health care and enzymes businesses; the split left Novo Nordisk with all the health care operations, while a new company,
   <company id="105933">
    Novozymes
   </company>
   , was formed to carry out the enzyme business. It bought out the remaining shares in its Brazilian subsidiary, Biobrás, in 2001.  In 2002 the company spun off its US-based biotechnology firm,
   <company id="103843">
    ZymoGenetics
   </company>
   . It retained a one-third of the company until selling its shares to
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   in 2010.
