   Sanmina means to be a top contract manufacturer of sophisticated electronic components. It designs and makes printed circuit boards and board assemblies, backplanes and backplane assemblies, enclosures, cable assemblies, optical components and modules, and memory modules. In addition, the company increasingly provides more value-added services such as design and engineering, materials management, order fulfillment, and in-circuit testing. It serves OEMs in the health care, defense, medical, aerospace, telecommunications, and technology industries, among others. Sanmina puts its manufacturing facilities close to its customers in lower-cost regions. More than 80% of its sales come from operations outside the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sanmina's Integrated Manufacturing Solutions unit (80% of sales) makes printed circuit board assembly and test, optical, and radio frequency modules. The Components, Products, and Services unit (20% of sales) makes interconnect systems and mechanical systems components in addition to memory and storage products and other services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sanmina, based in San Jose, California, operates nearly 80 facilities in more than 20 countries. Mexico is the company's largest geographic segment, producing 30% of revenue. China accounts for 20% of revenue with US customers generating about 15%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company supplies OEMs primarily in the communications networks, defense and aerospace, industrial and semiconductor systems, medical, multimedia, computing and storage, automotive and clean technology sectors. Two markets -- Industrial, Medical, and Defense and Communications Networks -- each account for about 40% of revenue. Sanmina's top 10 customers together generate half of sales. Nokia accounts for more than 10% of Sanmina's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanmina sells through its direct sales force as well as representative sales firms.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sales inched up 2% in 2016 (ended October) from 2015, for a total of about $6 billion. Sales to industrial, medical, and defense customers jumped about 10%, boosted by customer program acquisitions. Customers in the depressed oil and gas market, however, reduced purchases from Sanmina in 2016. Lower demand for communications network products cut that segment's sales 3% while sales of optical technologies rose. Reduced demand for set-top boxes and point-of-sale systems reduced revenue in the embedded computing and storage market segment about 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sanmina's 2016 net income of $190 million was half of the 2015 net income. The company had a tax benefit in 2015 that it didn't have in 2016 thus the lower net income. The 2016 net income was more in line with net income in 2014 and 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The $390 million in cash flow from operations in 2016 more than doubled the $175 million of 2015. The improved cash generation came from an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $40 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher business volume.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Part of Sanamina's strategy is to do as much work for its clients as possible. In an increasing number of cases that means working with a customer to design a product practically from the ground up. Additional services provide higher margins to Sanmina than its basic contract manufacturing work. In 2016, Sanmina teamed up with Nokia to make and sell a series of data center products. Sanmina's worldwide network of facilities provide quick delivery of the Nokia data center products to customers in nearby markets. In another situation, Sanmina provided hardware elements for products from software provider SAS. While SAS concentrated on the software, Sanmina designed and made high speed PCBs, enclosures, and backplanes for the products.
  </p>
  <p>
   This feeds into another element of Sanmina's strategy, the pursuit of diversification. With half of its revenue coming from just 10 customers, the company is seeking new customers in various markets. In the past several years, Sanmina's industrial segment has overtaken its communications segments as its biggest revenue producer. The company aims to maintain or even increase its rate of customer diversification.

  <p>
   Sanmina supplemented its storage hardware offerings with a software component through an acquisition. The $40 million deal for a privately held company adds data storage software for OEM's and systems integrators to Sanmina's portfolio. With another acquisition, Sanmina expanded in manufacturing capabilities in Malaysia. The company bought the factory from a customer for more than $50 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Sanmina bought a privately-held company that designs and manufactures equipment for the oil and gas industry.

  <p>
   Bosnian immigrants Jure Sola (chairman and CEO) and Milan Mandaric founded Sanmina in 1980 to provide just-in-time manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The name Sanmina comes from the names of Mandaric's children.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the late 1980s and early 1990s Sanmina shifted production to higher-margin components, such as backplane assemblies and subassemblies. Mandaric, an entrepreneur with other interests, left in 1989. The company went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like other contract manufacturers, Sanmina began bolstering its operations through acquisitions. The company bought manufacturing plants from Comptronix (1994), Assembly Solutions (1995), Golden Eagle Systems (1996), and

   (1996). In 1997 the company bought contract electronics maker Elexsys International, which was headed by Milan Mandaric. Sanmina also opened a plant in Ireland.
