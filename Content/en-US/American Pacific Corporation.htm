   American Pacific (AMPAC) manufactures and markets a potent mix of Specialty Chemicals and Fine Chemicals, mainly for pharmaceutical uses. Its largest unit makes and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates to the pharmaceutical industry. AMPAC's specialty chemicals also include sodium azide, an airbag deployment chemical also used in pharmaceuticals; and Halotron, an ozone-friendly fire suppressant. The company also makes and environmental protection products, including electro-chemical equipment for the water treatment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Serving clients in the US and other countries, the company's corporate headquarters is located in Las Vegas, and its manufacturing facilities are located in California, Texas, and Utah.

  <p>
   The company operates in three business segments: Fine Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals, and Other Businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMPAC's Fine Chemicals segment is operated through subsidiaries Ampac Fine Chemicals LLC and AMPAC Fine Chemicals Texas, LLC (collectively "AFC").
  </p>
  <p>
   AFC is a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and registered intermediates for customers in the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical ingredients it manufactures are used by customers in drugs with indications in three primary areas: anti-viral, oncology, and central nervous system. AFC's customers include some of the world's largest pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as emerging pharmaceutical companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Specialty Chemicals segment engaged in the production of perchlorates, which include several grades of ammonium perchlorate (AP), sodium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate. Sales of perchlorates represented 98% of the segment's revenues for fiscal year 2013. In addition, it produces and sells sodium azide, a chemical primarily used in pharmaceutical manufacturing, and Halotron, a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMPAC's Other Businesses segment includes PEPCON Systems, an operating division of the Company, is a leading manufacturer and supplier of On-Site Hypochlorite Generation systems. It designs, manufactures, and services equipment used to purify water or air in municipal, industrial, and power generation applications. The systems are marketed under the ChlorMaster and Odormaster names.

  <p>
   The company serves a broad spectrum of industries and segments, including Pharmaceutical and Biopharmaceutical, Aerospace, Fire Protection, Military, and Water Treatment. AMPAC supplies APIs and advanced intermediates to the pharmaceutical industry. It makes clean agent chemicals for the fire protection industry, as well as electro-chemical equipment for the water treatment industry. The company supplies AP for use in a number of defense programs, including the

  </p>
  <p>
   Some of its large customers include

  <p>
   AMPAC's revenues increased by 16% in fiscal year 2013 due to growth in all of its segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fine Chemicals segment's increased revenues were led by higher Development Product revenues (associated with an atypically large validation campaign for an anti-viral product that is in late stage clinical trials), as well as increased Oncology Core Product revenues which was supported by higher volumes from new oncology Core Products for drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMPAC's Specialty Chemicals segment revenues grew due to perchlorate volume increases attributed to additional rocket-grade AP volume in support of a unique
   <company id="105717">
    DOD
   </company>
   -related procurement and the occurrence of significant volume for non rocket-grade perchlorate product. It was also positively impacted by higher revenues from the sodium azide and Halotron product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Other Businesses segment revenues grew as a result of the sale of additional water treatment equipment units.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the revenue increase, AMPAC's net income decreased by 8% in 2013, due to increased Income Tax Expenses, and a decline in Income from Discontinued Operations (related to the sale of the Aerospace Equipment segment to
   <company id="12159">
    Moog
   </company>
   ). In addition, there was no Gain on sale of business in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operating activities grew by $40 million in 2013 thanks to an improvement in cash profits provided by its operations, and an increase in cash paid for income taxes.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The pharmaceutical markets AMPAC targets are expected to continue to be driven by strong demand for products that use the company's core technologies, including anti-viral and oncology drugs, many of which are expected to benefit from the use of energetic chemistry or require high containment or other unique engineering expertise. It also expects the AP volume for tactical and strategic missiles to continue at the current levels, and the DOD applications are expected to provide the steady basis for AP demand. While the US government budgeting process will affect the total demand for rocket-grade AP, AMPAC expect volumse within the range of 2.5 million to 5.0 million pounds per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 subsidiary AFC and Proteaf Technologies signed an deal for the joint development and implementation of tools and technologies supporting continuous flow chemistry for fine chemicals manufacturing. Proteaf will supply AFC with development services and specialty equipment for continuous processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's earlier relationship with
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   had become a liability, as large budget cuts decimated the agency's work. (AMPAC had been a major supplier of chemicals and parts to development of the Ares and Constellation rockets, projected to be NASA future "workhorse" launch vehicles after the Space Shuttle fleet was retired. However, the future of Ares and other similar projects was put on hold as Congress shifted funding to other priorities).
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result, in 2012 the company sold its In-Space Propulsion business to control components maker
   <company id="12159">
    Moog
   </company>
   for $46 million in cash. The divestiture of the liquid propulsion systems manufacturing unit allows AMPAC to focus on the growth of its pharmaceutical-related product lines.
