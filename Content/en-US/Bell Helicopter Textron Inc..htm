   Bell Helicopter, a

    Textron

   company, prefers a light lift and a heavy payload. It is a leading manufacturer of commercial helicopters, manned and unmanned vertical lift aircraft, and military tiltrotor aircraft, which lift like a helicopter but fly like an airplane with twice the speed and triple the payload as a traditional helicopter. Different models are suited for transporting troops, emergency medical provisioning, search and rescue, and warfighting. With partner

   Through a 50/50 strategic alliance, Bell Helicopter and Boeing are the prime contractors and suppliers of the V-22 Osprey program. Together, they are developing, testing, manufacturing, and and fielding V-22 multi-role tiltrotor aircraft to meet the amphibious and vertical assault needs of the

   , the strike rescue needs of the
   <company id="150763">

   , and the special operations needs of the
   <company id="151035">

   (USSOCOM). More than 100 Osprey tiltrotors are currently in operation, with Marine Corps MV-22 Ospreys available for deployment in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Air Force Special Operations Command CV-22s available for deployment in support of special operations missions. Bell Helicopter also makes H-1 (Huey) helicopters for the Marines.

  <p>
   Through its commercial business, Bell is a supplier of helicopters for offshore oil and gas, utility, charter, corporate, police, fire, rescue, and emergency medical uses. Its commercial line ranges from light single- and twin-engine helicopters to medium twin-engine helicopters. They include the 206L-4, 407, 407GX, 412EP/EPI, 429, and Huey II. The company's new 505 Jet Ranger X, a short-light single helicopter, achieved its first flight in late 2014; alongside the company is also developing the 525 Relentless, its first super medium commercial helicopter, whose first flight is expected in 2015.

   Operating as a segment, the company contributed 31% to the
   <company id="11466">
    Textron
   </company>
   's 2014 net revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Bell Helicopter's revenues decreased by 6% due to a drop in commercial revenues (the result of lower sales activity across the commercial helicopter market) along with a decrease in other military volume (primarily related to the H-1 helicopter program), partially offset by an $16 million increase in V-22 program revenues, reflecting higher product support volume of $115 million.

  <p>
   With the US withdrawal from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan the company is looking to certain sectors within the commercial market  to pick up the slack. The oil and gas industry, for instance, is showing increased demand for commercial helicopters or other specialty aircraft as exploration and development companies venture to more remote locations. The increase in natural and manmade disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires may also boost demand for aircraft capable of transporting emergency medical supplies and personnel. Demand for replacement aircraft, spare parts, and aircraft MRO services is being driven by aging fleets around the globe. It's estimated that approximately 40% of helicopter fleets are more than 25 years old.

   In 2015, the company introduced the new Bell 407GXP aircraft, which incorporates the reliability and advanced technology of the Bell 407GX platform, and introduces performance improvement, payload increase and pilot workload reduction. That year it also signed a deal with Erickson Incorporated, to provide product support of the Bell 214 B and ST models, including spare parts supply, technical assistance, maintenance training, and maintenance, repair and overhaul services.

  <p>
   Growing its global footprint, in 2015 Bell Helicopter opened an office in Tokyo, and a new regional branch office in the UAE. In 2014 the company opened a new branch in Milan, Italy. In 2014, the company signed a deal with Bangalore-based

   , making Dynamatic the single source regional supplier of major airframe assemblies for the Bell 407GX and 407GT.

   In 2014 Bell Helicopter broke ground on a 82,300-sq.-ft. facility in Lafayette, Lousiana, where the company will assemble its newest commercial helicopter, the Bell 505 Jet Ranger XTM. That year it also entered into an agreement with Van Horn Aviation to develop a composite main rotor blade for the Bell 206 product line, and entered into collaboration with a few companies for the supply of parts for Bell V-280 Valor (
