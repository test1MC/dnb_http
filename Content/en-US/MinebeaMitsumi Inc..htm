  <p>
   MinebeaMitsumi's revenues surged 32% from 2013 to 2014 due to growth across all its segments. Machined components sales increased in 2014 amid the global economic recovery and a higher operating rate that brought unit manufacturing costs down in addition to the positive effect of exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the electronic devices and components segment, growing demand in the smartphone market in 2014 buoyed sales of its ultra-thin light guide plates for high-end product applications as its customer base and market share expanded. HDD spindle motors and information motors also saw spikes in sales.
