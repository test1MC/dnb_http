   Previously called American Eurocopter, the company began operating as Airbus Helicopters, Inc. in early 2014 as part of the reorganization and rebranding of Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Group (formerly Eurocopter and EADS, respectively). Under the new structure, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. benefits from and enriches the Airbus brand as it develops, makes, markets, and supports a diversified rotorcraft product line.
