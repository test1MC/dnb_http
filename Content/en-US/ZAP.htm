   ZAP is driving the future. An acronym for "zero air pollution," ZAP provides efficient, alternative-energy vehicles and products for corporate and government fleets, security, and environmentally conscious consumers around the globe. Products include the Xebra Sedan and Truck, Zappy 3 and Zapino scooters, ZAP Taxi, electric bicycles. The company has two primary businesses -- ZAP Automotive (alternative energy vehicles) and ZAP Power Systems (personal transporters and ATVs) -- to manufacture products that meet the growing demands of eco-friendly consumers.

  <p>
   James McGreen, an inventor who specializes in lightweight motorized vehicles, and Gary Starr, co-founder of electric vehicle retrofitter U.S. Electricar, founded ZAP (Zero Air Pollution) Power Systems in 1994. The two were in part encouraged by the growing attention and legislation concerning fossil fuel emissions. California requires 10% of all vehicles sold by 2003 be zero emission vehicles; some states and countries have similar legislation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 ZAP contracted Power Biking to sell its bikes through auto dealerships and began selling products through catalogs. The company's business continued to pick up speed in 1997, when ZAP and Italian electric-scooter maker Movity formed ZAP Europa to cross-distribute products. The company also signed manufacturing and distribution agreements that year with Dantroh Japan, XtraMOBIL of Switzerland, and Forever Bicycle Co. (Shanghai).
  </p>
  <p>
   ZAP began selling its stock directly to the public via the Internet in 1997 and opened an outlet store in San Francisco. A year later it introduced the ZAPPY scooter, which put a zip into sales. (The company, however, has continued to report losses.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to ZAPWORLD.COM -- because, well, why not? -- and added a store in Key West, Florida, in 1999. It also bought electric vehicle maker emPower. The company bought Electric Vehicle Systems, which makes a two-wheel vehicle designed to tow skaters and skateboarders, in 2000. It added Aquatic Propulsion Technology and its sea scooter technology that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company began marketing an electric motor that can be mounted on manual wheelchairs and shortened its name to ZAP to solidify its brand name. ZAP filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2002 and emerged in late June. Part of the company's reorganization plan included merging with automotive distribution companies Voltage Vehicles and The RAP Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 2003 purchase of a fleet of rental electric cars, including two locations on the main strip in Las Vegas, provides highly visible locations for ZAP to present new products to consumers. In early 2004 the company purchased Santa Barbara-based The Electric Transportation Company (ETC), maker of drivetrains for electric propulsion vehicles. In March 2004 ZAP purchased the assets, including electric vehicles and intellectual property, of Electric Transportation Company. The next month ZAP acquired the exclusive distribution, marketing, and technology rights from Smart-Automobile LLC to make its Smart cars US compliant. That deal fell through in 2006.

   In May 2008, Eqbal Al Yousuf, President of Dubai's Al Yousuf Group -- a privately held engineering conglomerate -- was named Chairman. Gary Starr continues his role with the company as a member of the board.
