  <p>
   TomTom makes 70% of its sales in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and holds the leading market share in Europe (nearly 50%).
  </p>
  <p>
   TomTom continues looking to be at the doorstep in emerging markets as they gradually open up. Regions such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia/Pacific are where it works to turn footholds into strongholds.

   The company's annual revenue has been declining year-over-year. It reported $1.32 billion in revenue for fiscal 2013, down slightly from the $1.39 billion it brought in during fiscal 2012 and the $1.6 billion it reported in revenue for fiscal 2011. TomTom's net income also decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous year. The company cleared a profit of about $27 million in fiscal 2013 after reporting net income of $170 million in fiscal 2012. Despite the decreased revenue and net income, TomTom's cash on hand actually increased by more than $100 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 levels.

  <p>
   TomTom's fundamental strategy consists of controlling each component of the navigation experience, from software development, to content, to hardware. Also part of its strategy is to win contracts and develop products with industry-leading customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   TomTom has focused on its more profitable areas, such as automotive and content and services, as it expects the PND market to continue shrinking in both North America and Europe.
