   Ions are iconic at Axcelis Technologies. The company develops and makes ion implanters that semiconductor manufacturers use to insert ions into silicon wafers to change their conductive properties. Axcelis Technologies manufactures its ion implantation devices in house at its plant in Beverly, Massachusetts. In addition to equipment, it offers aftermarket service and support, including spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, and training. While the company sells its products around the world, the US accounts for about two-thirds of sales.

  <p>
   Ion implantation devices (sold under the Purion brand name) and services and royalties surrounding them account for 90% of Axcelis Technologies' revenue. The other 10% comes from its legacy processing systems. The company works with customers and industry experts to design applications and processes at its Advanced Technology Center in Beverly, Massachusetts.

  <p>
   The company has 30 field offices serving customers in a dozen countries. Its primary operations are in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US.

   Axcelis Technologies sells equipment and services through a direct sales force from offices in China, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. The US is its largest market, while sales to customers in Asia make up 23% of revenues and Europe accounts for about 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has a limited customer base; two customers accounted for 17% of revenue and its top 10 customers accounted for about 70% of revenue.

   After two years of declining revenue Axcelis Technologies recorded a 4% increase in 2014 to reach to $203.1 million. The increase came from better product sales as chip makers loosened their purse strings to buy new systems, spare parts, product upgrades, and used systems from Axcelis Technologies.

  <p>
   The company recorded a net loss for the third straight in 2014, but the loss was less. The 2014 loss was $11.2 million compared to $17 million in 2013 and $35 million in 2012. The company spent less in 2014 to reduce the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company had a negative cash flow of $16 million in 2014 compared to a negative $15 million in 2013.

   To address the challenges facing the semiconductor equipment industry, the company restructures its operations just about every year. For the past two years restructuring has cost about $5 million overall. In 2015 the company sold its corporate headquarters facility to Beverly Property Owner LLC, an affiliate of Middleton Partners, a real estate investment firm, for about $50 million in a sale-leaseback arrangement.

   Axcelis Technologies aims to push its sales of its Purion systems into the Korean semiconductor market. The common Purion platform combines a high-speed, state-of-the-art single wafer end station that has throughput of 500 wafers per hour.

  <p>
   Axcelis Technologies began as part of the Semiconductor Equipment Operations of industrial manufacturer
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton
   </company>
   . In 2000, Eaton spun off the operations as a wholly owned subsidiary, and Axcelis completed an IPO that year, selling less than 20% of the company's shares to the public. Brian Bachman, Eaton SVP and group executive for hydraulics, semiconductor equipment, and specialty controls, was named vice chairman and CEO of the spinoff.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2000 Eaton distributed the remaining 82% ownership it held in Axcelis as a stock dividend to its shareholders, fully ending its involvement in the semiconductor production equipment market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bachman resigned as vice chairman and CEO in 2002. Mary Puma, the company's president and COO, was elevated to the chief executive's post to succeed him. A former
