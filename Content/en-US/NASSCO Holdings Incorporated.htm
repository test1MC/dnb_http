   <company id="116669">

  <p>
   To its advantage, NASSCO operates as the only full-service maintenance and repair shipyard on the West Coast.

  <p>
   Most of NASSCO's business depends upon the ebb and flow of major Navy construction contracts, entailing large, multi-ship programs that span several years.
  </p>

  <p>
   NASSCO works to develop and maintain a reputation for delivering ships ahead of schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's commercial business benefits from the Jones Act, which requires that ships that carry cargo between US ports be built in US shipyards, as well as increasing environmental regulations requiring emission controls on tankers. As ship construction gains steam, NASSCO may increase in headcount.
