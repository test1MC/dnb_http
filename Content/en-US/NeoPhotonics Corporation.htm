   NeoPhotonics wants its clients to see communications in a new light. The company develops and manufactures optical network components using laser-reactive deposition. Its products include photonic integrated circuits (PICs), amplifiers, glass substrates, laser modules, passive optical components, photodiodes, and transceivers. NeoPhotonics' chips and components are used in optical networking equipment for data communications and passive optical networks that enable fiber-to-the-home broadband access among other functions. It has a portfolio of more than 40 product families, including ones that enable data transmission at more than 100 gigabits per second.

  <p>
   The company has manufacturing plants in China, Japan, and the US (in California). Sales offices are located across Europe and in China, Japan, Russia, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   China is its largest single market, accounting for more than 54% of sales, followed by the US, with about 23%. Japan makes up 3%, with the remaining 20% coming from other countries.

   NeoPhotonics' revenue increased 11% to $339 million in 2015 from $306 million in 2014. This increase came mostly from an increase in revenue from high-speed products driven from customer demand and the acquisition of the tunable laser products from EMCORE.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a $3.6 million profit in 2015, a reversal from a $20 million loss in 2014. It has lower expenses, including in R&amp;D, in 2015 to go along with the revenue increase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose to $26 million from a negative $451,000 in 2014.

  <p>
   Operating in a highly competitive industry, NeoPhotonics faces market challenges from other vendors that are preparing planar lightwave devices or photonic integrated circuits based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. The company's stated strategy is to apply its expertise in photonic integrated circuits (PIC's) to a broader range of optical networking product niches, while seeking to expand its relationships with existing clients, and augmenting its R&amp;D efforts with acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquires companies with technologies that will enhance its product lineup.

  <p>
   In 2015 NeoPhotonics acquired the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE Corp. for $17 million. The ultra narrow linewidth tunable laser products already beefed up revenue in the high-speed products line in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company previously bought the semiconductor optical components business of LAPIS Semiconductor for about $10 million. It now operates as NeoPhotonics Semiconductor GK in Japan.
