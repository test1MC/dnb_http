   At least when Groupe Lactalis takes your milk money, you get something in return! Lactalis is the largest dairy enterprise in the world, producing 13.6 million liters of milk a year. It also sells cheese, butter, and cream. Its flagship brand is Président (camembert). Other brands are Bridel, Locatelli, Société, and Valmont. Lactalis operates 200 industrial sites, which support global distribution of its lineup in some 150 countries. Although the group is a leading dairy exporter, about 60% of its sales are domestic. Lactalis was founded in 1933 by André Besnier; his descendants retain control. The French dairy group took over Italian rival

   in 2011.

   In 2014 Lactalis took its first step in India (the world's largest producer of milk and milk products) through the acquisition of a dairy company, Tirumala, for $275 million. It also bought Harvey Fresh Company in Australia.

   Lactalis strengthened its presence in South Eastern Europe with the 2013 acquisition of the Slovenian Society Ljubljanske mlekarne, and in Latin America through the acquisition of the Brazilian Society Balkis.

  <p>
   André Besnier started making cheese in Laval, France, in 1933, and within a year added milk and butter to his business. Besnier's operations expanded during the next 15 years. In 1947 Besnier's business took the name Société Laitière de Laval A. Besnier et Cie.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1950s the company won awards for its butter and started selling milk in one-liter bottles. André Besnier died in 1954 and his son Michel assumed control of the company. The company shorted its name to Société Laitière Besnier in 1961. The next year Besnier entered the yogurt business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besnier started selling its products in hypermarkets in 1963. That year it went public. The company purchased dairy Laitière de Villevêque in 1964. Besnier launched its famed Président brand in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besnier bought dairy Gaston Amy in 1976, which would produce the company's first goat's milk cheese. In 1981 Besnier bought its first non-French company, US cheese producer Belmont. In 1984 Besnier acquired a 45% stake in dairy GIE Lactet; it acquired the rest, including the Lactel and BÁ brands, in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besnier took over Groupe Bidel, including the Lanquetot operations and brand in 1990. That year it also bought UK dairy company David Brough (renamed Besnier UK). In 1991 Besnier bought Perrier's dairy operations, including cheese producer Valmont and yogurt maker Jean Jacques. In 1992 Besnier acquired a 58% stake in Caves de Roquefort from Nestlé (which included US cheese maker Sorrento). A year later, Besnier celebrated the sale of its billionth unit of Président cheese.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Groupe Lactalis in 1999. The name change coincided with the purchase of US cheese producer Simplot Dairy Products, which Groupe Lactalis eventually renamed Sorrento Lactalis. The acquisition doubled US sales for Groupe Lactalis. Emmanuel Besnier took charge of the company following the death of his father, Michel, in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth through acquisition marked 2004. That year Lactalis purchased FoodMaster (dairy products, Kazakhstan and Moldova), Fromageries Pochat et Fils (soft cheese, France), and McLellands (Seriously Strong branded cheddar cheese, UK). Following that strategy, Lactalis began 2005 with the purchase of French cheese maker Pochat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still expanding internationally, the company bought #1 Italian cheese maker Egidio Galbani, from investment firm
   <company id="133199">
    BC Partners
   </company>
   in 2006; it also acquired French dairy Celia, which rings up more than half of its sales from exports, mainly to Algeria and West Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lactalis formed a fresh dairy joint venture with food juggernaut
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   that year as well. The 60 (Lactalis)-40 (Nestlé) operation, Lactalis Nestlé Produits Frais, which covers nine European countries - France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Switzerland, made Lactalis a player in the world dairy industry, right up there with Nestlé, of course, as well as the US's

    Dean Foods
   </company>
   and France's
   <company id="41774">
    Danone
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company continued to expand its foreign market with the acquisition of 91% of Croation dairy company, Dukat, for $370 million. It also bought cheese importer, Denmark's Delimo, from
   <company id="105475">
    Arla Foods
   </company>
   . The acquisition made good business sense since Lactalis already owned Galbani, an Italian supplier of Delimo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spying opportunities beyond France, the group entered Russia in early 2010 by purchasing Efremovski, a processed cheese maker. The deal enables Lactalis to tap demand for hard cheese, a segment which represents approximately 65% of the Russian cheese market. Lactalis acquired the cheese business of Spain's Forlasa Alimentación, the same year. Forlasa's brands include El Ventero, Gran Capitán, and Don Bernardo; it is the world's #1 manufacturer of the sheepy Manchego. Lactalis also bought out Spain's Puleva (milk) from Ebro Foods and Sanutri (infant and baby nutrition products) from French health-food group Nutrition &amp; Santé. The latter move boosted the group's portfolio of baby milk and cereal products, established in 2008 with the takeover of Royal Numico's baby milk and drink businesses and Obory, a Polish producer of milk drinks and drinking yogurts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group looked across the Channel in 2010, too, and acquired Rachel's Dairy UK from US giant Dean Foods. Rachel's is the UK's second-largest organic dairy brand. Its core product is yogurt, a category that Lactalis is just beginning to mine in France.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite
   <company id="91715">
    Parmalat
   </company>
   's desire to remain Italian-owned, Lactalis has rapidly expanded its ownership. Since paying about €3.4 billion ($4.9 billion) for a share of Parmalat, Lactalis in mid-2011 secured an 83% stake and won control of Parmalat's board, gaining nine of 11 board seats, and appointing one of its own executives as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lactalis' coup has helped it rise to the top of both France and Italy's cheese market (as well as Europe's dairy industry). Nonetheless its appetite for acquisitions is unabated. In 2011 the group bought out Fromageries de l'Etoile, in a move estimated between €50 million and €100 million ($69.1 million and $138.2 million). Fromageries de l'Etoile (in English, "Cheese of the Stars") produces an array of specialty cheese, some bearing the coveted
   <em>
    Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée
   </em>
   (AOC) certification, awarded for products originating in certain French regions, in this case Rocamadour. Earlier in the year, Lactalis purchased specialty cheese maker Wälchli, making Lactalis the leading producer of Saint-Nectaire, a French cheese with an AOC pedigree, too. (Lactalis now owns 36 out of the 46 AOC certified cheeses in France.)
