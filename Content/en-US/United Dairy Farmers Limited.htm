   United Dairy Farmers helps its members go to market. The co-op (UDF) primarily buys, processes, and sells milk from more than 1,500-member dairy farmers across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. UDF comprises subsidiaries Dale Farm Dairies, Rowan Glen, and United Feeds, among several, which collect, process, and market more than one billion liters of milk a year, along with providing members general farm services, animal feeds, and other operating inputs. The co-op's products include fluid milk, butter, cheese, ice cream, cultured dairy products (yogurt and cottage cheese), and dairy ingredients.

  <p>
   The cooperative produces and sells dairy products across the UK and Ireland  and exports to more than 45 countries. It processes milk at six facilities in Northern Ireland, England, and Scotland.

  <p>
   Revenue increased 6% in 2015 (ended March) from 2014 for the co-op. An increase in prices for milk and other dairy products offset less raw milk production in 2015.

  <p>
   United Dairy Farmers has invested in facilities in the past several years to modernize and expand operations. Some of the facility changes have allowed it to produce more value-added products.
