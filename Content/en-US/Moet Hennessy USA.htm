   Moët Hennessy USA is the leading importer and marketer of luxury wines and spirits in the US.

In 2014, for instance, Moët Hennessy USA added to its vodka line by launching a Belvedere Mango Passion version. Its Cloudy Bay upscale New Zealand winery also rolled out a new ultra-premium Pinot Noir in 2013. Moët Hennessy USA also partnered with artist Shepard Fairey for a fourth edition release of the company's Limited Edition Hennessy V.S. label.
