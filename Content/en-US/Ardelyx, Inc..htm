   Ardelyx believes the key to a man's, and woman's, disease is through the stomach. The development-stage biopharmaceutical company's drug candidates fight disease by working exclusively in the gastrointestinal tract. It is focused on kidney and bowel disease with its current pipeline. Lead candidate tenapanor, being developed with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , treats late stage and chronic kidney disease as well as constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome. Ardelyx's other candidates target various aspects of kidney, gastrointestinal, and metabolic diseases. Its end-stage renal disease candidate is being developed in conjunction with
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   . The company was formed in 2007 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Ardelyx raised about $60 million in its IPO. It plans to use those funds for product development, including investing in tenapanor in order to increase its percentage of the royalties co-developer AstraZeneca will pay it once the drug is on the market.

  <p>
   Ardelyx has a development agreement with AstraZeneca where the larger company pays all research and development costs for the three trial variations of tenapanor in exchange for worldwide commercialization rights. Ardelyx has the option to co-promote it in the US. The company has a similar deal with pharma major Sanofi for its next candidate in the pipeline, RDX002, which is in the research stage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like many pharmaceutical development firms, Ardelyx touts its drug discovery platform, which targets receptors and transporters in the gastrointestinal system to treat diseases and avoid systemic toxicity. It uses a proprietary culture medium it calls Ardelyx Primary Enterocyte and Colonocyte Culture System to simulate intestinal tissue during drug discovery and research.

  <p>
   Though it has no products to sell yet, Ardelyx does intend to exercise its co-promotion rights with AstraZeneca and Sanofi. At that time, it would build a sales and marketing organization.

  <p>
   As a development stage company, Ardelyx collected less than $30 million in revenue in 2013 from licensing and development payments; its total revenue since inception is about $71 million. But the money continues to flow out for research, development, and clinical trials. As of March 2014, the company had an accumulated deficit of about $72 million.

  <p>
   In order to reverse the losses, Ardelyx must, of course, commercialize a product or several. AstraZeneca is footing the bill for stage two trials of tenapanor but if it goes to stage three, Ardelyx will exercise its right to co-fund that stage in exchange for a greater percentage of the drug's profits. Another part of the company's strategy is to continue seeking funding from partners without giving up any percentage of company ownership. It is also developing sales and marketing capabilities while continuing to seek additional drug candidates.
