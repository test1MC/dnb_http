  <p>
   CPI was once part of the Electron Devices group at the old Varian Associates; it was spun off from Varian in 1995. Varian engineers invented the klystron in 1937, which played an important role in the development of radar during WWII and is still used in high-power microwave equipment. CPI International was formerly known as Communications &amp; Power Industries, which remains the name of the company's main operating subsidiary.
