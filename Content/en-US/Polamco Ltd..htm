   Polamco knows how to stay insulated and connected at the same time. The company manufactures connectors, backshells, and interconnect components for electronic products. Other products include connector covers, screenbraid, screen fixing bands, heat shrink boots, silicon stretch tape, lacing tape, and adhesives. It sells directly and through distributors worldwide to customers in the aerospace, medical, mass transit, oil, communications, shipbuilding, and space sectors. Polamco is also the exclusive European distributor for Breyden lacing tapes, used in civil and military aircraft applications. Its distribution network spans some 20 countries. TE Connectivity, the Switzerland-based components giant, acquired Polamco in 2015.
