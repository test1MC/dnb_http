   Prospects for new business opportunities keep Crown Crafts drooling. Operating through its subsidiaries, Hamco and Crown Crafts Infant Products, the company designs and sells textile products for infants and juveniles. Crown Crafts designs, makes, and markets baby bibs, burp cloths, bathing accessories, and bedding. The childcare products firm founded in 1957 has worked to regain profitability by selling or shuttering its US manufacturing operations and relying on foreign contractors, mainly in China, to make its goods. Crown Crafts' products are sold in department and specialty stores, mass retailers, catalog houses, and outlet stores.

   Irving Ostuw started Crown Crafts in his garage outside of Atlanta in 1957. Philip Bernstein joined the company in 1961. Founded as a tufted bedspread maker, it added jacquard-woven bedspreads 10 years later; Crown Crafts went public in 1968. Michael Bernstein joined his father in 1972 and acquired Ostuw's interest. Crushed-velvet bedspreads and draperies put Crown Crafts on the map during that decade. When those products turned cold in the 1980s, the company introduced comforters and accessories. In 1987 Crown Crafts began manufacturing cotton throws, which became a mainstay. Jacquard-woven cotton products made up nearly half of its 1995 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm entered the baby market that year with the acquisition of Red Calliope, a leading manufacturer of infant bedding products. Crown Crafts also bought KKH of Los Angeles, maker of PillowBuddies. In 1996 the company acquired Churchill Weavers, a maker of luxury hand-woven adult and infant throws, pillows, and fashion accessories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its bid to dominate the baby market, in 1997 Crown Crafts bought Hamco, a maker of baby soft goods such as bibs and blankets, and Noel Joanna (NoJo), a producer of infant bedding and accessories. The next year the company acquired the

   </company>
   Home product line. Wal-Mart dropped Crown Crafts' Signature Series bedding line in early 1999. Markdowns and costs related to the Calvin Klein business hurt profits that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company hired a turnaround expert in early 2000 to find a way to cut losses, then set about remaking itself into a marketing and distribution company. It sold its woven products manufacturing business to textile maker

    Mohawk Industries
   </company>
   for $36 million in November that same year. Crown Crafts also laid off most of its manufacturing workers in Roxboro, North Carolina, and decided to stop making the Studio line of bedding products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2001 the company completed the sale of its adult bedding business (including the Calvin Klein, Royal Sateen, and private-label bedding and bath units) to an executive group headed by former chairman and CEO Michael Bernstein, who was replaced by EVP Randall Chestnut.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2002 the company formalized cost-cutting plans to close its manufacturing operations in Mexico (through its subsidiary Burgundy Interamericana). Operations continued until the end of the company's first quarter, 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2007 the company sold off its Churchill Weavers business, which made woven throws, to Wilford Morris, owner of Indiana-based Walcot Weavers, for about $275,000. Later that year it bought an infants and toddlers line from Springs Global US.
