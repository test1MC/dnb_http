   Dr. Reddy's has had rising revenues for the past three years. In fiscal 2015 (ended March), revenue rose 12% to ₹148 billion due to growth in the Global Generics and Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients divisions.

   (This was partially offset by a decline in the Proprietary Products division.) Sales of new products such as valganciclovir and sirolimus drove growth, as well as higher sales of existing products such as divalproex sodium ER and azacitidine. Sales of APIs also rose, including key products capecitabine and epoxide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The higher revenue led to an increase in net revenue, which rose 3% to ₹22 billion. Cash flow from operations rose 29% to ₹25 billion.

   The company's keys to success include specializing in difficult-to-make or first-to-market products and developing differentiated products to address unmet medical needs. It also works to introduce value-added services to its customers and patients. Dr. Reddy's is also focused on providing affordable alternatives to highly priced innovator brands, including branded and non-branded formulations. It often works with partners to develop these products. For example, in 2015 it partnered with Amgen to market and distribute three Amgen medications (Krypolis, BLINCYTO, and Repatha) in India.

   In 2015, the company launched a generic version of NAMENDA in the US. It also introduced its first OTC hair-growth supplement in India that year.
