   Dot Hill Systems designs and markets RAID (redundant array of independent disks) storage devices that are used in corporate data centers and other network environments by enterprises in data-intensive industries such as financial services and telecommunications. It also makes entry-level and and mid-range storage area network (SANs) and fibre channel systems, and provides storage system and data management software. Dot Hill's products are sold under the Assured brand. Most of the company's sales are made to manufacturing partners, including
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , which accounts for nearly three-quarters of sales. Dot Hill has international offices in Germany, Israel, Japan, and the UK. Seagate Technology bought Dot Hill in late 2015.

  <p>
   Dot Hill's revenue increased 5% to $217.7 million in 2014 from $206.6 million in 2013 driven by a 42% rose in vertical segment sales. The company experienced greater demand for existing products as well as for a new line of higher-density chassis models. The OEM segment, however, posted a 14% drop in sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher revenue and income from continuing operations propelled net income to a 59% jump from 2013 to 2014.
