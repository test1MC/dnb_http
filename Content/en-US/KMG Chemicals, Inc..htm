  <p>
   KMG's revenues decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2016 (July year end) to $298 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electronic chemicals segment sales dropped by or 1.5% primarily due to the impact the stronger US dollar on currency transactions (which cut sales by $6 million), and lower service sales in Asia (caused by the cessation of certain chemical service relationships). These negative impacts were largely offset by volume growth in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other chemicals revenue dropped by 33.4% in fiscal 2016 due to the divestiture of KMG's creosote business in early 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported a net income increase of 54% in fiscal 2016 to $18.7 million thanks to cost improvements from manufacturing consolidation in the electronic chemicals segment and the full year impact of sales in the industrial lubricants business (which was bought in May 2015). Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 2016 by 4% due to improved margins in electronic chemicals, operating efficiencies in KMG's electronic chemicals operations as a result of restructuring, and the realignment of its European operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sale of the lower-profit margin creosote distribution business (in January 2015) also improved gross profit as a percentage of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations activities grew from $16.6 million in fiscal 2015 to $41 million in fiscal 2016 due to higher margins in the electronic chemicals and other chemicals segments. In addition, KMG paid $11.5 million less for distribution expense and $2.4 million less for taxes in fiscal 2016. Trade receivables declined by $5.2 million and inventories decreased by $4.3 million within the electronic chemicals segment. (Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities dropped by $5.3 million due higher-than-usual balances at the end of fiscal year 2015).

  <p>
   The company's strategy is to grow by discovering and exploiting opportunities that other companies overlook. It focuses on customer satisfaction, operational efficiencies, and optimizing its assets. KMG also seeks targeted acquisitions that mesh with and enhance existing business segments, and to effectively integrate acquisitions into ongoing operations while divesting non-core businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding it product line, in 2015 the company moved into the industrial lubricants market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 KMG sold its creosote distribution business to
   <company id="51219">
    Koppers
   </company>
   for about $14.9 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Boosting its industrial lubricants portfolio, in 2017 KMG agreed to acquire Canada-based Sealweld, for $17.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing its electronic chemicals platform in Southeast Asia, in 2016, the company acquired Nagase Finechem Singapore for $2.9 million. The acquired company makes wet process chemicals, including solvents, acids and custom blends for the liquid crystal display, electronics and semiconductor markets, and provides recycling and refining services for certain customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, KMG bought Valves Incorporated of Texas, which makes and distributes industrial sealants and lubricants, primarily to the oil and gas storage, pipeline and gas distribution markets. It also sells related products, including lubrication equipment and fittings.

  <p>
   In 2013 KMG bought the Ultra Pure Chemicals subsidiaries of
   <company id="16661">
    OM Group
   </company>
   in the US, the UK, Singapore, and France for $60 million
   <em>
    .
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company sold its animal health business to Bayer Healthcare, including brands such as Patriot cattle ear tag and Rabon and Permectrin insecticides. Because KMG has grown significantly in the last five years in its electronic chemicals and wood-treating chemicals units, the company decided its animal health business no longer fit within its strategic objectives.
  </p>
  <p>
   KMG acquired the electronic chemicals unit of General Chemical Performance Products in 2010 for $27 million. The unit manufactures wet process chemicals used primarily to clean and etch silicon wafers in the production of semiconductors. The deal not only increased KGM's electronic chemicals business but also expanding its reach into Asia markets.
