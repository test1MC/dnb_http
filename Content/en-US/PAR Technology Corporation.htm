   PAR uses a direct sales force to sell to restaurant chains and their franchisees, as well as the hotel and resort market. The company markets to independent restaurants and non-food service clients such as convenience stores and movie theaters through resellers. It also has a dedicated sales force targeting international markets.

   PAR's overall sales increased 7% in 2012 compared with 2011, to $245.2 million. The rise in sales was driven by a 28% jump in contracts revenue for the firm's new Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems integration contract with the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   . Revenue from products and services both declined. PAR posted a net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million in 2012 compared to a net loss of $13.4 million in 2011. PAR's sales and profit growth has been uneven in recent years, with gains one year and losses the next.
