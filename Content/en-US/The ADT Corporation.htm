   ADT wants you to be armed and calm with its alarms. The company provides products and services used for fire protection, access control, alarm monitoring, medical alert system monitoring, video surveillance, and intrusion detection. It divides its security operations across four disciplines: Residential Security (provides burglar, fire, carbon dioxide alarms), Small Business (intruder detection and cameras), ADT Pulse (allows users to access and control security systems remotely), and Home Health (emergency response in the case of medical emergencies). In early 2016 the company was acquired by

    Apollo Global Management
   </company>
   for $6.9 billion.

   In early 2016 ADT was acquired by
   <company id="40036">
    Apollo Global Management
   </company>
   for $6.9 billion. Apollo plans to combine ADT and its brands with Protection 1, another brand it owns through other security products subsidiaries.

  <p>
   ADT's applications include intrusion and fire protection, closed circuit television (CCTV), access control, computer security, and electronic article surveillance. Its residential products and services include fire and carbon monoxide detection, alarm monitoring, remote operation products, and home connectivity. The ADT Pulse remote system not only provides off-premise security control but accesses lights and thermostats.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The security services company has about 6.6 million commercial, residential, and government customers, as well as sales and service offices in some 200 locations throughout North America. The US accounts for nearly 92% of total sales; Canada is responsible for the remainder.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's residential customers are owners of single-family homes, while its small business customers include retail businesses, small-scale commercial facilities, and offices of professional service providers and similar businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADT markets its electronic security and home/business automation systems and services through national television advertisements, online advertising, paid search, yellow pages, direct mail, and social media tools. It sells its products through more than 450 authorized dealers, which accounted for 40% of its new customer accounts in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $199 million on advertising in 2015 and $168 million in 2014.

  <p>
   ADT's revenues were up 5% from $3.41 billion in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $3.57 billion in 2015. Profits declined 3% from $304 million in 2014 to $296 million in 2015 due to a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue growth for 2015 was driven by a 39% surge in Canada sales and a 3% rise in US sales. The US was aided by growth from residential and business customers. In addition, recurring customer revenue increased as a result of higher average revenue per customer.

  <p>
   ADT's blueprint for growth entails expanding its Residential Security operations by increasing its ADT Pulse adoption rates and through acquisitions. In 2014 it purchased Reliance Protectron from Reliance Comfort Limited Partnership. ADT acquired Protectron for total cash consideration of C$555 million in a transaction that will accelerate its growth plan for the key Canadian market.
  </p>
  <p>
   ADT is also expanding its service offerings to mid-sized businesses in the top US commercial security markets. These include Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, the New York metropolitan area, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Seattle/Tacoma, as well as the states of California, Florida, New Jersey, and Texas. ADT's initial plans call for investing in the necessary resources and making further enhancements to its product portfolio in order to capture future growth opportunities within these key commercial markets.
