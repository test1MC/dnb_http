   Bodycote reported in 2012 that its North American operations enjoyed a 25% spike in revenues (of which 6% was organic and 19% was from acquisitions). The growth was driven by increased car and light truck related sales. It also enjoyed a 25% rise in general industrial sales.

   The company fortified its southeastern US operations in 2012 when its parent acquired Carolina Commercial Heat Treating for $68 million. The deal also added to Bodycote's expertise in the off-road vehicle and heavy truck markets.
