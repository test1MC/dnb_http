  <p>
   The Duchossois Group invests in company which have annual revenues  between $100 million to $500 million and EBIT of between $5 million to $50 million. It is seeking to add to and diversity its existing portfolio through complementary and strategic acquisitions and investments. For example, in 2014 The Duchossois Group acquired Controlled Products Systems Group (CPSG), headquartered in Denver. The acquisition complemented the company's The Chamberlain Group subsidiary and will serve growing market demand within the safety, security, and sales, and service support industries.

   The Duchossois Group's current strategy is "lifestyle improvements for the home and office." To that end, it is looking to expand the company's existing portfolio of consumer goods, access control, and systems integration companies, as well as diversifying and adding firms that have niche products, strong management teams, and intellectual property. Its venture capital fund,

   </company>
   , focuses on acquiring communications, information technology, semiconductors, and software businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company believes it has a competitive edge based on its business philosophy. It holds a purchased company for a longer period than most strategic buyers; it tries to preserve the culture and staff of the companies it acquires; it is able to provide operating resources; and it allows sellers to remain invested in their businesses.
