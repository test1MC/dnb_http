It also markets other furnishings and decor, such as seating, tables, file cabinets, storage units, ergonomic items, and lighting.

   From its headquarters in Toronto, Teknion operates a US headquarters office in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, as well as a European head office in London. Across the US, Canada, the UK, India, Russia, and Malaysia, Teknion boasts sales offices, showrooms, and manufacturing and warehousing facilities. The company has extended the reach of its business in recent years to now include market share in Europe, the Middle East, India, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Rim.

   Teknion has entered several new deals to grow its business. The company opened a 22,000-sq.-ft. New York City showroom in 2013 to showcase products from its Teknion Studio, Teknion Textiles, and B&amp;B Italia Project collections.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also formed a design partnership with industrial designers Jeffrey Bernett and Nicholas Dodziuk to establish a new brand and enhance its existing products portfolio. It also inked an exclusive North American distribution, licensing, and manufacturing agreement with B&amp;B Italia for a Project Collection, as well as an agreement with textile designer Suzanne Tick. In the fall, Teknion launched a new line of desks and seating in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the firm formed Teknion Studio Group (TSG) in North Carolina. TSG develops and makes collaborative furniture, furniture suited for the open environment and shared work spaces that have become increasingly popular in offices today.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because the US market has grown increasingly price-competitive, Teknion has turned to Europe to boost its bottom line.
