   Andritz is a workhorse when it comes to machinery manufacturing. The company is a leading global supplier of customizable, high-tech plant systems and services for the hydro-power, pulp and paper, environment and process, metals, and feed and biofuel industries. It supplies electromechanical equipment for hydro power plants, as well as automation and production equipment for pulp and paper manufacturing, steel strip manufacturing, and animal feed mixing and wood pelleting. Its environment and process group supplies solid and liquid separation products for municipalities and process industries, including mining. Andritz has more than 250 production facilities primarily in Europe, North America, and Asia.

  <p>
   Although Andritz's pulp and paper group has historically been its largest business segment (35% of total sales), it is now only slightly ahead of the company's fast-growing hydro division (32%). The hydro group is entering promising new markets, such as power generation from tidal currents, and expanding its product range in pumps. In addition to pumps, the hydro division makes space technology components for the European Ariane rocket launcher program. Other segments include metals (23%) and separation (10%).

   Andritz is putting much of its investment and strategic focus on emerging markets that are showing more rapid recovery and growth. In particular, it expects longer-term opportunities to come from Asia (especially China and India) and South America. Already, it is strengthening its local market position in China through a joint venture with Chengdu Tianbao Heavy Industry to produce hydropower equipment on Chinese soil. It also began the delivery of five turbines to the Guri II power station in Venezuela, considered the largest in the world.

   Hydro power and biomass, both fast-growing renewable energy segments, are becoming increasingly important to Andritz's future. About one-fifth of the world's electricity production is generated by renewable energies, with hydro power and  biomass generating more than wind, geothermal, and solar energy. This is creating demand for new hydro power plants to be built. In response, Andritz is busy securing orders for biomass and recovery boilers that are used by pulp mills to generate green electricity from forest residues, as well as contracts to build the world's largest wood pelleting plants.
