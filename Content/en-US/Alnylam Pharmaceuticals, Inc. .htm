   Like a genetic linebacker, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals runs interference with RNA to prevent the forward progress of disease. RNA interference (RNAi) technology developed by the biotech firm can selectively shut off harmful genes. The company is developing a pipeline of candidates both individually and through collaborations with other drugmakers. Its disease targets include neurological ailments, hypercholesterolemia, and hemophilia. Alnylam has additional partner-based programs in clinical or development stages, including candidates targeting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and liver cancers.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's RNAi therapeutics includes more than 1,800 active cases and more than 700 granted or issued patents, of which more than 300 are issued or granted in the US, Europe, and Japan.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is made up of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and five wholly owned subsidiaries (Alnylam U.S., Inc., Alnylam Europe AG, Alnylam Securities Corporation, Alnylam (Bermuda) Ltd., and Alnylam UK Limited). Alnylam has R&amp;D alliances and licensing agreements with drug companies, including
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   Alnylam's lead internal development program targets the most common types of ATTR (TTR-mediated Amyloidosis), a genetic disorder that can cause severe pain, neurological damage, and heart failure. Other candidates seek to treat severe hypercholesterolemia, a major factor in coronary artery disease, as well as hemophilia and other blood conditions and genetic disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alnylam's genetic medicine programs are RNAi therapeutics directed toward genetically defined targets for the treatment of serious, life-threatening diseases with limited treatment options for patients and their caregivers. These include patisiran (ALN-TTR02), an intravenously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of ATTR in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), and ALN-TTRsc, a subcutaneously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR in patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis, including familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy and senile systemic amyloidosis.

  <p>
   Alnylam's has seen its revenues decline since 2009. Revenues decreased by 23% in 2013 due to the completion of its remaining performance obligations under the Roche/Arrowhead alliance in August 2012. This decrease was partially offset by recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the
   <company id="51620">
    Cubist
   </company>
   agreement of $9.7 million due to the termination of the Cubist agreement in February 2013 and the end of Alnylam's related performance obligations. (In 2013, Cubist notified the company that it would not exercise its opt-in right for ALN-RSV01, and terminated the license and collaboration agreement).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has experienced operating losses since its inception. In 2013 it had an accumulated deficit of $596.2 million. It has not developed any products nor generated any revenues from the sale of products. It has generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities, acquiring, filing and expanding intellectual property rights and general administrative costs. In 2013 the company saw 16% decline in net loss from $106 million in 2012 to $89 million in 2013 due to absence of restructuring of its Tekmira license agreement expense and equity in the loss from a joint venture with
   <company id="162868">
    Regulus Therapeutics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In the light of these changes Alnylam conducted a restructuring program to reduce its collaborative resources, cut expenses, and focus on its lead development candidates. The company announced a 33% workforce reduction in early 2012 (following a 25% cut a year earlier).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company saw cash outflow in last five years. However, in 2013 it saw a decline in cash outflow due to its net loss and other changes in its working capital and a decrease in deferred revenues of $6.2 million
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Alnylam's primary goal is to bring RNAi therapeutic products to market through whatever means possible. As part of this strategy, its goal is to develop product candidates with the following shared characteristics: a genetically defined target and disease expressed in the liver; the potential to have a major impact in high unmet need patient populations; the ability to leverage its existing RNAi platform with clinically proven delivery to the liver; the opportunity to monitor an early biomarker in Phase 1 clinical trials for human proof of concept; and the existence of clinically relevant endpoints for the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, with a focused patient database and possible accelerated paths for commercialization. The company's strategy is to retain development and commercial rights for its current and future genetic medicine pipeline in North America and Western Europe, while forming alliances with leading, innovative companies for the development and commercialization of these products in the ROW.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its Alnylam 5 X 15 program, the company hopes to have seven genetic medicine product candidates in clinical development, including at least two programs in Phase 3 and five products in advanced development (near commercialization) stages by 2015, with a focus on genetic disease targets in fields where patient needs have been largely unmet, such as rare hereditary diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alnylam partners with other drugmakers to help fund its research programs. In 2014 Alnylam and The Alpha-1 Project (TAP) formed a collaboration for the  advancement of ALN-AAT, an RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency-associated liver disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company entered into a global, strategic collaboration with
   <company id="13560">
    Genzyme
   </company>
   to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics as genetic medicines to treat orphan diseases principally in territories outside of North America and Western Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it formed a collaboration with
   <company id="101014">
    The Medicines Company
   </company>
   for one of its lead candidates (ALN-PCS) targeting hypercholesterolemia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company has licensed its RNAi technology out to several other companies, including
   <company id="161475">
    Tekmira
   </company>
   , Quark Biotech, and Arrowhead, that are independently using the technologies develop therapies for a variety of applications. With the case of Arrowhead, Alnylam has a joint licensing agreement in which it can use Arrowhead's delivery technology for an RNAi target in its pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   With respect to programs that are outside of its core focus on genetic medicines, for example, in the fields of metabolic and infectious disease and in oncology, it intends to seek regional or global alliances. For example, in 2012, the company formed a regional alliance with Ascletis for the development and commercialization of ALN-VSP in China and certain other territories.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Alnylam took on a new direction for its RNAi-based intellectual property and proprietary technologies by forming a 10-year strategic alliance with
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   for the development of its technology for agricultural solutions. Monsanto paid $29 million up front to gain exclusive global rights for developing the technology.

   In 2014 the company purchased Sirna Therapeutics, and its RNAi candidates and delivery systems, from
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   . It paid about $150 million in stock and $25 million in cash.
