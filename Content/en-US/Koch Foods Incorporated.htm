   Why did the chicken cross the road? To escape "America's Chicken Specialist," Koch Foods, no doubt. The vertically-integrated poultry processor makes commodity and value-added fresh and frozen chicken products, such as chicken tenderloins, tenders, strips, boneless breasts, and wings, along with diced and pulled white and dark meat, and whole and whole cut-up chickens. Koch's customers include companies in the retail food and food service sectors throughout the US, as well as overseas. The company sells its value-added poultry products under the Antioch Farms and Cravers retail brands. Koch Foods began as a one-room chicken de-boning and cutting operation in 1985. Koch Foods is owned by its CEO Joseph Grendys.

   Based in Illinois, Koch Foods has a sales office in Pearl, Mississippi and an export office in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The chicken processor has feed mills and slaughter houses across the US.

   Koch Foods has grown by acquiring other poultry processors. In May 2012, Koch affiliate JCG Foods purchased Atlanta-based Cagle Foods at a  bankruptcy auction for about $93 million. Cagle's assets included two processing plants, a feed mill, and a hatchery. The company processes about 1.7 million chickens a week.

   Illinois-based Koch Foods is having to contend with the severe drought that parched the nation's midsection in 2012, driving up corn and other commodity prices. As a result, the company in 2013 put a $45 million expansion of its plant in Fairfield, Illinois on hold indefinitely due to higher corn prices, which affected the feed stock for chickens. The company hopes to go forward with the 170,000-square-foot addition once the price of corn stabilizes.
