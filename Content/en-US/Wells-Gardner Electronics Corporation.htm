   After selling assets and losing a key contract, AG&amp;E Holdings, formerly known as Wells-Gardner Electronics, is resetting its business as a distributor of electronic parts to the casino and gaming markets. The company sells parts for video gaming machines to some 700 casinos in the US. In 2014 the company sold its LCD business and in 2015 it lost a contract with

    GTech
   </company>
   to supply video lottery terminals for the Illinois Lottery. In 2016 AG&amp;E bought Advanced Gaming Associates (AGA), which services slot machines in the US. AG&amp;E changed its name from Wells-Gardner in 2014.

  <p>
   AG&amp;E's revenue has been cut in half from 2013 to 2015. The company had sales of $13.8 million in 2015, compared to $21.9 million in 2014, and $28.2 million in 2013. Since posting a $651,000 profit in 2013, the company lost $5.5 million in 2014 and about $500,000 in 2015.

  <p>
   In less than a year in 2014-2015 AG&amp;E lost a good chunk of revenue when it sold its LCD monitor and lost the distribution agreement for video gaming terminals or video gaming terminals (VGTs) in Illinois with GTech. The company wound down the VGT business as a result. It then explored alternatives, engaging Innovation Capital in an advisory role.

  <p>
   In April 2016 AG&amp;E struck the deal for AGA to form a $17 million (in revenue) company to service the casino and gaming markets in the US. The company's lines of business are Parts Distribution, Services (including technical, maintenance, installation, and professional services), and Products, including i-depsys note counter systems, SurgeX power protection technology, and Nanoptix printers.
