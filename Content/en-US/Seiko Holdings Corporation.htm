   Seiko Holdings (formerly Seiko Corp.) is way beyond its tradition of marking time -- whether it's wristwatches, clocks, or precisionÂ timing devices for athletic events. The corporation serves as a holding company for subsidiaries, such as
   <company id="132325">
    Seiko Watch
   </company>
   , maker of watches such as the Kinetic and Thermic series that generate power by the movement of the owner's wrist or body heat. The watchmaker also makes mass-market watch brands Pulsar and Lorus. Seiko Watch's other timepieces range from small bedside alarm clocks to large-scale public clocks. Seiko Holdings other subsidiaries include Seiko Clock,

  <p>
   Kintaro Hattori started in the jewelry business at age 13. In 1881, at age 21, he set up K. Hattori &amp; Co. in Tokyo's Ginza district to import clocks. As increasing railroad traffic created a demand for accurate timepieces, Hattori started making wall clocks at his Seikosha factory in 1892. Pocket watches followed in 1895, alarm clocks in 1899, and table clocks in 1902. Hattori began exporting clocks to China and opened his first foreign branch, in Shanghai, in 1913.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hattori first used the name "Seiko" (Japanese for "precision") on a watch in 1924. The Seikosha plant started producing camera shutters six years later. Daini Seikosha, the predecessor to Seiko Instruments, was set up as an independent watch manufacturer in 1937. Production shifted during WWII from timepieces to time fuses and ammunition. In 1942 Daiwa Kogyo, which later became Seiko Epson, was established.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1953 K. Hattori had restored itself to its prewar position in the Japanese watch market, with a 55% market share. The company attacked the US market in the 1960s by initially offering jewel-lever watches in the midrange market with an average price of $50 and then expanding to the upper and lower ends of the market. This expansion was aided by K. Hattori's selection as the official timekeeper for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The company launched the world's first quartz wall clock in 1968 and the first analog quartz watch (the Seiko Astron) the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s K. Hattori expanded globally, establishing subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. The company broadened its quartz technology by offering the world's first women's quartz watch in 1972 and the first digital watch with an LCD the next year. K. Hattori introduced the first black-and-white TV watch in 1982. To promote the Seiko brand, the company changed its name to Hattori Seiko Co. the following year. In 1984 it marketed the world's first computer wristwatch and the first battery-operated LCD pocket color television.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Seiko Corporation in 1990. The next year it introduced the Seiko Perpetual Calendar, a watch capable of tracking dates for more than 1,000 years. Also in 1991 Seiko acquired American Telephone and Electronics (AT&amp;E) -- its partner in a wristwatch pager joint venture -- after AT&amp;E filed for bankruptcy, and it established a joint venture with DEC to market PCs in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The official timekeeper for the Olympics in 1992 (Barcelona, Spain) and 1994 (Lillehammer, Norway), Seiko was outbid by rival SMH (Swatch watchmaker) for the 1996 Olympics. In 1997 it secured the timekeeping position for the 2002 Utah Olympics; it also was timekeeper for the Nagano, Japan, Olympics in 1998. Also in 1998 Seiko began selling the Ruputer, a wristwatch/PC that exchanges data with a PC and stores files. In 1999 the company formed SII Marketing International with Fossil to sell the companies' lower-priced watches in Wal-Marts and other discount outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seiko spun off its watch operations as Seiko Watch in 2001 and set itself up as a holding company for its six independent companies. To combat competition from Chinese and Swiss watch companies, Seiko and rival
   <company id="60227">
    Citizen Watch
   </company>
   -- already cooperating on shipments -- began combining other operations in early 2002, including purchasing and supplying parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep its clock business ticking, Seiko in 2006 shuttered its Gifu Clock unit, part of Seiko Clock, as it reorganized its domestic clock business and consolidated production and sales for the product segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although Seiko became a pure holding company in July 2001, it took the company six years to officially change its name to Seiko Holdings Corporation; which it finally did in July 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2009 the company moved its corporate headquarters to Tokyo's affluent Ginza district.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2010 Shinji Hattori was named president of Seiko Holdings, succeeding Koichi Murano who was dismissed.
