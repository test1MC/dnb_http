   In early 2010 the company restructured its debt, leading to equity ownership by its creditors. As part of the deal, USS reduced its debt by 80% and its interest payments by 90%. Following the restructuring, fund units managed by GSO Capital Partners and

   and related entities control USS. The new owners appointed

   veteran Ron Carapezzi as CEO.

   That year the company boosted its US-leading fleet of restroom trailers to about 300 with the acquisition of 31 new trailers.

   Since its founding in 1999, USS has made acquisitions an integral part of its growth strategy. Acquiring smaller, locally-based companies in its industry gives it the geographic diversity to serve professional event planners in major metropolitan areas across the US, as well as emergency responders along the Gulf Coast, for example.
