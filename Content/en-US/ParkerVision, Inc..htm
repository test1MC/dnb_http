   Parkervision is more about sound than sight. The company develops radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) for use in wireless networking. The company has produced limited numbers of its chips through contract manufacturers, but it has not recorded a sale in recent years. If it did, the chips could be in mobile handsets, tablets, data cards, femtocells, machine-to-machine communications, embedded applications, even military radios and cable modems. ParkerVision was founded in 1989 by CEO Jeffery Parker. In 2014 it retained advisory firm 3LP Advisors to help execute a licensing strategy and get its business off the ground.

   While Parkervision spent more than $8 million for research and development in 2014, it seems to have more action for lawyers than engineers. The company has been involved with several patent infringement lawsuits. It has accused Samsung and Qualcomm, among others, of improperly using technology developed by Parkervision. The company holds 179 US patents and 8 foreign patents for its RF technologies. Another 45 patent applications are pending in the US and abroad.

   Parkervision reported no revenue in 2014. For the last decade its total revenue has been a bit more than $2.5 million and that includes 2005 when it posted $1 million in revenue. The company reported a loss of $23.57 million in 2014, which was lower than the $27.87 million it lost in 2013. The company had lower operating costs and higher interest income in 2014.

   Parkervision freshened its line of RFICs in 2014 with the introduction of its PVOA20x series of operational amplifiers. The first product, the PVOA201, is a 165 MHz ultra-low power, low noise, fully-differential operational amplifier. It can be used for wireless sensors, low-power data-acquisition systems, and other devices, particularly those deployed in the Internet of Things market.

   In order to press its infringement cases, the company entered into a funding agreement with 1624 PV, an affiliate of 1624 LLC, a litigation investment firm. The investment firm agreed to pay as much as $7 million for legal fees and expenses for specified future patent infringement litigation. Parkervision is to payback and further compensate 1624 from the proceeds resulting from litigation.
