  <p>
   As part of its strategy to exit its Advanced Materials business to focus on its core assets, in 2013 OM Group sold the downstream portion of the business, including its cobalt refinery assets in Kokkola, Finland, for $435 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made another tactical acquisition with the 2011 purchase of VAC Holding of Germany (Vacuumschelze), a manufacturer of advanced materials and specialty magnetics, for about $996 million. VAC is a global leader in several segments, including chemicals and metal-based materials; the deal gave OM Group a significant boost in the alternative energy market.
