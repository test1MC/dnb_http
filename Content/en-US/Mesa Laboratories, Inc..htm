   Mesa Laboratories measures its progress by the sales of its measurement devices. And so far it hasn't plateaued. The company makes niche-market electronic measurement, testing, and recording instruments for medical, food processing, electronics, and aerospace applications. Mesa's products include sensors that record temperature, humidity, and pressure levels; flow meters for water treatment, polymerization, and chemical processing applications; and sonic concentration analyzers. The company also makes kidney dialysis treatment products, including metering equipment and machines that clean dialyzers (or filters) for reuse. It also provides repair, recalibration, and certification services.

  <p>
   The company is organized into four segments - instruments, 42% of revenue; biological indicators, 40% of revenue; continuous monitoring, 13% of revenue, and cold chain, 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The instruments division includes the DataTrace (data loggers), Bios, Torqo (bottle cap test systems), DialyGuard, DryCal, SureTorque, BGI, and Nusonics (ultrasonic fluid measurement systems) brands. Biological indicators, sold under the Mesa, PCD, and Apex brands, are used by dental offices, hospitals and manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceuticals for quality control testing in sterilization processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuous monitoring, created in 2013 through acquisitions, provides temperature control to laboratories that require stable environments, such as hospitals, blood banks, pharmacies, and medical device manufacturers. Brands include CheckPoint and AmegaView. The cold chain segment is Mesa's newest, also formed through acquisitions. It provides parameter (primarily temperature) monitoring of products, consulting services such as compliance monitoring, packaging development and validation or mapping of transport and storage containers, and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials and phase-change products to control temperature during transport.

  <p>
   Mesa Laboratories has manufacturing plants in Lakewood, Colorado; Butler, New Jersey; Bozeman, Montana; and Omaha, Nebraska. The new continuous monitoring division operates from Marlton, New Jersey; and Emeryville, California. The company's sales are split about two-thirds and one-third between the US and international markets.

  <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force as well as distributors in the US. Overseas, the company relies on about 270 distributors to gets its products to customers.

  <p>
   Overall sales grew 19% in 2016 (ended March) to $84 million. Revenue from biological indicators jumped 23% with the help of a series of acquisitions and 2% rise in organic growth from new customers, new markets, and price increases. Instruments revenue rose 8% as a 55% increase in service revenue more than balanced a 3% drop in product sales. The BGI acquisition also aided revenue growth. Continuous monitoring revenue was off 1%. The cold chain segment reported $4.5 million revenue in its first year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mesa posted a 17% increase in profit to just more than $11 million in 2016 compared to the year before. Expenses were about a $1 million higher in 2016 than 2015. The company also paid about $1.7 million in a legal settlement, but benefited by $860,000 by adopting a different standard for stock compensation. Cash flow from operations increased to $17 million in 2016 from about $11 million in 2015. The company had gains in depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and accrued liabilities and payments.

  <p>
   Mesa's strategy is to provide products that serve niche markets and carry high margins. The lure of niche markets is that they are too small for big competitors, leaving the field for Mesa to exploit. The company accomplishes some of it goals through develop its own products -- organic growth is a healthy 6% a year. But it revs up its growth rate through acquisitions that complement and add to its portfolio. The company is building a product range that serves the supply chain in certain medical testing and control markets.

  <p>
   Mesa has stepped up its pace of acquisitions to build its offerings. In fiscal 2016 (ended March), the company made 10 deals and added several others in the 2016 calendar year. Deals made the year before totaled six.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company jumped in to the cold chain business with its July 2015 acquisition of Infitrak Inc., a provider of monitoring instruments, packaging products, and consulting services to the cold chain markets in Canada and the US. Mesa followed up with the purchase of another cold chain business, FreshLoc Technologies Inc., in November 2015. The new business segment added about $4.5 million to Mesa's sales -- 5% of the total -- in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other acquisitions focused on Mesa's dental business and included a deal for North Bay Bioscience. North Bay provides sterilizer testing services for dental offices in Canada. The acquisition marks Mesa's entry into mail-in testing services. Mesa built on that with the  purchase of mail-in rights from Mydent International Corp. Mydent's mail-in business involves the testing of small table-top sterilizers in the US.
