   What fashion statement have the Pope and Madonna made? Both have worn Dr. Martens (aka Doc Martens, Docs, or DMs), the chunky, thick-soled shoes and boots made by Dr Martens Airwair (formerly R. Griggs) and sold in specialty stores and major retailers. The style has grown beyond the classic, black, lace-up boot to include more than 1,000 variations of boots, shoes, and sandals for adults and children. Dr Martens Airwair, one of the UK's biggest shoemakers, returned to its work-boot roots when sales dwindled, but it's back to getting its feet wet elsewhere again.

   The Dalai Lama, punk rockers, and workers who spend a lot of time on their feet all made the shoes manufactured by Dr Martens Airwair part of their wardrobe in the eighties and nineties. But changing tastes have walked all over the old boot maker. The company tried new styles, introducing casual shoes and even sandals, but got left out of the closet by the hip hop clubbing generation. In response the company began to focus on work boots again and moved production out of the UK to Asia.

  <p>
   Founded a century ago, the company has been making Docs since 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 R. Griggs was bought out in a $484.9 million private equity deal by
   <company id="134986">
    Permira Funds
   </company>
   and renamed Dr Martens Airwair.

  <p>
   Klaus Maertens, a German doctor, had a skiing accident in 1945. Needing a comfortable shoe while recuperating, he and his friend Dr. Herbert Funck used tires to create a pair of soles, then heat-sealed uppers to the soles, trapping a cushion of air inside. The design was patented in 1947, and soon "Dr. Maertens" shoes were sold throughout Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boot and shoemaker R. Griggs, founded in 1901, acquired the UK rights in 1960 to manufacture the shoes; the name was anglicized to Dr. Martens. Griggs' first model, an eight-eyelet boot still popular today, rolled off the assembly line on April 1, 1960, and was therefore dubbed the 1460. British teens seized on Doc Martens as anti-fashion footwear, and during the 1970s the brand became de rigueur with the punk rock crowd.
  </p>
  <p>
   R. Griggs' Doc Martens were first made by local shoemakers, but after Griggs' son Max took over the family firm in 1980, he bought out the various manufacturers. The line expanded from a limited range of colors and styles to more than 65,000 variations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company announced in 1996 that it had received an order for a hundred pairs of Docs for the Vatican staff -- along with a letter from the Pope praising the shoe's comfort. (R. Griggs offered to waive the bill.) That year the company purchased distributor AirWair USA, and in 1997 it started a Dr. Martens record label. By 1998 R. Griggs was making more than nine million pairs of Docs per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 R. Griggs sued former distributor Skechers U.S.A., claiming Skechers was producing knockoffs of its shoes; Skechers countersued, accusing R. Griggs of falsely advertising that it made all of its shoes in the UK. The two reached a secret, out-of-court settlement the following year. To freshen its brand in 2000, R. Griggs unveiled its "vegetarian" models -- three-eyelet shoes and eight-eyelet boots made from synthetic leather. Falling sales that year prompted the company to announce it would close six of its 10 UK factories, cutting employment by about 14%.
  </p>
  <p>
   When chairman Max Griggs announced his retirement in November 2001, the company appointed Clifford Morton chairman and Stephen Griggs, Max's son, vice chairman. (Max Griggs kept an executive role at the company.) In September 2002 the company named David Suddens group managing director. When 2002 brought continued declining sales, Suddens announced more job cuts, the decision to move all production from its UK plants to China, and new line of boots for 2004 aimed at workers in everything from construction to offices.
