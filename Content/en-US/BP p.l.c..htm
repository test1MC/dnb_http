   BP is also BO (Big Oil). It is the world's #3 publicly traded integrated oil concern, behind
   <company id="50019">
    Royal Dutch Shell
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10537">
    Exxon Mobil
   </company>
   . BP explores for oil and gas in 28 countries and has proved reserves of 17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company is the largest oil and gas producer in the US and a top refiner, with 15 plants processing more than 3.2 million barrels of crude oil per day; it is also a major producer of petrochemicals. The company supplies fuel and related convenience services to consumers at some 17,200 BP-branded retail sites worldwide, and markets its products in more than 50 countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in 80 countries, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, but it also manufactures and markets products in Australasia, Africa, and Central and South America. BP's upstream activities in North America takes place in four main areas: deep-water Gulf of Mexico, Lower 48 states, Alaska and Canada.
  </p>

  <p>
   BP's downstream segment includes fuels, lubricants and Petrochemicals. The Upstream segment operates oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production, and midstream transportation, storage and processing. BP also markets and trade natural gas, including liquefied natural gas, power, and natural gas liquids.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company supplies fuel and related retail services to consumers through company-owned and franchised retail sites, as well as other channels, including dealer wholesalers and jobbers. BP also supplies commercial customers in the transport and industrial sectors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 BP's net revenues decreased by 7% due to lower liquids realizations, partially offset by higher production in higher-margin areas, higher gas realizations, and higher gas marketing and trading revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income decreased by 84% in 2014 due to lower net revenues, higher impairment charges, and losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets stemming from adjustments to prior year disposals in Canada and  the North Sea and costs associated with the decision to cease refining operations at Bulwer Island in Australia. Other factors included the write-off of expenses related to unsuccessful drilling activities or lease expiration.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company's cash inflow increased by 55% due to changes in working capital as a result of a decline in inventories, a drop in other current and non-current assets, and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities.

  <p>
   The company took a major hit in 2010 when one of its Gulf of Mexico oil rigs exploded and killed 11 workers. Millions of gallons of crude spilled into the Gulf and BP was forced to set aside $20 billion to pay for related damages in 2011 and 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The spill developed into a major political, economic, and public relations crisis for the company as it struggled to cap the leaking well, clean up the massive spill, and mollify Gulf Coast communities, which saw their fishing industry decimated and their coastlines inundated by oil. To address the growing crisis, in 2010 the company established an escrow account of $20 billion, managed by a third party, to reimburse claims from people and businesses financially damaged by the oil spill. (It settled with individual and business plaintiffs for $7.8 billion in 2012, but still faced federal, state, and local government charges). In a plea deal with the US government, in 2012 BP pled guilty to criminal misconduct (12 felony counts) and in 2013 agreed to pay $4.5 billion in damages.
  </p>
  <p>
   A federal court found BP grossly negligent in 2014 for its role in the 2010 spill. In 2015 BP agreed to pay a record $20.8 billion in damages to the US government and five Gulf Coast states that resolved years of litigation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continues to jettison non-core assets to raise cash. In 2015 BP announced plans to sell its oil storage terminal in Amsterdam. It also agreed to sell its equity in the Central Area Transmission System business in the UK North Sea to Antin Infrastructure Partners for Â£324 million ($545 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   After the costly Gulf spill, BP embarked on a "shrink to grow" strategy of selling older oilfields around the world to generate cash for settlements and simplify its upstream operations. All told, the company has sold about $37 billion in assets. Completed divestitures include one of the largest transactions in the Gulf of Mexico -- BP's sale of a number of oil and gas fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico region to
   <company id="106157">
    Plains Exploration &amp; Production
   </company>
   for $5.55 billion in 2012. That year it also sold assets in Canada, Egypt, and the Permian Basin in the US to fellow explorer
   <company id="10120">
    Apache
   </company>
   for about $7 billion. The deal included BP receiving a $5 billion cash advance. (In 2011 BP sold its Colombian assets to
   <company id="54836">
    Talisman Energy
   </company>
   and
   <company id="95023">
    Ecopetrol
   </company>
   for $1.9 billion and properties in Venezuela and Vietnam to its Russian joint venture
   <company id="122955">
    TNK-BP
   </company>
   for $1.8 billion.)
  </p>
  <p>
   TNK-BP was BP's longtime drilling venture with several Russian partners. After years of feuding with those partners, in 2013 BP sold that business to Russian state oil company
   <company id="55399">
    Rosneft
   </company>
   as part of a complex package of deals worth a whopping $55 billion. The transaction gave BP a nearly 20% stake in Rosneft and about $12.3 billion in cash, allowing it to pursue offshore drilling opportunities in the Arctic Ocean and settle billions of dollars in US Gulf spill penalties. Several BP competitors, Exxon Mobil, Italy's
   <company id="40875">
    Eni
   </company>
   , and Norway's
   <company id="91067">
    Statoil
   </company>
   , already have Russian Arctic drilling deals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company agreed to sell interests in four BP-operated oilfields on the North Slope of Alaska to
   <company id="159746">
    Hilcorp
   </company>
   and its specialist global Aviation Turbine Oils business to
   <company id="16569">
    Eastman Chemical Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   On the growth side, in 2015 BP signed a deal to sell to China Huadian Corporation up to 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year worth up to $10 billion over the next 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 BP agreed to acquire stakes in exploration blocks in Mauritania and Senegal from
   <company id="162036">
    Kosmos Energy
   </company>
   for $916 million.

  <p>
   As part of its strategy to be a leading purified terephthalic acid (PTA) regional player, in 2014 BP acquired PT Amoco Mitsui PTA Indonesia (AMI). The deal allows the company to assess future opportunities to lower the cost of the production facilities by upgrading to the latest technology as well as opportunities for expansion in the Indonesian market.

   The company, which was formed in 1998 from the merger of
   <company id="41759">
    British Petroleum
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10108">
    Amoco
   </company>
   , grew by buying
   <company id="10142">
    Atlantic Richfield Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   BP (formerly BP Amoco) was born on two sides of the Atlantic. In the US,
   <company id="10108">
    Amoco
   </company>
   emerged from Standard Oil Trust, organized by John D. Rockefeller in 1882. In 1886 he bought Lima (Ohio) oil, a high-sulfur crude, anticipating the discovery of a sulfur-removing process. Such a process was, indeed, patented in 1887, and in 1889 Standard organized Standard Oil of Indiana, which later established such innovations as company-owned service stations and a research lab at the refinery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overseas,
   <company id="41759">
    British Petroleum
   </company>
   (BP) was a twinkle in the eye of English adventurer William D'Arcy, who began oil exploration of Persia in 1901. In 1908, bankrolled by Burmah Oil, D'Arcy's firm was the first to strike oil in the Middle East. D'Arcy and Burmah Oil formed Anglo-Persian Oil in 1909, and the British government took a 51% stake in 1914.
  </p>
  <p>
   Back in the US, Standard was broken up into 34 independent oil companies in 1911. Standard Oil of Indiana kept its oil refining and US marketing operations. In 1925 it added a few Mexican and Venezuelan firms, including Pan American Petroleum and Transport, which held half of American Oil Co., known for Amoco antiknock gasoline. It began Amoco Chemicals in 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anglo-Persian took the BP name in 1954 and bought its own Standard Oil: After making a strike in Alaska in 1969, BP swapped Alaskan reserves for a 25% interest (later upped to 55%) in Standard Oil of Ohio (SOHIO). BP also struck North Sea oil in 1970. But falling oil and copper prices in the mid-1980s and a dry hole in the Beaufort Sea hurt earnings. Under Robert Horton, SOHIO sold off units. BP also bought livestock feed producer Purina Mills (1986, sold 1998) and the rest of SOHIO (1987).
  </p>
  <p>
   Standard Oil of Indiana had its own problems, including being kicked out of Iran after the Islamic revolution and causing a major oil spill off the French coast in 1978. The firm, which became Amoco in 1985, bought Canada's Dome Petroleum in 1988, making it the largest private owner of North American gas reserves, but the big purchase proved hard to swallow.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Amoco hurled itself into overseas oil exploration. It was the first foreign oil company to explore the Chinese mainland. But by 1995 production was down. That year John Browne, often compared to Rockefeller, became BP's CEO. In 1996 BP and Mobil merged their European fuel and lubricants operations, and the British government sold its remaining stake in BP.
  </p>
  <p>
   As oil prices tumbled in 1998, BP merged with Amoco in a $52 billion deal that formed BP Amoco. The new oil major agreed the following year to buy US-based
   <company id="10142">
    Atlantic Richfield
   </company>
   (ARCO) in a deal that closed in 2000. BP Amoco sold ARCO's Alaskan properties to Phillips (later ConocoPhillips) for $7 billion to gain regulatory approval for the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its stake in Siberian oil fields was nearly taken away in a controversial 1999 bankruptcy sale before BP Amoco and Russia's Tyumen Oil agreed to cooperate. In 2000 BP Amoco and Shell Oil sold their stakes in Altura Energy to Occidental Petroleum for $3.6 billion. Also that year BP Amoco bought motor-oil maker
   <company id="43711">
    Burmah Castrol
   </company>
   for $4.7 billion. It paid $1.5 billion for the 18% of former ARCO exploration and production unit
   <company id="20142">
    Vastar Resources
   </company>
   that it didn't already own.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company adopted BP as its main worldwide brand in 2000, and it officially shortened its name the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 BP agreed to swap control of its stake in German natural gas supplier
   <company id="92654">
    Ruhrgas
   </company>
   , plus $1.6 billion in cash and $950 million in assumed debt, to German utility giant
   <company id="43005">
    E.ON
   </company>
   for a majority interest in
   <company id="93300">
    Veba Oel
   </company>
   , owner of Germany's largest gas station chain. Regulators moved to keep E.ON from acquiring the Ruhrgas stake, but BP agreed to make up the difference in cash if necessary, and the deal proceeded. The agreement allowed BP to take full ownership of Veba Oel in 2002. To recoup some of its investment, BP (with E.ON's consent) sold Veba Oel's exploration and production operations to
   <company id="54033">
    Petro-Canada
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That year BP increased it stake in Russian oil and gas producer
   <company id="55401">
    Sidanco
   </company>
   from 10% to 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 BP sold its Boqueron field and Desarrollo Zulia Occidental assets, both located in Venezuela, to Europe's Perenco. In late 2005 BP sold its petrochemical unit,
   <company id="138138">
    Innovene
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="104943">
    INEOS
   </company>
   for a reported $9 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   An explosion and fire in 2005 at BP's Texas City refinery killed 15 workers and injured many more.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its remaining producing properties on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to
   <company id="10120">
    Apache Corporation
   </company>
   for $845 million. That year BP sold its 28% stake in the Shenzi field in the Gulf of Mexico to
   <company id="41831">
    Repsol
   </company>
   for $2.2 billion. It also acquired a $1 billion stake in
   <company id="55399">
    Rosneft
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the discovery of corrosion in a major oil pipeline forced BP to close down part of its Prudhoe Bay oilfield (which represents 8% of daily US crude production) for several weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also announced plans to invest $3 billion to reconfigure its Whiting Refinery in Indiana to process Canadian heavy crude oil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company sold its Coryton refinery in the UK to
   <company id="119966">
    Petroplus Holdings
   </company>
   for $1.4 billion. That year BP acquired
   <company id="103877">
    Chevron
   </company>
   's 31% stake in a Netherlands-based refinery and other assets for $900 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   BP's long-term chief executive John Browne was forced to step down in 2007 over a personal scandal and was replaced by BP veteran Tony Hayward. That year the company announced a major restructuring with a focus on core divisions Exploration &amp; Production and Refining &amp; Marketing, and a new Alternative Energy unit dedicated to solar power, wind energy, and carbon capture technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 BP agreed to pay US authorities $373.5 million in fines relating to the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion, the 2006 Alaska oil spill, and a propane price-fixing scandal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company signed a deal with
   <company id="54895">
    Enbridge
   </company>
   to pipe oil sands crude from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast. Enbridge and BP will spend up to $2 billion to expand existing pipelines and build new connections to deliver up to 250,000 barrels a day to Gulf Coast refiners by 2012. In another oil sands move, BP and
   <company id="56221">
    Husky Energy
   </company>
   teamed up that same year to create an integrated North American oil sands business through two joint ventures, BP-Husky Refinery LLC, operated by BP, and the Sunrise Oil Sands Partnership (SOSP), operated by Husky. BP committed $2.8 billion to create SOSP.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 BP acquired 90,000 net acres of natural gas assets in the Arkoma Basin Woodford Shale play in the US from
   <company id="12049">
    Chesapeake Energy
   </company>
   for $1.75 billion. It subsequently bought a 25% stake in that company's Fayetteville Shale assets in Arkansas for $1.9 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its North Sea assets, in 2010 the company agreed to buy two oil fields in the Norwegian sector from
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   for $991 million. That year BP acquired
   <company id="11878">
    Devon Energy
   </company>
   's international assets for $7 billion in a deal that, among other things, gave BP a foothold in the emerging major oil play off the coast of Brazil. The company also gained properties in Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico. (In 2010 it agreed to sell four of these mature deepwater oil and gas fields in Gulf of Mexico to
   <company id="41770">
    Marubeni
   </company>
   Oil and Gas for $650 million in order to pay down debt).
  </p>
  <p>
   The global recession and the slump in demand for oil and gas products saw BP's revenues (along with those of its industry peers) plummet in 2009. Improved market conditions in 2010 lifted revenues. However, the company reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2010 as a result of the Gulf oil spill and its aftermath, the cost of which was pegged at almost $41 billion.
