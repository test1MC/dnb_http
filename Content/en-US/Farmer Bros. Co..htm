   Farmer Bros. may know beans about farming, but just ask the firm about coffee beans. Farmer Bros. roasts and packages coffee, and sells it mainly to institutional foodservice operators, such as restaurants, fast-food outlets, hotels, and hospitals. It also distributes related coffee products, such as filters, sugar and creamers, as well as assorted teas and culinary products (spices, soup, and gelatins). As part of its business, it provides private brand coffee programs nationwide to retail customers, such as convenience and grocery stores. Founded in 1912, Farmer Bros. distributes more than 3,500 stock keeping units (SKUs) from more than 115 branch warehouses located in or near major US cities in five states.

   California-based Farmer Bros. boasts production facilities and distribution centers in California, Oregon, and Texas that grind, roast, and package coffee beans. These locations also focus on product development. Its additional distribution centers are located in Illinois, Oklahoma, and New Jersey.

   With a handle on coffee beans, Farmer Bros. in 2013 debuted a new line of premium teas in 2013. The company in 2014 launched a line of ready-to-drink iced coffees -- a fast-growing category -- that were developed especially for the foodservice niche.

   Farmer Bros. continues to log revenue increases. In fiscal 2014 (ended June) the company posted about $529 million in sales vs. 2013's $514 million, driven by an 8% increase in unit sales. Roast and ground coffees, which accounted for some 60% of total sales, contributed to the 2014 gains with a double-digit (12%) bump. After having suffered an $8.5 million loss in 2013, Farmer Bros. reported a net income profit of more than $12 million, thanks to a combination of higher sales and lower operating expenses.
