   Northwest Biotherapeutics is a development-stage drug company. Its DCVax vaccine platform uses dendritic cells (a type of white blood cell) obtained from a patient's blood to program that patient's own T cells to kill cancer cells. Northwest Biotherapeutics' two DCVax product candidates are being targeted to treat brain and prostate cancer. Both candidates are in late-stage clinical trials. If successful, the therapies could work in conjunction with more traditional cancer treatments. Toucan Capital holds over 85% of the company's shares. Toucan's Cognate Therapeutics subsidiary manufactures the DCVax products and provides additional services to Northwest Biotherapeutics.

   Northwest's lead candidate is DCVax-L, which is in trials for Gliobastome multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain cancer. Another candidate, DCVax-Direct, is in studies for all types of inoperable solid tumors.

  <p>
   Net sales have been rising for the past five years. In 2015, net sales increased 20% to $1.7 million. However, the company has been losing money every year. Its net loss in 2015 totaled $114.7 million, a $20.8 million decrease from the previous year's loss. The losses have been driven by growing R&amp;D expenses, but in 2015 those were partially offset by the absence of inducement expenses related to financing from an institutional investor. Additionally, the company saw an increase in conversion of accounts payable with common stocks and warrants to Cognate BioServices for R&amp;D service agreements.

  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased $24 million in 2015 to $78.6 million.

   In 2014, Northwest Biotherapeutics acquired a UK facility for Â£13 million.
