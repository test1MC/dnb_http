   No, Badger Meter does not measure the frequency of the appearance of a certain nocturnal carnivorous mammal. Instead, it provides water utilities and industrial customers with instruments that measure and control the flow of liquids. Badger is a major manufacturer of water meters, and automatic meter reading (AMR) and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) products, which are mainly sold to municipalities. Its flow instrumentation business is made up of metering technologies for markets including concrete, HVAC, water and wastewater, chemicals, and food and beverage. Established in 1905 Badger also makes handheld devices that dispense and monitor oil and other fluids for the automotive market.

  <p>
   The company manufactures its products at facilities located around the globe, including four in the US (Arizona, Oklahoma and two in Wisconsin). It also operates international facilities in the China, Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Singapore and Switzerland. The US accounts for 85% of its total sales.

  <p>
   Badger's product lines fall into two categories: sales of water meters and related technologies to municipal water utilities and sales of meters to various industries for water and other fluids and gases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both the company's ORION AMR and GALAXY AMI products take advantage of leading communications networks in the market, and can interface with other meter reading systems that transmit a signal, such as mobile, power-line carrier, fixed base or Wi-Fi applications. The company has also developed cost-savings products like its residential meter encasement that uses less copper.

  <p>
   Badger has achieved unprecedented growth over the last three years. Revenues jumped 4% from $365 million in 2014 to peak at $378 million in 2015, a historic milestone. The growth for 2015 was driven by a surge in municipal water sales due to higher demand for residential and commercial meters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Badger's profits, however, have fluctuated wildly the last several years. After increasing in 2015, profits fell 13% to $26 million in 2015 due to expenses related to making acquisitions.

  <p>
   In addition to its organic growth, the company is expanding its products portfolio and international reach through small, strategic acquisitions. In 2015 Badger expanded its geographical presence in the eastern US with acquisition of United Utilities, a distributor of Badger Meter products for the municipal water utility market, serving customers in Georgia and Tennessee, for $3.3 million.
