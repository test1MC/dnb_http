   FEI makes instruments to find very small defects. The company makes structural process management systems that use ion beams to analyze and diagnose submicron structures in integrated circuits (ICs), data storage components, and biological and industrial compounds. FEI makes focused ion beam and dual beam electron microscopes that analyze ICs. It also makes scanning and transmission electron microscopes that detect defects in ICs and analyze biological specimens and materials. FEI targets applications in nanotechnology R&amp;D, but still gets significant sales from the semiconductor and data storage markets. In 2016 the company was sold to
   <company id="11473">
    Thermo Fisher Scientific
   </company>
   for $4.2 billion.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   FEI joined Thermo Fisher Scientific's analytical instruments segment in late 2016. FEI's high-end electron microscopes complement Thermo Fisher's mass spectrometry equipment and help it move deeper into drug research.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products include transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), focused ion beam system (FIBs), DualBeam systems that combine a SEM and a FIB, and high-performance optical microscopes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales from FEI's science group accounted for 52% of revenue in 2015 while the industry group accounted for the other 48%. In terms of products and service, about three-quarters of revenue comes from product sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to sales and service offices located in some 50 countries, FEI has R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities in the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, and the US (in Oregon, where it has its headquarters).
  </p>
  <p>
   FEI is not overweighted in sales to one geographic area. The Asia/Pacific region (as well as some countries outside the area) account for 41% of sales, with the US and Canada generating 32% and Europe, 27%.

  <p>
   FEI sells its products through independent agents and distributors. Its sales cycle typically ranges from three months to a year and a half.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company serves a range of industries including semiconductor and related industries, metals, automobiles, aerospace, geosciences, and forensics.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Sales dropped 3% in 2015 to $930 million. The company blamed the dip on the strength of the US dollar in relation to other currencies, particularly the euro and the Czech koruna. The only product or geographic segment to not post a loss in 2015 was service, which had a 5% sales bump.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit, however, rose 18% to $124 million in 2015. FEI reported gains related to restructuring and other cost-cutting made in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased to $204 million in 2015 from $143 million in 2014.

  <p>
   FEI introduced new products in 2015 and 2016. They included the HeliScan, microCT, Helios, PFIB EFI, and Helios G4 DualBeam HX/EX instruments. In 2016 the company launched Apreo, a range of applications for scanning electron microscopes which collect data for researchers.

  <p>
   FEI acquired DCG Systems, supplier of electrical fault characterization, localization, and editing equipment, for $160 million in 2015. The acquisition adds optical imaging, thermal imaging, and nano-probing technologies to its semiconductor capabilities. It was FEI's biggest deal since the 1997 merger with Philips Electron.
