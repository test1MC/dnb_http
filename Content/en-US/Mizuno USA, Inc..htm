  <p>
   While parent Mizuno Corporation does not report separate financials for Mizuno USA, the company reported that sales revenues in the Americas rose some 33% in fiscal 2013 versus 2012 on a local currency basis. Increases were led by expanded running shoes sales channels within specialty stores and major sports retailers. Steady performance of baseball products and gains by its golf products business due to continued promotion of custom-fitted clubs also contributed to year-over-year growth. Mizuno USA generated about 17% of its parent's total revenue in fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company announced it will relocate all of its distribution facilities and manufacturing operations to a 520,00-square-foot facility in Braselton, Georgia by 2015 to support expected growth. To support growth in the Americas, Mizuno has expanded its Portland Design Center to assume responsibility for global performance running footwear. Mizuno also reorganized in 2013 by combining its Diamond Sports, Volleyball, and Golf divisions under unified leadership.

  <p>
   Mizuno USA sells its products online and through retail stores, serving several markets, such as softball (both fast pitch and slow pitch), baseball, running, golf, volleyball, and soccer. The company's partnership with Olympian Jeff Galloway to head up nationwide workshops has already begun to help the company achieve its goal of building its specialty running shoes business by 2% to 3% annually.

   Overall, the company concentrates on developing products that are both unique and enhance athlete performance. In 2013 Mizuno USA debuted the first Mizuno Beach Volleyball apparel line and signed on three new volleyball professionals to promote its products.
