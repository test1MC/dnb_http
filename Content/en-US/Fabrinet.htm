   Fabrinet makes optical, electrical, and electro-mechanic components and assemblies on a contract basis. Its optical components include switches, transponders and transceivers, and cables. Other products include industrial lasers and sensors. Fabrinet's engineering team also provides design, testing, and regulatory support while other groups offer packaging, including hermetic sealing, and laser welding. It has plants in Thailand, China, and the US serving OEMs in the optical communications, medical, and automotive markets. The company was formed in 2000 through the purchase of a

   </company>
   plant in Thailand; it went public in 2009.

  <p>
   Optical products are big for Fabrinet, accounting for 72% of its revenue. The other 28% comes from its work for lasers, sensors, and other technologies.

  <p>
   Although most of its manufacturing operations are in Thailand, just under 50% of Fabrinet's revenue comes from customers based in the US. Customers in the Asia-Pacific region aren't far behind, accounting for 40% of the company's revenue. European-based customers round out the revenue generation. Sales in 2015 (ended June) increased in the US and Asia-Pacific, but fell in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some 1 million square feet of Fabrinet's 1.4 million total manufacturing operations are in Thailand. The rest is split between China and the US.

   and

  <p>
   Fabrinet posted its third straight year of revenue increases in 2015 (ended June) with revenue rising 14% to $773.6 million from 2014. The company attributed the increase to rising demand for communications equipment, optical and not, from its customers. The company's profit dropped 52% to $43.6 million in 2015. Expenses that cut into profit include higher selling, general, and administrative costs and costs associated with cutting 100 jobs. Cash flow from operations fell to $52.6 million in 2015 from $66.5 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Fabrinet is in a good position to benefit from the growing demand for more bandwidth. Optical communications technologies offer the best performance in delivering faster and more accommodating transmission and Fabrinet manufactures optical components for its customers. The company's business in providing sensors for automotive applications is another area experiencing fast growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fabrinet is building more manufacturing space in Thailand and in California to handle increasing demand. It hopes to use its manufacturing processes to branch out into other types of products as well as to expand geographically.
