   Eileen Fisher -- the woman and the company -- has an eye for clothing that's fashionable and comfortable. The company makes and sells upscale women's business and casual clothing (tops, jackets, pants, skirts, and dresses) made mostly from organic and natural fabrics. Fisher's unfussy, forgivingly tailored, block color, lineup is sold through nearly 60 of its namesake stores in about 15 states, Canada, and the UK, as well as through upscale department and specialty stores (including

   ,
   <company id="40406">
    Saks Fifth Avenue
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11064">
    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   ) nationwide. It also offers personal shopping services for US customers. After working in the fields of graphic arts and interior design, Eileen Fisher founded the company in 1984.

   Despite the soft retail market for women's apparel, the company has been expanding its store base by opening new shops in Tennessee and Maryland. It also extended its reach into the UK following the line's debut in
   <company id="42468">
    Fenwick
   </company>
   department stores in 2011. Eileen Fisher continues, as well, to test trends and new designs at a "lab store" in Irvington, New York.

   In addition to expanding its geographic presence, the upscale fashion retailer is looking to grow by courting a clientele with an eco-friendly conscious. In 2012 the designer began asking customers to donate gently worn Eileen Fisher garments that the company cleans and resells at Green Eileen, a new specialty shop that both helps consumers reduce their environmental impact and supports nonprofit organizations with programs for women and girls.

   Eileen Fisher is also building its customer base through new designs and new product categories. (The over-50 set has long been the company's mainstay.) New looks include plus-size collections, as well as leggings, jeans, and clingy tops that are designed to appeal to daughters, as well as their mothers. Concurrently, Eileen Fisher designs a Home Collection that includes bedding, bath towels, rugs, and sleepware available in several of its boutiques, as well as from catalog retailers, including Garnet Hill (part of

   ).
