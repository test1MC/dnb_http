   Under the Equip Outdoor Technologies umbrella, Lowe Alpine relocated its headquarters to be housed at the outdoor company's Kendal-based pack division. It is working to expand the Lowe Alpine clothing line, which is being developed and managed separate to that of the Rab brand. Equip Outdoor Technologies is hoping to breathe new life into Lowe Alpine's apparel offerings to support Equip Outdoor Technologies' strategy to become Europe's top supplier of specialist outdoor clothing and equipment.

  <p>
   Founded in Colorado by climber Greg Lowe in 1967, Lowe Alpine was owned by Italian investors as a unit of Aspen Ltd. until mid-2011. Lowe Alpine was acquired by Equip Outdoor Technologies, a private British company that sells products under the Rab, Podsacs, and Outdoor Designs brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Executives at Equip Outdoor Technologies were particularly eager to snap up Lowe Alpine when it was announced that under Aspen's ownership Lowe Alpine intended to change its development strategy for 2011. As part of the shift, Lowe Alpine would cease production of its outdoor apparel collection to focus entirely on the company's packs and accessories business.
