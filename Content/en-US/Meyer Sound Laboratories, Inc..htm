   Berkeley, California's Meyer Sound Laboratories isn't for the faint of hearing -- or maybe it is. The company has built a business manufacturing high-quality digital loudspeaker systems for venues of all sizes. Its products have been used in cinemas, sports venues, hotels, museums, recording studios, cruise ships, corporations, theaters, restaurants, retail outlets, and theme parks, among other settings. Proportionate to company size, Meyer Sound Laboratories employs one of the largest engineering staffs in the audio industry. It has sales forces across the US and abroad. President and CEO John Meyer and executive VP Helen Meyer established the company in 1979.
