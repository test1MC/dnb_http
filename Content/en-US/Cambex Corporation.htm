   Cambex has a long memory when it comes to data storage. The company provides Fibre Channel host bus adapters, hubs, and software for storage area networks (SANs). In addition to its own products for SANs, the company offers third-party products such as disk arrays and tape drives. It also sells memory modules for

   Joseph Kruy fled Hungary during the 1956 uprising. In 1968 he founded Cambridge Memories (which became Cambex in 1980). The firm carved its market niche by buying memory units from clients' IBM mainframes, replacing those with Cambex memories, then reselling the IBM units at cost. It enjoyed spectacular success during the early 1970s, but a foray into leasing its memory products and investing in its own computer chip plant almost caused bankruptcy.

   In the 1980s Cambex returned to selling IBM memory products and sales increased toward the end of the decade. In 1991

   named Cambex the best US small company. Cambex bought the IBM mainframe memory operations of rival EMC in 1992, becoming the principal independent supplier of Big Blue big iron memory upgrades. But that year the firm suffered losses as fewer companies bought mainframes, opting instead for smaller, less expensive server systems. Cambex focused on product development to meet demand. In 1994 it increased R&amp;D investment to more than 15% of sales, but the losses continued. To cut expense, Cambex eliminated jobs; its employee count has dropped steadily from 180 in 1992 to under 30 in 2003.

   Cambex in the mid-1990s began developing Internet devices for the storage market. But declining sales continued, and a delay in shipments of a network disk storage line in 1997 caused a fourth straight year of losses. Cambex also filed for bankruptcy protection that year; it emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in 1998.

   In 2004 the company liquidated its Super PC Memory subsidiary, two years after acquiring the business.
