   Burberry bought back its fragrance license from Inter Parfums in 2013 and sales dropped as a result. Burberry had been Inter Parfums' most important partner. However, since then the company has shaken off the hit and returned to growth, post a sales increase of 10% in fiscal 2015 €326 million. The increase in sales relates to the acquisition of fashion and fragrance brand Rochas from

    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   in 2015. Net income rose 26% to €29.1 million as a result.

   The loss of the Burberry license in 2013 was a blow to the company, and it has been working to replace it by striking new agreements. In 2015, it acquired the Rochas fashion brand from Procter &amp; Gamble for $108 million, and in the same year it reached an 11-year agreement with Coach Inc, a New York design house, to produce, create and distribute new perfumes for men and women. It also extended its exclusive worldwide license to make perfumes for Montblanc through to 2020.
