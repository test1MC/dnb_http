   Pratt &amp; Whitney has let its customers slip the surly bonds of earth since 1925. The company, a division of
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   (UTC), manufactures and maintains commercial, military, and business jet engines. Pratt &amp; Whitney also makes industrial gas turbines for power generation. Commercial air giants
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus
   </company>
   (about 35% of sales) and
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   are Pratt &amp; Whitney's largest commercial engine customers. Military offerings include engines for the F-22, F-15, F-16, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the C-17 Globemaster II military transport.

  <p>
   Its operations include
   <company id="122099">
    Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada
   </company>
   (P&amp;WC), which manufactures engines to power business and regional aircraft and helicopters. P&amp;WC has produced more than 80,000 engines, of which there are more than 50,000 engines in service by more than 10,000 operators in 200 countries. Another division is Pratt &amp; Whitney Global Services, which provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services, as well as spare parts and fleet management services for large commercial engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney AeroPower designs and manufactures auxiliary power units and turbojet engines for commercial and military aircraft. Pratt &amp; Whitney AeroPower's portfolio includes the APS500R, APS2300, APS3200 and APS5000 APUs. Pratt &amp; Whitney Commercial Engines provides dependable power to hundreds of airlines and operators, with nearly 13,000 large commercial engines installed.

  <p>
   Of all large commercial engines that power passenger aircraft globally, about 30% are Pratt &amp; Whitney's. Besides aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and US government agencies, Pratt &amp; Whitney also counts aircraft leasing companies, space launch vehicle providers, and foreign governments, as well as 30 armed forces around the world among its customers. Non-US clients represent a little more than 50% of its revenues. To keep production close to its foreign customers, the company has expanded its facilities beyond US shores.

  <p>
   Sales generated by Pratt &amp; Whitney's international operations, including US export sales, were 64% and 57% of Pratt &amp; Whitney's total sales in 2013 and 2012, respectively. It contributed 23% to parent company
   <company id="11559">
    UTC
   </company>
   's net revenues in  2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 4% in 2013 due to organic growth driven by higher commercial engine sales volume (2%), increased military aftermarket and development program sales (2%), higher commercial aftermarket sales (1%), and a rise in industrial engine sales and related development contracts (1%), partially offset by lower military engine sales volume (4%). Sales increased 2% as a result of the consolidation of International Aero Engines (IAE) and the transfer of the AeroPower business to Pratt &amp; Whitney from UTC Aerospace Systems, partially offset by the divestiture of Pratt &amp; Whitney Power Systems.

   Pratt &amp; Whitney is looking to bounce back after it was devastated by the painful effects of the recession in which the airline industry lost billions in sales. It collaborates with companies in the development of new engines, with each entity sharing in associated costs, risks, and revenues. Such arrangements include a 33% interest in IAE, which provides V2500 engines for Airbus A320 aircraft. The company is also teamed up with
   <company id="57976">
    GE Aviation
   </company>
   in a 50/50 joint venture known as Engine Alliance (EA) to manufacture GP7000 engines for the Airbus A380 aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   When it comes to developing the next generation of engines, however, Pratt &amp; Whitney is flying solo. The company has completed several hundred hours of testing on the core of its PurePower PW800 and PW1000G Geared TurboFan engines. The PurePower engine family has been designed for greater fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and a 50% reduction in noise. The PW1000G has been selected to take the
   <company id="42381">
    Bombardier
   </company>
   's C-Series passenger aircraft aloft, as well as to power
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi
   </company>
   's regional jet, while the PW800 engine is built to power large business jets
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Pratt &amp; Whitney signed a depot activation contract with Aerospace Industrial Maintenance  Norway to establish a Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul, &amp; Upgrade capability for the F135 engine (which powers the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft). That year it also expanded its third-party logistics relationship with
   <company id="40483">
    UPS
   </company>
   . As part of the agreement, UPS will open a 600,000-square-foot Northeast Logistics Center (NELC) in Londonderry, New Hampshire
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013
   <company id="95436">
    Embraer
   </company>
   announced the selection of the PurePower engine to exclusively power the next generation of Embraer's E-Jet family of aircraft scheduled to enter service in 2018. That year All Nippon Airways signed an eight-year extension to its exclusive part repair agreement with Pratt &amp; Whitney to continue support of the airline's fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines. In 2013 Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada signed an engine service agreement with Hawker Beechcraft Services (HBS) for the support of Beechcraft King Air series turboprops and Hawker business jets.

  <p>
   To focus on its core aerospace and commercial businesses, in 2013 UTC divested its Pratt &amp; Whitney Power Systems unit to
   <company id="52292">
    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
   </company>
   . In order to finance its acquisition activities, that year UTC sold space propulsion division Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne to competitor GenCorp (later renamed
   <company id="10626">
    Aerojet Rocketdyne
   </company>
   for $550 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 the company was awarded a $1.12 billion contract with the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   for making F135 production engines to power the F-35 Lightning II airplane.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Pratt &amp; Whitney received its largest single order in half a century -- 300 new Geared Turbofan engines for IndiGo, an India-based low-cost airline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frederick Rentschler started Pratt &amp; Whitney in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925 when he built the first aircraft engine -- a 410-horsepower, air-cooled Wasp.
