  <p>
   Keysight's revenues have fluctuated over the years. After declining in 2015, revenues increased 2% to $2.9 billion in 2016. The growth for 2016 was associated with additional revenue from acquisitions coupled with data center expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits have also oscillated over the years. After rising in 2015, profits dipped 35% to $335 million in 2016. This was largely due to the absence of income tax benefits it incurred the previous year. In addition, cash flow from operations has followed this same up and down pattern, rising to $416 million in 2016 after falling the previous year.

  <p>
   One of the ways Keysight achieves revenue growth is through the use of acquisitions. In early 2017, the company agreed to buy

    Ixia

   , a California-based data technology firm that makes equipment that monitors and tests networks, for $1.6 billion. The combination will create a technology firm with expertise in electronic design, device and network measurement, and application and security performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2015, the company picked up Anite plc, a UK-based supplier of software products for wireless research and development, for around $600 million. The acquisition enabled the company to offer a broader portfolio of products throughout the wireless research and development cycle.
