   Tattoo regrets? Candela's medical laser technology can remove them and other cosmetic skin issues as well. The company makes light-based (laser) systems, including Alex TriVantage for birthmarks, lesions, sun spots, and tattoos; GentleLASE for permanent hair removal, facial veins, and wrinkles; Vbeam for acne, skin rejuvenation, scars, and warts. Candela sells to cosmetic and surgical markets through a direct sales force and distributors in the US and abroad. Its patent portfolio consists of roughly 25 issued US patents (with some 20 patents applications pending) and 35 international patents. Candela is a wholly-owned subsidiary of aesthetic laser-maker

   The company's operations are maintained in the Americas, EMEA, Australia, and Asia. Candela's subsidiaries include Candela KK, Candela Iberica, Candela Deutschland GmbH, Candela France SARL, Candela Italia, and Candela (U.K.) Limited.

   Candela's marketing efforts are traditionally targeted at dermatologists and plastic surgeons. In addition, the company had expanded its customer base to include primary care physicians (including general practitioners and OB/GYNs), who could supplement declining managed care reimbursements with cash revenue generated with Candela's aesthetic treatments. Candela struck an exclusive agreement with
   <company id="40964">
    McKesson Medical-Surgical
   </company>
   to distribute its products to these non-traditional customers in the US. And now, with the benefit of being part of a larger organization within Syneron, Candela has access to a wider range of potential customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historically, the majority of Candela's income came from overseas sales through its subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, and Europe, as well as sales of products shipped directly to international locations from the US. With Candela now part of Syneron's operations, Syneron looks to generate the majority of its revenues from international markets.
