   Hayes and Finch has made quite a holy cash cow out of the business of holy sacraments. The company manufactures and sells items belonging inside a church (besides the willing souls and the people attached to them): altars, altar linens, altar breads, baptismal fonts, candles, candlesticks, cassocks, clerical garments, crucifixes, cottas, funeral palls, hymn boards, incenses, kneelers, lecterns, pews, pulpits, stoles, surplices, vestments, wines, even collection plates. Hayes and Finch's products are sold through the company's catalog, web site, and through retail outlets.
