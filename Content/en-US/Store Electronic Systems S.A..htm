   Store Electronic Systems (SES) helps retailers deal with the shelf life of prices. The company designs and makes wireless communication products, namely electronic labels for store shelves that display product information and enable rapid price changing. Its systems come with a PC that encodes and organizes data for the labels, a transmitter that communicates with the labels via low frequency radio, a handheld terminal that links a label to a product via barcode, and electronic labels that show real-time product names and pricing to consumers. SES label systems are used by some of Europe's largest grocery retailers, including France's

   In 2015 revenue at SES jumped 39% higher to €113 million, increased by 39% compared to 2014. The revenue leap was driven by international growth, 28% higher in 2015 from 2014. The rise also reflects adoption of electronic labels by non-food retailers.

   SES calls its strategic plan 'Leapfrog 2020.' This plan involves total quality, industrial competitiveness, software differentiation, development of the partner network, and digital transformation. It looks to expand into new geographic markets and retail markets and quicken the pace at which it delivers new technology to customers. The company's goal is to install its labeling systems in more than 20,000 stores by 2020. It also wants to get 75% of revenue from international clients by 2020.
