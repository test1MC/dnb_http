   Pacira Pharmaceuticals lets injections last longer with its DepoFoam technology. The company develops sustained-release therapies based on DepoFoam, an injectable drug delivery technology that allows both immediate and sustained release. Pacira's newest drug, EXPAREL, is an injectable local anesthetic. Its two established products are DepoCyt for treating cancer-related neoplastic meningitis and DepoDur for the treatment of post-operative pain. The company is conducting development and licensing programs on other DepoFoam candidates as well.

        <p>
   Pacira has manufacturing and research facilities in La Jolla and San Diego, California. It also has administration and commercialization offices in Parsippany, New Jersey.

   EXPAREL received its
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for use in treating post surgical pain in late 2011, and Pacira began marketing EXPAREL to customers in 2012. The company's operations are focused on ramping up sales of EXPAREL. Its older products, DepoCyt and DepoDur, are licensed out to commercialization partners.

        <p>
   Pacira has a sales force entirely dedicated to commercializing EXPAREL composed of roughly 60 representatives and several sales managers. Pacira developed its sales force in 2012 through a contract with
   <company id="17267">
    Quintiles
   </company>
   Commercial US; in 2013 the representatives were transferred from Quintiles to become Pacira's own direct sales force, which targets surgeons, anesthesiologists, pharmacists, and other hospital decision makers. By the end of 2012 Pacira had made sales to more than 800 hospitals. It also sells to surgery centers and wholesale distributors.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Commercialization of EXPAREL caused a 149% increase in Pacira's revenues in 2012 to some $39 million. Growth was offset by declined sales of DepoCyt in Europe. The company also experienced slight revenue growth in 2011 and 2010 from its licensing and marketing agreements.
  </p>
        <p>
   Like most drug development companies, Pacira has incurred significant operating losses since inception. The company doesn't expect its currently marketed products to generate enough money to cover its expenses and lead it to profitability in the near future. Pacira expects to continue to incur significant expenses from increasing commercialization activities for EXPAREL and advancing the development and commercialization of its other product candidates.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Pacira is conducting research programs to expand the uses for EXPAREL; for instance, the firm is pursuing FDA approval of the drug for a nerve block indication. It also has DepoFoam candidates under development for other uses in the hospital market, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cardiac care, and cancer.
  </p>
        <p>
   To bring in additional income, Pacira licenses out its technologies or partners with other drugmakers on development and commercialization programs. The company occasionally pursues growth through asset acquisitions.
