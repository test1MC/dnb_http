   When it comes serving the agriculture and transportation industries through its eclectic range of businesses, Chief Industries is the head honcho. Chief makes ethanol fuel and manufactures a host of supplies for agricultural, industrial, correctional, building, transportation, and wastewater treatment applications. Its agri/industrial unit makes grain-drying and storage bins, crop-drying fans, and aeration systems. Its transportation business makes rail car products, while division Chief Custom Homes makes modular homes and RVs. Chief offers services, including metal fabrication, powder coating, design/build general contracting, electrical/lighting design, and for-hire freight hauling.

  <p>
   The company's manufacturing, distribution, and engineering facilities are located throughout the US, as well as in France and the UK. In 2010 Chief's primary agri/industrial division opened a new distribution center in Atwood, Indiana, to better serve customers in the region.

   Demand for ethanol is expected to increase due to recent changes in the Clean Air Act by the
   <company id="130205">
    Environmental Protection Agency
   </company>
   , which should prove to be beneficial to the company's Chief Ethanol Fuels subsidiary. In late 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver that allowed the sale of E15 (an 85% gasoline/15% ethanol blend) to 2007 and newer model cars and light trucks. In early 2011 the EPA extended the waiver to include 2001 and newer vehicles.

   Chief Industries has found a way to help its dealers with the tight credit market. Chief Custom Homes introduced Chief Financial Services in 2010 as a means to provide dealers a way to purchase model homes. Some dealers are unable to finance newer models and are forced to keep older inventory for displays.

  <p>
   Chief Industries was founded in 1954 as a small construction firm, building and remodeling single family homes. It soon became a dealer for farm buildings and grain bins.
