   The Medicines Company will meet you at the hospital. The drug developer focuses on treatments used in acute care settings, including the ER, the surgical suite, and the cardiac catheterization lab. It aims to be a leader in the areas of serious infectious disease care, acute cardiovascular care, and surgery and perioperative care. Its marketed products include Angiomax, an anticoagulant used during coronary angioplasties; it also sells Brilinta. The Medicines Company has other compounds in various stages of development including cangrelor, an anti-platelet agent with possible use during cardiac catheterization, and antibiotic oritavancin.

  <p>
   A majority of the company's income (88% in 2014) comes from sales of Angiomax in the US; the drug is also available internationally and is known in some regions as Angiox. The company depends on third parties (including
   <company id="110928">
    Lonza
   </company>
   ) for manufacturing of its drugs. Sales of Recothrom (a topical thrombin used to control bleeding, sold in early 2016) accounted for 9% and other products accounted for about 3% of annual revenues in 2014. It also sells acute care generics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Medicines Company also markets Minocin (minocycline) and Orbactiv (oritavancin). Its development pipeline includes three registration-stage products -- cangrelor, IONSYS (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system), and RPX-602 -- and four R&amp;D products -- ABP-700, ALN-PCSsc, CarbavanceTM, and MDCO-216.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounts for more than 90% of The Medicine Company's annual revenues. Its products are sold in more than 25 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Medicines Company has global centers in Parsippany, New Jersey; and Zurich. It leases small offices and other facilites in Waltham and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Redwood City and San Diego, California; Seattle; Montreal; Abington, UK; Hong Kong; Paris; Rome; Munich, Germany; Vienna, Austria; Brussels; Amsterdam and Leiden, Netherlands; Madrid; Helsinki, Finland; Copenhagen; Stockholm; Warsaw, Poland; Sydney; Auckland, New Zealand; SÃ£o Paolo; and New Delhi.

  <p>
   Angiomax, Cleviprex (now divested), and Argatroban are sold in US through sole-source distributor ICS (Integrated Commercialization Solutions); ICS markets and sells the products to hospitals and wholesalers. For Angiomax, its sales force targets hospitals with cardiac catheterization laboratories that perform 200 or more coronary angioplasties annually. ICS accounted for 95% of net revenue in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Europe, Angiomax is sold as Angiox through an inside sales force; the company also directly sells Angiomax in Australia and New Zealand. In other international markets, Angiomax/Angiox is sold through distributors, including
   <company id="11673">
    Sunovion
   </company>
   in Canada and Grupo Ferrer Internacional in Greece, Portugal, Spain, and some Central and South American countries, and through a joint venture with partner Windlas Healthcare Private in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014 the company entered into a collaboration with SciClone Pharmaceuticals through which SciClone gained exclusive rights to promote, market, and sell Angiomax and Cleviprex in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising costs totaled $1.1 million in 2014, up from $0.4 million in 2013 and $0.2 million in 2012.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Medicines Company reported increased revenues over the past five years as its product offerings have grown, including a 5% increase to $724.4 million in 2014. The rise in earnings was driven by a price increase on Angiomax in the US,higher sales volumes, and favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. That year was also the first full year for sales of Recothrom, which was first sold in February 2013. Increased sales of Argatroban and Cleviprex, the 2014 launches of Orbactiv and PreveLeak (the latter of which was divested in 2016), and sales of the recently acquired Minocin IV also contributed to the increase in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the rising revenues, net income has been on the decline since 2012. In 2014 the company reported a net loss of $32.2 million (versus net income of $15.5 million in 2013) as expenses (R&amp;D, general and administrative, and selling costs -- primarily to support the launches of Orbactiv and Minocin IV) rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has fluctuated over the past few years. It decreased 26% to $67 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has been working to expand the number of approved indications for Angiomax, as well as to expand the drug into new markets. Development candidates include products aiming to reduce blood loss during surgery and to reduce the risk of coronary events in patients who have heart problems, including angina and coronary thrombosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Without a drug discovery operation of its own, The Medicines Company licenses or acquires clinical-stage compounds from others and shepherds them through clinical trials and (hopefully) onto the market. It licensed Angiomax, for example, from
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   . It is on the lookout for additional candidates (or approved drugs) that would fit easily into its portfolio of products aimed at the hospital market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been busy rolling out or nearing roll-out of new products. After receiving
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for Orbactiv for the treatment of adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, the company launched Orbactiv commercially in the US in 2014. Also that year, it received European approval for Kengrexal and US approval for Minocin. In 2015, the FDA approved IONSYS for the short-term management of acute post-operative pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsidiary Rempex entered an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (part of the
   <company id="150448">
    US Department of Health and Human Services
   </company>
   ) in 2014, under which it could receive up to $89.8 million to support the development of Carbavance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, The Medicines Company entered an agreement with SciClone granting SciClone exclusive rights to market and sell Angiomax and Cleviprex in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016, the firm sold its hemostasis portfolio to pharmaceutical manufacturer
   <company id="10798">
    Mallinckrodt
   </company>
   for a potential $410 million (based on considerations for future milestone payments). The sale included three products -- Recothrom, PreveLeak, and Raplixa -- and served to provide capital for The Medicine Company's core programs such as R&amp;D for cholesterol-lowering agents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Medicines Company then sold its non-core cardiovascular assets to
   <company id="124295">
    Chiesi
   </company>
   for up to $792 million. The transaction included Cleviprex, Kengreal, and rights to Argatroban for Injection. These latest sales help the company focus on its pipeline, which contains four potential blockbuster drugs.

  <p>
   The company has made selected acquisitions of development candidates over the years to expand its pipeline. It also occasionally purchases small stakes in drug technology firms. In 2015 it acquired Annovation Biopharma, which is developing ABP-700, a novel intravenous anesthetic.
