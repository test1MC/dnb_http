   Hardly an unknown or no name ("NN") supplier, NN produces a slew of precision metal components and assemblies for a highly diverse, global market. Operating through three manufacturing units, NN makes precision steel balls and rollers for bearing makers; carmakers; drilling bit makers whose products extract water, oil and gas, and minerals; and OEMs of stainless steel valves and pumps. It also churns out precision bearing seals, metal and plastic retainers for ball and roller bearings, and molded plastic products for automotive, electronic instrument, and fluid control industries.

  <p>
   NN enjoyed unprecedented growth in 2015, with revenues surging 37% to peak at a record-setting $667 million in 2015. The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by extraordinary increases from its precision engineered products (130%) and autocam precision components segments (85%). A large portion of this growth was attributed to additional revenue from previous acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a net loss of $7 million in 2015 mostly due to higher depreciation, amortization, and write-off costs related to the refinancing of its acquisitions. Cash flow was up by 9% in 2015, mostly due to favorable changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and other non-current assets.

  <p>
   Going forward, NN looks to deploy cash generated from operations to grow organically as well as through business acquisitions in the global market for metal bearing and precision metal components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it bought Caprock Manufacturing and Caprock Enclosures, a privately held plastic components supplier located in Lubbock, Texas. Caprock serves multiple end markets, including the aerospace, medical, and general industrial sectors. The company will become a part of its precision engineered products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, NN also purchased Precision Engineered Products Holdings (PEP). PEP is a global manufacturer of highly engineered precision customized products serving the medical, electrical, automotive, and aerospace end markets.
