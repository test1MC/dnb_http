   Think you have a high pressure job? Husky Injection Molding Systems makes&#160;high&#160;pressure injection molding equipment&#160;used by&#160;manufacturers&#160;to&#160;produce such plastic products as bottles, containers, computer housings, cell phones, auto parts, and medical&#160;devices (syringes and vials). The world's #1&#160;equipment molding brand supplier builds molding and&#160;hot runner systems, which distribute plastic resin to mold cavities, as well as&#160;part-handling robots that remove the plastic products from the mold,&#160;to sort and stack them. The PET (polyethylene terephthalate) packaging market accounts for&#160;more than&#160;half of Husky's sales.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Husky operates manufacturing plants&#160;in Canada and the US, as well as in Luxembourg and China. Its sales and service network, some 40 offices, dot more than 100 countries; about 75% of all sales are made beyond North America.

        <p>
   Husky's equipment is used to manufacture a wide range of plastic products such as bottles and caps for beverages, containers for food, medical components, and consumer electronic parts.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company&#160;designs and manufactures a comprehensive range of complete, integrated injection molding systems for a variety of key markets. Its systems include Hylectric, HyPET, H-PET AE, H-MED AE, HyPAC and HyCAP.

        <p>
   Husky's goal is to continuously develop innovative technologies to help&#160;its customers streamline their operations and improve their bottom lines. The company's&#160;investment in research and development has resulted in a&#160;slew of product patents and improvements.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012, to&#160;complement Husky's existing suite of beverage closures products, the company launched its next generation HyCAP
   <sup>
    ™
   </sup>
   system for high-output beverage closure manufacturing.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its&#160;all-electric injection press for medial molding, launched in 2011, was the plastic machinery industry's first simulated clean environment.&#160;Drives and motors are supplied by Toyo Machinery &amp; Metal Co. The addition enables Husky to&#160;tap demand&#160;for medical clean room molding.&#160;In the market for molding PET preforms, Husky has introduced a new generation of its hot runner system, which&#160;decreases the weight of beverage containers and&#160;closures, thus&#160;mitigating resin costs, and increases productivity and energy efficiency by up to 15%.&#160;It is also developing a line for molding recycled PET containers into preforms.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2011, the company acquired Austria-based Kunststofftechnik Waidhofen a.d. Thaya Ges.m.b.H. (KTW), a closure mold maker.&#160;The deal, which&#160;builds upon a 14-year collaboration,&#160;improves the marriage of&#160;KTW-brand molds&#160;with Husky's systems.&#160;As a result, Husky stands as&#160;the&#160;only provider&#160;of&#160;fully integrated&#160;injection molding systems.

   , Husky&#160;grew, literally,&#160;out&#160;of a garage. Robert Schad started the company as a small machine shop in 1953. Schad served as president and CEO of Husky until 2005. He held more than a 40% controlling interest in the company until its takeover 2007.
