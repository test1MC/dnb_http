   RC2 is well beyond its First Years in selling playthings. The company designs child care products and toys for infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children. It markets them through its

   unit, whose brand portfolio includes The First Years, Lamaze, and JJ Cole. For bigger kids, RC2 offers plastic and die-cast collectibles, such as Ertl agricultural vehicle replicas and Johnny Lightning vintage cars and trucks. It also holds licensing agreements to make products under such names as Thomas &amp; Friends, Bob the Builder, and

  <p>
   RC2 was acquired by TOMY in 2011 for about $640 million in cash. Under the umbrella provided by the Japan-based maker of toys and infant products, RC2 has access to broader markets and distribution networks. Most of TOMY's products are sold in Asia. The US and Europe typically account for about 10% of its total sales. Conversely, North America is responsible for the bulk of RC2's demand; however, international customers have generated an increasing percentage of sales in recent years.

  <p>
   From its headquarters in Illinois, RC2 Corporation enjoys a global reach. Outside the US, it operates in Canada and Mexico, as well as outside North America in international markets. The company distributes its products to retailers located in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia Pacific, and South America.

  <p>
   The company operates its business through two reportable segments: North America and International. The first segment includes its business in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Its International sector includes all business conducted outside North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of RC2 Corporation's products are provided by third-party manufacturers in China, including all of its die-cast products. About 10% of its products are made in the US. These include ride-on toys, safety gates, and certain plastic infant and toddler products.

  <p>
   Before being acquired by TOMY, RC2 Corporation had been busy trying to boost its revenue. While sales inched upward, its top line declined for several years. The company, in response, reduced its workforce by about 15% and made other cost-cutting moves.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, the company has concentrated on new product development for growth. For North American customers, it has rolled out die-cast train engines under the Chuggington brand (based on the eponymous animated TV show aired in the UK) and train cars, dinosaurs, and plush toys from Dinosaur Train (based on the PBS TV series of the same name). RC2 Corporation has also launched new products under the Thomas &amp; Friends and John Deere brands. Outside North America, the company is focused on expanding its Thomas &amp; Friends and Chuggington train toys, as well as its The First Years and Lamaze lines.

   Looking to expand its products portfolio in the baby care category, the company purchased JJ Cole Collections, a Utah-based manufacturer of bundleme-brand designer diaper bags, nursery storage products, baby blankets, and other soft goods. RC2 Corporation paid about $40 million in cash for JJ Cole.
