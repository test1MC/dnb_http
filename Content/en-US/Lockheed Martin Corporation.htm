   Lockheed Martin takes flight in times of crisis. A leading global military contractor, the company serves the civil and commercial sectors, but it is firmly on the defense/government side of the aerospace industry; sales to the US government accounts for about 80% of revenue, with the
   <company id="105717">
    US DoD
   </company>
   accounting for some 60%.
   <company id="135981">
    Aeronautics
   </company>
   makes combat aircraft and UAVs, while other segments include
   <company id="110919">
    Space Systems
   </company>
   (satellites and space travel),
   <company id="105080">
    Missiles &amp; Fire Control
   </company>
   (air and missile defense systems), and Mission Systems &amp; Training (ship and submarine combat technology). The company traces its historical roots back to 1912.
  </p>

  <p>
   Lockheed Martin operates through several business segments.
   <company id="135981">
    Aeronautics
   </company>
   is its largest, representing 34% of its total sales in 2015. Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions (IS&amp;GS; spun-off in 2016) generated 12%, while
   <company id="111079">
    Space Systems
   </company>
   also accounted for 20%. Other segments include
   <company id="105080">
    Missiles &amp; Fire Control
   </company>
   (15%) and Mission Systems &amp; Training (19%).
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2016, the company spun-off its IS&amp;GS segment and merged it with
   <company id="149843">
    Leidos
   </company>
   , a provider of national security services, in a deal valued at around $5 billion. The transaction allowed Lockheed Martin to focus on its core aerospace and defense operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lockheed Martin's key subsidiaries include
   <company id="10915">
    Loral Corporation
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="99451">
    United Space Alliance

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company maintains a global presence in about 30 countries across Asia, US, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. International customers accounted for 21% of its net sales in 2015.

   Though the DoD is undergoing budget cuts, it is still committed to several important Lockheed Martin product initiatives, including the F-35, the Global Positioning Satellite program, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system, the Space-Based Infrared System, Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, the DDG-51 AEGIS destroyer, and the U-2 manned ISR aircraft.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lockheed Martin's revenues have remained consistent the last several years, jumping 1% from $45.6 billion in 2014 to $46.1 billion in 2015. Its profits also remained static, hovering around the $3.6 billion mark for 2014 and 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The marginal growth for 2015 was fueled by increased revenue from both its Aeronautics and Mission Systems and Training segments. Aeronautics generated higher sales for F-35 production contracts due to increased volume on aircraft production and higher sales for the C-5 program due to increased deliveries. Mission Systems and Training earned extra sales from the company's Sikorsky acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lockheed Martin's cash flow from operations has fluctuated over the years; after going down in 2014, cash flow surged by 32% in 2015, mostly due to favorable changes in post-retirement benefit plans.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lockheed Martin is focusing on serving the DoD's new priorities as it tries to become leaner under budget constraints. These priorities include logistics, information technology, and network and cyber security. It finds further optimism for its defense business in the pervasiveness of its products in all aspects of defense theaters. The military realms of land, sea, air, and space will continue to find use for the Aegis Combat System, the PAC-3 missile program, and the THAAD.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, in mid-2016 the company sold its IS&amp;GS segment to
   <company id="149843">
    Leidos
   </company>
   , a provider of national security services, in a deal valued at around $5 billion. The transaction allowed Lockheed Martin to focus on its core aerospace and defense operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   As other government departments and agencies also suffer with budget constraints, Lockheed Martin is similarly focusing on the priorities they have identified for leaner operations. For government customers that include the
   <company id="151486">
    Social Security Administration
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
   </company>
   , Lockheed Martin has been providing service in critical intelligence, knowledge management, and e-Government.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company believes that the government's ongoing focus on homeland security will boost opportunities for business in air traffic management, cargo security, and biohazard detection, among other security functions. The company is also looking to grow its international sales, primarily from foreign government customers in need of its Aeronautics and Electronic Systems products and services.
  </p>

  <p>
   In late 2015, the company acquired Black Hawk helicopter manufacturer
   <company id="99064">
    Sikorsky Aircraft
   </company>
   for $9 billion. Lockheed Martin bought Sikorsky from
   <company id="11559">
    United Technologies
   </company>
   and will integrate its operations into its Mission Systems &amp; Training segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2014, the company spent a total of $898 million on acquisitions. That year it completed the acquisition of Zeta Associates, a Virginia-based specialist in technology powering critical national security missions. The deal enhanced its Space Systems business area and also strengthened its ability to deliver ground, air, and space-based intelligence in support of its customers' essential missions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lockheed Martin in 2014 also snapped up Systems Made Simple, a leading provider of health information technology to the US federal government. The acquisition allowed the company to deliver a broader portfolio of capabilities to its health care customers. Systems Made Simple will be integrated into the Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions segment.

  <p>
   Brothers Allan and Malcolm Loughead (pronounced "Lockheed") started their first aviation venture, the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company, in 1912. Alco's first product, the Model G floatplane, didn't sell. In 1916 the brothers relocated from Santa Barbara to San Francisco and formed the Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company. That company's first product, the F-1 seaplane, made a successful debut in early 1918, but the end of WWI effectively ended the potential market for the F-1. Loughead Aircraft went bankrupt in 1921.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Loughead brothers joined Fred Keeler in 1926 to form the Lockheed Aircraft Company in Southern California. John Northrop (who later founded Northrop Corporation) designed Lockheed's first airplane, the Vega (flown by Amelia Earhart). The company was acquired in 1929 by Detroit Aircraft Corporation, which went bankrupt in 1931 as the Great Depression devastated the airplane industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Gross, Carl Squier, and Lloyd Stearman bought Lockheed in 1932. The company produced such aviation classics as the P-38 Lightning fighter, the U-2 spy plane, and the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. It also produced submarine-launched ballistic missiles (Polaris, 1958), military transports (C-5 Galaxy, 1968), and the L-1011 TriStar airliner (1971).
  </p>
  <p>
   Lockheed suffered from the cancellation of its Cheyenne attack helicopter, the C-5A cost overrun scandal, and financial problems with the L-1011. Government loans saved the firm from bankruptcy in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glenn Martin started
   <company id="54397">
    Martin Marietta
   </company>
   in 1917. Martin Marietta made the first US-built bombers, as well as military and commercial flying boats. During the 1950s Martin Marietta made missiles, electronics, and nuclear systems. In 1961 it merged with American-Marietta Company (construction materials and chemical products).
  </p>
  <p>
   Strapped with debt after defeating a hostile takeover by Bendix in 1982, Martin Marietta sold many of its businesses. It bought
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   's aerospace business (1992) and became part of Lockheed in 1995.
