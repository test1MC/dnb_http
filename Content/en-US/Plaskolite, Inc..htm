   Plaskolite knows that not all sheets go on a bed. The plastics company manufactures its trademarked OPTIX and DURAPLEX (impact resistant) extruded acrylic sheet used in products such as lighting panels, picture frames, and signs. Other offerings include acrylic resin, polystyrene sheet, FABBACK mirror sheet, and protective coatings and backings (UV &amp; thermal). Plaskolite, which was founded in 1950, also offers a Run-to-Size program that enables customers to buy the exact sheet specifications they need for their applications. The company operates US manufacturing and distribution facilities in California, Mississippi, Ohio, and Texas, an international sites in the Netherlands and Mexico.

   Plaskolite has been expanding its product offerings through purchases in recent years. In 2012 it obtained the extruded sheet business of Pexco LLC, based in Atlanta. Plaskolite also that year purchased the VIVAK PETG sheet USA business from

    Bayer MaterialScience
   </company>
   in a deal that further enhanced the company's product offering to its distribution customer base.

  <p>
   In order to diversify its product offerings even further, Plaskolite has formed a joint venture in Turkey with Isik Plastik, a thermoformed plastics maker. The new entity will manufacture cell cast acrylic, a new product sold by Plaskolite that contains a high chemical resistance and color range.
