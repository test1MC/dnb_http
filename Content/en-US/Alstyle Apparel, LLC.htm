   Like an all-cotton t-shirt in a hot clothes dryer, apparel maker's sales and profits are shrinking. In fiscal 2013 (ended January) sales declined $40.2 million versus the prior year, to $198.8 million. Indeed, sales have fallen 28% over the past two years due to soft market conditions, reduced retail and consumer demand attributed to the protracted and uneven economic recovery, lower inventory levels held by customers, and a drop in commodity prices and competitors' pricing strategies. Alstyle's profits have also declined from more than $77 million in fiscal 2011 to just $26.3 million in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nonetheless, the company has reason to anticipate an improved future. Alstyle's expects sales volumes to improve as its selling prices and the cost of cotton in its inventories become better aligned, and an improved business environment spurs sales in fiscal 2014.

   While no single customer accounts for more than 5% of its sales, Alstyle fancies itself as a staple in the skate, surf, and extreme sports industries. Customers include notable surf and skate brands who actively take advantage of the company's relabel and private label programs.
