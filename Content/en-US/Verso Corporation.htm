   Verso operates in three market segments: coated papers; hardwood market pulp; and other, consisting of specialty papers. Its chief product lines, however, include coated groundwood paper (45% of net sales) and coated freesheet paper (32%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Verso's mills have a combined annual production capacity of about 1.4 million tons of coated paper and 160,000 tons of ultra-lightweight specialty and uncoated papers; they also produce 930,000 tons of kraft pulp. The company also owns four hydroelectric dams, which provide hydroelectric power to its Androscoggin mill; and owns fourteen woodyards for the storing and loading of forest products.

   Verso sells and markets its products to about 130 customers which comprise about 700 end-user accounts. In 2013 about 37% of its paper products were sold directly to end-users, most of which were catalog and magazine publishers. The company's largest indirect paper sales by volume are sold through brokers and merchants (41% of sales) who resell the paper to end-users. In 2013 total sales to printers represented 22% of total sales.

  <p>
   Verso is attempting to bounce back after struggling with declining revenues and four straight years of net losses. Revenues were down 6% from $1.47 billion in 2012 to $1.39 billion in 2013. The company also suffered a net loss of $111 million in 2013 after posting a net loss of $174 million the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2013 was driven by a decrease in demand from coated papers, its largest segment. This was due to an 8% drop in paper sales volume, which was driven by the closure of its Sartell mill during the third quarter of 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net loss for 2013 decreased due to lower restructuring charges related to the facility operations and personnel costs for its Sartell mill site. However, the company still suffered from losses associated with debt refinancing throughout 2013. (It paid over $137 million in interest expenses during the year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has been falling steadily over the past few years, from nearly $180 million in 2009 to a loss of $28 million in 2013.

  <p>
   After suffering four straight years of net losses, Verso is focused on returning to profitability. As part of its business strategy, it is in the process of identifying opportunities to improve its balance sheet by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. It has implemented focused programs to optimize material and energy sourcing and usage, reduce repair costs, and manage overhead. It continues to utilize the process improvement program to drive further cost reductions and operating improvements in its mill system.

  <p>
   In early 2014 Verso agreed to acquire rival paper maker
   <company id="138248">
    NewPage Holdings
   </company>
   in a deal worth $1.4 billion. Once the deal is finalized during the second half of 2014, the combined company will have sales of approximately $4.5 billion and 11 manufacturing facilities spanning six states. Verso believes the merger will create a company better positioned to compete more effectively against increased competition from electronic and online competitors.
