   From Alphabet to Z, Groupe Zannier wants to keep French kids in fashion. Zannier designs and sells children's apparel under a dozen brands, including 3 Pommes, Alphabet, Z generation, DIM, Catimini, Kenzo, and Absorba. The company operates in more than 120 countries worldwide, though France provides about half its sales. While clothing represents more than 90% of revenues, Zannier also sells shoes and watches and licenses its brands for other products. The company distributes through retailers, wholesalers, and its own network of 900 stores (company-owned, franchised, or affiliated).

  <p>
   Siblings Roger and Josette Zannier started a small clothing manufacturing business in 1962 to serve local shops in France's Loire region. Within a few years they started serving French clothing wholesalers and were specializing in children's apparel. By 1976 the Zanniers had expanded their operations to include sales to hypermarkets.
