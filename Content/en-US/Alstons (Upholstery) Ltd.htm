   One of the UK's leading furniture manufacturers, Alstons (Upholstery) works with wood and fabric to make people comfortable in their homes. The Alston family's direct involvement with selling and repairing furniture dates back to 1850. The family later honed their product offerings in 1951, when Leslie Alston opened Alstons Upholstery in Colchester. Still a family-run home furnishings wholesaler and manufacturer, Alstons' unbranded wooden and upholstered pieces are sold through retailers across the UK. Products are fabricated inside the UK by Alston-operated manufacturing facilities.

   To make its furniture more durable, the company uses copper washed seat springs.

   Even though Alstons is considered one of the UK's leading furniture manufacture, the company has had to deal with increased competition from developing countries and regions such as China, Southeast Asia, Poland, Mexico. The European Union accounts for half of the world's furniture production with the UK accounting for some 10%, but China and India has gained ground.
