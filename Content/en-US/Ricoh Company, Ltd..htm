   Ricoh may be best known for its imaging equipment, but the company is more than just another copycat. One of the world's leading manufacturers of copiers and supplies, Ricoh also makes fax machines, scanners, and printers. Other products from the company, which operates about 230 subsidiaries and affiliates in more than 180 countries, include digital cameras, servers, software for its products, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, thermal paper labels, and optical equipment. Ricoh is represented in the US and across the Americas by its

   subsidiary.

  <p>
   Sales in Japan account for about 42% of the company's revenues. Sales in the Americas and Europe were around the 25% mark for each.

   Ricoh's revenue increased 2% in 2015 (ended March) due to increase in Imaging &amp; Solutions (1.6% higher) and Industrial Products (8% higher). New models of color multi-function printers sold well in Japan and overseas, boosting Imaging &amp; Solutions while the thermal business heated up sales for Industrial Products. Profits dropped 6%, however, on higher expenses in 2015.

   Although printers and office equipment are Ricoh's biggest moneymakers, the company has moved beyond its core products into related services, including  managed document services, document outsourcing services, logistics, financing, leasing, and IT service. The company is investing $300 million in its managed document services infrastructure through 2014. Ricoh leases its equipment through a separate publicly traded company in Japan named Ricoh Leasing.

  <p>
   In 2015, Ricoh expanded its activities in Malaysia with the acquisition of NASSION Systems, a provider of information and telecommunications services in the country. In a 2014 acquisition, Ricoh added PTIMarketing Technologies, a software-as-a-service marketing asset management and marketing firm, to its fold. Ricoh bolstered it IT services portfolio through the 2014 acquisition of mindSHIFT Technologies Inc., a managed IT, cloud, data center, and professional services company that serves small and mid-sized organizations.

  <p>
   Ricoh began in 1936 as the Riken Kankoshi Company, making photographic paper. With founder Kiyoshi Ichimura at the helm, the company soon became the leader in Japan's sensitized paper market. It changed its name to Riken Optical Company in 1938 and started making cameras. Two years later it produced its first camera under the Ricoh brand.

   By 1954 Ricoh cameras were Japan's #1 seller and also popular abroad. The next year it entered the office machine market with its compact mimeograph machine. Ricoh followed that in 1960 with an offset duplicator.

   Ricoh built its business in the 1960s with a range of office machines, including reproduction and data processing equipment and retrieval systems. The company began establishing operations overseas, including US subsidiary Ricoh Industries U.S.A. in 1962. The US unit started marketing cameras but found greener pastures in the copier industry, where Ricoh's products were sold under the

   and

   brand names. It changed its name to Ricoh Company in 1963. Two years later Ricoh entered the emerging field of office computers and introduced an electrostatic copier. In 1968 Ichimura died, and Mikio Tatebayashi took over as president for the next eight years.
