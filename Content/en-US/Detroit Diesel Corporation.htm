   Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) says "keep on truckin'" as it continues to make a full lineup of engines. DDC sells its heavy-duty, diesel engines and hybrid line to the commercial truck market. It offers 190 to 600 horsepower engines for vocational and on-highway customers. The Series 60, a heavy-duty diesel engine with electronic controls, is its #1 seller. DDC also remanufactures two- and four-cycle engines. It services its engines through a network of more than 800 outlets in North America. Most sales are made directly to truck makers in the US. Detroit Diesel is a brand affiliate of

Five years later, GM consolidated the division with the Allison Division (a manufacturer of automotive transmissions and gas turbines) to form the Detroit Diesel Allison. In early 1988, Detroit Diesel Corporation was created as a joint venture between GM and
