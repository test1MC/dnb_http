   Lanson-BCC (formerly Boizel Chanoine Champagne) has a hand in making one of the finer things in life. The firm is the second largest producer of champagne in France (behind
   <company id="105243">
    LVMH
   </company>
   ); it makes and sells champagne for the domestic and international markets. Lanson-BCC owns and markets seven brands (or "houses") of champagne. Among its brands are Besserat de Bellefon and Clos des Goisses. The company's acquisition of Maison Burtin and Champagne Lanson in 2006 doubled its activity and made it a tour de force in the industry. Chairman and CEO Bruno Paillard and his family own more than 40% of the company.

  <p>
   Lanson-BCC operates in France, Europe, Middle East, the US, Asia and Latin America. Europe accounts for around 95% of revenue, of which France made up 60 percentage points.

   In 2015, revenue decreased 4% on prior year to €266 million due to lower units sold. Sales prices are up, but not sufficiently to offset the higher cost price of bottles sold in the year. Net income fell 23% to €12 million as a result.

   Faced with stiff competition, Lansom-BCC is working to ensure it maintains a focus on all segments.

   In 2015, the Champagne Hillsides, Houses and Cellars were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, which is beneficial to three of Lansom-BCC's Houses: Boizel, De Venoge and Philipponnat.
