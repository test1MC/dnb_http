   Out to ax the dreaded flu is Novavax, a producer of novel, next-generation vaccines designed to prevent life-threatening infectious diseases, such as the influenza virus. The clinical-stage company uses its own virus-like particle (VLP) technology that, unlike traditional vaccines which are grown in chicken eggs, use recombinant proteins grown from insect cell lines. Its manufacturing process is also faster and more flexible than traditional manufacturing methods -- a fact that might help the vaccines succeed in combating fast-changing strains of pandemic influenza. Candidates in the company's pipeline include vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza, Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV), Varicella Zoster (shingles), and HIV.

  <p>
   Like many drug development company's Novavax works with a number of partners and collaborators. It has a joint venture with India-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals to develop H1N1, seasonal flu, and other vaccines for that market. The joint venture, called CPL Biologics, is planning to initiate clinical studies of vaccine candidates to prevent influenza and rabies in 2012 and 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the company has a licensing agreement with LG Life Sciences. The agreement with LG Life Sciences allows the company to use Novavax's VLP technology to develop and sell influenza vaccines in South Korea and certain other emerging markets. Under terms of the agreement, Novavax received an upfront payment and is eligible for milestone payments and royalty payments.

   It is working with PATH Vaccine Solutions on an RSV vaccine for infants by vaccinating the mother, with

   on a flu vaccine for the US Department of Health and Human Services, and with US Homeland Security to protect the US from foot-and-mouth disease.

   The company's headquarters, manufacturing, and R&amp;D facilities are in Maryland with an additional R&amp;D and manufacturing facility in Sweden.

  <p>
   Being a development-stage company, even all of these licensing agreements can't offset the price of trying to develop and bring to market a new vaccine. Though it brings in some revenue each year, thanks to such agreements and grants, R&amp;D expenses combined with operating expenses have left the company posting net losses each year. As of 2013 Novavax's accumulated deficit was $410 million. It will likely continue to post losses until it is able to get a vaccine approved for sale in the US.

   Of course, the company plans to turn a profit once it has an
   <company id="144161">
    FDA

   -approved product to market. It will find that product through its own R&amp;D, acquisition of drugs or companies, partnering, in-licensing, and strategic alliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016, Novavax announced plans to cut 30% of its staff after receiving disappointing results in clinical tests of its RSV vaccine in elderly patients. The move will help the company slow down its cash spending. Novovax now intends to focus its RSV efforts on maternal immunizations to protect infants, as well as to increase its R&amp;D activities on a Zika virus vaccine candidate.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased drug developer Isconova, which it renamed Novavax AB. The purchase brought in a key vaccine ingredient along with R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities in Sweden.
