   The company has evolved from a small mill that manufactured cattle feed to a conglomerate interested in producing, distributing, and marketing food and nutritional products for animals and people. Its growth continues to be fueled by improvements in technology as well as strategic acquisitions that expand its capacity and portfolio of branded products. In 2013 GSTC Logistics, Inc. of Walford, Iowa, began construction of a new 600,000-sq.-ft. warehouse and distribution center in Muscatine to serve Kent's Grain Processing Corporation, Kent Nutrition Group, and Kent Pet Group businesses.

   In 2012 Kent Nutrition Group and
   <company id="107103">
    J.D. Heiskell &amp; Company
   </company>
   formed a joint venture to provide dairy operators in the northeastern US with mixed dairy feeds, feed commodities, mineral packages, and other nutrition inputs. Operating under the name Gold Star Feed and Grain, LLC, the business gets its management expertise from J.D. Heiskell &amp; Company while Kent Nutrition Group offers four feed mills and proprietary nutritional products.
