In addition, it offers remote teller systems, cash dispensers, and check cashing machines. Originally a manufacturer of safes, the company is still active in its original market, offering products that include vaults and security systems for financial institutions. It also provides electronic voting machines in Brazil. The company's related services range from traditional maintenance to remote monitoring, transaction processing, and currency management. Diebold, which has operations in more than 90 countries, gets more than half of sales outside North America. In a major move, Diebold bought its European rival Wincor Nixdorf for $1.8 billion.

   Diebold's sales fell 12% to 7% to $2.4 billion in 2015 from $3 billion 2014. Revenue dropped in all business segments and all geographies regions but the US where sale were flat. Overseas, Diebold felt the impact of a strong dollar with currency exchange rates working against it. The significant 32% droip in Latin America sales were blamed on the weakening of the Brazil real and other economic problems in Brazil. The company attributed a 12% drop in Asia-Pacific sales on the move in China -- at the government's behest -- to use of domestic ATM suppliers.

        <p>
   The company's profit slid some 36% to about $74 million in 2015 from $114 million in 2014. The lower revenue did its part, but Diebold also had higher costs in 2015, including some related to acquisitions.

   Diebold had to use more of its cash flow toward operations in 2015 finishing the year with $31 million, compared to $189 million in 2014. Cash flow was affected by less income from continuing operations, higher working capital, and reductions in deferred revenue.

   Diebold's acquisition (it closed in August 2016) of Wincor Nixdorf doubles revenue to more than $5 billion. The deal open Europe to Diebold and, on the other hand, opens the US to Wincor Nixdorf products. Diebold positions the merger as a match between companies with strong services and software components, areas that Diebold is emphasizing as it changes its business model from a hardware orientation to one focused on software. The Wincor Nixdorf board has approved the deal and the companies were waiting on shareholder and regulatory approval in early 2016. The companies expected the deal to conclude in summer 2016.

   German immigrant Charles Diebold formed safe and vault maker Diebold Bahmann in Cincinnati in 1859. The Chicago Fire of 1871 gave the company an unexpected boost: All 878 of its safes in the area (and their contents) survived the inferno. The company relocated in 1872 to North Canton, Ohio, where it was incorporated in 1876. During the next two decades, it also made jails, trapdoors for gallows, and padded cells for asylums. In the 1930s Diebold helped develop a tear gas system for bank lobbies, made in part to deter the notorious John Dillinger.
  </p>
        <p>
   Compelled to diversify after the Great Depression, Diebold made seven major acquisitions between 1936 and 1947, including bank and office equipment firms and other safe makers. WWII government arms contracts helped boost the company's sales from about $3 million per year to $40 million in 1942. Two years later former Prohibition G-man Eliot Ness (immortalized on television and in films in
   <i>
    The Untouchables
   </i>
   ) joined Diebold's board, later becoming chairman and overseeing the 1946 takeover of York Safe, which was the largest US safe maker before the war.
