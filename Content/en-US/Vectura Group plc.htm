   Biopharmaceutical company Vectura Group strives to be a breath of fresh air to patients with respiratory ailments. The company develops inhalable drug therapies and inhaler devices for the treatment of asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It makes inhalable products for a select few non-respiratory diseases, as well. Vectura's pipeline includes about 10 therapies that are in middle- and late-stage development, but the company also earns royalties off of drug products that it markets through licensing agreements with pharmaceutical companies including
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="114003">
    Novartis
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="132760">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   . Vectura plans to merge with
   <company id="57592">
    SkyePharma
   </company>
   , another firm with a focus on breathing difficulties.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Of the company's five marketed products, three are designed for treatment of non-respiratory diseases, such as hemophilia and surgical adhesions. Such products include drugs to treat hemophilia, kidney disease, and post-surgical adhesions. The other licensed products treat asthma.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's non-marketed pipeline is also dominated by asthma-related drug candidates, but the pipeline contains candidates to treat neurological disorders like migraines and Parkinson's disease, as well. Vectura develops these candidates through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations. Such partnerships, which are common in the industry, enable all companies involved to share resources and costs in the otherwise expensive development process.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its core drug development and licensing focus, Vectura also makes various inhaler devices that it markets under its Clickhaler brand and other names. Its inhalers are typically packaged and distributed with its drugs, but it also distributes stand-alone inhalers.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its future growth strategy, Vectura intends to remain focused on its core respiratory treatments and inhaler technologies, but it will also continue to develop neurological treatments. It plans to invest in development of some of its own drugs and is open to in-licensing (acquiring drugs and technologies from other biopharmaceutical companies) or pursuing acquisitions of related businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vectura has collaborations and license agreements with the likes of

   . For example, it partnered with Novartis to commercialize Ultibro Breezhaler and with Baxter to commercialize of Advate and Adept.

   The US accounted for 40% of total revenue in 2014. The UK represented 10%, excluding a 50% contribution from the rest of Europe.

  <p>
   Revenue increased 59% to £58 million in fiscal 2015 (ended March). This rise was primarily driven by increased royalties on recently released products (Seebri Breezhaler, Ultibro Breezhaler, Incruse Ellipta, Relvar/Breo Ellipta) as well as significant milestone achievements (for example, it received an upfront payment upon entering an agreement with Janssen for the development of novel anti-asthma therapies). Increased development services and device sales also contributed to the growth. The upward trend is expected to continue in coming years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vectura made a profit for the first time in several years in fiscal 2015. That year it netted £3.7 million, thanks to the higher revenue and an increase in tax benefits. Cash flow from operations totaled £8 million, versus a net outflow in fiscal 2014.

  <p>
   As its collaboration deals add up, the company is focused on expanding its development portfolio and building on its existing portfolio. For example, in 2015 Vectura forged a partnership with Novartis to develop a new inhaled powder for asthma patients; it also teamed up with Janssen to develop anti-inflammatory therapies for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Also that year it partnered with a non-disclosed US company to develop and license VR506, a clinical asthma monotherapy. The company hopes to strengthen these key relationships with other firms, ensuring that the partnerships' management and governance is effective and that long-term value is delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Vectura agreed to join forces with fellow asthma treatment specialist
   <company id="57592">
    SkyePharma
   </company>
   . After the merger closes, SkyePharma shareholders will own 42% of the combined group (which will be led by Vectura CEO James Ward-Lilley and chairman Bruno Angelici).

   In 2014 Vectura acquired private German pharmaceutical firm Activaero, which focuses on the development of treatments for respiratory diseases, for €130 million.
