   Gateway US Retail, doing business as eMachines, cranks out affordable computers. A subsidiary of
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   , eMachines now represents Gateway's value brand. eMachines' products include PCs and desktop displays. Marketed toward budget-conscious consumers, its desktop and notebook PCs are sold by a variety of electronics retailers. Former rival Gateway purchased eMachines for approximately $235 million in cash and stock. After the acquisition Gateway closed its retail stores and installed a number of eMachines executives in top management posts. eMachines' products are sold exclusively through retailers.

   The eMachines vision -- deliver a quality PC affordable to everyone -- started with Steven Dukker, and compared with his penchant for flying aerobatic planes and maintaining a private museum of cell phones, this endeavor seemed lucrative. Dukker had tried it before in the 1980s with PC Network, and in the early 1990s with PC Brand. (Both clone makers went bankrupt after brief success.) In 1993 Dukker tried it yet again unsuccessfully at Compudyne, CompUSA's retail PC division. Convinced the market was finally ready for his idea, Dukker quit his job at Computer City to start eMachines in 1998.

   Meanwhile, in a tanked Asian economy, PC maker
   <company id="58428">
    TriGem Computer
   </company>
   and monitor specialist Korea Data Systems (KDS) had idle factories. For his lowball pricing model to be profitable, Dukker needed high-volume, low-margin manufacturing. It was a match made in South Korea. Dukker negotiated $2 million in working capital and contract manufacturing from TriGem to supply the PCs and from KDS to build the monitors.

   eMachines shipped its first PC after two months. By the end of its first six weeks of sales, it had cornered 6% of the US retail market. The company wasn't the first to deliver a $500 PC, but it was the first to offer one with brand-name components, such as

   </company>
   hard drives and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   processors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered into a marketing agreement in 1999 with
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   , offering rebates to PC buyers who signed AOL service contracts. Trouble came when

    Compaq
   </company>
   (acquired by
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   in 2002) sued for 13 counts of patent infringement. Later in the season eMachines released eOne, a dead ringer for
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   's iMac, and Apple sued. (That litigation was settled in 2000.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 eMachines bought FreePC, which had caused a stir by offering consumers a free PC in exchange for viewing targeted advertisements. As part of the deal, Bill Gross (founder of FreePC and chairman of Web incubator idealab!) joined the eMachines board. eMachines went public in March 2000.

  <p>
   Dukker stepped down as president and CEO in 2001. Wayne Inouye, a veteran of retailer Best Buy, took over the helm. Later that year the company cut 16% of its workforce. Then the company was acquired for about $160 million by director Lap Shun Hui through a holding company.

   In 2004

   acquired eMachines for approximately $235 million in cash and stock. The deal included the promotion of Inouye to CEO of Gateway, a position he held until his resignation in 2006.
