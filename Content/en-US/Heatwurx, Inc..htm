   Heatwurx provides a way to fix cracks and potholes in the roadway not by just laying more asphalt but by repairing them through the use of plenty of heat. The company manufactures machinery that recycles broken asphalt at temperatures above 300° F. with infrared heating equipment that is electrically powered. Heatwurx claims it is an environmentally friendly method by virtue of its reuse of distressed pavement and the lack of need to transport material from asphalt plants. It incorporated in early 2011 and is a development-stage company with negligible sales. In late 2012 Heatwurx filed an IPO initially aiming to raise $7.6 million.

        <p>
   From the proceeds of the initial public offering, Heatwurx plans to generate a dealer network, to conduct research and development, to protect its intellectual property, to pay executive salaries and benefits, and to reserve any remaining for general corporate purposes.

   Heatwurx currently manufactures three products. One is an attachable asphalt processor, which repairs and invigorates existing asphalt in place. Another is a boxlike electric infrared heater that makes troubled asphalt pliable enough to be reused. The third is a seam heater, a heavy piece of machinery that heats the edge of newly laid asphalt.

   The company considers its revenues to be immaterial so far (less than $180,000 a year) as it remains in a startup stage. Funds have come from a small group of investors in private placements.

        <p>
   The company views its most promising customers to be government, contractors, real estate businesses, and parking lot owners. It intends to enter into distribution agreements with other companies and provide training in the use of its equipment to those partners as well as to customers and government agencies.
