   Evonik Degussa likes a chemical reaction, or a least a good reaction to its chemical products. The German giant operates as the chemical unit of
   <company id="158909">
    Evonik Industries
   </company>
   and groups those operations in a half dozen units. The largest division makes industrial chemicals like chlorides, peroxides, and propylene derivatives. Evonik Degussa's inorganic materials unit makes silicon products for solar energy applications and carbon black. Evonik Degussa is the world's largest maker of specialty chemicals, and serves the automotive, pharmaceutical, and coatings industries. German coal firm
   <company id="92224">
    RAG
   </company>
   had owned what was then just plain Degussa until the 2007 spinoff of most of its businesses into a new entity, Evonik Industries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in three segments: technology specialties, consumer solutions, and specialty materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   It makes superabsorbents and additives for personal care products, feed additives and active pharmaceutical ingredients (or APIs), and lubricant additives and additives for the paints and coatings industry. Evonik Degussa's performance polymers unit makes specialty acrylic products including its best known brand, Plexiglas.

   Any company would love to operate a business with a license to print money, and that's just how Degussa AG started. In 1840 the South German states and the Free City of Frankfurt formed the Frankfurt Mint. Director Friedrich Roessler opened a private precious metals refinery within the mint and a chemical engineering lab nearby.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the Austro-Prussian War (1866), Frankfurt ceased to be independent, and Roessler lost his refinery. He soon bought another, however, and combined it with his chemical business. His sons ran the business, which was called Friedrich Roessler Söhne (Friedrich Roessler Sons). In 1871 the coins of the former German states were replaced by currency (the mark) of the new German Empire. Friedrich Roessler Söhne converted to a joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) in 1873, and its name became Deutsche Gold-und Silber-Scheideanstalt vormals Roessler (German Gold and Silver Refinery, formerly Roessler).
  </p>
  <p>
   Degussa entered the commercial market in 1879 by making bright gold for china and glass. The company expanded its chemicals business in 1898 when it opened a plant in Rheinfelden for making active oxygen and peroxide compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foreign expansion was impossible during and immediately after WWI, so Degussa grew domestically. New business lines included organic chemistry (1930), carbon black for tires (1932), and pharmaceuticals (1933).
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII left Degussa in shambles. The company didn't begin to recover until the early 1950s when it reconstructed the Rheinfelden plant and built a hydrogen cyanide factory in Wesseling, Germany. Degussa spent the 1960s and 1970s rebuilding.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s Degussa expanded its carbon black business into France, Italy, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden. It consolidated its pharmaceutical operations to form Asta Pharma in 1987. German energy company VEBA AG (a predecessor of Hüls AG) bought a 36% stake in Degussa in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hüls AG, founded in 1938 as Chemische Werke Hüls GmbH, manufactured Buna (a synthetic rubber) for the Nazi war effort. The company also made chlorine, antifreeze, and other chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1943 Hüls' factories were bombed; production did not resume until the next year. The Potsdam agreement banned Buna production in Germany, so Hüls looked to new products (softening agents, gases, colorings, and antifreeze). When the Korean War broke out, the allies permitted Hüls to make Buna again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allied control ended in 1953, and Hüls became a joint stock company, of which VEBA and Bayer owned nearly equal amounts. In 1979 VEBA bought Hüls outright. Operations broadened in the 1980s to include sludge burning and manufacturing powdered rubber. In 1985 Chemische Werke Hüls changed its name to Hüls AG. It merged with Degussa AG in 1999 to form Degussa-Hüls AG. Later that year Degussa-Hüls sold Vestolit, its PVC business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Majority-owner VEBA merged with German conglomerate VIAG AG in 2000 to form
   <company id="43005">
    E.ON AG
   </company>
   . As a result, Degussa-Hüls merged with SKW Trostberg, VIAG's specialty chemicals unit. The company then changed its name back to Degussa AG. Degussa combined its interests in precious metals and automotive catalysts to form Degussa Metals Catalysts Cerdec (dmc2). In 2001 Degussa acquired
   <company id="90243">
    Laporte
   </company>
   (specialty chemicals, UK) in a $2 billion cash deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Degussa spent much of 2001-02 divesting noncore assets, including the precious metals unit Degussa Metals Catalysts Cerdec (sold to the US-based
   <company id="16661">
    OM Group
   </company>
   for $1.1 billion), its gelatins business, and Degussa Bank. As part of the cost-cutting measures, Degussa cut about 11% of its workforce in 2001-02. At the same time, the company built up its core businesses with the Laporte deal and by buying the admixtures business of Schwenk Zement and the 50% of Novara Technologies it did not already own. Novara, a manufacturer of high-purity synthetic silica glass based in Italy, was added to Degussa's aerosil and silanes business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company agreed to rid itself of all of its food ingredients businesses. The first move was the sale of its fruit preparations unit to the US private equity firm Speyside for an undisclosed sum. Degussa then announced, in 2005, that it would sell the remaining food ingredients businesses (texturant systems and flavoring) to
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   for about $670 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, the company moved to slim down and concentrate on its core polymers and materials operations when it sold its construction chemicals unit in 2006 to
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   for about $3.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   German energy company
   <company id="43005">
    E.ON
   </company>
   used to have a majority stake in Degussa but sold some of its shares to RAG in 2003. RAG bought out the remaining shares owned by E.ON in mid-2006; it then squeezed out the remaining shareholders and made Degussa a wholly owned subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The spinoff and formation of Evonik in 2007 came about in an effort to raise money and help fund the German government's takeover of the troubled coal industry's debts and liabilities. Evonik is owned by the government-controlled RAG Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to add silicone-based products to its portfolio, the company acquired the hanse chemie Group in 2011, including its subsidiaries hanse chemie AG and nanoresins AG. The Group produces high-quality components and raw materials for the manufacture of sealants and adhesives, molding and casting compounds. The deal allowed Evonik Degussa to enter the market for specialty silicones.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company opened a new manufacturing plant for precious-metal-powder catalysts in Shanghai, China, and acquired the precious metal powder catalysts business of Ravindra Heraeus Pvt. Limited in Rajasthan, India.
