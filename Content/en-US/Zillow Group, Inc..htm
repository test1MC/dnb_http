   Wonder how much your home is really worth? Zillow Group has the answer. Its website for homeowners and buyers provides a free estimated market value using its proprietary formula ("Zestimate") for millions of homes in America. Users enter an address into a search field, and Zillow Group computes the Zestimate and overlays it on a satellite map. The firm also provides home listings, neighborhood information, photos, purchase and sale data, and rental price estimates; offers mobile real estate apps; and sells subscription services that help find real estate agents and mortgage rates. The company went public in 2011 and changed its name to Zillow Group in 2015.
