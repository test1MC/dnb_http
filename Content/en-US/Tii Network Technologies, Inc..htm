   When lightening strikes, Tii products ensure your power stays on. Tii Network Technologies makes overvoltage surge protection devices used by telecommunications companies to protect their equipment during lightning strikes and power surges. Products include the Totel Failsafe brand modular station protectors and In-Line brand broadband coaxial cable protectors. Its Porta Systems line makes copper connectivity and surge protection products. Tii also makes gas tubes, custom network interface devices, and electronic products used to test the integrity of voice and data lines remotely. In 2012 Tii was acquired by Kelta, which had been the contract manufacturer for its products.

  <p>
   From 2010 to 2011, Tii experienced a 3% jump in revenue, from $54.5 million to $56.3 million. However, it wasn't enough to offset a 2011 net loss of $3.1 million, its first net loss in eight years. Tii was also hurt by an 8% decrease in gross profits, due mainly to cancelled orders, increased expenses, and an excess in inventory due to lower than expected demand for its Porta Systems copper products. International sales represented about 35% of 2011 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tii depends on a concentrated number of clients for its total sales; it collectively generated 50% of its total sales from its three top clients in 2011. The company continues to focus on the telephone operating industry as 98% of its total revenues derive from this sector.

  <p>
   Now that it is part of Kelta, Tii is better equipped to develop and produce newer products as well as oversee all the stages of its supply chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tii's growth strategy has centered on acquisitions. In 2011 it snapped up Frederick Fiber Optics, which became a subsidiary of the company and increased its position in the fiber optics market. Tii obtained the Copper Products Division of Porta Systems (now known as
   <company id="12248">
    North Hills Signal Processing
   </company>
   ) for about $8 million in cash, in 2010. The division designed and made connectivity blocks, housings, and surge protection modules for the telecom industry and sizably widened Tii's product portfolio.
