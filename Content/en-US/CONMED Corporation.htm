   Doctors and their patients get a charge out of CONMED's surgical equipment. The medical technology company develops and manufactures a wide range of electronic instruments such as electrosurgical systems, powered surgical instruments, and endoscopic devices. Its arthroscopic (joint surgery) products include reconstruction tools, scopes, implants, and fluid management systems. CONMED also manufactures patient monitoring products and handheld medical accessories such as scissors, sutures, and staplers. Brands include Hall, CONMED Linvatec, Concept, and Shutt. The company sells its products in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   CONMED's revenues are generated through three product lines: orthopedic surgery, accounting for more than half of all sales; general surgery, accounting for some 40%; and surgical visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Orthopedic surgery lines range from sports medicine products to powered surgical instruments. General surgery lines cover areas including advanced energy, endomechanical instrumentation, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and patient monitoring. Meanwhile, surgical visualization lines offer imaging systems, including 2DHD and 3DHD technologies, used in minimally invasive general surgery and orthopedic procedures.
  </p>

  <p>
   CONMED's expansion efforts have paid off in the international arena, as sales outside of the US have grown to account for half of the company's revenues. Major international markets include Europe, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific region. The company operates manufacturing plants in the US and Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, CONMED's surgical products are marketed to more than 6,000 hospitals, surgeons, and physicians in specialty fields such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, gastroenterology, and gynecology through the company's direct sales force, which is organized into five product-focused groups. They are also sold through via independent distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product sales abroad are conducted through local dealers and through direct sales. The company has sales and distribution facilities in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.

  <p>
   After slowly climbing, revenue has slipped over the past couple of years. In 2014 revenue declined 3% to $740 million as all three segments experienced declines. Product sales overall have dropped; in particular, procedure specific, fluid, and resection product sales have slowed down. Additionally, the company's discontinuation of its Cascade Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) line cut into earnings. However, sales of large bone and small bone handpieces rose that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income and cash flow from operations have also been on the decline. As a result of CONMED's lower revenues, net income fell 10% to $32 million in 2014. Operating cash flow fell 19% to $65 million.

  <p>
   The company strives to add new product offerings by conducting R&amp;D programs that aim to reduce the risks and costs associated with specific medical procedures. It also seeks to expand its device lines by forming collaborative partnerships with other device makers and pursuing strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, CONMED is working to increase foreign sales and broaden both its direct and indirect sales networks. The company looks to grow in markets with aging populations, where more medical care is needed. It also works to establish a stronger presence in the markets where it already operates (including the US), partly by establishing relationships with physicians to better understand their changing needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To combat the economic slowdown's impact on consumer spending for non-emergency surgical procedures, CONMED has been restructuring certain operational functions to control costs, including the consolidation of select manufacturing facilities and some distribution and administration functions. In the past three years, it has consolidated its Finland manufacturing operations to the US and moved Massachusetts and Colorado operations to other facilities in the US and Mexico.

  <p>
   Chairman Eugene Corasanti incorporated the company in 1970 as Consolidated Medical Equipment; in 1973 it began developing and selling disposable medical devices, including electrodes. Three years later it began making disposable electrosurgical ground pads. By 1978 Consolidated Medical began expanding overseas; it changed its name to CONMED in 1982. The company went public five years later and introduced its laparoscopic surgical devices in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   CONMED continued to grow by acquiring medical products companies. In 1993 it bought disposable electrode maker Andover Medical, and in 1995 bought Master Medical Corp., a maker of disposable intravenous sets. As HMOs began to seek one-stop medical suppliers with low prices, CONMED continued to diversify its equipment portfolio. Deciding it needed to boost overseas sales, CONMED in 1997 acquired the surgical-suction product line of
   <company id="10253">
    C. R. Bard
   </company>
   and the Linvatec unit from
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   . In 1997 prices for ECG electrodes dropped and CONMED posted a loss, despite restructuring its US sales force and ending certain dealer incentive programs. In 1998 the company closed its Lawrence, Kansas, manufacturing plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Linvatec in 1999 acquired
   <company id="11003">
    3M
   </company>
   's Powered Surgical Instrument business. CONMED launched several new products in 2000, including an arthroscopy camera that can be sterilized in an autoclave. It also bought certain assets of Imagyn's minimal access surgical business; in 2001 it bought the remaining assets of this business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2002, CONMED bought ValMed Corporation and NorTrex Medical. Both companies provide products and services for operating rooms and critical care departments. CONMED acquired CORE Dynamics in early 2003. CORE Dynamics' products complemented the company's laparoscopic surgical products. That same year CONMED bought Bionx Implants to add more "sports medicine" products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 CONMED acquired the Endoscopic Technologies division of C.R. Bard. To expand internationally, in 2008 it purchased a direct sales organization in Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, to reduce operational expenses during times of economic uncertainty, the company began restructuring its manufacturing organization. CONMED closed two New York plants and one Canadian plant and consolidated certain manufacturing operations to two remaining facilities in New York and a Mexico plant during 2009. In 2010 CONMED consolidated additional manufacturing functions from facilities in New York, Florida, and California to its Mexico plant.
