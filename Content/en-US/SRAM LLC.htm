   SRAM International keeps the wheels of commerce spinning as it makes and sells bicycle shifters, derailleurs, brakes, chains, pedals, power meters, and other cycling parts. Its components are used by bicycle manufacturers (some 65% of sales) and sold in the aftermarket to distributors or directly to high-end US bicycle retailers. Products are marketed under the SRAM (drivetrain systems), RockShox (suspension), Avid (brakes), Truvativ (cranks), and Zipp (wheelsets) brand names. The firm's products are sold worldwide (the US accounts for a mere 15%). SRAM International was founded in 1987 by president and CEO Stanley Day, Jr.

   In mid-2011 SRAM International filed to go public, hoping to raise up to $300 million to repay debt. However, it postponed its filing and plans to file again when the overall bicycle market improves.

   SRAM views its premium brands as its competitive edge. The firm prominently positions its branding, so as to link the products to great performance, and it continues to develop new products to maintain its credibility as an innovator in cycling components. Part of SRAM's product development process includes increasing its assortment of components, which makes them marketable to a broader range of bikes. Its parts can be used on bicycles from

   The company operates through two distribution channels: OEM and the aftermarket channels. For OEM, the company markets its products to bicycle companies as original equipment components for new bikes they can sell to consumers through independent bicycle retailers. For the aftermarket, SRAM sells a limited number of premium aftermarket products directly to independent bicycle retailers, who in turn sell them to consumers for replacements and upgrades.

   Acquisitions have been critical to SRAM's expanding product line. In 2011 the company acquired power meter maker Quarq Technology, which has a manufacturing facility in South Dakota, adding power measurement devices (a device on a bicycle that allows measuring of the power output of the rider) to SRAM's component selection. Power measurement is a growing segment of the cycling market.

  <p>
   A leader in the mountain bike world since acquiring suspension product maker RockShox, SRAM also targets the elite global road racing market. The company is looking to get a foothold in the niche with a gain of a 20% market share in the road racing market within several years.
