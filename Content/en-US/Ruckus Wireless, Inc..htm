    Brocade
   </company>

  <p>
   Ruckus' strategy includes increasing the use of Wi-Fi among its customer base, extending its sales network, and leveraging its products across its key markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ruckus spent to bolster its sales organization to reach new service providers and channel partners. It also invested in research and development by spending $15.4 million more in 2014 than 2013 (while maintaining R&amp;D at 23% of revenue) to develop new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   One new market Ruckus targeted in 2014 was small and medium businesses without IT support. The company's Xclaim Wi-Fi system, which is released in 2014, offers easily managed Wi-Fi services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014 Ruckus technology was deployed by Boingo Networks at dozens of US military installations to support social networking, gaming, voice over IP, and streaming video.
