   Planar Systems has no qualms about making a public display. The company makes custom, embedded, and video wall displays used in such applications as vehicle dashboards, instrumentation, security monitoring, and retail systems. Planar also sells desktop monitors and home theater systems. Its products -- marketed under the Planar, Clarity, and Runco brands -- include matrix and mosaic LCD systems, flat-panel displays, rear-project cube displays, touch monitors, and theater front-projection systems. The company serves consumers, as well as clients in the retail, industrial, transportation, and education industries, among others. It generates most of its sales in the US. Planar was bought by
   <company id="185398">
    Leyard Optoelectronic Co.
   </company>
   in late 2015.

  <p>
   Leyard, based in China, paid $157 million for Planar. The acquisition adds Planar's high-end home entertainment systems to Leyard's professional display systems. The purchase also extend Leyard's reach into North America through Planar's customer base and its sales and marketing operations. Planar is a subsidiary of Leyard.

   Planar sells directly to consumers and original equipment manufacturers, but is focused on reseller channels.

   The company has sales offices in China, Finland, France, Italy, and the US (in Oregon.) It has manufacturing plants France and the US (in Oregon); it closed a plant in Finland in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Planar Systems generates three-fourths of its sales in the US.

   Planar reported sales for fiscal 2013 (ended September) of $166 million, down about 3% from 2012. The net loss of $6.5 million that year was up from a loss of $16 million the previous year. Growth in the company's strong digital signage segment (driven by LCD video wall systems and LCD commercial flat panels) was not enough to offset an 18% decline in sales from its commercial and industrial segment as demand decreased for high-end home theater products and rear-project cubes. The dip in revenue was also related to the sale of its electroluminescent display business in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company has experienced a negative cash flow for the past three years. In 2013 net cash used in operating activities related to the overall net loss, increases in accounts receivable and inventories, and a decrease in other liabilities.

  <p>
   The company is increasingly focused on its fast-growing digital signage business as the commercial and industrial markets it serves are mature and don't offer the same opportunities. (In 2013 the digital signage business accounted for about 40% of sales; commercial and industrial made up the other 60%.)
  </p>
  <p>
   To that end, it has been divesting operations (such as the late 2012 sale of its electroluminescent business to Beneq for about $6.5 million) to sharpen its focus on digital signage and interactive display. The company also continues to target new specialty niche applications for digital signage such as large venue viewing, ruggedized outdoor displays, and touch applications.

  <p>
   Planar Systems was founded in 1983 by former
   <company id="11444">
    Tektronix
   </company>
   executives William Walker (former chairman of Planar), James Hurd (former president and CEO of Planar), and Christopher King (former EVP and CTO of Planar). Tektronix contributed its flat-panel display technology in return for an interest in Planar (since sold). The company opened the first US manufacturing facility for displays in 1984. In 1990 Planar expanded into Europe. The company went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Planar bought Tektronix's avionics display business in 1994. The next year the company won a contract worth more than $1 million to supply displays to the
   <company id="112381">
    University of Kansas Medical Center
   </company>
   . Also in 1995 Planar formed a joint venture with
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   to supply active-matrix LCDs for defense applications; the partnership demonstrated its flat-panel color avionics displays in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Planar gained a presence in the low-end market for displays by acquiring Standish Industries, a maker of inexpensive LCDs. The acquisition caused profits to plunge that fiscal year. The company diversified in 1998 into color displays and low-powered displays for cellular phones and other handheld devices. Hurd resigned as president and CEO that year for medical reasons, and former Tektronix executive Balaji Krishnamurthy replaced him. (Hurd died in 2000.) A restructuring to cut costs helped cause losses for fiscal 1999. In 2000 the company exited the defense sector and jumped into the desktop computer monitor market. The following year it closed its cathode-ray tube (CRT) business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Planar acquired DOME Imaging Systems, a privately held maker of medical imaging displays, for approximately $61 million. Balaji Krishnamurthy resigned in 2005 and was succeeded by Gerry Perkel, the former CEO of Merant (acquired in 2004 by
   <company id="58667">
    SERENA Software
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="104261">
    Clarity Visual Systems
   </company>
   for about $46 million in cash and stock in 2006. Clarity became Planar's Control Room and Signage business unit. The unit's command and control segment provided video walls for the broadcast, energy, government, industrial, security, and telecom sectors. Its digital signage business marketed large-format displays and sign management software. The following year itt bought the assets of high-end home theater specialist
   <company id="60811">
    Runco International
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bowed out of the medical imaging market when it sold its DOME imaging systems subsidiary to NDS Surgical Imaging in 2008. The divestiture moved Planar out of medical-grade diagnostic imaging. Also that year Planar sold certain assets of its CoolSign digital signage software business to the Bally Gaming unit of
   <company id="15006">
    Bally Technologies
   </company>
   and the remaining CoolSign assets to CS Software Holdings LLC.
