   Benziger Family Winery produces a wide variety of Bordeaux wines from its 168-acre, family-owned and -operated vineyards and winery, which is located in Glen Ellen, California. In addition to using its own fruit, Benziger also makes wines from grapes grown by a network of 50 other area vineyards. The company is dedicated to certified-sustainable, organic farming practices. It operates a research and education center to further these practices, which it shares with its longtime Sonoma County grower/partners. Benziger Family wines are distributed to retailers and restaurants throughout the US, as well as through its wine club and the company's Web site. Benzinger's first wines were produced in 1981.
