   Teligent (formerly IGI) is betting big on small things. It manufactures creams, liquids, and other topical products for drug and cosmetics companies using its microencapsulation technology. Teligent originally licensed the technology, dubbed Novasome, from drug firm
   <company id="47828">
    Novovax
   </company>
   . The Novasome process entraps and protects the active ingredients of various skin care products, moisturizers, shampoos, and fragrances, allowing for greater stability during storage and a more controlled release when used. The firm is examining further applications of the Novasome technology in food, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   Teligent also provides development, formulation, and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, OTC, and cosmetic industries. Specializing in topical products, the company offers formulation and methods development, analytical support, scale-up, commercial manufacturing, and packaging services. For its own products, Teligent develops, manufactures, and markets topical, injectable, complex, and opthalmic dosage forms.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has acquired 21
   <company id="144161">

   The company manufactures all of its labeled products in its 25,000-sq.-ft. facility in New Jersey. It leases an additional 11,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space in New Jersey and leases 10,000 sq. ft. of corporate office space, also in New Jersey.

   Teligent offers its products to pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, and cosmetic customers. In 2014, 31% of its net total sales were to three wholesale drug distributors:
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Revenue has been rising since 2012: It more than doubled to $18.2 million in 2013, and rose 85% to $33.7 million in 2014. The increases were due to the launch of the firm's generic pharmaceutical line as well as growing product sales to pharmaceutical customers. For the past decade, expenses exceeded revenue, but in 2014 the company became profitable, netting $5.2 million on the higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, operating cash outflow increased greatly to $3.9 million as more cash was used in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.

  <p>
   The company's growth efforts center around making and selling its generic pharmaceutical products, building up its contract manufacturing and development business, and adding to its portfolio of intellectual property and products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To facilitate that growth, it is planning to expand its facility in Buena, New Jersey. Teligent is also looking to strike up partnerships with contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacturing of its sterile injectable and opthalmic products.

  <p>
   In mid-2014, the company acquired ANDAs and New Drug Applications (NDAs) associated with 18 products from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   . It also bought ANDAs and NDAs associated with two opthalmic products as well as the exclusive right to acquire three additional approved injectable products from
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant
   </company>
   . The following year, it agreed to buy the assets of Canadian firm Alveda Pharmaceutical for C$47 million. Generic specialist Alveda markets nearly 40 injectable pharmaceutical products in Canada and has a pipeline of products under development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired assets and intellectual property, including one ANDA, for econazole nitrate cream 1%, which it launched in September of that year.
