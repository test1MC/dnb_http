   EnPro is a real professional when it comes to sealing systems, engineered products, and heavy-duty engines. The company operates from three segments: Sealing Products (comprising product lines including GST, Stemco, and Plastomer Technologies); Engineered Products (GGB, Compressor Products International), and Engine Products &amp; Services (Fairbanks Morse Engine). Products include gaskets, hydraulic components, self-lubricating bearings, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and heavy/medium-duty diesel and natural gas engines. These serve the automotive, aerospace, chemical and petrochemical and food processing, power generation, and semiconductor industries. More than 50% of sales are generated by the US.

   Customers are served through EnPro's business segments. Sealing Products comprises GST (Garlock Sealing Technologies), which produces gaskets, seals, compression packing, and rubber products. Stemco manufactures heavy-duty truck and trailer wheel-end component parts and systems, while Plastomer Technologies specializes in tapes, sheets, and shapes made principally from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).

   Bearing products, hydraulic and compressor components are manufactured by EnPro's Engineered Products segment though businesses that include GGP and Compressor Products International. Fairbanks Morse Engine markets diesel, natural gas, and dual fuel reciprocating engines for EnPro's Engine Products &amp; Services segment.

  <p>
   EnPro posted a 7% increase in net revenues for 2014, earning $1.22 billion, its highest total in its history. Its net income, however, decreased 20% from $27 million for 2013 to $22 million for 2014 primarily due to an asbestos settlement. In addition, the company's net cash inflow decreased sharply during 2013 and 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth was driven by a 19% surge in Power Systems sales and a 7% spike in Sealing Products sales. Sealing Products in 2014 was aided by additional demand in Stemco's North American heavy-duty truck market, Technetics Group's semiconductor and aerospace markets, and Garlock's China market.

  <p>
   EnPro has been growing through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired ATDynamics, a company offering aerodynamic products to the commercial trucking industry, for $29 million in cash. ATDynamics will become part of EnPro's Stemco division within the Sealing Products segment. ATDynamics makes products engineered to reduce fuel consumption in the global freight transportation industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company obtained Fabrico, a provider of mission-critical components for the combustion and hot path sections of industrial gas and steam turbines. The deal expanded EnPro's presence and scale in the land-based turbine seal and combustion market.

   </company>
   in 2002 after Goodrich acquired Coltec Industries. That same year EnPro was spun off from Goodrich as an independent company.
