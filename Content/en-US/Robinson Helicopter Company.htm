   The last "eye-in-the-sky" news report you saw might very well have come from a copter made by Robinson Helicopter. The company manufactures non-military helicopters used in applications such as police work, television news reporting, instrument flight training, radio traffic reporting, and emergency services. Robinson Helicopter offers three main product lines: the two-seat R22, the four-seat R44, and its newest model -- the five-seat R66 Turbine. The company also provides overhaul and maintenance services and safety courses for technicians and pilots. The privately held company is owned by the family of Frank Robinson, who founded the company in 1973.

  <p>
   Robinson has a network of more than 400 service centers, of which, around 125 are authorized dealers providing service and support. The company offers its helicopters in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and South Africa.

  <p>
   Robinson keeps a short lease on quality control; most manufacturing operations, including welding and machining, assembly, painting, and flight testing, are executed at the company's own plant. Since its founding in 1973, the company has produced more than 11,000 helicopters.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has bounced back since the recession. In 2012 it produced 517 helicopters, (286) R44s, (191) R66s, and (40) R22s. This was a 45% increase over its 2011 production, when it produced 356 helicopters. As in previous years, the majority of those sales (70%) went to foreign customers. Robinson in 2013 produced 523 helicopters.

  <p>
   New helicopter sales were relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012; however, revenues from product support and service continued to grow for the company. During 2013 Robinson saw a strong performance in South Africa, where the rand is at a five-year low and has fallen 30 percent against the dollar since 2012.
