   Woolrich has branched out beyond woolen textiles. As the US's oldest continuously operating apparel manufacturer and woolen mill, the outdoor apparel maker's products include men's and women's sportswear and outerwear, woolen fabrics, blankets, and home furnishings. Woolrich also licenses its name for the sale of furniture and accessories. Its branded products are marketed domestically and internationally. In addition, Woolrich supplies woolen yard goods to apparel and home furnishings makers. The firm distributes several million catalogs per year and sells via the Internet. The Rich family founded Woolrich in 1830.

   The company's woolen mill, located in Woolrich, Pennsylvania, is the oldest vertically-integrated woolen mill in operation in the US.

   The company sells its apparel and home goods at stores operated by other retailers across the US and Canada, online, and at the Woolrich Outlet Store in Woolrich, Pennsylvania.

   Woolrich has been losing market share to the likes of
   <company id="12390">
    Timberland
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40271">
    L.L. Bean
   </company>
   . In response it has refocused on marketing rather than manufacturing. To that end, the company shuttered its sewing facility in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania and shifted most of its production offshore. It has also licensed its brand to European producers. One of those had such a hit with the company's rugged jackets that, in a tail-wags-the-dog move, the licensee brought the upscale Woolrich John Rich &amp; Bros line to the US where it sells in high-end department stores. Also, in 2013 the company partnered with Portland Product Werks to create a shoe collection set to debut in fall 2014.

   The company's attempts at diversification include an ill-fated dip into the bottled-water business. More enduring ventures include branching into bedroom, dining room, living room, and family room furniture in partnership with

   ; and a line of outdoor furniture.

   Building on its military roots (the company made the wool blankets carried by Union troops in the Civil War), Woolrich has branched into "tactical" clothing, a line of pants, jackets, and vests designed for and in conjunction with military special ops, police officers, and private security guards. The clothing includes pockets designed to carry specific weapons and ammo, false bottoms and breakaway button panels for quick access to weapons carried under the clothing, special features for carrying concealed weapons. Woolrich counts the

   among its customers.
