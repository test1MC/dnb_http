  <p>
   In 2015 the company sold its Services segment, which offered general railcar repair and maintenance, inspections, parts sales, and railcar fleet management services.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   FreightCar America's revenues increased by 29% from $599 million in 2014 to $773 million in 2015. The growth was fueled by increased sales from its primary Manufacturing segment, attributable to increases in the number of railcars delivered, a higher mix of new versus rebuilt railcars, and favorable changes in its product mix of new railcars.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net income also skyrocketed from $6 million in 2014 to $32 million in 2015. This was attributed to a major gain on the sale of its railcar repair and maintenance services business and facilities.

  <p>
   FreightCar America focuses on diversifying the range of railcars produced, including covered hoppers, intermodal, and other non-tank car types. Its growth strategy depends in part on its continued development and sale of new railcar designs and design changes to existing railcars to penetrate new railcar markets and to expand or maintain its market share in its existing railcar markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold its railcar repair and maintenance services business for $20 million. Through that effort, the company increased its focus on its railcar manufacturing, parts, and leasing business.
