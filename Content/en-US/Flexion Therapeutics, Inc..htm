   Flexion wants to help its customers be more flexible. The development-stage company is working on anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatments for patients with osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its lead candidate combines an existing steroid with a polymer in a medication that gets injected at the joint to relieve pain and swelling. Flexion's other candidates are for post-operative pain and end-stage osteoarthritis.The polymer is the company's proprietary sustained-release ingredient that allows medication to stay where it's needed. The company owns the worldwide rights to commercialize its products once they gain regulatory approval. Flexion was formed in 2007 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Flexion raised $55 million in its public offering. It will use the funds for development and clinical trials for its three candidates.

   It intends to use its own sales force to woo orthopedists and rheumatologists in the US while pursuing development and distribution partnerships internationally.

  <p>
   As a development stage company, Flexion has yet to earn any revenue. At the end of 2013, it had an accumulated deficit of about $63 million. It expects the losses to continue "for the foreseeable future."

  <p>
   The company focuses on developing long-lasting pain relief without the side effects associated with oral or systemic medications. While its primary target is osteoarthritis, Flexion will also look for other pain applications where its products would have a significant advantage. Going forward it plans to retain the rights to its products in the US but seek commercialization partners in other countries.
