   Simpson sells its products through an extensive distribution system comprising dealer distributors supplying thousands of retail locations nationwide, contractor distributors, home centers, lumber dealers, manufacturers of engineered wood products, and specialized contractors such as roof framers. SST markets its products to the residential construction, light industrial, and commercial construction, remodeling, and do-it-yourself (DIY) markets.

  <p>
   The company's revenues climbed 6% from $752 million in 2014 to $794 million in 2015, its highest total in about seven years. The growth for 2015 was driven by a 10% spike in North America that were mostly due to an increase in sales volume and from acquisitions, primarily within the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits also jumped 7% from $64 million in 2014 to $68 million in 2015. Simpson's operating cash flow has fluctuated the last two years; after declining sharply in 2014, cash flow skyrocketed by 70% during 2015.

  <p>
   Simpson's long-term strategy has relied on capturing additional market share in both the wood construction and concrete construction product groups by continuing to invest in mobile and web applications for customers. It is also utilizing social media, blog posts, and videos to connect and engage with its customers and to help them do their jobs more efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2015, the company closed sales offices in China, Dubai and Thailand due to continued losses in these operations.
