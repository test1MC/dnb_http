   Milk + chocolate + coffee = the Strauss Group. A blending of confectionery company Elite Industries and dairy player Strauss Fresh Foods resulted in an operation that makes and sells a variety of retail food products, including fresh foods (dairy, salads, pre-cut vegetables), beverages (coffee, chocolate, juices, water), and snacks (candy, cookies, salty items). The company's coffee and chocolate business was so dominant in Israel that it turned to international markets for growth and it is now a player worldwide. Indeed, Strauss is the world's fifth-largest coffee company. Strauss Group (formerly Strauss-Elite) owns coffee businesses in Brazil and is a leading coffee provider in central and eastern Europe.

   The Strauss family bought its initial controlling share of Elite in 1997. The merged Strauss-Elite company was created in 2004. It then went on to sell its Excella chocolate factory to Spanish confectioner Zahor for about $8 million and purchase Israel's leading over-the-counter coffee and espresso chain, Coffee-To-Go. Later that year, the company announced that it would turn its cafes, located in Australia, the Far East, and Israel, into chocolate-drink bars, serving its Max Brenner premium chocolate brand. (The company opened is first Max Brenner Chocolate branch in New York City in 2006.)

   In 2005 the company announced it would focus its growth outside Israel. This strategy included its 2005 acquisition of Doncafe (roasted and ground coffee), which extends its reach into Serbia. The company also turned its eyes on Poland, where it bought the MK beverage brand and has become a dominant part of the coffee market.

   In 2007 Strauss formed a 50-50 joint venture with PepsiCo's, to form Sabra Dipping, a fresh dip and spread business. In 2011 the two firms extended the joint venture to do business outside of North America.
