  <p>
   Actuant's revenues have decreased the last two years. From 2015 to 2016, revenues dipped by 8% from $1.25 billion to $1.15 billion. The company also suffered a net loss of $105 million in 2016 mainly due to about $187 million it paid in impairment charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's core sales were down in 2016 as a result of challenging end market conditions in the global oil and gas markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also unfavorably impacted sales comparisons by $45 million, while fiscal 2016 acquisitions added $19 million of sales. Additionally, fiscal 2016 and 2015 results both included impairment charges related to the write-down of acquired goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, which reduced operating profit margins.

  <p>
   Acquisitions has been central to Actuant's growth strategy. In 2016 it acquired the Middle East, Caspian, and North Africa (MENAC) operations of Four Quest Energy for $60 million. Based in Dubai, UAE, FourQuest MENAC is an expert in the provision of pipeline and process services across the Caspian, the Middle East, and the North Africa regions. The deal strengthened Actuant's position within the integrity and maintenance services in the energy space.

  <p>
   From its founding in 1910 as American Grinder and Manufacturing, a maker of tool sharpeners, the business diversified into water and oil pumps for military vehicles during WWI, and later it expanded into hand tools. Renamed Blackhawk in 1925, the company sold off its hand-grinder line, exited the pump industry, and moved into hydraulic equipment in 1927. In 1955 Blackhawk sold its original line of hand tools.
  </p>
  <p>
   After taking the name Applied Power Industries in 1961, the enterprise became Applied Power, Inc., in 1973. It bought hydraulic-equipment makers Toyo Hydraulic Equipment and Electro-Hydraulic Controls in the 1980s. Applied Power went public in 1987, and a year later it bought Gardner Bender (established in 1959) from the Gardner family. In 1989 the company acquired Barry Wright Corporation (now Barry Controls).
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1990s Applied Power expanded into Mexico, Asia, and Europe. In 1997 it purchased electronic-enclosure maker C Fab Group of Dublin, Ireland, and Versa Technologies, a US conglomerate of industrial equipment makers. In 1998 Applied Power bought other enclosure makers, including ZERO, Vero Group, AA Manufacturing, Premier Industries, Rubicon Group, and certain assets of Performance Manufactured Products, Product Technology, and Brown Manufacturing. These acquisitions were primarily responsible for the doubling of Applied Power's sales in 1998. In 1999 the company announced that it was considering selling its industrial business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Applied Power switched gears and spun off its electronics enclosures business to shareholders as APW Ltd. Former Applied Power chairman and CEO Dick Sim became chairman of the remaining industrial group -- which was renamed Actuant Corporation the following year -- as well as chairman and CEO of APW. Barry Controls was sold to Hutchinson Worldwide, a unit of
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   . APW Ltd. filed for bankruptcy two years later.
