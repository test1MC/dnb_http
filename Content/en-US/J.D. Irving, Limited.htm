   Although its roots are in forest products, J.D. Irving (JDI) has really branched out. The conglomerate is active in retail, food processing, forestry, transportation, manufacturing, and shipbuilding. Its key products include lumber, consumer tissues (Scotties, Royale, Majesta), farm supplies, fertilizer, and storage management services (Cavendish). JDI also operates one of Canada's top home improvement retail chains (Kent), is a leading Canadian shipbuilder, provides logistics and transportation services, and produces manufactured commercial and industrial buildings. Established in 1882, family-owned JDI operates in Eastern Canada and the US and serves customers worldwide.

   . The Transportation and Logistics division provides trucking, courier, ocean towing, and other services through such subsidiaries as Sunbury Transport, NBM Railways, Atlantic Towing, and JDI Logistics, among others.

   JDI owns several shipyards and provides marine construction and repair through its Shipbuilding and Industrial Fabrication division. In addition to Kent home improvement stores, the company's Retail and Distribution division includes business-to-business wholesaler Chandler and truck and trailer dealership Universal Truck and Trailer. The company's Agriculture division operates through Cavendish and Juniper Farms, offering farm supplies, soil analysis, crop scouting services, and mulch products.

   JDI is eyeing growth primarily in the Atlantic Canada region. In early 2016, it announced the hiring of almost 8,000 manufacturing, engineering, shipbuilding, and other workers in this region and parts of the US by 2018. The hires are affiliated with a new $2.3 billion contract signed for the construction of six Arctic offshore patrol ships at Halifax Shipyard.

   In addition, years earlier, JDI announced it was investing $513 million in its mills across New Brunswick. The initiative was touted as the largest investment in a Canadian pulp mill since 1993, according to JDI leadership.
