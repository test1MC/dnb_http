   Linear has a system and it's sticking with it. The company manufactures access control systems, intercom systems, wireless security alarms and emergency response systems, as well as smoke and fire detection systems. It is a leading maker of radio frequency (RF) security and alarm systems for both the residential and commercial markets. Its Audio, Video, and Control group markets consumer electronics, such as music/communications systems, intercoms, and central vacuum systems. Founded in 1961, the company is a subsidiary of

   Its parent also uses acquisitions to beef up its core security software line. In 2013 Nortek purchased 2GIG Technologies, an integrated security systems manufacturer, for $135 million. The deal expanded Linear's expertise in providing smart home technology security products. It is keeping the 2GIG brand name.
