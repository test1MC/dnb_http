   The hills are alive with the sound of Muzak. Once the king of canned music, the company has been busy working to transform its image. Muzak, famous for its instrumental versions of pop tunes, has turned its focus away from the elevator rider and toward the consumer as it pumps original songs (with lyrics) into retail stores, restaurants, and bars, as well as hotels, offices, and factories. Its music is heard by some 100 million people daily. The company additionally provides music and marketing for telephone on-hold and in-store messaging. Founded in 1934, Muzak emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2010 and was acquired by in-store media specialist Mood Media Corporation in May 2011.

   George Squier patented a system for transmitting phonograph music over electrical lines in 1922. He sold the rights to utility North American Company, and together they formed a subsidiary to begin testing the system in Cleveland. In 1934 Squier coined the term Muzak ("muz" from music and "ak" from
   <company id="10500">
    Kodak
   </company>
   , his favorite company) before he died that year. The company moved to New York in 1936.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1930s Muzak was used in then-newfangled elevators to calm riders (hence the term "elevator music"). In 1938 Warner Bros. bought the company but sold it the next year to US Sen. William Benton. Experiments showed that music could increase productivity, and during WWII Muzak systems were installed in factories.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war the company continued to work on "stimulus progression" -- the idea of regulating worker productivity through music. In 1972 Teleprompter bought the company and began distributing its music via satellite. Westinghouse bought Teleprompter in 1981 and sold it to Marshall Field V in 1986. Field bought Seattle-based Yesco, a producer of "foreground" music for retailers, and merged the two the next year. Led by Yesco's management, Muzak began updating its sound to appeal to baby boomers. Field sold Muzak to its management and New York investment firm Centre Capital in 1992.

   In 1996 the company called off plans to go public. Saddled with debt from the buyout and mounting losses, it ousted CEO John Jester in 1997 and replaced him with Bill Boyd, who refocused Muzak on its core music business. During 1998 the company began buying competitors and its own independent affiliates. In 1999 it merged with Audio Communications Network, a Muzak franchiser owned by media investment firm ABRY Partners, and the Muzak affiliates owned by Capstar (Capstar later became part of AMFM, which was subsequently acquired by radio station owner

   ). Later that year Muzak made a string of acquisitions, including Data Broadcasting's (now
   <company id="42114">
    Interactive Data Corporation
   </company>
   ) InStore Satellite Network, a music and ad business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Muzak moved its headquarters to Fort Mill, South Carolina. Extending its acquisitive streak, the company acquired Telephone Audio Productions (audio marketing and messaging) and Muzak franchisee Vortex Sound Communications.

   (now AOL) alum Lon Otremba, who joined the company as president in 2003, was announced as the new CEO in 2004. Also in 2004 he announced the addition of 150 jobs at the company's headquarters. However, Otremba stepped down in 2005, citing a desire to pursue additional business interests. Greg Rayburn, a former senior managing director from FTI Palladium Partners (a division of
   <company id="51562">

   </company>
   ), replaced him that same year. Rayburn left Muzak in mid-2006. He was replaced by Stephen Villa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Muzak filed for Chapter 11; it emerged from bankruptcy the following year after reducing its massive debt and hired Steven Richards as its new CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2011, a new era began for Muzak when it was acquired by Mood Media Corporation for $345 million.
