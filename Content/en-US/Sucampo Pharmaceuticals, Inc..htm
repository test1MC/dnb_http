   Sucampo Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on unmet medical needs around the world. Sucampo works with a group of compounds derived from fatty acids called prostones; it uses prostones in the development of therapies for the treatment of age-related gastrointestinal, respiratory, vascular, and central nervous system disorders. It has two

   -approved products: AMITIZA, which treats chronic constipation in adults and irritable bowel syndrome in adult women, and Rescula for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Sucampo's pipeline has other candidates in pre-clinical and early stage clinical development to treat a range of conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company operates through subsidiaries based in the US, the UK, Switzerland, and Japan. It organizes its business into three reportable segments: the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sucampo makes most of its money from collaborations and licensing agreements which provide royalties, upfront payments, development milestone payments, and development reimbursements, as well as product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMITIZA is marketed in the US through a collaboration with

   .
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott
   </company>
   in Japan helped to develop and commercialize the drug for that market (where it was introduced in late 2012). The company received more than 80% of its income from its relationship with Takeda and another 18% from Abbott Japan Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMITIZA is also in clinical trials to measure its effectiveness in alleviating opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, a common post-surgical complication. While Rescula is already approved as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension, the company also intends to test the drug as a possible treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sucampo routinely enters into agreements with third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to oversee clinical research and development studies provided on an outsourced basis and to assist in other research and development activities.

  <p>
   The company generates most of its earnings in the Americas, which contributed 65% of total revenue in 2014. Asia contributed 28% of total revenue, and Europe brought in the final 7%.

  <p>
   Net revenue has generally been on the rise in recent years, with the exception of 2011 when it fell to $54.8 million. In 2014 net revenue rose 29% to $115.5 million (versus $89.6 million in 2013), as all three geographical segments saw growth. US sales of AMITIZA increased, bringing royalty revenue up; co-promotion, contract, and collaboration revenues also increased as the company furthered its efforts to sell AMITIZA in particular. Meanwhile, higher global sales of AMITIZA and higher US sales of Rescula led to an increase in product sales revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in net revenue drove net income up 87% to $13.1 million in 2014. Cash flow from operations increased 833% to $30.9 million, versus the $5.4 million cash outflow reported in 2013.

  <p>
   With the modest goal of becoming the leading biopharmaceutical company, Sucampo is focused on strengthening its clinical development capabilities, broadening its product pipeline while also pushing for growth of its flagship product AMITIZA.

  <p>
   In late 2015 Sucampo bought Japanese firm R-Tech Ueno for $278 million. R-Tech (which was controlled by the founders of Sucampo) manufactures AMITIZA for Sucampo and its partners. Acquiring the firm benefits Sucampo by providing it with more control over the manufacturing and distribution of AMITIZA. R-Tech also has a number of drug candidates in development in areas including opthalmology, gastroenterology, and inflammatory diseases.
