   Pinnacle Frames and Accents has plenty of frames, but what it needs is a prettier picture. Once home to nearly 20 retailing and manufacturing companies, the company now makes and markets photo frames and albums under its own brand name and private labels, in addition to other décor. The firm's Gallery Solutions brand features matted wall frames in mix-and-match styles while its Snap collection, targeted to cost-conscious digital photographers, consists of clear and magnetic frames, key chains, and coasters. Pinnacle's products are available at major retail stores in the US and Canada, including

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   . The company, formerly named Tandycrafts, is owned by investment firm Newcastle Partners.

  <p>
   Tandy Corporation, which began in 1919 as shoe-leather supplier Hinkley-Tandy, expanded into leather crafts and hobby stores in the 1950s and added the Radio Shack chain in 1963. In 1975 Tandy spun off its non-Radio Shack businesses into two separately traded companies: Tandy Brands (leather products) and Tandycrafts (leather retailing, along with the Color Tile do-it-yourself home-improvement products chain).
  </p>
  <p>
   Tandycrafts spun off Color Tile in 1979, bought a majority stake in the owner of 10 Cargo furniture stores in 1982, and acquired the five-store Joshua's Christian Stores chain (books, music, gifts) in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cargo grew to more than 100 stores but lost money and was pared down to nearly half that number in the early 1990s. Tandycrafts bought several small companies during that time, including Sav-On Office Supplies in 1991, J-Mar Associates (inspirational gifts) and Nocona Belt (leather accessories) in 1992, Impulse Designs (now Pinnacle Art &amp; Frame) and Birdlegs (activewear) in 1993, and Rivertown Button Company (promotional buttons) in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales at Joshua's and the leather stores began to lag in 1995, and the next year Tandycrafts underwent a major restructuring. It closed and sold several businesses and hired a new CEO, Michael Walsh. The Cargo furniture chain was sold to management and employees in 1997. The next year the company sold the money-losing, 56-store Joshua's chain to rival Family Christian Stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Tandycrafts closed its leather crafts stores and manufacturing operations, taking a charge of up to $22 million for the fiscal year. It also bought back Cargo and its 26 stores. Tandycrafts later announced plans to refocus its efforts on its home décor operations. To that end, in June 2000 the company sold its 41-store Sav-On Office Supplies chain and the J-Mar part of its gift division. Licensed Lifestyles and Rivertown Button were sold a month later, and Tandy Leather Direct unit (leather and leather craft products sold via the Internet and mail order) followed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Angry shareholders, upset over losses (Tandycrafts has lost more than $50 million in five years, and its stock price has plummeted from a high of $26 in 1993 to $1.38 in November), mounted a proxy fight in 2000; they gave up the fight after gaining half the seats on the board. Tandycrafts sold its Cargo Furniture chain to Pier 1 Imports in early 2001, leaving it with only Pinnacle, which has decided to exit the unprofitable framed art business. In May 2001 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In January 2003 Tandycrafts sold substantially all of its assets to an affiliate of Newcastle Partners and began operating under the company name, Pinnacle Frames and Accents.
