  </p>
  <p>
   The company has maintained a positive trend in net income since 2012. In 2014 the Vestas' net income increased by 578% due to higher revenues, lower expenses, and gains from the establishment of an offshore joint venture. These gains were partially offset by increase in administrative expenses and income taxes.

  <p>
   In 2014 Vestas' operating cash flows decreased by 10%, due to smaller improvements in working capital.

    DONG Energy
   </company>
   has ordered for testing. Another important part of Vestas' strategy is the Key Account Management group, which includes the appointment of account managers for all key customers. The company credits the group with obtaining an agreement for about 2,000 MW with

    EDF

   . The group also scored a 550-plus MW order from E.ON. The company has additionally established the Global Solutions and Services group for pre-sales and aftermarket services and a Power Plant Solutions group to provide planning and other services for the integration of wind energy with the power grid.
