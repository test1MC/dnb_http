   Don't feel bad if KLA-Tencor points out your flaws. It's probably going to save you a ton of money -- if you make computer chips. The company is one of the world's largest makers of process control equipment for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics as well as other high tech industries. It makes yield management systems that monitor and analyze materials during the entire fabrication process, inspecting reticles (which make circuit patterns) and measuring microscopic layers. KLA-Tencor has long dominated the market for equipment that inspects semiconductor photomasks and reticles. An agreement for KLA-Tencor to be acquired for $10.6 billion by
   <company id="13941">
    Lam Research
   </company>
   was scrapped in 2016 because of antitrust concerns.

  <p>
   The acquisition by Lam Research would have created one of the biggest semiconductor equipment makers in the industry with combined revenue reaching $8 billion. Proposed in October 2015, the deal has been held up by competition concerns expressed by competing companies and government regulators. The companies called off the deal a year later.

   KLA-Tencor reports in four segments that reflect its product segements. Wafer inspection generates 43% of revenue, followed by Global Service and Support, 28%, Patterning, 26%, and Other, 3%. Overall, equipment accounts for 75% of revenue and service accounts for the rest.

  <p>
   Taiwan is the company's single largest market, accounting for 30% of its sales. Overall, Asia is the source of about 70% of KLA-Tencor's sales. North America contributes about 18%. The California-based company has manufacturing facilities in Belgium, California, China, Germany, Israel, and Singapore.

   Semiconductor manufacturers Micron Technology and

   . account for 18% and 10% of KLA-Tencor's. The company makes most of its sales through its direct sales force, which is in Asia, the US, and Europe.

  <p>
   KLA-Tencor's 2016 (ended June) sales rose 6% from 2015 from better sales in all its product lines and its major geographic markets. Demand for inspection products from chipmakers and expansion of chip factories in Asia drove revenue higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit soared 92% to $704 million n 2016 from 2015. In 2016 KLA-Tencor didn't carry a loss for debt extinguishment that dragged it down in 2015. Research and development spending was lower in 206 than 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations came in at about $1.3 billion in 2016, up from $606 million in 2015.

  <p>
   KLA-Tencor is a leader in its niche; it tries to position itself as a one-stop shop for its customers' yield management needs, particularly by complementing its technology offerings with consulting services and software, as well as refurbished equipment.The one-stop shop is even more so with the acquisition by Lam Research. The combined company can serve even more of the needs of chip makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   KLA-Tencor's software includes products for factory-wide yield management and for test floor automation and control. Besides its core focus on semiconductor customers, KLA-Tencor products are also used in manufacturing for other related nanoelectronics, LEDs, data storage, solar cell applications, automotive, and general materials research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chip makers are laying down more complex patterns on chips and adding steps to the production process. KLA-Tencor is keeping up with the complexity with new equipment to test for flaws more often and find them when they occur. The company's research and development activities in 2015 involved developing process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes and new back-end packaging techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
   KLA-Tencor has reduced research and development spending in recent years. It was $481 million in 2016, compared to to $530.6 million in 2015 and $540 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 and 2016, the company introduced new inspection and packing products. Inspection products included the 3900 Series and the 2930 Series broadband plasma optical inspectors, the Puma 9980 laser scanning inspector, the CIRCL5 all-surface inspection cluster, the Surfscan SP5XP un patterned wafer inspector, and the eDR7280e-beam review and classification tool. The new products can detect defects at smaller manufacturing sizes.

   While acquisitions were a part of KLA-Tencor's strategy in the past, it made just one small one in 2014. It bought assets of a privately held make of software for semiconductor equipment for $18 million.

  <p>
   In the semiconductor industry's early years, chip defects rendered about half of some product runs unusable. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kenneth Levy -- who helped develop image processing equipment pioneer Computervision (later merged into
   <company id="14647">
    PTC Inc.
   </company>
   ) -- and Robert Anderson founded KLA Instruments in 1975. ("KLA" originally stood for Kenneth Levy Associates.) Their goal was to develop inspection equipment to improve semiconductor factory yields. In 1978 KLA introduced a first-of-its-kind inspection system that employed advanced optical and image processing technology to test the templates used to etch circuit designs onto silicon wafers. It cut inspection time from eight hours to about 15 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
   KLA went public in 1980; within two years it had introduced wafer inspection and wafer metrology systems. As chip yields jumped, so did KLA's sales, shooting past $60 million by mid-decade. When increased competition left US demand faltering, Levy began targeting markets in Europe and Asia. By 1987, 40% of KLA's sales came from those two regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Levy named former
   <company id="10723">

   </company>
   executive Kenneth Schroeder president in 1991 to take more day-to-day control of the company. Anderson by then had given up his executive duties; he retired in 1994. Also in 1994 KLA bought Metrologix, a maker of advanced electron beam measurement equipment. In 1995 it launched an electron beam-based system that doubled wafer production yields.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking an edge in an increasingly splintered market, the company merged with Tencor Instruments (and changed its name to KLA-Tencor) in 1997. The $1.3 billion deal created a company with the broadest line of wafer inspection equipment, film measurement systems, and yield management software in the industry. Czechoslovakian Karel Urbanek (1938-1991) started Tencor in 1976 to make semiconductor measurement and test instruments. Tencor's first product was the Alpha-Step, a film layer profiler, but the company became known for a system that detected and analyzed wafer defects measuring as small as 1/100,000th the width of a human hair. Tencor went public in 1993.
