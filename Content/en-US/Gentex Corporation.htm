   Gentex would agree that competitors never look better than when they are in the rearview. The company focuses on designing, making, and marketing interior and exterior auto-dimming rearview mirrors and camera-based driver-assist systems for the automotive market. It serves customers worldwide, but its largest base includes big carmakers such as
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   . Its products are found as standard or optional features on hundreds of vehicle models. To a lesser degree, Gentex also makes dimmable aircraft windows found on commercial aircraft and fire protection products -- including smoke detectors, fire alarms, and signaling devices -- primarily for commercial buildings.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Operating through five manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Gentex has additional offices in the US, Korea, Canada, France, Mexico, China, Japan, Sweden, Hungary, and the UK. Unsurprisingly, the company's largest markets are the leading car production countries of the US (32% of net sales), Germany (19%), and Japan (10%).

  <p>
   The company's fire protection products are primarily sold to domestic distributors and OEMs of fire and security systems. Within the aerospace industry, Gentex has delivered dimmable aircraft windows to the production line of
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing

   <company id="103890">
    Hawker Beechcraft
   </company>
   for its business-class Beechcraft King Air 350i airplane. Gentex's dimmable window systems are marketed by PPG Aerospace under the brand name Alteos Interactive Window Systems.

   The company's top customer is
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen

   (14% of sales). Other major clients have included

    Chrysler

   , and

   . Gentex markets its products directly to OEMs, as well as through Tier 1 suppliers.

   The company has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues jumping 17% from $223 million in 2013 to $289 million in 2014. Profits also surged 29% from $223 million to $289 million over that same time period. (Both 2014 totals counted as historical milestones for the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was fueled by increased sales from automotive products and other products. Automotive net sales spiked due to its acquisition of HomeLink and an 11% increase in auto-dimming mirror shipments. Dimmable aircraft window sales also increased 54% year over year and fire protection sales surged by 4%.

  <p>
   To boost production capacity and support growth in its core geographic territories, Gentex is busy making investments in its facilities. It constructed a new technology center adjacent to its headquarters in Zeeland, Michigan, and it is making a number of facility upgrades and renovations. The investments support the company's optimistic sales forecast and anticipated growing demand for high-tech, camera-based automotive products, such as Gentex's rear camera displays, which consist of a liquid crystal display (LCD) that works with a rear-mounted video camera to provide a rear view while backing up, and its SmartBeam high-beam assist system, which uses a camera-on-a-chip to maximize forward lighting while eliminating the task of turning the high beams on and off manually. Both are integrated into Gentex auto-dimming mirrors.
  </p>

  <p>
   Gentex has also achieved milestone revenues due to acquisitions. In 2013 it obtained HomeLink, a wireless vehicle/home communications product that enables drivers to remotely activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting, security systems, entry gates, and other radio frequency convenience products. Gentex integrated HomeLink into its interior auto-dimming rearview mirrors product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Gentex acquired Helmet Integrated Systems Ltd (HISL). Headquartered in the UK, HISL provides helmets, communications equipment, and respiratory protection for civil, defense, security and industrial personnel. The addition of HISL accelerated Gentex's international growth by providing it immediate access to new markets, particularly within the UK.

   At 23, Fred Bauer had already started and sold one company before founding Gentex in 1974. A maker of dual-cell photoelectric smoke detectors, Gentex found its niche with products that had fewer false alarms and could detect slow, smoldering fires. The company went public in 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Gentex entered the automotive market with the first electromechanical dimming mirror to beat the glare of nighttime driving. (Electrochromic technology uses electricity to darken a material.) The product was soon snapped up by
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   to the tune of 200,000 units a year. Five years later Gentex debuted the interior Night Vision Safety (NVS) electrochromic automatic-dimming mirror. Exterior NVS mirrors were introduced in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gentex entered an agreement in 1992 with Japan's
   <company id="159487">
    Ichikoh Industries
   </company>
   to market mirrors in Asia. The following year it established a European office. Returning to its roots, Gentex in 1993 introduced an AC/DC smoke detector. That year rival Donnelly paid $3.6 million in damages for infringing on Gentex's electrochromic mirror patent. Gentex formed a German subsidiary, Gentex GmbH, in 1994 and two years later opened an $8 million plant near its Michigan headquarters.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Gentex developed a compass mirror, a headlamp control mirror, and a mirror that displays outside temperature. The next year it bought a stake in Photobit, a developer of pixel sensor technology, and sold more than 3.3 million NVS mirrors. In 1999 DaimlerChrysler agreed to equip all its models with Gentex mirrors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding to its manufacturing capacity, Gentex in 2000 completed the construction of a $12 million mirror manufacturing plant in Zeeland, Michigan, and made plans to build a factory in Europe. Adding more equipment to rearview mirrors paid off when GM announced that it would place the
   <company id="104786">
    OnStar
   </company>
   communications system in Gentex's interior mirrors in 1 million automobiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Gentex announced that it would bring its new SmartBeam product to market by mid-2004. SmartBeam allowed drivers to use their bright lights more easily, because the high beam self-dimmed when it detected an oncoming car. SureBeam came to market in 2004, the same year Gentex finished constructing a sales and engineering facility in Erlenbach, Germany. The facility was intended to help Gentex better serve its European customers by offering greater logistics, sales, and engineering support.
