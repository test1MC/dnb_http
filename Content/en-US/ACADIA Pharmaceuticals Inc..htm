   ACADIA Pharmaceuticals develops small molecule drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. The biopharmaceutical company's pimavanserin (Nuplazid) was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2016 as a treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis, a common development with the disease. Two other clinical-stage candidates are being developed in collaboration with
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   to treat patients with chronic pain. The company's pipeline also includes pre-clinical candidates in development for chronic pain and Parkinson's disease. All candidates are birthed from ACADIA's own R-SAT drug discovery platform.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ACADIA is conducting further studies of Nuplazid for additional indications including Alzheimer's disease psychosis and schizophrenia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has no manufacturing facilities and contracts with third parties to make its existing and future product candidates for both development and commercial purposes. Nuplazid is manufactured by Patheon Pharmaceuticals for commercial use; Siegfried Pharma makes active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used in the manufacturing of the drug.
  </p>
  <p>
   ACADIA holds 45 issued patents in the US and 234 issued patents abroad.

  <p>
   The company has its headquarters and R&amp;D facilities in San Diego, California.

  <p>
   ACADIA has a specialty sales force of some 135 professionals and nearly 20 managers. The team is focused on promoting Nuplazid to US neurologists, psychiatrists, long-term care physicians, and others who treat patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis.

  <p>
   Being a development company means that ACADIA will likely spend more money than it earns for a while yet. The company has not received any revenue from product sales but rather from research grants and collaborations with other pharmaceutical firms. In 2015, revenue dropped 49% to $61,000, versus $120,000 in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   ACADIA has lost money every year since its formation, and it expects those losses to continue over the next few years as it works to develop and commercialize its candidates. In 2015, its net loss increased 78% to $164.4 million as the company ramped up hiring in preparation for the launch of Nuplazid. Transition agreement charges related to the retirement of ACADIA's CEO that year also added to the firm's expenses. As of December 31, 2015, ACADIA had an accumulated deficit of some $662.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 83% to $121.8 million in 2015.

  <p>
   ACADIA's general strategy is to pursue strategic partnerships to lift some of the cost burdens of clinical drug development. The company is initially focusing on commercializing Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis in the US. Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder, and psychosis develops in about half of patients, with symptoms commonly consisting of hallucinations and delusions. Nuplazid is the only FDA-approved treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis and, if it's approved for Alzheimer's disease psychosis, it will the only treatment for that, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, ACADIA launched the NUPLAZIDconnect program to provide financial assistance to qualifying patients in need.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Allergan terminated its collaboration with ACADIA for development of a treatment for glaucoma, but the companies continue to work together to develop treatments for chronic pain.
