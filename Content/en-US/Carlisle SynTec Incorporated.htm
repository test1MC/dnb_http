   Carlisle SynTec is poised to benefit from the ongoing post-recession recovery. In fiscal 2013 its immediate parent, Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM), contributed some 60% of Carlisle Companies' revenue. That year sales grew 5% to $1.8 billion; international sales represented 14% of total sales.

   In order to meet customer demand Carlisle has been rolling out new energy-saving and eco-friendly products such as sky lights and reflective white roofing membranes. Another green product is the Roof Garden -- a waterproof system that allows for grass, trees and other plants to be planted directly upon the roof. The company's Carlisle Energy Services division, in an agreement with solar panel manufacturer
