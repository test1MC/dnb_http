   Pfenex is pfast. The biopharmaceutical company's lead candidate went from concept to clinical trials in just two years. Using its patented Pfenex Expression Technology for building complex proteins, the company creates biosimilars or newer versions of existing biologics. Pfenex's lead candidate mimics Novartis' Lucentis, used to treat retinal disease. Second in line is a version of Bayer's Betaseron for multiple sclerosis. Other pipeline products include vaccines and generic biologics. Pfenex was formed in 2009 as a protein development and production company serving the world's top drug manufacturers; the company believes this history gives it an competitive advantage. Pfenex went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Pfenex raised $50 million in its offering. It's using the proceeds to fund clinical trials for its lead candidates along with R&amp;D for preclinical products.

  <p>
   Pfenex has no products so it's only operations at this are R&amp;D and clinical testing of its candidates. When it does have an approved product, the company intends to do its own manufacturing. Its current candidates include: PF582, a biosimilar to Lucentis, a treatment for retinal disease, whose patent expires in 2018; PF530, a biosimilar to Betaseron, a treatment for multiple sclerosis, that it plans to test in India, Malaysia, Russia, and parts of Eastern Europe in 2018; PF694, a generic version of Pegasys, a Hepatitis C treatment; PF708, a biosimilar to Forteo, a severe osteoporosis treatment; Px563L, an anthrax vaccine, whose development is funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services; and Px533, a prophylactic vaccine for malaria being developed through a grant from the National Institute of Allergies and Disease.

  <p>
   Pfenex doesn't have any approved products so it has no revenue and reported a total accumulated deficit of $91 million in mid-2014.

  <p>
   Going forward Pfenex intends to continue R&amp;D on its pipeline while working to gain FDA approval for its biosimilar and generic candidates while seeking government funding and support for its vaccine development.
