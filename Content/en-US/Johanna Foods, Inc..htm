   Johanna Foods expanded its yogurt manufacturing plant in Flemington, New Jersey, by 65,000 sq. ft. in 2013 to accommodate future growth among this part of its business. Doubling its capacity, the addition included 19,000 sq. ft. of cold storage and 46,000 sq. ft. of dry goods warehouse and yogurt processing. While boosting the company's production capacity, adding onto the manufacturing plant enables Johanna Foods to more easily introduce new products to meet demand and consumer preferences.
