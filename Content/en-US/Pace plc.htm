   Although there are opportunities in emerging markets that are still in the process of deploying digital and high-definition services, Pace sees its future in convergence as mature markets are offering opportunities beyond just delivering TV programming content. Pace is developing its products to deliver services ranging from telemedicine to home security, Internet applications, and streaming video games. The company is gearing its technology toward incorporating mobile devices into the converged home set-up it offers.

  <p>
   Pace Micro Technology was founded in the UK county of West Yorkshire by Barry Rubery and David Hood. In 1982 Rubery, a sales manager for a British shipping company, and Hood, a former consumer electronics technician who ran television rental and mail order businesses, noticed a lack of software for Apple 2 home computers in the UK. The pair set up Pace Micro to import and distribute software first for the Apple 2 and then for another PC, the BBC Micro. The next year they began making floppy disk drives for both machines.
  </p>
  <p>
   After introducing Britain's first computer modem priced for retail consumption in 1985, Pace Micro acquired satellite receiver technology from a developer for the price of a
   <company id="10706">
    Harley-Davidson
   </company>
   motorcycle. Business took off, and the company expanded into the broadcasting market when it began selling analog satellite TV receivers in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Hood and Rubery formed a joint development agreement with cable television operator NTL (now part of Virgin Media), giving Pace Micro access to that business's digital compression technology. The company formed a separate digital products unit and began pulling resources from its core analog operations to fuel the digital TV (DTV) initiative. This shift resulted in a dip in sales growth, Pace Micro's first ever, that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's modem division, Pace Micro Communications (PMC), had grown to become the largest modem maker in the UK by 1995. Hood and Rubery sold their stakes in the business to PMC's directors that year in order to give their full attention to the digital satellite market. Pace Micro Technology was making about a third of the set-top satellite boxes in Europe and half of those in the UK as a result of partnerships, including deals with affiliates of Rupert Murdoch's
   <company id="41816">
    News Corp.
   </company>
   The company also expanded into Asia, Australia, and South Africa in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1996 about 70% of the company's sales were to customers outside the UK and more than a quarter of its sales were to Murdoch-owned
   <company id="42747">
    Sky plc
   </company>
   . Pace Micro went public and named Peter Morgan as chairman that year. In 1997 the company moved into Latin America and gained access to the US cable market when it licensed DTV encoding technology from
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, amid lagging sales caused in part by the slow adoption of digital TV in some parts of Europe, Barry Rubery left his position as joint CEO. Later in 1997 Morgan named Malcolm Miller,
   <company id="42010">
    SEGA
   </company>
   's top man in Europe, to the post. Hood became director of technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pace Micro added products for WebTV and signed deals with
   <company id="41766">
    Cable &amp; Wireless
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   in 1998, and by the end of 1999 Miller had turned the company around. Pace Micro signed contracts with US-based cable service providers
   <company id="10200">
    BellSouth
   </company>
   and
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   , and its shares were up more than 400% from the previous year. Also in 1999 the company added DSL broadband technology when it bought the set-top unit of UK-based multimedia specialist Acorn.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Morgan turned the chairman's post over to BT Cellnet chairman Sir Michael Bett, and Pace Micro acquired VoIP specialist
   <company id="133278">
    VegaStream Group
   </company>
   . The next year Pace teamed with
   <company id="42010">
    SEGA
   </company>
   to provide interactive video game features to pay TV viewers and acquired France-based digital set-top box maker Xcom Multimedia Communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Pace Micro Technology shortened its name to simply Pace. Also that year, Pace acquired the set-top box and connectivity solutions divisions of
   <company id="41823">
    Royal Philips Electronics
   </company>
   . Traditionally a powerhouse in the European set-top box market, Pace saw its sales in North America increase dramatically after commencing shipments to
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42070">
    DIRECTV
   </company>
   in 2006.
