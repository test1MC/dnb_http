   You could be forgiven for thinking that ABB is short for "A Bunch of Businesses" -- though that bunch has evolved over some 130 years. ABB engineers power and automation technologies for a broad base of utility, industrial, and commercial customers. Its lines run from robots to light switches. Power products include transmission and distribution components, as well as turnkey substation systems. Automation technologies are used to monitor and control equipment and processes in industrial plants and utilities. The company has established a presence in about 100 countries, with its core businesses concentrated in power and automation markets.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ABB's operations extend to around 100 countries. A large portion of the company's production and development facilities reside in Canada, China, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Europe accounted for 36% of its total sales in 2012; the Americas and Asia each generated 27%, while Africa and the Middle East brought in 10%.

  <p>
   ABB operates through five segments: Power Products, Power Systems, Discrete Automation and Motion, Low Voltage Products, and Process Automation. The Power Products and Power Systems segments are driven primarily by the capital expenditures of electrical utilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Automation Products, Process Automation, and Low Voltage Products segments are impacted by the health of several industries, including automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals, paper and pulp, and pharmaceuticals. A global presence and competitive cost base, however, have helped to buffer ABB's exposure to regional recessions and slow economies.

  <p>
   ABB generated $39.3 billion in revenues for 2012, a historic milestone for the company; this represented a 3% increase from the $37.8 billion it earned in 2011. The spike in revenues was mainly due to a solid order level as well as the favorable impact of its 2012 Thomas &amp; Betts acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   While ABB has enjoyed three straight years of revenue growth, its profits slipped by 15% from $3.2 billion in 2011 to $2.7 billion in 2012 due to an increase in the cost of sales. This was the result of an unfavorable business mix coupled with higher prices involved with restructuring its segments.

  <p>
   As the global economy moves away from the recession, ABB has been making some milestone acquisitions to boost its product offerings, operations, and geographic reach. In mid-2013 it purchased
   <company id="54225">
    Power-One
   </company>
   , a major provider of solar inverters, technology used to convert the sun's energy into electricity. ABB made the $1 billion deal to boost its renewable energy business and expand its solar product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 ABB bought
   <company id="11475">
    Thomas &amp; Betts
   </company>
   (T&amp;B) for about $3.9 billion. T&amp;B sells electrical connectors, HVAC equipment, and transmission towers. The acquisition significantly added to ABB's North American presence, giving it access to T&amp;B's network of more than 6,000 distributor locations and wholesalers throughout the continent. Shortly after that transaction was made, ABB snapped up
   <company id="106234">
    Tropos Networks
   </company>
   , a California firm that makes wireless technologies and products for distribution area communication networks. The acquisition broadened ABB's communications systems portfolio and enabled it to better cater to North American clients in the power, transportation, and mining sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 ABB acquired the Trasfor Group, which advanced its portfolio of specialty dry-type transformers used in drives, railway rolling stock, offshore wind power, and other renewable energy applications. Months earlier, ABB swallowed up
   <company id="10164">
    Baldor Electric
   </company>
   for $3.1 billion. Baldor Electric, a US industrial motors business, strengthened ABB's energy efficient offerings, most notably, in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other completed acquisitions that year include ABB's takeover of
   <company id="100706">
    Mincom
   </company>
   , an Australia-based software and services company with clients ranging from mining companies (
   <company id="52987">
    Rio Tinto

   and
   <company id="41809">
    Anglo American

   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   ). Not only did the deal bring an estimated $200 million in revenues, but it also expanded ABB's software capabilities.

  <p>
   Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) was formed in 1988 when two giants, ASEA AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri of Switzerland, combined their electrical engineering and equipment businesses. Percy Barnevik, head of ASEA, became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   ASEA was born in Stockholm in 1883 when Ludwig Fredholm founded Electriska Aktiebolaget to manufacture an electric dynamo created by engineer Jonas Wenstrom. In 1890 the company merged with Wenstrom's brother's firm to form Allmanna Svenska Electriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA), a pioneer in industrial electrification. Early in the 1900s ASEA began its first railway electrification project. By the 1920s it was providing locomotives and other equipment to Sweden's national railway, and by the next decade ASEA was one of Sweden's largest electric equipment manufacturers. In 1962 it bought 20% of appliance maker
   <company id="41778">
    Electrolux
   </company>
   . ASEA created the nuclear power venture ASEA-ATOM with the Swedish government in 1968 and bought full control in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   BBC Brown Boveri was formed in 1891 as the Brown, Boveri, and Company partnership between Charles Brown and Walter Boveri in Baden, Switzerland. It made power generation equipment and produced the first steam turbines in Europe in 1900. BBC entered Germany (1893), France (1894), and Italy (1903) and diversified into nuclear power equipment after WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1988 BBC, the bigger company, had a West German network that ASEA, the more profitable company, coveted. Both had US joint ventures. In an unusual merger, ASEA (which became ABB AB) and BBC (later
   <company id="139600">
    ABB AG
   </company>
   ) continued as separate entities sharing equal ownership of ABB. Barnevik crafted a unique decentralized management structure under which national subsidiaries were closely linked to their local customers and labor forces. In six years ABB took over more than 150 companies worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   An ABB-led consortium built one of the world's largest hydroelectric plants in Iran in 1992, and in 1995 ABB merged its transportation segment into Adtranz (a joint venture with Daimler-Benz) to form the world's #1 maker of trains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tragedy struck in 1996. Robert Donovan, CEO of ABB's US subsidiary, died in a plane crash along with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and other executives on a trade mission. Donovan's death hastened the US unit's restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Barnevik gave up the title of CEO, remaining as chairman, and was succeeded by Göran Lindahl, an engineer who worked his way up the ranks at ASEA. (Barnevik remained chairman until 2001.) After 1997 profits dipped drastically, Lindahl scrapped Barnevik's vaunted regional matrix structure in favor of one organized by product areas under a strong central management. Though the Asian financial crisis slowed orders, ABB still pulled in large contracts, including one to build the world's largest cracker plant in Texas in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 ABB acquired Elsag Bailey, a Dutch maker of industrial control systems, for about $1.5 billion, and sold its 50% stake in Adtranz to DaimlerChrysler for about $472 million. ABB and France's
   <company id="57238">
    ALSTOM
   </company>
   combined their power generation businesses to form the world's largest power plant equipment maker. That year ABB AB and ABB AG were at last united under a single stock through holding company ABB Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB scaled back its power plant-related activities in 2000. The company sold its nuclear power business to
   <company id="57559">
    BNFL
   </company>
   for $485 million and its 50% stake in ABB Alstom Power to ALSTOM for $1.2 billion. (
   <company id="104852">
    Areva
   </company>
   acquired ALSTOM's transmission and distribution business in 2004.) In 2001 Lindahl resigned and Jörgen Centerman, head of the company's automation business, replaced him. Centerman promptly reorganized ABB's industrial operations into four segments based on customer type and two based on product type.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2001 ABB acquired French company Entrelec, a supplier of industrial automation and control products. With economic slowdowns occurring in the company's key markets, ABB announced plans in 2001 to cut 12,000 jobs over 18 months. Later that year, amid rising numbers of asbestos claims against US subsidiary Combustion Engineering, ABB took a $470 million fourth-quarter charge to cover asbestos liabilities. The claims charged asbestos exposures stemming from products supplied before the mid-1970s by Combustion Engineering, which ABB acquired in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 ABB found itself embroiled in controversy after revealing not only a record loss but also payments of large pensions to former chairman Barnevik and former chief executive Lindahl. The former executives agreed that year to return a part (about $82 million) of their pension payouts to ABB. That year the company, which faced $4.4 billion in debts after industry slumps affected its sales of power systems and equipment, industrial automation, and controls, sold part of its financial services unit to
   <company id="106285">
    GE Commercial Finance
   </company>
   for $2.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The day after the company sold its structured finances unit, ABB's chief executive, Jörgen Centerman, resigned and was replaced by the chairman, Jürgen Dormann. That year ABB sold its metering business to Germany-based
   <company id="92654">
    Ruhrgas
   </company>
   for $244 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003, as part of its settlement with asbestos plaintiffs, ABB placed Combustion Engineering into bankruptcy. Later that same year the company announced that it would sell its Sirius International reinsurance business to the Bermuda-based
   <company id="10566">
    White Mountains
   </company>
   ; the deal was completed in 2004 for about $425 million. ABB also sold its upstream oil, gas, and petrochemicals unit to Candover Partners,
   <company id="47011">
    3i
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="99789">
    J.P. Morgan Partners
   </company>
   for $925 million in 2004. (To clear the way for the sale, ABB also agreed to pay US regulators $16 million in fines to settle bribery cases at US-based ABB Vetco Gray and Scotland-based ABB Vetco UK. The subsidiaries -- part of the petroleum business that was sold -- allegedly paid off government officials in Angola, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria in order to win oil contracts between 1998 and 2003.)
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="91993">
    Sulzer
   </company>
   CEO Fred Kindle succeeded Dormann as ABB's CEO in 2005. (Dormann remained chairman until his retirement in 2007.) The company made a number of small dispositions in 2005, including its Japanese control valves business, its foundry business, and several cable and power line businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB ended years of litigation -- and a major corporate headache -- when it reached a settlement on an asbestos liability case related to US subsidiary Combustion Engineering in 2006. As part of the settlement, ABB committed more than $1.4 billion to pay settled claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   After consolidating its remaining businesses into the two areas, power technologies and automation technologies, ABB restructured its operations into five divisions in 2006: Power Products, Power Systems, Automation Products, Process Automation, and Robotics. It took further steps to streamline operations and position itself for growth, for example by moving its main robotics operation from Detroit to Shanghai.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 ABB voluntarily disclosed to the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   that the company made payments in the Middle East that might have violated anti-bribery laws. The following year ABB disclosed similar suspect payments at subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kindle left ABB in 2008 due to what the company called "irreconcilable differences" concerning the leadership of the company; former
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   CEO Joe Hogan became CEO of ABB later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company dug deeper into its investment purse, spending $653 million to complete 12 deals. Most notably, ABB purchased Kuhlman Electric, a US-based transformer manufacturer, from
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   for $513 million, including assumed debt. Kuhlman Electric was integrated into ABB's Power Products division in North America, and deepens ABB's geographic footprint and product offerings in the industrial and electric utility sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB's bunch of businesses has been peeled back, too. Several divestitures were completed in 2008 and 2007; ABB exited its 50% interest in South Africa's ABB Powertech Transformers to Powertech, owned by the Altron Group, for $11 million. In 2007 ABB sold subsidiary
   <company id="105795">
    ABB Lummus Global
   </company>
   to
   <company id="52871">
    Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co.
   </company>
   for some $870 million in cash, as well as its Building Systems business in Germany, and power plant interests in India and Morocco to
   <company id="55886">
    Abu Dhabi National Oil
   </company>
   . Power Lines businesses in Brazil and Mexico were also put on the sale block for $20 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB plowed in $209 million in 2009, adding eight new operations. Among them, the company acquired the assets of Sinai Engineering, a designer and provider of services for electrical generation and transmission systems planning, as well as construction management. The transaction, completed through its US ABB, Inc., expanded ABB's presence in western Canada. On the other side of the world, ABB picked up South Africa's Westingcorp (Pty) Ltd. The move ramped up ABB's line of power capacitors (machines that add to a system's power quality and energy efficiency) and opened the door to local and global electric utilities and mining markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB in mid-2010 acquired K-TEK, a maker of level detection technology used in the oil and gas industry, as well as water and other industries. Its instrumentation and sensing technologies, which number more than 350,000 installations, enhanced ABB's slate of measurement products, part of its Process Automation division. The deal garnered K-TEK's facilities in the US, the Netherlands, China, India, and South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   ABB picked up US software provider Insert Key Solutions in late 2010. Its combination with the earlier acquisition of
   <company id="41070">
    Ventyx
   </company>
   (valued at approximately $1 billion) from
   <company id="126587">
    Vista Equity Partners
   </company>
   created a comprehensive portfolio of software for managing asset-intensive businesses engaged in the utility, energy, and communications industries. Ventyx and Insert Key Solutions joined ABB's network management business.
