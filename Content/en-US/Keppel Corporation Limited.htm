   Keppel gets the lion's share of its revenue from its Offshore &amp; Marine division, which accounts for more than half of its annual revenue. Keppel FELS designs and builds mobile offshore rigs, while Keppel Shipyard repairs, converts, and upgrades a diverse range of vessels. Its specialized shipbuilding division is led by Keppel Singmarine. Keppel Infrastructure (20% of sales) is active in the energy and related infrastructure fields, while Keppel T&amp;T is in the business of logistics and data centers in the Asia-Pacific Region and Europe. The conglomerate's property arm, Keppel Land, contributes just over 20% of annual revenue.

        <p>
   Keppel reported revenue of nearly SGD$14 billion ($11 billion) in 2012, representing a 39% increase versus 2011. (Note that the company restated its 2011 results.) The company's net profit rose 28% to SGD$1.9 billion ($1.5 billion). The Offshore &amp; Marine (O&amp;M) and Property divisions performed well with the O&amp;M division booking SGD$10 billion ($7.9 billion) in new orders in 2012. Keppel's financial performance in 2012 reflected the spillover effects of a slow recovery in the US and the debt crisis in Europe. Results in Asia, while resilient, reflected slowing growth in China and fourth quarter weakness in Singapore.

   With the increase in oil exploration in the East, Keppel is expanding its deepwater rig manufacturing operations. It also repairs and converts liquid natural gas carriers and other vessels, and is building a new shipyard in Qatar with Qatar Gas Transport. The company also announced a shipbuilding joint venture in Astrakhan that will build tankers for transporting oil in the Caspian Sea.
  </p>
        <p>
   Keppel is actively expanding its property holdings in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam with residential and commercial developments. Its K-REIT Asia real estate investment trust is also seeking acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, weak energy prices have hurt Keppel's bottom line as oil producers offshore exploration activities decline. In October 2016, the company announced that it has cut some 8,000 jobs, or roughly 26% of its Offshore &amp; Marine segment's workforce.
