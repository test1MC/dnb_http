   Ultratech's machines take the ultimate in high-tech baby steps. The company makes step-and-repeat photolithography systems -- called steppers -- that help manufacturers produce semiconductors, thin-film heads for disk drives, and micromachined components. Chip makers use the steppers in photolithography, a process during which device features are imprinted on semiconductor wafer surfaces through repeated exposures to patterns of light. The company's steppers expose a small section of the wafer, then "step" to an adjacent site to repeat the process. Ultratech was founded in 1979.

  <p>
   More than 90% of Ultratech's revenue comes from its products with the rest from services. The company gets a tiny amount of revenue, less than 1%, from licensing.

  <p>
   Ultratech maintains manufacturing plants in California and Singapore that also offer phone-based technical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, the company has sales and support offices in China, Germany, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manufacturers in Taiwan makes that country Ultratech's biggest geographic marketing, accounting for 44% of revenue. US manufacturers account for 19% and those in Japan, 9%.

   The company uses a direct sales force. Semiconductor makers (including companies involved in chip packaging) continue to dominate its customer ranks, generating 84% of revenue, while 16% of sales come from firms in nanotechnology, which includes manufacturers of optical networking gear, thin-film head magnetic recording devices, laser diodes, and high-brightness light-emitting diodes (HBLEDs). In 2015, Ultratech's biggest customers were
   <company id="99621">
    Siliconware Precision Industries
   </company>
   , 21% of revenue,
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
   </company>
   , 13%, and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel Corp.
   </company>
   , 10%.

  <p>
   Ultratech revenue in 2015 was about $150 million, 1% lower than that recorded in 2014. Sales of the company's HBLED systems declined while ALD system sales increased and product sales overall were even. Services revenue, however, dropped 6% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost $15 million in 2015, a better performance than the $19 million loss in 2014. Lower R&amp;D and general and administrative expenses helped shrink the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow turned positive in 2015, reaching $8 million from a negative cash flow of $6.6 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Ultratech partners with potential customers to develop new process technologies, which help the company sell equipment based on the technology to its partner. Once a customer makes a capital equipment purchasing decision, that company will generally rely on the equipment for a specific application and until it needs next-generation technology, making it difficult to sell a similar product to a manufacturer once the purchasing decision has been made.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continues to expand its manufacturing operations in Singapore. It qualifies for tax breaks for building in Singapore and will invest overseas earnings into overseas operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultratech sells a niche product rather than a broad line of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The company has diversified into a few key markets including 3-D packaging and high-brightness LEDs to reduce its overall exposure to downturns in the chip industry and extend its market share once next-generation technologies go into production.
