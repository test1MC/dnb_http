  <p>
   Bandag, the US company, was established in 1957 when Roy Carver gained the North American rights to the Bandag system from Bernard Anton Nowak of Darmstadt, Germany. The Bandag name came from Bernard Anton Nowak's initials, B.A.N.; the "D" from Darmstadt; and AG from Aktiengesellschaft, the German word for corporation.
