        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Before it was acquired, Life Technologies had enjoyed consistently strong revenue growth since 2003, reporting revenue of $3.87 billion in 2013. The company's profits had also grown consistently since 2008.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014, operating as the Life Sciences Solutions segment, the company reported revenue of $4.20 billion in 2014, and contributed roughly 25% to the net revenue of its parent company,

        <p>
   Life Technologies grows by researching and developing its own products, in-licensing new technologies from other research and drug development companies, and by making select acquisitions. Life Technologies focuses its energy on expanding in areas that it expects will undergo major growth or will provide for particularly high financial returns. Its primary areas of focus include investing in next generation DNA sequencing, regenerative medicine, and applied markets (such as forensics, food safety, and animal health). In late 2014, the company introduced one of the industry's first NGS Genotyping Solution via the Ion 16S Metagenomics Kit. In 2013, it launched a new line of reagents and an upgrade to its software platform.

        <p>
   In recent years, it has also expanded by forming partnerships. In early 2015, for example, it established a distribution agreement with Cynvenio Biosystems for the rights to deliver its LiquidBiopsy platform. In 2014, it partnered with other major companies including: Cellectis, to cover the uses of TAL nucleases under the TALEN brand; and IntegenX Inc., to give it rights to distribute Life's GlobalFiler Express chemistry on IntengenX's RapidHIT platform. The company has also recently partenered with firms including

   ,
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline

   ,

    Gen-Probe,
   </company>
   and
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has focused much of its acquisition activities in recent years on building out its companion diagnostic, molecular diagnostic, and gene sequencing operations. Geographically, Life Technologies targets emerging markets including China, India, and Brazil for expansion. Indeed, the Asia/Pacific and Latin America are its fastest growing regions.

        <p>
   Life Technologies typically purchases small businesses that round out its operations or move it into a new field of operations. For instance, it purchased two CLIA laboratories in 2012, giving the company the capability to produce companion diagnostics (tests that predict a patient's response to a specific drug) and conduct clinical trials in partnership with pharmaceutical companies. It also added makers of cancer diagnostic, food testing, and cell imaging instruments.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 it strengthened its global distribution system through the purchase of Life Science Korea (LSK), which sells instruments in South Korea. Also that year it purchased Dutch protein purification firm BAC.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company changed its name from Invitrogen to Life Technologies when it acquired
   <company id="11167">
    Applied Biosystems
   </company>
   through a $6.7 billion merger transaction in 2008. The former Invitrogen focused on research consumables such as reagents, while Applied Biosystems specialized in big instrumentation systems. Since then, the company has reshuffled its operating structure a few times. Some of its products are still marketed under the Applied Biosystems (mass spectronomy and biochromatography media products) and Invitrogen (reagents and cloning kits) brands.
