  <p>
   Wabash is enjoying unprecedented growth over the last few years. Revenues jumped 14% from $1.64 billion in 2013 to peak at $1.84 billion in 2014, a historical milestone for the company. The growth was fueled by increased sales from all its segments, especially Diversified Products and Retail. Wabash also experienced higher overall trailer sales during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's earnings increased 31% to $61 million in 2014, due to the spike in revenue coupled with a decrease in selling expenses, which was affected by salaries and employee-related costs of sales personnel and lower advertising and promotional costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with its revenue stream, Wabash has seen strong growth from its operating cash flow year-over-year. For 2013 it surged by $53 million due to cash generated from deferred income taxes and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Operating cash flow did take a hit in 2014, however; decreasing by 28% due to reduced amounts of deposits from customers for products not delivered during the year.

  <p>
   Wabash has traditionally sold to the largest operators of trailer fleets. Although it preserves its core customer base, the company is striving to diversify its offerings and win business from the next tier of trucking companies -- carriers with fleets of between 250 and 7,500 trailers.

  <p>
   Wabash has experienced uncharted revenue growth through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it purchased certain assets of the tank and trailer business of Beall Corporation, a manufacturer of aluminum tank trailers and related equipment based in Portland, Oregon. The deal fortified its Diversified Products segment and expanded its tank trailer market geographically by adding manufacturing operations in the Western half of the US.

  <p>
   Donald Ehrlich was president of trailer maker Monon when its parent company was purchased in 1983. Disillusioned by the new management, Ehrlich took several key employees with him to create Wabash in 1985. The business got a jump-start when Ehrlich's Sears contacts ordered 10 trailers. In 1991 Wabash bought the rights to RoadRailer (bimodal railcar construction technology developed in 1956) and went public.
