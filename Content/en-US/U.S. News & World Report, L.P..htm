   U.S. News &amp; World Report was once the publisher of a print news magazine of the same name; today its content is available online only, with special printed issues. USNews.com focuses on topics such as politics and policy, education, and health. In recent years the company has found more luck in print with its signature
   <em>
    America's Best
   </em>
   annual series of books that ranks institutions and services such as colleges, hospitals, and mutual funds. The magazine was founded in 1933 as
   <em>
    United States News
   </em>
   . Real estate and media tycoon Mort Zuckerman (co-owner of the
   <em>
    New York Daily News
   </em>
   ) has owned the company since 1984.

   The company has shifted its revenue model to focus on digital advertising sales and sales of its rankings guides. In addition, it is expanding its
   <em>
    US News Weekly
   </em>
   website -- which has channels including Politics &amp; Policy, Education, Money, Health, Autos, and Travel -- to digital readers, such as the iPad and Android tablets.

   In 1933 political columnist David Lawrence started
   <i>
    United States News,
   </i>
   a weekly newspaper. He turned it into a magazine seven years later, launched another magazine,
   <i>
    World Report,
   </i>
   in 1946, and merged the two publications in 1948. During the 1960s and 1970s,
   <i>
    U.S. News &amp; World Report
   </i>
   was employee-owned. After making his fortune through his real estate firm (Boston Properties), Mort Zuckerman bought the magazine in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1990s the company began placing more emphasis on book and CD-ROM publishing. It launched its online edition -- USNews.com -- in 1995. That year Zuckerman invested in a start-up magazine called
   <i>
    Fast Company,
   </i>
   giving him an 88% stake. In 1996 James Fallows, author of a controversial book that skewered the media, replaced husband and wife co-editors Michael Ruby and Merrill McLoughlin. Fallows immediately brought in several top editorial managers and staff members of his own, which led to a host of other defections. In 1997 Harold Evans was named editorial director of all of Zuckerman's publications, effective in early 1998. Later that year Fallows became a
   <i>
    U.S. News
   </i>
   casualty himself: Zuckerman replaced him with Stephen Smith, a veteran of both
   <i>
    Time
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Newsweek.
   </i>
   (Insiders say Zuckerman and Fallows never saw eye to eye on editorial issues.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Smith rehired a number of editors and writers who had departed during Fallows' tenure. Also in 1999 Zuckerman sold the literature and politics title
   <i>
    Atlantic Monthly
   </i>
   to
   <company id="61829">
    National Journal Group
   </company>
   , so U.S. News &amp; World Report could focus on its flagship title. Upheaval in the company's top ranks continued as Evans announced he would leave at the end of 1999 to work on several books, and COO Kimberly Jensen was found dead of an apparent suicide after being questioned about alleged misuse of company funds.
  </p>
  <p>
   As turmoil continued to mark the magazine, many speculated that Zuckerman would sell the newsweekly. But Zuckerman denied the rumors emphatically; he hired more reporters at the magazine and launched a new ad campaign ("Smart news for smart readers"). In 2000 the company closed its Tokyo bureau. That year Zuckerman also sold its fast-growing
   <i>
    Fast Company
   </i>
   magazine to
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner &amp; Jahr
   </company>
   , the magazine arm of Germany-based media conglomerate
   <company id="40661">
    Bertelsmann
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Smith's contract wasn't renewed and he was replaced by Brian Duffy, the company's eighth editor since 1984. The company hit hard times later that year, reducing staff and cutting salaries of existing employees. Duffy left the magazine in 2007 and Brian Kelly was appointed the next editor.

  <p>
   <em>
    U.S. News &amp; World Report
   </em>
   decreased is publication schedule from weekly to every other week in 2008.  In 2009 the company launched the digital magazine,
   <em>
    U.S.
   </em>
   <em>
    News Weekly
   </em>
   . Also that year the print magazine became a monthly publication before ultimately shutting down with the December 2010 issue.
