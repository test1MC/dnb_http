   Buffalo Pumps operates as one of the three divisions comprising the Air and Liquid Processing segment of Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation. This segment generated 33% of its parent company's sales in fiscal 2013. This segment saw an overall 9% decrease in sales for 2013 due to reduced demand for custom air handling equipment by universities and research facilities.
