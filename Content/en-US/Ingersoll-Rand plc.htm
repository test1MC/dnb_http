   Ingersoll-Rand's heavy machinery helped carve the faces of Mount Rushmore, but more recently the company has made its name as a market-leading commercial products manufacturer. It sells temperature management systems for the home, commercial facilities, and transport vehicles through its
   <company id="40026">
    Trane
   </company>
   and
   <company id="112480">
    Thermo King
   </company>
   brands. Its
   <company id="138805">
    Club Car
   </company>
   brand comprises golf, utility and personal transport vehicles; and it sells a wide range operational efficiency products and services, including compressed air and gas systems and power tools, under the Ingersoll-Rand brand. The company sells its products both directly and through distributors to customers in about 100 countries around the world. It has manufacturing plants in the Americas, Asia, and Europe.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Ingersoll-Rand operates two business segments, Climate and Industrial. Climate sells heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, with brands including Trane and American Standard, while the Industrial segment sells products to improve productivity, operations and energy efficiency, which includes Club Car. Climate pulls in the bulk of revenue, at about 75% of total; Industrial makes up the rest.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US is Ingersoll-Rand's largest market at about 60% of revenue, but the company sells to more than 100 countries and has manufacturing and assembly operations in some 50 sites worldwide.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company markets its products in the US through branch sales offices, distributors, dealers; outside the US, it uses subsidiaries. No one customer accounts for more than 10% of total sales, and no part of the business is dependent on one individual customer either.
  </p>

  <p>
   Net revenue for 2015 grew by 3.2% to $13.3 billion. The increase in revenue was driven by higher volumes of sales (primarily in the Climate segment), organic growth in the refrigeration transport business in North America and Western Europe, and revenue from new acquisitions (across both segments). Total revenue growth, however, was curtailed by unfavorable currency movements. The Climate segment posted growth of 3.5% to $10.2 billion, with Industrial lower at 2.1% to $3.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell sharply in 2015 from $950 million to $682 million - a 28% fall - as a result of an increase in the effective tax rate to 43.3%; this was due to a ruling by the IRS that Ingersoll-Rand owes $744 million from incorrect treatment of intercompany debt in the period 2002-2006, and a similar ruling is expected for the period 2007-2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash flow for the year was down 10% to $886.2 million, linked to the IRS settlement.

  <p>
   Ingersoll-Rand thinks long term: it employs a strategy of diversity in geography and industry - its numerous brands include American Standard and Aro, and 40% of revenue is non-US - to mitigate against over-reliance on any one revenue stream - an approach especially warranted given current global market turmoil. The company also views investment in product development and innovation as key to long-term growth, while some 30% of revenue comes from largely repeatable business, providing the company revenue stability. And a growing global population will increase the need for products that cut energy demand and lower emissions - an opportunity Ingersoll-Rand hopes to exploit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company completed in April 2016 the sale of its minority interest in Hussmann, a refrigeration and food merchandising equipment manufacturer, as part of a deal that will see Panasonic acquire 100% of Hussmann's shares; this will result in net proceeds of around $425 million once the deal is closed in 2016.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Ingersoll-Rand completed the $850 million acquisition of Cameron International's Centrifugal Compression, which provides aftermarket parts for air separation, gas transmission and process gas. Also in 2015 it acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of FRIGOBLOCK, which sells transport refrigeration units, primarily in Western Europe, for $113 million.

  <p>
   Simon Ingersoll invented the steam-driven rock drill in New York City in 1871. In 1874 he sold the patent to Jose Francisco de Navarro, who financed the organization of the Ingersoll Rock Drill Company. Three years later it merged with Sergeant Drill, a company created by Henry Clark Sergeant, Navarro's former foreman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the Rand brothers were also establishing a drill company. The companies merged in 1905 to become Ingersoll-Rand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ingersoll-Rand initially produced air compressors and a basic line of rock drills. In 1912 the company added centrifugal compressors and turbo blowers. Later, portable air tools were added.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Ingersoll-Rand, which had mostly served US mining operations, expanded internationally. From the 1960s on, the company diversified into specialized machinery and products. Acquisitions in the 1970s and 1980s made Ingersoll-Rand the largest US bearing manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also developed small air compressors and water-jet systems capable of cutting steel and concrete. In 1986 Ingersoll-Rand formed a joint venture with Dresser Industries called Dresser-Rand to produce gas turbines, compressors, and similar equipment. Ingersoll-Rand and Dresser Industries combined pump operations to form another joint venture, Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 16-year Ingersoll-Rand veteran James Perrella became CEO. That year the company bought the German needle- and cylindrical-bearing business of FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schafer; it also sold its underground coal-mining machinery business (to Long-Airdox), as well as its domestic jet-engine bearing operation. ECOAIR, a unit of MAN GHH, was among several 1994 acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ingersoll-Rand acquired Clark Equipment for $1.5 billion in 1995 in a deal that included the businesses of Bobcat (skid-steer loaders), Clark-Hurth Components (axles and transmissions, sold 1997), Club Car (golf cars), and Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment (asphalt-paving equipment). In 1996 Ingersoll-Rand bought Metaldyne's (formerly Mascotech) Steelcraft Division (steel doors). In 1997 Ingersoll-Rand bought Newman Tonks Group (UK) and technology from the
   <company id="103896">
    Master Lock
   </company>
   unit of
   <company id="10075">
    Fortune Brands
   </company>
   , which boosted its architectural hardware line and extended its distribution in Europe and Asia. That year Ingersoll-Rand bought
   <company id="112480">
    Thermo King
   </company>
   from
   <company id="11627">
    Westinghouse
   </company>
   (now
   <company id="12435">
    CBS
   </company>
   ) for $2.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Ingersoll-Rand bought Harrow Industries (access controls, architectural hardware, decorative bath fixtures). The company's industrial production equipment was enhanced when it struck a deal with Cadence Design Systems, a world-leading supplier of electronic design and automation software. James Perrella stepped down as CEO that year; Herbert Henkel, formerly of Textron, succeeded him.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Ingersoll-Rand bought
   <company id="10697">
    Halliburton
   </company>
   's stake in its joint ventures with Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump. Ingersoll-Rand then sold Ingersoll-Dresser Pump to Flowserve for about $775 million and bought Neal Manufacturing, which makes compact road-paving equipment. It also acquired
   <company id="53961">
    Hussmann International
   </company>
   (refrigeration equipment) for about $1.8 billion. That same year, Ingersoll-Rand sold the reciprocating gas compressor packaging and rental business of its Dresser-Rand unit to Hanover Compressor Company for $190 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed 20 plants and laid off more than 3,900 employees the next year. But acquisitions continued. Ingersoll-Rand's 2001 purchases included refrigeration company National Refrigeration Services and lock maker Kryptonite Corporation (originator of the U-shaped bicycle lock), as well as companies in the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, and Turkey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ingersoll-Rand reincorporated in Bermuda in late 2001; the move could save the company nearly $40 million in US taxes every year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Torrington Co. unit (bearings and motion-control components) to The Timken Co. for $840 million in 2003. It then sold its drilling business to
   <company id="90875">
    Atlas Copco
   </company>
   for $225 million. A bigger divestment came in late 2004 with the sale of
   <company id="40133">
    Dresser-Rand
   </company>
   to private equity group
   <company id="117524">
    First Reserve Corporation
   </company>
   for about $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2007 Ingersoll-Rand sold its road construction equipment division to
   <company id="41854">
    AB Volvo
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion in cash. Later that year the company said it was exploring options for
   <company id="138799">
    Bobcat
   </company>
   and its other construction equipment businesses, citing the fact that these operations no longer complement its core business. Ingersoll-Rand found a buyer later in 2007 in a teaming of two sister companies of the Doosan Group --
   <company id="57069">
    Doosan Infracore
   </company>
   and Doosan Engine. The two companies paid $4.9 billion for the businesses, which essentially made up Ingersoll-Rand's construction division -- Bobcat, utility equipment, and attachments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reorganization was sparked by Ingersoll-Rand's 2008 acquisition HVAC systems and service provider Trane, Inc. (formerly American Standard Companies) for $9.6 billion. The deal gave Ingersoll-Rand an entrée into commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets demanding a range climate control technologies. In 2009 Trane increased net revenues by nearly 16% over 2008. Trane's results included a more consistent revenue stream through the economic downturn.
