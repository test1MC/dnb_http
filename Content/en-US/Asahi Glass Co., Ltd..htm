   Asahi Glass Company (AGC) shatters the conventional image of glassmakers. The world's #1 maker of flat glass also claims the top spot in automotive glass, plasma display panel substrates, and fluorinated resins. Glass for construction, solar, automotive, and other applications account for half of AGC's overall sales. The company's Electronics and Display division makes high-purity silicon carbide, electronic components, and synthetic quartz glass for semiconductors and glass substrates, and its Chemicals unit makes soda ash, caustic soda, and other specialty chemicals. Subsidiaries include US-based

   and
   <company id="90617">
    AGC Glass Europe
   </company>
   . It operates mainly in the Asia/Pacific region as well as the US and Europe.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Although the company is closely tied to the Japanese marketplace, its geographic reach extends into China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia -- regions where demand for glass, chemical, and electronic products is growing.

  <p>
   The company has three reportable segments: Glass, Electronics, and Chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glass products include float flat glass, figured glass, polished wired glass, low-E glass, fabricated glass for architectural use, automotive tempered and laminated glass, glass for solar power systems, fabricated glass for industrial use, and decorative glass. The glass segment account for 53% of AGC's sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the electronics segment, products include glass substrate for display devices, specialty glass for display applications, display related materials, optical membranes, optoelectronics materials, synthetic quartz glass, glass frit and paste, materials for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and lighting glass products
  </p>
  <p>
   Chemicals segment products include raw materials for vinyl chloride polymer, caustic soda, urethane, gases, solvents, fluorinated resins, water and oil repellents, pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates, and iodine-related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   AGC has developed a number of core technologies. In the field of electronics and energy components, the company sells state-of-the-art glass materials and processes, fluorine chemistry, coating technologies, and nano materials. It has developed synthetic quartz lens materials for steppers with deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser permeability and durability for manufacturing semiconductors. AGC has also driven several firsts, including infrared ray (IR) cut glass, privacy glass, UV glass, and a water repellent windshield. It plans to increase its capital investment in facilities for manufacturing glass for solar cells and for thin-film transistor (TFT) glass substrates used in TVs, monitors, and digital radiography. AGC has already made significant investments in plants in China, which manufacture laminated glass and tempered glass.

   In 2014, revenue increased by 28 billion yen due to the increased shipments of glass products (automotive glass) and chemicals, as well as the continued depreciation of the yen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, net income decreased by 226 million yen, while net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by 31 billion yen.

   AGC is seeking to increase sales by developing new markets with existing products, exploring existing markets with new products, and targeting new markets with new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the architectural glass business, the AGC is seeking to grow through joint ventures. In the LCD glass business, the company plans to shift its production capacity to China which is growing rapidly, and reduce costs and keep the profitability. In the applied glass materials business, AGC plans to provide thin, light and strong glass in various markets, including electronics, architectural, automotive, solar
  </p>
  <p>
   In the chemicals business, AGC is looking to respond to the expanding demand for chlor-alkali in Southeast Asia. In the fluorochemicals business, the Group plans to grow capacity to meet the increasing demand for high-performance materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, AGC announced plans to build a furnace for TFT-LCD glass substrates in Huizhou in Southern China. It also committed $400 million dollars to construct a power plant at its Indonesian subsidiary, P.T. Asahimas Chemical.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, AGC broke ground on a new automotive glass plant in Mexico.

  <p>
   In 1881 Toshiya Iwasaki was born into one of Japan's most powerful industrial families. His uncle, Yataro Iwasaki, had founded Mitsubishi. The younger Iwasaki studied chemistry at the University of London, then returned home to fight in the Russo-Japanese war.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war, Iwasaki decided to use his chemistry education to go into the glass business. Because of the country's isolation, there was no flat-glass industry to speak of in Japan until 1907, when Iwasaki founded Asahi Glass in Kansai. To start, he recruited glass blowers from Belgium, which was the leading flat-glass maker at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1909 the company was operational and instantly became Japan's #1 maker of flat glass -- a position it maintains. However, because Japanese industry was still in its infancy, Asahi Glass had to produce its own equipment and raw materials. The company began making firebrick for its glass furnaces in 1916, and the next year began producing soda ash at a facility in Kitakyushu.
  </p>
  <p>
   Helped by savvy marketing and an economy nourished by WWI, Asahi Glass was soon profitable and growing rapidly. In China, Asahi found convenient markets and labor. During the 1930s, the company shifted some of its glass and chemical operations to 17 factories in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the rest of industrial Japan, Asahi Glass contributed to the country's effort to equip for WWII. In 1944 the government merged Asahi Glass with a chemical company to form Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   No Japanese strategy, business or military, was ready for two US nuclear attacks. By 1945 the company had lost its 17 Chinese factories. Allied occupation forces took over the Japanese economy with a top priority being the breakup of Japan's
   <i>
    zaibatsu
   </i>
   -- or trading companies. Mitsubishi was a prime target and Mitsubishi Chemical Industries was split into its composite parts. Asahi Glass was incorporated in 1950.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's four domestic plants remained operable, and Asahi Glass was soon providing glass for the rebuilding of Japan. Two products new to Japan would create a boon for Asahi Glass -- the TV and the car. Japan began televising in 1953, and Asahi Glass responded by creating Asahi Special Glass to make cathode ray tubes. Asahi Glass met demand for automotive glass in 1956 by forming Asahi Processed Glass. With these operations and recovery from the war, Asahi Glass thrived for 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company renewed foreign operations in 1956, establishing Indo-Asahi Glass in Calcutta, India. It went on to set up dominant positions in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Asahi Glass branched into Europe with the purchases of MaasGlas (the Netherlands) and a majority stake in Glaverbel (Belgium). Shrinking domestic demand in the early 1980s prompted the company to expand its chemicals business by forming joint ventures with Olin Corp., PPG Industries, and UK-based Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).
  </p>
  <p>
   Asahi Glass began making technologically advanced "new glass" products in the 1990s. These included large, flat TV screens; reflective building glass; and glass hard disks for PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Asahi Glass became the first Japanese company to establish a Russian presence with the purchase of a 26% stake in Bor Glass Works. Asahi Glass bought PPG Industries' European flat-glass business in 1998, securing 25% of the European market. It also bought out ICI's share of its joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Asahi Glass sold its Indo-Asahi Glass operations to an Indian glass concern in 1999. The next year it sold its interest in magnetic memory disk venture Asahi Komag. In 2001 Asahi Glass paid about $325 million to increase its holdings in Glaverbel to 90%; it owned 100% by the end of 2002. In early 2003 Asahi closed its Philippine auto glass production operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Asahi established automotive glass plants in China and Hungary, established a TFT LCD plant in South Korea, and converted its Aichi automotive glass operations to plasma display panel substrate production.

   AGC has formed a joint partnership with
