   Revlon has the look of a leader in the US mass-market cosmetics business, alongside
   <company id="41772">
    L'Oréal
   </company>
   's Maybelline and
   <company id="11211">

   's Cover Girl. Aside from its Almay and Revlon brands of makeup and beauty tools, the company makes Revlon ColorSilk hair color, Mitchum antiperspirants and deodorants, Charlie and Jean Naté fragrances, and Ultima II and Gatineau skincare products. Its beauty aids are distributed in more than 150 countries, though the US is its largest market, generating more than half of sales. Revlon products are primarily sold by mass merchandisers and drugstores such as

   The US is Revlon's largest market, accounting for about 55% of sales. The cosmetics maker also has operations in more than a dozen foreign countries and enjoys a global reach and leading positions in several product categories in Australia, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Canada, the UK, and South Africa.

  <p>
   Revlon is one of the world's top cosmetics makers across the mass retail channel, known for its color cosmetics in the face, lip, eye, and nail categories, as well as women's hair color and beauty tools. It has built a big business selling cosmetics and beauty products in the US to mass-market retailers and chain drug and food stores, collectively known as the mass retail channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   It operates across two segments: Consumer (74% of net sales) and Professional (26%). Consumer consists of Revlon color cosmetics, Almay color cosmetics, SinfulColors color cosmetics, Pure Ice color cosmetics, Revlon ColorSilk hair color, Revlon Beauty Tools, Charlie fragrances, and Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Professional segment was formed upon its 2013 acquisition of
   <company id="121228">
    Colomer
   </company>
   . Professional now consists of Revlon Professional in hair color and hair care; CND-branded products in nail polishes and nail enhancements; and American Crew in men's grooming products.

   The beauty giant spends heavily to promote its products in the hotly-competitive beauty market. Revlon reported advertising expenses, including TV, print, and digital ads, and in-store promotional displays, of $383 million in 2014, up from $279 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The mass-market cosmetic company's largest customer is
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , which accounted for about 16% of its total sales in 2014.

  <p>
   Revlon posted unprecedented growth in 2014, with revenues surging from $1.49 billion in 2013 to peak at a record-shattering $1.94 million in 2014. The historic growth was primarily due to its 2013 acquisition of Colomer; as a result, Revlon's newly formed Professional segment saw its sales skyrocket by over 400% during 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting a net loss of $6 million in 2013, the company recorded $41 million in positive income for 2014. Revlon has also achieved steady operating cash flow growth the last four years.

   In 2016 Revlon acquired
   <company id="47820">
    Elizabeth Arden
   </company>
   for more than $419 million in cash. The combined company is positioned to grow its global presence by selling its expanded portfolio of brands in additional markets. The deal was valued at $870 million, including debt.

  <p>
   Legend has it that, jobless in New York City in the depths of the Depression, Charles Revson became a cosmetics salesman by the toss of a coin -- tails, he'd apply for a job selling household appliances; heads, he'd answer an ad for a cosmetics salesman. It was heads, and in 1931 Revson began selling Elka nail polish to beauty salons. He painted his own nails with different colors so he wouldn't need a color chart.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revson and his brother Joseph decided to start their own nail polish company. They scraped together $300, hooked up with nail polish supplier Charles Lachman, and in 1932 began Revlon (the "L" in the name came from Lachman). The nail polish, emulating Elka's, was opaque rather than transparent, available in many colors, and an immediate hit with beauty salons. Revlon grew rapidly, and by 1937 Revson was selling his nail polish in upscale department stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeing nail polish as a fashion accessory, Revson introduced new colors twice a year, giving them -- and the matching lipsticks introduced in 1940 -- names like Kissing Pink and Fifth Avenue Red. More opportunist than innovator, he let his competitors do the research and make the mistakes, and then he would make a better version of the product, outpackaging and outadvertising his rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revlon introduced Fire &amp; Ice in 1952, one of its most successful launches ever. Its sole sponsorship of
   <i>
    The $64,000 Question
   </i>
   quiz show in 1955 boosted sales of some products by 500%. Later that year Revlon went public. To diversify and expand its markets, it began making acquisitions (although many were soon dumped) and selling its products overseas.
