   ASML Holding holds a strong hand in the semiconductor lithography game. The company is one of the world's largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In particular, it vies with Japanese giants
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="51742">
    Nikon
   </company>
   for supremacy in the market for the specialized photolithography systems used to imprint microscopic circuitry patterns onto silicon wafers. To keep on top of advanced technology, the company formed strategic partnerships with a range of companies, including
   <company id="59002">
    Carl Zeiss
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41823">
    Philips Electronics
   </company>
   . Customers include silicon foundries (contract semiconductor manufacturers), such as
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   . ASML gets about two-thirds of its business from Asia.

  <p>
   ASML Holding's pedigree is as good as its timing was bad. The company was formed in 1984 under the name ASM Lithography Holding as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials (ASM; now
   <company id="92077">
    ASM International
   </company>
   ) and the Scientific and Industrial Equipment Division of
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   . ASML had already begun selling a wafer stepper (a device that transfers reticle patterns onto silicon wafers) when the joint venture was announced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, the chip industry was headed into one of its infamous slumps. Startup costs dogged both ASM and Philips. Though the industry downturn abated by 1987, the financial stresses created by the slump led ASM to sell its 50% stake in ASML to Philips in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Philips offered a minority stake in ASML to the public in 1995. By 1998 ASML was battling
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   for the stepper industry's #2 spot. Also that year the company formed a unit to develop lithography equipment for makers of thin-film heads (used in recording and data storage), MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), and compound semiconductors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 ASML joined with
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   and Lucent Technologies (now
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ) to form SCALPEL, an alliance formed to speed development of electron beam lithography. Also that year the company bought MicroUnity Systems' MaskTools unit (optical proximity correction technology). In 2000 Doug Dunn, a former CEO of the Philips Consumer Electronics Division, became ASML's president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   ASML later agreed to acquire
   <company id="14721">
    Silicon Valley Group
   </company>
   (SVG) in a deal valued at about $1.6 billion. In 2001, after many delays -- and opposition from some US business groups -- the US government cleared the way for the merger. As part of the deal, ASML and SVG were given six months to sell SVG's
   <company id="46636">
    Tinsley
   </company>
   unit, which made highly specialized optical gear for sensitive aerospace and military applications. Late in the year, ASML sold Tinsley to privately held SSG Precision Optronics (now
   <company id="104848">
    L-3 SSG-Tinsley
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2001 Philips sold off nearly three-fourths of its remaining 24% stake in ASML. Later that year ASML cut 1,400 jobs -- about one-sixth of its workforce -- in the face of the worst downturn yet in the worldwide chip industry. That year the company also changed its name from ASM Lithography Holding to ASML Holding.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Dunn retired as CEO. He was succeeded by Eric Meurice, a veteran executive of
   <company id="61619">
    THOMSON
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   . ASML and
   <company id="51742">
    Nikon
   </company>
   reached a legal settlement on global patent litigation that year, including a cross-licensing agreement. The settlement called for ASML to make an initial payment of $60 million to Nikon, followed by payments of $9 million a year for three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intel and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   , two of the biggest chip makers in the world, licensed ASML's Scattering Bar Technology in 2005, technology that helped improve wafer yield results using ASML equipment. In 2007 ASML acquired Brion Technologies, a developer of software for photolithography optimization, for $270 million in cash. Founded in 2002, Brion became a wholly owned subsidiary of ASML.
