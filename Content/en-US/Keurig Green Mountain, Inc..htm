   subsidiary makes single-cup coffee machines for home and office use, and roasts coffee for its K-Cups and Vue portion packs. Green Mountain also roasts and packages whole bean and ground coffee and supplies apple cider, teas, cocoa, and other beverages wholesale to food stores, resorts, and office-delivery services.

   Keurig Green Mountain's Keurig Kold cold-drink machine arrived stillborn in 2015 amid exceptionally unfavorable customer reviews, citing high price and poor performance. The company ditched the product in less than a year. However, the company in early 2017 announced plans to breathe life back into the Keurig Kold technology via a joint venture with alcoholic drink giant
   <company id="47435">
    AB InBev
   </company>
   . The JV will aim to develop an in-home alcohol drink system, targeted at the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Mountain Coffee Roasters became a giant in the home-and-away coffee business by pursuing an aggressive growth strategy that includes multiple alliances and acquisitions. The coffee company is focused on developing new brewing technologies, expanding beyond North America, expanding its brand offerings and sales channels, and, lastly, getting people to drink more coffee. The growth and adoption of Keurig Single Cup Brewing systems, including the brewer and related portion packs, is central to Green Mountain's growth plan, which envisions a Keurig brewer on every counter and a beverage for every occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, the company continued expanding consumer choice in the Keurig hot beverage system by entering into or extending a number of business relationships across multiple channels and geographies. It partnered with Community Coffee Company to launch illy brand and Laughing Man brand. It also expanded partnerships with

   and

  <p>
   In 1981 Robert Stiller had his first cup of Green Mountain coffee at a small Vermont coffee shop. He was so impressed, he bought the one-store company (using proceeds from the sale of E-Z Wider, the marijuana-rolling-paper-business he co-founded in 1971). Stiller sought a wider market, and in 1984 he began generating word-of-mouth business by donating coffee to charities and civic groups and placing mail-order ads. By 1985 Green Mountain Coffee had four stores and was turning a profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using direct-mail sales as a vanguard, Green Mountain continued its efforts to build a multichannel distribution network. It was successful: Supermarkets began selling Green Mountain coffees, and institutions such as the Harvard Club began serving them. The company added retail locations in the late 1980s and early 1990s and went public in 1993. It had 12 stores by 1994, but earnings suffered as Green Mountain's expansion outpaced its sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began selling its products online in 1995, and Business Express Airlines began serving Green Mountain coffee on its flights in the US and Canada.
   <company id="10448">
    Delta Air Lines
   </company>
   ' shuttle service followed suit the next year. Green Mountain signed a five-year agreement with Mobil Oil (later,
   <company id="108381">
    ExxonMobil
   </company>
   ) in 1997 to provide coffee at its On The Run convenience stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Mountain inked a deal in 1998 with
   <company id="55156">
    American Skiing Company
   </company>
   to supply its nine US ski resorts, including Vermont's Killington and Sugarbush resorts. Also that year it expanded its organic coffee line, revamped its website, and began closing or selling its retail operations to concentrate on its wholesale business; all stores were closed by August 1999. Also in 1999 Green Mountain partnered with Keurig to offer one-cup brewing varieties of its coffees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company agreed to supply coffee to more than 900 (up from nearly 500) ExxonMobil corporately owned convenience stores; as part of the deal, Green Mountain also became the recommended coffee to about 13,000 ExxonMobil dealer and franchise store locations. In mid-2001 Green Mountain purchased the Frontier Organic Coffee brand from Frontier Natural Products Co-op for about $2.4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Mountain began selling coffee under the Newman's Own name in 2003. That year the company signed an agreement with
   <company id="44730">
    Hain Celestial Group
   </company>
   to sell a line of teas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company expanded its Vermont manufacturing and distribution facility with a 52,000-sq.-ft. warehouse and packaging plant. The added space boosted Green Mountain's annual production capacity from 17 million pounds of coffee to 50 million pounds. Also in 2004 the company announced plans to sell Heifer Hope Blend, an organic coffee that generates income for
   <company id="132165">
    Heifer Project International
   </company>
   . The organization provides support and training for coffee farmers in Guatemala.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Mountain has pinned its growth hopes to the trend of "single-cup" brewers. The company had been a minority owner of  single-cup brewing-system manufacturer
   <company id="105284">
    Keurig
   </company>
   since 2002. In 2006 Green Mountain acquired the remaining 65% of Keurig that it did not already own for $104 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007, in conjunction with
   <company id="10800">
    International Paper
   </company>
   , it created an environmentally friendly coffee cup made of corn, natural paper, and water, which, unlike traditional paper cups, breaks down into organic matter after use. Green Mountain uses the cup in all of its US outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2010 Green Mountain acquired Diedrich Coffee at a price of $35 per share following an intense bidding war for the company. In December, Green Mountain acquired Canada-based Van Houtte for CAD$915 million (or about $900 million). Van Houtte roasts and markets gourmet coffee for home and office consumption, and distributes it through its direct-to-store delivery and coffee services networks in Canada and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Robert Stiller was replaced as chairman in May 2012 by Michael Mardy, the company's chairman of the audit and finance committee.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, the company signed an agreement with rival
   <company id="15745">
    Starbucks Corp.
   </company>
   that expands their partnership for the manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and sale of Starbucks and Tazo-branded single-serve packs for use in Green Mountain's Keurig single-serve brewing systems worldwide. The company has a similar agreement with Italy's Lavazza SpA.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Green Mountain consolidated its Canadian coffee and portion pack production at its facility in Montreal. Consequently, it expects to cease production at its facility in Toronto by March 2014. As its grows, Green Mountain continues to assess its manufacturing, distribution, and logistics networks in both the US and Canada.
