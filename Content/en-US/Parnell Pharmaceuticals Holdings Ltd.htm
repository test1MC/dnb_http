   Parnell Pharmaceuticals makes broodmares of livestock. The company manufactures and sells two injectable reproductive hormones to increase pregnancy rates in cattle, and it also has treatments for osteoarthritis in both pets and livestock. estroPLAN and GONAbreed are approved for cattle breeding in a dozen countries, while Zydax, Glyde, and Tergive treat osteoarthritis in dogs and horses. It also offers software to help farmers manage breeding operations, and has a half dozen other drug candidates in development to treat diabetes, dermatological conditions, and laminitis (horse hoof inflammation), among other indications. Parnell Pharmaceuticals went public in the US in mid-2014 and raised $50 million.

  <p>
   The company plans to use the proceeds to repay about $25 million in debt. The remainder will be used to further develop its drug candidates and expand its commercial infrastructure for future product launches, potential acquisitions, or working capital.

  <p>
   Parnell Pharmaceuticals manufactures its products at its plant in Sydney, Australia - a country that knows a thing or two about beef. It also maintains an office in the US (in Kansas, another cattle-centric locale.)

   The company has a sales presence in Australia, New Zealand, and the US and uses
   <company id="160960">
    VÃ©toquinol
   </company>
   as its marketing partner in Canada. In the US, it targets 20 states in the dairy sector. Its products are sold to distributors, veterinarians, and livestock producers.

  <p>
   Overall sales increased in 2013 after estroPLAN and GONAbreed were approved by the FDA for use in the US and in Canada by its regulatory agency. Sales would have been higher except the company ran out of a key ingredient for Zydax and the product was out of stock for a brief time. (The company quickly boosted inventory by contracting with a second ingredient manufacturer to prevent another production hiatus.)

  <p>
   There's plenty of business opportunity in both the market for livestock and companion animals as more people eat beef and indulge their pets. Parnell Pharmaceuticals plans to offer new products for companion animals, such as Glyde Chews, a beef-flavored dog treat to support joint health. It also plans to have its livestock hormones approved for use in China and Europe. Ideally, the company's goal is to launch one new product each year beginning in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the meantime, it would like to use its manufacturing plant as a contract facility for other animal health products. It has the capacity to produce pilot or R&amp;D batches for companies to use in clinical trials.
