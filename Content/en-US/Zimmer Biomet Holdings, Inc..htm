   Zimmer Biomet (formerly Zimmer) can put the spring back in your step or the zing back in your swing. The company designs and markets orthopedic products, including reconstructive implants used in knee or hip replacement surgery, shoulder implants that restore function in arthritic joints, bone and tissue grafting materials, and sports medicine products. It also makes dental implant systems, spinal implants to fix aching or injured backs, and trauma products (such as plates, screws, and pins) that help broken bones to heal. Additionally, Zimmer Biomet makes surgical products used in orthopedic surgeries, including tourniquets and devices for wound cleansing. The firm's products are sold around the globe.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's four primary operating segments are: Americas Spine, Bone Healing, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (CMF), and Dental. Its operations are managed through three major geographic segments: Americas, Asia/Pacific, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).
  </p>
  <p>
   Zimmer Biomet makes most of its money from sales of knee and hip replacement products (63%). Some of its lead products are the Alloclassic hip system, Zimmer M/L taper hip prosthesis, and NexGen knee product line. In addition to knee and hip replacements, the company makes reconstructive systems for extremities, including the Bigliani/Flatow line for shoulder procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its smaller segments, top products include the Tapered Screw-Vent dental implant system, the PathFinder minimally invasive pedicle spine screw system, and the Zimmer locking plate systems for bone fractures. Surgical supplies and other operations make up a fraction of sales and include the Palacos and Hi-Fatigue bone cement surgical products, as well as the Accelero Health Partners unit (surgeon consulting).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Americas segment (largely consisting of US operations) accounts for more than 60% of the company's annual revenues, though sales in international markets (especially in the Asia/Pacific region, which includes such markets as Australia, China, India, and Hong Kong) are rising. Europe, including sales in France, Germany, and the UK, accounts for about a quarter of all revenues. Zimmer Biomet's products are sold in more than 100 countries worldwide, and the company has direct operations in more than 40 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zimmer Biomet's primary manufacturing facilities are located in the US (Warsaw, Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Jacksonville and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and Parsippany, New Jersey), Puerto Rico (Ponce), Ireland (Shannon, Galway), China (Beijing, Changzhou), France (Valence), Germany (Berlin), Spain (Valencia), South Wales (Bridgend), and Switzerland (Winterthur).

  <p>
   Zimmer Biomet sells its orthopedic products directly to health care providers (such as hospitals, surgery centers, and surgeons themselves), as well as to purchasing organizations, distributors, and health care dealers. Its dental products are sold directly to dental practices and laboratories. Zimmer Biomet markets biologic bone and tissue allografts for dental, spinal, and trauma procedures through a partnership with
   <company id="100824">
    RTI Surgical
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The US sales force is made up of direct employees and contracted exclusive agents. European sales are handled by direct associates, support employees, commissioned agents, and independent distributors, while Asia/Pacific sales are handled through a network of dealers and associates. Direct channels account for 80% of the company's net sales.

  <p>
   After net sales had remained flat over the past five years, they increased 28% to $5.9 billion in 2015 due to higher knee and S.E.T. (surgical, sports medicine, biologics, foot and ankle, extremities, and trauma) product sales after Zimmer acquired
   <company id="12777">
    Biomet
   </company>
   that year. In fact, the Biomet acquisition led to higher sales across all product categories in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has fluctuated over the past few years, dropped 80% to $147 million in 2015; this was primarily due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of Biomet. Other related expenses included retention bonuses for Biomet employees and third-party sales agents, as well as severance costs and contract terminations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by operations fell $236.1 million to $816.7 million in 2015 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   Zimmer Biomet works to keep its sales figures on the rise through new product development efforts, as well as by introducing next-generation versions of existing best-sellers that add functionality or ease of use. New products include the 2014 launches of the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, the Persona personal knee system, the JuggerKnotless Soft Anchor device, and the Puros Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) Block and Strip. The firm also conducts substantial R&amp;D work in the field of orthobiologics, or the implantation of biological materials to help repair and regenerate damaged tissue. In 2015 the company added new musculoskeletal offerings; the following year it launched three new hip offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with increasing its sales through product growth, Zimmer Biomet expands through acquisitions, partnerships, and international expansion efforts. The company expects overall industry trends to help keep its sales in the black: The aging US population, chronic obesity, and advances in surgical techniques are all expected to contribute to increased demand for its products. However, the company could continue to see depressed prices in some segments due to economic conditions (causing patients to decrease non-essential expenses) and government and hospital cost-control programs.

   In mid-2015 Zimmer acquired fellow implant maker
   <company id="12777">
    Biomet
   </company>
   for $14 billion. The deal made the combined company the #2 orthopedics seller worldwide, behind
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   . It also doubled Zimmer's knee and dental lines and gave it entry into the lucrative sports medicine business. Upon completion of the transaction, Zimmer took on the Biomet name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company bought Arizona-based Cayenne Medical in a move that strengthens Zimmer's sports medicine operations, including its portfolio of soft tissue reconstruction solutions. To further its presence in the spine disorder business, it then bought Texas-based
   <company id="163088">
    LDR Holding Corporation
   </company>
   for $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Zimmer Biomet acquired Colorado-based Ortho Transmission for an undisclosed price. Ortho Transmission develops skeletal implant technology for limb amputee patients; Zimmer Biomet will utilize the unit's technology as part of its ongoing collaboration with the US Department of Defense, which aims to restore mobility for amputee patients. Other strategic acquisitions include the 2014 purchase of ETEX Holdings, which added products such as CarriGen, Beta-BSM, and Gamma-BSM (all bone void fillers).
