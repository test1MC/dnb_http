   PetroLogistics thinks it's perfectly logical to focus on making one petrochemical at a time. The company operates a 67-acre propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant in Houston that turns propane into propylene, a chemical used in the production of polypropylene. PetroLogistics sells its propylene to three major polypropylene manufacturers --
   <company id="10471">
    Dow
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="104943">
    INEOS
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   , which use it to make petrochemical-based consumer and industrial products such as coatings, paints, plastic parts, reusable containers, ropes, and textiles. The plant has an annual production capacity of about 1.4 billion pounds of propylene. It produced almost 1.3 billion pounds ion 2012.

  <p>
   The company filed a $600 million IPO in June 2011 and went public in 2012, raising $595 million. Pre-IPO, PetroLogistics was majority owned by
   <company id="160696">
    Lindsay Goldberg
   </company>
   and another investment firm, York Capital. The companies continued to be its majority shareholders after the IPO. PetroLogistics used the proceeds from its IPO to pay a distribution to its two investors, their affiliates, its executive officers, and certain employees.
  </p>

  <p>
   The bulk of what PetroLogistics' produces is propylene (97% of 2012 revenues). Propylene is a building block petrochemical used in the production of paints, coatings, building materials, clothing, automotive parts, packaging and a variety of other consumer and industrial products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other 3% came from producing commercial amounts of hydrogen, a mixed stream of butane and butylenes (known as a C4 mix stream), and heavier hydrocarbons (known as a C5+ stream).
  </p>
  <p>
   PetroLogistics has a 10-year contract with
   <company id="15758">
    Praxair
   </company>
   to sell hydrogen, and PetroLogistics also buys nitrogen from Praxair to make propylene. Other key propylene suppliers are
   <company id="57154">
    Enterprise Product Partners
   </company>
   for propane and a subsidiary of
   <company id="161948">
    Kinder Morgan
   </company>
   for natural gas.

  <p>
   Major customers include
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="144901">
    Total Petrochemicals
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="162787">
    INEOS
   </company>
   (with whom the company has multi-year contracts), and
   <company id="106018">
    LyondellBasell Industries
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   PetroLogistics sells the C4 mix stream to specialty chemical consumers and refiners. The C5+ stream (heavy in aromatics) is shipped by its pipeline to a Kinder Morgan terminal, and then sold to a third party.

  <p>
   The company's revenues increased by 22% in 2012, thanks to a 49% growth in production volumes, partially offset by lower propylene prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, net income decreased by more than 300% in 2012 as the result of increased expenses related to expansion and profit enhancement projects at its plant and a loss on derivatives, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   PetroLogistics' strategy is focused on improving the operating performance of its facility and find cost-efficient methods to increase propylene output. It is also pursuing expansion and complementary growth opportunities.

  <p>
   PetroLogistics came about in 2008 when private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg formed an investment company to purchase ExxonMobil's olefins plant in Houston. The olefins plant was decommissioned and developed into a PDH facility, and PetroLogistics was able to retain the existing infrastructure, utilities, permits, logistics, and certain operating units, which saved plenty of time and money over building a petrochemical plant from scratch. The plant, strategically located in Houston's Ship Channel, is the largest "dedicated" PDH facility in the world, but all of PetroLogistics' competitors have diversified operations and produce other chemicals alongside propylene.
