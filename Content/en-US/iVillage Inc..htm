   iVillage offers a cyber retreat for the female Web surfer. The
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   (NBCU)-owned network of websites aims to be the leading online destination for women. The iVillage Network blends expert opinion on a variety of topics (pregnancy and parenting, beauty and style, home and garden, entertainment, and food) with community features (message boards and blogs). In addition to its flagship portal, iVillage operates sites such as iVillage UK, the NBC Digital Health Network, GardenWeb, and Astrology.com. A majority of revenue comes from online advertising. iVillage was founded in 1995. NBCU acquired the business for $600 million in 2006.

   While working as a consultant in 1995,
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   and Q2 shopping channel veteran Candice Carpenter suggested that
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   unite some of its individual communities into a single media brand. Encouraged by executives at the Internet powerhouse, Carpenter founded iVillage with Nancy Evans, founder of
   <i>
    Family Life
   </i>
   magazine, and video producer Robert Levitan in 1995. With backing from
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="43460">
    Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="11508">
    Tribune Media
   </company>
   , and cable giant TCI (later
   <company id="14891">
    AT&amp;T Broadband
   </company>
   ), iVillage launched its first Web site, Parent Soup, on AOL and the Web in early 1996. The company began tailoring the site to women after observing that Parent Soup's audience was largely female.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company created the iVillage Web site and positioned Parent Soup and a handful of other sites (About Work, Better Health &amp; Medical) under that umbrella. iVillage also formed a joint venture with Ourbaby to launch the e-commerce site iBaby. iVillage went public in 1999. Later that year the company acquired full ownership of iBaby and KnowledgeWeb (operator of the Astrology.net Web site), Lamaze Publishing, Family Point, and OnLine Psych. Losses grew and iVillage's stock price eroded during 2000, however, and cable TV veteran Doug McCormick was brought in as CEO to lead the company's reorganization. (Founder Carpenter resigned from the board in 2001.) It sold its iBaby unit and trimmed its staff to cut costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company boosted its online reach by acquiring rival
   <company id="59056">
    Women.com Networks
   </company>
   for about $27 million in stock. As part of the deal, publisher
   <company id="40209">
    Hearst
   </company>
   (an investor in Women.com) invested $20 million into the combined operation for a 25% stake. iVillage also bought Business Women's Network, an information network for the working woman.
  </p>
  <p>
   iVillage's expansion continued as the company acquired Internet promotions firm
   <company id="60119">
    Promotions.com
   </company>
   in 2002 and teen Web site gURL.com from
   <company id="40258">
    Primedia
   </company>
   in 2003. Also that year iVillage purchased the remainder of beauty product information site Substance.com from
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   . More acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 added home and garden site GardenWeb.com to its operations, as well as health care content from Healthology and HealthCentersOnline.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 NBC Universal (NBCU) acquired iVillage and named former Cond√© Nast executive Deborah Fine as the head of the business. Initially, iVillage hit some snags after NBCU's purchase. The parent company attempted to use the acquisition to help extend some of its broadcast brands, such as
   <em>
    Today
   </em>
   , into the realm of digital and interactive media. However, the on-air televised mentions of iVillage initially failed to drive traffic to the website. In response, iVillage made some strategic moves in order to see a growth in visitors; these included a site redesign, as well as forming content partnerships with companies such as
   <company id="61309">
    XO Group
   </company>
   and PopSugar (a celebrity and entertainment site).  In 2007 iVillage sold Promotions.com to
   <company id="138277">
    Corsis Technology Services
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   NBCU also invested in iVillage through the development of a companion TV show,
   <em>
    iVillage Live
   </em>
   , a daytime hour-long women-oriented show. After its launch,
   <em>
    iVillage Live
   </em>
   suffered from low ratings and ceased production in 2007. Months later the show relaunched as
   <em>
    In the Loop with iVillage
   </em>
   . However, it was promptly cancelled in 2008 after failing to increase ratings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fine left iVillage in 2008 in order to head the digital strategy at Universal Television Group. In 2009 the company unveiled a major site redesign that included a new home page, integrated-sponsorship opportunities, and branded tools.
