   In 2012 the company's logistics division rolled out an upgraded Container Asset Recovery Tracking System (C.A.R.T.S.) software program -- developed by the company's Environmental Services Group -- targeted to municipalities and private waste haulers. The software helps customers with Rehrig Pacific's RFID technology to track container collection data in an effort to alleviate container loss and identify non-paying accounts. In 2013 more than 2.8 million of Rehrig Pacific's RFID enabled containers exist in more than 70 different North American locations.
