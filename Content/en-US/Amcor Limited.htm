   Amcor Limited? Hardly. The package maker offers a near unlimited range of boxes, cartons, cans, flexible and film packaging, PET (polyethylene terephthalate plastic) and glass bottles, closures, and sacks. It divides business into several segments. Flexibles, the largest, supplies packaging for fresh and processed food as well as medical products, and folding cartons for tobacco.

    Rigid Plastics
   </company>
   produces PET containers for food and beverages, and some household, personal care, pharmaceutical, and chemical goods. Its Flexibles segment makes flexible and film packaging products for the food and beverage, tobacco, and consumer products industries.

   Amcor Limited operates through a sprawling network of more than 190 sites spanning some 40 countries. It caters to a diverse group of regions: Western Europe, North America, and Emerging Markets each represented about 30% of sales during 2015.

  <p>
   Over 90% of Amcor's sales derive from the food, beverage, health care, and tobacco packaging industries. To target these sectors, the company converts raw materials -- predominately polymers, aluminum foil and fiber -- into its finished products. The costs of those raw materials are generally passed on to customers via contractual arrangements.

  <p>
   Amcor's revenues decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due decreases from its Flexibles segment, which was fueled by the divestiture of its

   operations.

   Amcor has streamlined its operations recently in order to achieve growth. It sold off its Australasia and Packaging Distribution (Orora Limited) business in 2013. The business represented 13% of Amcor's earnings at the time and was focused on the making of fiber packaging, glass wine, and beer bottles, aluminum beverage cans, and wine closures in Australasia and Packaging Distribution in North America.

  <p>
   The company also grows its core business segments and diversifies its geographical portfolio through the use of acquisitions. Throughout 2015 it purchased Zhongshan TianCai Packaging (Chinese flexible packaging business; $44 million), Nampak Flexibles (flexible packaging in South Africa; $85 million), and Souza Cruz's internal tobacco packaging operations in Brazil ($30 million).

  <p>
   Amcor's beginnings can be traced to the 1860s when Samuel Ramsden established a paper mill in Melbourne. The company's predecessor, Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM) Ltd., was established by the 1926 merger of some of Australia's more significant paper companies, including the Australian Paper Mills Company and Sydney Paper Mills. APM, the name by which the company was known until it was changed to Amcor in 1986, began producing pulp in 1938.
  </p>
  <p>
   During WWII, 70% of APM's production was dedicated to the manufacture of ammunition and war equipment, but the company continued to expand its paper mills. At the close of the war, it was the country's largest paper and pulp company and had a monopoly on Australia's wrapping paper and board markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   APM expanded its paper offerings during the 1960s to include tissue products when it formed Kimberly-Clark Australia, a joint venture with US-based Kimberly-Clark. The late 1970s, however, brought about significant diversification for the company when APM purchased Brown &amp; Dureau, a company with holdings in international trading, automotive, retailing, and aviation industries. APM continued to expand its operations during the 1980s with acquisitions that included Containers Packaging (1982) and James Hardie Containers (1986). Also in 1986 the APM changed its name to Amcor Limited and made a slew of plant acquisitions from companies such as Reed Corrugated Containers, J Fielding &amp; Co., United Packages, and Tasmanian Fibre Containers.
