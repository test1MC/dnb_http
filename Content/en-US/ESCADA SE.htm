    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   and

    Saks
   </company>
   . Founded in Munich in 1976 by Margaretha and Wolfgang Ley, ESCADA is owned by its chairman Megha Mittal who acquired the ailing company out of bankruptcy in 2009. The firm changed its name from the German form to ESCADA SE in 2010.

  <p>
   Wolfgang and Margaretha Ley, husband and wife, founded Escada in Munich in 1974 and presented their first collection in 1976. She had been a chief designer with German fashion powerhouse Mondi; he worked in retail and manufacturing. They pooled their talent and a vision for global women's fashions with clever tailoring and a brilliant color palette. The name Escada came from a winning racehorse the couple bet on in Spain. The company sold three lines under the names Escada (upscale tailored looks), Laurel (career apparel), and Cisca (trendier offerings). All of Escada's lines were designed by Margaretha and her team and were made in the company's German factory.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded throughout West Germany, Europe, and Canada. In 1981 it tested in the US and launched in 1982. By 1985 Escada's clothes, shoes, and accessories were carried by upscale stores in 25 countries throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas, Australia, and South Africa, with annual wholesale sales of more than $110 million. As a testament to the company's expansion policy, only a quarter of its sales came from West Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 the Leys took Escada public in Germany, retaining 51%. The public offering fueled expansion as the company began opening its own retail outlets. Escada quickly opened six new, including its first store in the US in New York. A year after going public, the company had $231 million in sales and 35 stores worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Escada bought struggling American look-alike, St. John's Knits, in 1991 and spruced it up with new boutiques in the US and Europe. By 1992 Escada had an $813 million global business and plans for aggressive retail expansion across the US. About that time, things turned dark for the company. Big spending on global expansion, combined with a global slow-down in luxury goods, depleted Escada's 1992 earnings by $63 million, three times analysts' estimates. Investors sold the company's shares like used designer goods at a rummage sale and the stock lost 90% of its value. Adding to the misery, its chief designer, Margaretha, died in 1992 after an illness and surgery. To cope with rising debt, Escada sold its 80% stake in St. John Knits for $117 million in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sale, coupled with layoffs and a shift to foreign production, had the company back on its feet by 1994. Escada launched new lines, including more casual offerings, to keep it ahead of the fashion pack. In 1995 the company formed Escada Development, an accessories division, to complement its cosmetics division, Escada Beaute, which had been formed in 1991. Escada Sport, casual wear, was added in 1996 as Ley completed the changeover to a divisional organization. Even new stores reflected the change, with different floors for couture (evening wear), accessories, cosmetics, and casual wear. In mid-2000 the company revamped again, changing its designer lines, its logo, and the look of products and advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to the 2001 worldwide recession in the luxury goods market, Escada's management decided to jettison the company's European brands to concentrate on the core profitable Escada line. In September 2002 Escada upped its stake in German fashion house Louis Feraud to 90%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Frank Rheinboldt, the CEO responsible for the turnaround of Escada subsidiary PRIMERA, took over as CEO from founder Wolfgang Ley, who remained with Escada in a consulting capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2008 Bruno Sälzer joined ESCADA as CEO, succeeding Jean-Marc Loubier who replaced Rheinboldt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unable to secure financing amid falling sales and earnings, the company in August 2009 filed for bankruptcy protection. In November 2009 ESCADA was sold to Megha Mittal, who became its chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company changed its name from ESCADA AG to ESCADA SE.
