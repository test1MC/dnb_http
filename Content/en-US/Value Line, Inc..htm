        <p><em>
    The Value Line Investment Survey,
   </em>
   which includes one-page reports on 1,700 stocks in nearly 100 industries, is a leading investment publication. Researched by in-house analysts, the survey is updated weekly and sold to individuals, as well as libraries and other institutions.

   The company also earns fees from copyright data, including its ranking system and other proprietary information. Value Line's proprietary Timeliness ranking system predicts price performance for approximately 1,700 actively traded US stocks.

   Founded as Arnold Bernhard &amp; Co. in 1931, Value Line began ranking stocks in 1965. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm of withholding information and improperly taking fees. It denied the charges, but bowed to an injunction against future securities laws violations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The firm reorganized under the Value Line name in 1982 and went public in 1983. After Bernhard's death in 1987, Buttner became CEO. Her style (described as autocratic) and her meager experience in stock analysis translated into corporate turbulence. But in spite of departures and firings that had reduced its workforce by more than 20%, Value Line managed to launch its mutual funds survey in 1993 and offer its surveys online in 1995.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Buttner's twin brother, Arnold Van Hoven Bernhard, filed a lawsuit accusing her of not representing minority shareholders' interests (he held two fewer shares in the firm's holding company than did his sister). Bernhard had been ousted from Value Line company boards in the wake of bitter feuding with his sister. A settlement in which the holding company bought out Bernhard's shares left him with no ties to the company.

   Value Line introduced two new publications in 1998 --
   <i>
    Value Line Small Cap Plus
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Value Line Select.
   </i>
   In 1999 and 2000 it substantially strengthened its website offerings, adding an investing tutorial, portfolio tools, and company reports.
