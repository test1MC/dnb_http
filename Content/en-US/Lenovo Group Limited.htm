   's former low-end server entity into a fast-growing business. Besides ThinkPad-branded commercial PCs, Lenovos turns out tablets, ultrabooks, software, and accessories. Its sales are fairly evenly sourced from the major world markets of China, North America, and Europe.

   Lenovo's personal computer business racks up two-thirds of the company's sales, followed by the mobile phone segment, which supplies about 20% of revenue, and the enterprise group with about 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes many of its own products, but outsources some manufacturing as well.

  <p>
   Hong Kong-based Lenovo serves customers in more than 160 countries. Its three biggest markets, the Americas, China, and Europe, together for about 85% of sales. The Asia/Pacific region generates the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lenovo has operations in more than 60 countries across the globe. It has operational hubs in Beijing, Paris, and North Carolina, and a marketing hub in Bangalore, India. It also has major research centers in Yokohama, Japan, and in China in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. It makes products at plants in China, Singapore, India, Japan, Brazil, Switzerland, and the US.

   Lenovo rebranded itself under the tag line, "Never Stand Still," marking its expansion in size and scope. The rebranding rollout included the company's first conference, Lenovo Tech World, held in Beijing, where it brought users and developers together and touted new products.

   Lenovo's growing stable of products and geographic expansion pushed revenue higher for six years until 2016 (ended March). The company reported a 3% revenue decline to about $45 billion in 2016 from 2015. Lenovo blamed currency fluctuations, reduced PC demand, and smartphone development for the drop. The company said revenue would have increased 3% without the currency impact. The worldwide slowing of the PC market hit Lenovo's biggest business with an 11 revenue drop. Its 6% decline in shipments bettered the industry wide 12% drop and the company also fattened its No. 1 market share. Sales in the mobile business rose 7% even as Lenovo integrated its Motorola Mobility acquisition into its existing phone operations. Enterprise sales, just 10% revenue, jumped a whopping 70% in 2016. Geographically, sales fell in China and North America while growing in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia/Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   A 20% increase in operating expenses wiped out Lenovo's profit and plunged it to a loss of about $130 million in 2016. Costs were higher for usual expenses - sales and administration, selling, and research and development - in 2016. The company also reported costs stemming from the acquisitions of IBM's server business and Motorola Mobility. Then there were costs associated from a restructuring and realignment of the company's businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even with the loss, Lenovo's cash from operations increased to more than $290 million in 2016 from about $240 million in 2015.

   Lenovo has been adept at building a $45 billion revenue company from parts that other companies didn't want. It bought its world-leading PC business from IBM in 2005 and added IBM's x86 server business in 2014 as Big Blue de-emphasized hardware. Lenovo in 2014 bought the Motorola Mobility phone business from Google, which, at that time, couldn't find the right touch for the phone business.
  </p>
  <p>
   With those assets, Lenovo has established itself as the market leader in the shrinking, but still huge, PC market; as developer of competitive smartphones; and a fast-growing provider of servers for data centers. The company realigned its corporate structure n 2016 to better exploit those businesses. The PC and Smart Device Business Group handles PCs as well as tablets, detachables, gaming and other smart devices. The Mobile Business Group handles smartphones with sub-units focusing on China and emerging markets. The Data Center Group develops high performance servers for the converged/hyperconverged, cloud, and hyperscale markets. A fourth unit, Lenovo Capital and incubator Group, funds startups and explores new technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's emphasis on servers comes at time when the market might be right for relatively new play to step up. Competitors have dealt with mega-merger (Dell Technologies which swallowed
   <company id="10491">
    EMC
   </company>
   ) and super splits (
   <company id="163421">
    Hewlett Packard Enterprise
   </company>
   , which resulted from the breakup of Hewlett-Packard. Lenovo competes with
   <company id="10723">
    HP Inc.
   </company>
   in the PC business). That could leave an opening for a single-minded provider such as Lenovo. The company has also leveraged relationship with companies like Nutanix,
   <company id="91277">
    SAP
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="54603">
    Juniper Networks
   </company>
   , and others to develop applications and gain a faster path of customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In phones, the Motorola acquisition and a good amount of development work (as well as draining inventory of old models) propelled the business to account for more than 20% of Lenovo's revenue. The competition, however, is stiff throughout the world, but particularly in China. Telecom equipment maker
   <company id="59788">
    Huawei
   </company>
   has emerged as the dominant player in the world's largest phone market. Other top smartphone sellers in China are Oppo, Xiaomi, and
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   . That might be why Lenovo has set its sights on other emerging markets such as Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region. The 83% revenue growth for smartphones in the EMEA region in 2016 was largely driven by sales in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lenovo is developing more products such as digital assistants and virtual reality hardware.

   In the last two years Lenovo has made acquisitions to beef up its hardware offerings and support expansion in select markets. In 2014 it paid more than $5 billion to acquire two new major product lines. First it bought
   <company id="10796">
    IBM's

   low-end x86 server business for $2.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, Lenovo spent some $2.9 billion for

   from
   <company id="59101">
    Google

  <p>
   Liu Chuanzhi, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who wrote industry research reports, established Legend Group Holdings Co. in 1984 in Beijing. Backed by a modest investment from the academy, Liu, who went on to become something of an entrepreneurial hero in China, and 10 other engineers were given a green light to form a retail business. They first bought and sold items ranging from TVs to roller skates, but later focused on distributing computer products and eventually moved into manufacturing PCs for
   <company id="12500">
    AST Research
   </company>
   . Legend introduced its first proprietary product, a Chinese character system for PCs, in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 the company formed Legend Holdings Limited, which was originally a Hong Kong-based PC distributor. The following year the parent company began designing and manufacturing motherboards and added systems integration services to its offerings. In 1990 China reduced import tariffs, a move that opened the trade door for companies such as
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   . That year Legend Group Holdings began making its own brand of PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legend Holdings went public in 1994, and the following year began absorbing operations from its parent company, which retained approximately 60% ownership in the subsidiary. By 1996 it was tied with IBM for PC market share in China; it became the country's top brand the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 parent company Legend Group Holdings transferred Beijing Legend Group to its Hong Kong-based subsidiary. The following year
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   , looking to extend its operating system dominance into China, teamed up with Legend Holdings to create set-top boxes. In 2000 the company partnered with Pacific Century CyberWorks to provide broadband Internet services. The following year Legend spun off its distribution business,
   <company id="145421">
    Digital China
   </company>
   , as a separate public company. In 2001 Yang Yuanqing was named CEO of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Legend Holdings changed its English company name to Legend Group Limited. The company launched a corporate brand, Lenovo, the following year, and in 2004 it officially adopted Lenovo as its English name. It also sold its non-telecom IT services business to AsiaInfo Holdings, renamed
   <company id="99544">
    AsiaInfo-Linkage
   </company>
   , in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lenovo acquired IBM's worldwide PC operations for approximately $1.75 billion in 2005. IBM executive Stephen Ward was named CEO of Lenovo at the time of the merger, but he was replaced by William Amelio before year's end. Amelio headed
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   's Asia/Pacific operations before joining Lenovo. In 2006 Lenovo launched a unit called Lenovo Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Lenovo stopped using the IBM PC brand, to which it still held the rights, and began offering only Lenovo-branded machines. The following year it sponsored and supported the Olympic Summer Games in Beijing, providing more than 30,000 pieces of equipment and 600 engineers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to focus on its core PC operations, Lenovo sold its mobile phone business, Lenovo Mobile Communications, to Hony Capital in 2008. Hony, the private equity arm of Legend Holdings, paid $100 million for the unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year later Lenovo bought back the mobile communications business for about $200 million in cash and stock. The company cited the growth of the mobile Internet market and the increasing convergence between the PC and wireless handset sectors for the about-face in product strategy. Lenovo's move came as Dell introduced a mobile phone for the Chinese market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citing a flagging economy, Lenovo announced a restructuring plan in 2009 that included a workforce reduction of 11%, executive pay cuts, and the consolidation of its China and the Asia/Pacific units. The company also initiated a management shakeup, including its chairman taking over as CEO. The change may in part have reflected a strategy shift for Lenovo. With corporate spending flagging, particularly in the US, the company planned to focus on China and other emerging markets, with an emphasis on consumers.
