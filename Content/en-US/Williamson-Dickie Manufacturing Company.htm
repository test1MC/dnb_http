   Appreciated by the working class and the sophomore class, Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing makes Dickies branded khaki pants, bib overalls, jeans, women's and children's apparel, and Workrite fire-resistant uniforms. It also makes apparel and footwear for work and outdoor use under the Kodiak and Terra names. Its work clothes, originally tailored for the blue-collar set, are in fashion with young people, who account for a growing portion of sales. Its products are sold worldwide by major retailers (such as

   Dickies goes to work to get its name out. Through partnerships with other companies, the workwear company peddles a variety of lines, such as bags, belts, socks, headwear, junior girls' clothing, footwear, and kidswear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years Dickies has concentrated on expanding its products portfolio through licensing agreements and acquisitions. Looking to attract customers in a growing niche of the apparel market, Dickies enlisted the help of Strategic Partners to design, produce, and distribute Dickies-branded apparel and footwear specific to the medical industry. A deal with Magla Products, which specializes in hand-safety gear and related cleaning items, allows Dickies to sell work gloves and compete head-to-head with Ã¼ber gloves maker

  <p>
   On the international front, in 2013 Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing launched Dickies.mx, an online Spanish language site for Mexico. Mexico is an important market for the company with huge growth potential.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company signed an exclusive licensing agreement allowing ID Overseas to sell Dickies licensed workwear in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Back home, it signed a licensing agreement for Jerry Leigh of California to become the exclusive licensee for Dickies juniors' apparel.
