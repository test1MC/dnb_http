   Once unleashed, there was no putting Vitro back in the bottle. Since 1909 Mexico's #1 glassmaker has poured itself into two businesses operating in the Americas and Europe. The largest, its Glass Containers segment, produces glass and aluminum products for wine and beer, food and beverage, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. A Flat Glass segment builds construction glass for exterior and interior finishing touches, as well as tempered glass, such as bulletproof shields, soundproof windows, and reflective sheets. Vitro also supplies automotive OEMs with windshields, dashboards, and bumpers. In mid-2015,

   In 1909 a group of investors purchased some bottle-making machinery and established Vidriera Monterrey. The company was created to support the operations of Cervecería Cuauhtémoc, a brewery founded by Francisco Sada to make Carta Blanca beer. By 1927 Vidriera Monterrey had become one of Mexico's first companies to export to Guatemala. The following year the company established Vidrio Plano, a flat glass company. Vidriera Monterrey created Vidriera México in 1934 to serve glass container customers in the central and southern states of Mexico. By 1935 Vidriera Monterrey was also exporting to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
