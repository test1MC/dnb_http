   BMW is moving ahead with several projects that will make their way to the US over the next few years. Electric models, known as Project i vehicles, are being sold in the US, following a 2013 market release. The new cars are marketed under the electric i3 and i8 model names.

   BMW North America is expanding the production capacity at its plant in South Carolina, which is the exclusive manufacturing plant for all X5 and X6 sports activity vehicles. The company is investing some $900 million to boost capacity from 160,000 vehicles per year to 350,000 by 2014.

   BMW is positioned with its luxury model lines for when luxury becomes fashionable again, and the company believes it will. The company's optimism stems from its broad choice of BMW styles and models, as well as the fact that it still offers financing to customers. The BMW Certified Pre-Owned business brings new and younger customers to the brand.
