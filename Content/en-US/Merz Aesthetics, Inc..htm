   While some believe that wrinkles are a sign of wisdom and experience, Merz Aesthetics caters to a different clientele. The company's Radiesse is an injectable dermal filler used mainly for cosmetic reasons to temporarily mask wrinkles brought on by aging or loss of fat; it is also used to plump up folds in the vocal chords of patients who have speech impairments due to stroke. Radiesse is sold directly to dermatologists and plastic surgeons in the US and Europe and through distributors elsewhere. Merz's other key products -- focused on the treatment of frowns, wrinkles, and spider veins --  are Xeomin, Belotero, and Asclera. Previously named BioForm Medical, the company is a subsidiary of Germany's

   Although focused primarily on aesthetics, the company also has an injectable device (Coaptite) used to treat urinary tract abnormalities in women. The device is sold in the US through distribution partner

   Merz Aesthetics (then BioForm Medical) was acquired by Germany-based

    Merz

   for $253 million in 2010. The acquisition gave Merz' US operations, Merz Pharmaceuticals, a broader development pipeline of products. BioForm's operations were kept intact and used as the base to build up the Merz Pharmaceuticals' aesthetics business.
