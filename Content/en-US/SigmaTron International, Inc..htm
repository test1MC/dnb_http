   An assembly at SigmaTron International doesn't mean fraternizing over a keg. The company produces electronic components, printed circuit board assemblies, and box-build (completely assembled) electronic products on a contract basis for customers in the appliance, automotive, consumer electronics, fitness equipment, industrial electronics, and telecommunications industries. SigmaTron also offers design, testing, shipping, and storage services. Major customers include electronic controls manufacturer Spitfire Controls and fitness equipment maker

   , together accounting for nearly half of sales. Besides its US manufacturing facilities, the company boasts plants in China, Mexico, and Taiwan.

   The appliances market, which looks to SigmaTron for its household appliance controls, accounts for a growing share of SigmaTron's revenue. Indeed, the market generated 49% of 2014 sales, up from 41% in 2013. Industrial electronics, such as motor controls, power supplies, lighting products, scales, and joysticks, brought in another 31% in SigmaTron's 2014 revenue.

   SigmaTron caters to customers across several sectors, from appliances to fitness and gaming. The company enjoys a concentrated customer base, with its top five clients accounting for nearly two-thirds of sales. In general, it does not have long-term purchasing contracts with its customers, which place orders based on demand.

  <p>
   Increased demand in fitness, gaming, sciences, industrial electronics, and semiconductors has bolstered SimgaTron's business in recent years post-recession. Razor thin profit margins, however, are typical in the contract electronics manufacturing industry. SigmaTron must compete with multinational manufacturers with greater financial resources.

  <p>
   SigmaTron typically grows through acquisitions. The company purchased Spitfire Control, a manufacturer of electronic controls mainly for the consumer appliance industry in North America. The 2012 deal added manufacturing sites in Chihuahua, Mexico, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to SigmaTron's operations.

   Sales increases from the consumer electronics, appliances, and the medical/life sciences markets helped SigmaTron post $222.5 million in revenue in fiscal 2014 (ended April), representing a 12% boost from 2013's $198.4 million. Additionally, SigmaTron logged a profit of $2.9 million during the reporting period, an increase of $2.4 million from 2013. While the company's cash flow has fluctuated during the past five years, in 2014 SigmaTron reported a cash flow from operations of $1.7 million.

  <p>
   In 1990 an investment partnership led by Circuit Systems bailed out struggling STI Electronics (including its Mexican subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico) and renamed it SigmaTron. In 1993 and 1994 the company found a niche manufacturing closed-captioning decoders. But this evaporated when the US government mandated that televisions made in the US after July 1993 contain captioning capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   SigmaTron went public in 1994. That year it formed a joint venture, SMT Unlimited, to provide surface mount technology assembly services. (SigmaTron owned 42.5% of SMT; it bought full interest in 2004.) In 1995 SigmaTron won a three-year manufacturing contract to make carbon monoxide detectors for NSI. (NSI and SigmaTron continued to operate under the terms of the agreement without a written extension.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Aggressive selling and a growing reputation in the industry combined to nearly double SigmaTron's sales from 1995 to 1997, before a glut of cheaper Asian goods contributed to a slump in demand, resulting in lowered sales and profits in fiscal 1998. In April 1998, only months after SigmaTron's Acuna, Mexico, plant more than tripled in size, flooding along the Rio Grande hit the plant and the company's nearby warehouse in Del Rio, Texas, forcing production to be cut in half. However, by October SigmaTron's manufacturing was back to 90% of preflood levels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999, SigmaTron signed a patent licensing agreement with the Lemelson Medical, Education and Research Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired full ownership of privately held SMT Unlimited, also a contract manufacturer, in 2004. Also that year SigmaTron expanded manufacturing operations by opening a plant in China. The following year SigmaTron acquired Able Electronics, a contract manufacturer that had facilities in Mexico and the US. The company sold its Las Vegas manufacturing facility in 2005 to Grand Products Nevada.
