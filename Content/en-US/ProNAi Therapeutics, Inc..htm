   DNA is the basic genetic building block for human life. It is also the backbone of Sierra Oncology (formerly ProNai Therapeutics). Sierra is a clinical-stage biotech company developing a class of therapeutics based on its proprietary DNA interference (DNAi) technology platform. Its sole product candidate, PNT2258, targets an oncogene that has been linked to many forms of cancer; it has seen promise in early trials of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphona. The firm has initiated Phase 2 trials of PNT2258 to investigate its efficacy in targeting diffuse large B-cell lymphona and Richter's transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It may seek orphan drug status for PNT2258. The company went public in mid-2015.

  <p>
   The company raised $137.7 million in its initial public offering, within its expected range of between $124.4 million and $143.6 million. It intends to use the net proceeds to fund its PNT2258 trials and to broaden its portfolio of DNAi-based product candidates. The remainder will be used for general corporate purposes and to possibly acquire complementary products, firms, and/or technologies.

  <p>
   Cancer is the leading cause of death in the developed world, and demand for cancer treatments is tremendous. ProNAi's expertise lies in its understanding of DNAi oligonucleotides, which are DNA sequences that modulate the transcription of potentially cancer-causing genes. The company's next-generation therapies target DNA itself by interfering with the expression of those genes. (This is differentiated from most cancer therapies, which targets the protein level or RNA.)
  </p>
  <p>
   ProNAi does not manufacture PNT2258; rather, it contracts with third parties to meet its manufacturing needs. The company plans to continue using third-party manufacturers if and when PNT2258 receives regulatory approval, as well as for any other future potential product candidates.

  <p>
   ProNAi leases its headquarters in Vancouver, as well as office and laboratory space in Plymouth, Michigan.

  <p>
   The company has yet to market its products, but it plans to directly market them in the future to cancer specialists in North America. In other major markets, it will either seek to collaborate with others for the commercialization of its products, or it will directly market them itself.

  <p>
   As a clinical-stage firm, ProNAi has yet to sell any products or be profitable. It has incurred significant losses since its 2003 inception, and it expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. At the end of 2014 its debt totaled $23.9 million.

  <p>
   ProNAi's priority is advancing its lead candidate PNT2258 for approval and subsequent commercialization. It is also working to build its product portfolio, utilizing its DNAi platform to target cancer and other diseases.
