   One man's trash is another man's brilliant idea. Mascoma Corporation's plan is to make a chemical used in cellulosic ethanol, a renewable fuel made from the waste products of plants, such as wood and agricultural by-products. The company invented genetically-modified yeasts and bacteria that aid in the fermentation of feedstocks and help turn it into biofuel and other chemicals. So far it has only produced test batches of its Mascoma Grain Technology (MGT), but Mascoma plans to begin selling it commercially to corn ethanol producers in 2012 as a less expensive alternative to other enzymes. The company filed a $100 million IPO in 2011 but withdrew it in 2013, citing unfavorable market conditions.

   In the US, corn ethanol is an additive in unleaded gasoline, and Mascoma claims its MGT can lower the production cost of making corn ethanol by one or two cents per gallon. While corn-based ethanol is more eco-friendly than petroleum, there are concerns about its sustainability in terms of the energy it takes to plant and harvest corn, as well as the affect it has on corn prices. Mascoma plans on marketing MGT to the more than 200 corn ethanol plants in the US.

   The company's other product takes on cellulosic ethanol, hailed as a superior alternative to corn ethanol in that it doesn't require any new crops to be grown. Mascoma has tested its cellulosic ethanol production capabilities at a demonstration facility in New York that successfully produced 200,000 gallons. It signed a deal with
   <company id="11574">
    Valero
   </company>
   in January 2011 to develop a commercial-scale biorefinery in Michigan. The plant would produce 40 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol from hardwood pulpwood annually, and the project has received subsidies from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   . Under the deal, which is not set in stone, Valero will invest up to $50 million. The company also has a second plant planned for Drayton Valley, Alberta, which has received a small ($800,000) grant from the Canadian government and could be built in 2013.

   As a development-stage company, Mascoma has benefitted from government grants for clean energy, which accounted for 86% of revenue in 2010. Only 10% of sales came from product sales for equipment used in the pretreatment of biomass feedstocks. Mascoma has an accumulated deficit of $138 million and expects net losses to continue as it has not yet commercialized any products or technologies. The company planned to use the net proceeds from its IPO to get its business up and running, specifically, for marketing initiatives for MGT and building the cellulosic ethanol plant.

   Macoma was founded in 2005 by Chief Development Officer Charles Wyman and Chief Science Officer Lee Lynd, two scientists who spent their careers researching and developing biofuels. The company is named after Lake Mascoma in New Hampshire, where Wyman has a summer home.
