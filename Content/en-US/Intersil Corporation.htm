   Intersil makes transfer of power an orderly process, at least in electronics. Its line of semiconductor devices for power management include power regulators, converters and controllers, power modules, amplifiers and buffers, proximity and light sensors, data converters, video decoders and interfaces. Its products are components in data centers, computers, smartphones, autos, and a range of other applications. Almost three-quarters of its sales are to customers in Asia. In 2017 Intersil was bought by
   <company id="161701">
    Renesas Electronics
   </company>
   for $3.2 billion.
  </p>

  <p>
   Intersil's products should fit nicely with the microcontroller business of Renesas. Having Intersil technology on board should help Renesas further its penetration of the automotive market, a growing area for semiconductor companies. Intersil became a wholly owned subsidiary of Renesas after the transaction closed in early 2017.

  <p>
   Intersil's industrial and infrastructure division, which addresses power, automotive, aerospace, and broad-line industrial applications, accounted for 64% of sales in 2014. Products in the company's computing division, 21% of sales, provide power management functions for personal computers, including ultrabooks, notebooks and desktops. The consumer division, 15%, makes devices for gaming consoles and systems.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As a region, Asia accounts for 73% of Intersil's sales. China, by itself, makes up 50% of sales. The next highest country is the US with about 18%. Countries in Europe generate about 8% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Based in Milpitas, California, Intersil has sales and design operations around the world. It has a manufacturing plant in Florida where it makes about 13% of its products. The rest of production is handled by contract manufacturers including Global Foundries,
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics Corporation
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   About 60% of revenue comes through distributors and value-added resellers. Avnet Inc. accounted for about 18% of revenue and WPG Holdings Ltd. for just more than 10% in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
   Intersil's revenue fell by about 2% to $562.5 million in 2014 from 2013. Sales in its industrial and infrastructure division rose 6% (nearly $19 million) in 2014 from 2013, but sales were off 1% ($1.2 million) in computing. Intersil's de-emphasis of lower-margin products in its consumer division was reflected in the 26% ($30 million) drop in sales the unit posted in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income, on the other hand, rocketed 1,800% higher to $55 million in 2014 from $2.8 million in 2013. The main reason was that Intersil didn't carry the burden of a $28 million restructuring charge it took in 2013. Reductions in head count and other factors also reduced expenses in 2014. Cash flow from operations fell to $73 million in 2014 from about $107 million the year before.

  <p>
   Intersil has made power management its focus, shedding most of its connectors business. The restructuring began in 2013 and was largely completed by 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The main focus of the refocusing is toward the company's industrial and infrastructure applications for growing markets such with power management needs. They include data centers, communications infrastructure, and industrial applications with a desire for better energy efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another area is automotive and aerospace markets. For automotive, the company makes video circuits for the growing use of cameras in autos and power products for the increasing demands of monitoring and managing power in hybrid and electric vehicles. For aerospace applications, the company makes components for satellites bombarded by high radiation as they sail through space.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Intersil expanded its line of radiation hardened (rad hard) devices to include the ISL71091SEH10, 20, 33, and 40. The product offers stable output voltage noise and a reference voltage, providing better precision in data acquisition, signal processing, and power management.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced a Single-Chip Display Power and LED driver for smartphones in 2014. It incorporates display power and backlight LED driver functions in a single chip, which improves efficiency and increases battery life.
  </p>
  <p>
   A product that could improve efficiency for product such as battery powered drills are Intersil's First Half and Full-Bridge Drivers for multi-cell lithium-ion battery devices. They provide a safety feature that prevents voltage kickback, a leading cause of damage and deterioration of lithium-ion batteries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made no acquisitions in 2014, but maintains the possibility to do so in order to add to its power management product line.

  <p>
   Intersil is a venerable corporate name in Silicon Valley. A semiconductor company by that name was founded in 1967 and acquired in 1981 by
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   . Intersil continued under its own name and GE ownership until 1988, when the business was sold to
   <company id="10709">
    Harris
   </company>
   and became part of Harris Semiconductor. Intersil retained products and technology from GE Solid State and RCA Semiconductor. Harris Semi was sold in 1999 to an entity known as Intersil Holding Corp., reviving the Intersil name. The new Intersil went public in early 2000. Intersil Holding changed its name to Intersil Corp. the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intersil went through a series of acquisitions and divestitures in shaping its product portfolio. Intersil exited the markets for discrete power and automotive chips in 2001, selling the product line to
   <company id="53008">
    Fairchild Semiconductor
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has ventured in and out of several business since the turn of 2000. Its current emphasis is on power management semiconductor devices for a range of applications from aerospace and automotive to computers and smartphones.
