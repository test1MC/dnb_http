   "Essence of taste" is the literal translation of "AJI-NO-MOTO," which is a trademark and brand name for the monosodium glutamate (MSG) product manufactured and marketed by Japan's largest seasoning maker, Ajinomoto. In addition to MSG, the company makes foodstuffs, such as HON-DASHI flavor seasonings,
