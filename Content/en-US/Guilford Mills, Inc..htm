   Guilford operates through two product lines: automotive products and specialty products. Automotive produces fabrics for a number of automotive interior applications, including seat fabric, while specialty products produces high-technology fabrics for diverse end markets including water filtration, window covering, performance apparel, medical, and other industrial applications.

   Guilford and 50 of the largest US textile mills generate about 60% of total textile industry revenue. Though referred to as "mills" -- because fabric was originally created using water power -- these companies are indeed factories. Guilford Mills' textiles are made by automated machinery, including yarn spinning machines, knitting machines, and looms. The company holds over 25 worldwide patents.

   James Hornaday began Guilford Mills in 1946 with two knitting machines and six employees in the warehouse of his feed-and-seed store. By 1957 the company had 120 employees. Charles Hayes joined Guilford in 1961 to head a new dyeing and finishing plant. Energetic, direct, and fast-living (at one time he was married to a
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy
   </company>
   bunny), Hayes became president in 1968 and led the company through technological innovation and acquisitions. Guilford went public in 1971. It expanded in the 1970s by acquiring plants and moving into the automotive industry, using a technology developed for apparel to make car headliners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Guilford doubled its sales by adding six companies between 1984 and 1989, but it had difficulty absorbing the operations and working with new circular knit technology. Contributing to the company's problems, Hayes gave up day-to-day operations to focus on acquisitions and Guilford's international growth. When sales fell and the company incurred an $8 million loss in 1990, Hayes became president again and turned Guilford around, posting a $15.9 million profit the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company bought Hofmann Laces, a maker of lace fabrics for intimate apparel and home furnishings, but cheap imports hurt the company in 1998. So did accounting irregularities at Hofmann Laces, which led to earnings restatements and shareholders' lawsuits. Battling cheap Asian imports and a slow economy, Guilford began restructuring its operations in 2000. It closed several US apparel plants and moved some operations to its Mexico facilities. Hayes stepped down as president and CEO that year to serve as chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002, Guilford sold its entire home fashions unit (which produces window curtains, comforters, sheets, and shower curtains) to British-based Broome &amp; Wellington. Defaulting on its loans, which had ballooned to $270 million, Guilford Mills filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2002. The company emerged about six months later with $135 million in debt and lenders owning 90% of the company. Chairman and former president and CEO Charles Hayes died in 2002. Guilford closed and sold its manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Mexico, and Portugal in 2002 and 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. purchased the company for about $98 million.
