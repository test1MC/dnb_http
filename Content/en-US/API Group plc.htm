   There's no need to put out an APB (all points bulletin) to find an API product. Subsidiaries of the international holding group make and distribute materials used in graphics and packaging for a diversity of high consumption products, from tobacco to food, beverage, and luxury and consumer goods. Holographic and metallic foils and laminated-board papers are their specialty, touted to deliver impact finishes and labeling effects demanded by big brand lines. In addition to packaging, API's global manufacturing and distribution network caters to such applications as greeting cards, printed plastics, and security holograms for tickets.

  <p>
   API targets the industrial markets in Europe, North America, and Australasia from production operations in the UK and US. The UK accounts for 21% of net sales, while the rest of Europe generates 58%.

  <p>
   API reports through four segments: Laminates, 52% of sales; Foils Europe, 24%; Foils America, 19%; and Holographics, 5%. Operating through subsidiary API Laminates Limited in Poynton in the UK, the Laminates segment claims to be world's biggest maker of custom, high-volume laminated board.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foils Europe and Foils America produce metallic foil for decorative packaging; cold foil, an alternative to hot stamping foil; decorative holographic foil for more shelf appeal; and pigment foil, used for date coding and other functions that require durability. Clients have included

  <p>
   API's revenues increased 2% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increased sales from Laminates and Foils Europe. Its net income, however, declined from 2013 to 2014 due to an increase in tax expenses.

  <p>
   API continues to focus on such key sectors as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, document security (especially for Holographics), and perfumes, cosmetics, and personal care. By segment, Holographics has been focusing on national state printers of tax stamps. The Laminates segment has a new lamination machine, and Foils Europe has created a new sales and distribution hub in Warsaw, Poland. More generally the Foils Europe segment has a separate management team tasked with overhauling operations. Foils Americas has positioned itself for healthy growth by implementing lower operating costs.
