   In the world of electrical equipment, Magnetek is a power player. Among the largest, the company makes digital power and motion-control systems. The systems comprise radio remote controls, programmable drives, and collision-avoidance devices used in overhead cranes and hoists. Its DC drives and integrated subsystems are used to control high rise, high speed elevators. Magnetek also offers power inverters, which direct AC power from generator to utility grid, for wind turbines and other renewable energy projects. In late 2015, Magnetek was acquired by material handling products maker

   for roughly $189 million.

   Magnetek is headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. It has manufacturing facilities in Pittsburgh and Bridgeville, Pennsylvania. It also has a manufacturing and sales facility in Ontario, Canada, and an office in Bedford, UK. The US market generates 88% of its total revenue.

   The company sells largely to North American OEMs of industrial cranes and hoists, mining equipment, and elevators, as well as building and renewable energy contractors and systems integrators.

   Magnetek banks on the development of new products to fuel sales and maintain its financial footing. In 2011 Magnetek rolled out a liquid-cooled wind inverter used in wind turbines. Targeting another green sector, Magnetek unveiled an energy-saving drive used in building modernizations, as well as completed development of its first elevator drive in a series dedicated to larger alternating current (AC) control systems.

   In its wireless control offerings, the company added a new radio remote control. The line expands its material handling base from cranes and hoists to mobile hydraulic equipment. It evolved from an earlier acquisition of assets held by Enrange, a manufacturer of wireless radio remote controls for material handling and other industrial outlets.

  <p>
   Magnetek was formed by the 1984 LBO of Litton Industries' Magnetics Group. Charles "Tex" Thornton founded Litton in 1954 and expanded the high-tech company through internal growth and acquisitions. The always acquisitive Litton bought Louis Allis, a maker of specialty electric motors, generators, and condensers, in 1967. Litton then gathered several of its electronics products companies into one business unit, the Magnetics Group.

   In the mid-1970s Magnetics Group workers developed the first high-efficiency electric motor, the E-plus, which set the energy-efficiency standard for a decade. In 1984, however, Litton's efforts at streamlining and focusing on core operations led to the sale of the Magnetics Group. The owners of the newly named Magnetek -- some of whom were from Michael Milken's Drexel Burnham Lambert -- infused the company with $88 million in junk bond proceeds. Magnetek's primary operations included integral horsepower motors, lighting ballasts, drives and controls, and small transformers.
