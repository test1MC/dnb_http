   Premium Brands is an under-rated link in the food-industry chain. Its cornucopia of specialty deli meat, sausage, and convenience foods are sold under such brand names as Grimm's, Harvest, Hygaard, McSweeney's, and Quality Fast Foods. The company uses traditional grocery distributors to channel its lineup to major Canadian food retailers. In addition, its Direct Plus Food Group, one of the largest direct-to-store distribution networks in western Canada, supplies small groceries, convenience stores, and gas stations. The company serves some 26,000 customers in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as well as in the US states Washington and Nevada.

   As with all Canadian meat processors, the discovery of a single BSE-infected cow in Alberta eroded Premium Brands' bottom line during 2003. Exports to Japan were interrupted; the company offset its loss of US exports by shifting some of its processing into the US and using US meat processors as co-packers for its US brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Making a further step up from luncheon meats, in 2004 Premium Brands plunked down $6.5 million to purchase Hygaard Fine Foods, a maker of pre-packaged sandwiches in western Canada. Later that same year, the company sold off its processed meats operations to Quality Meat Group, but struck a supply-and-marketing agreement with the company.

   In 2006 Premium Brands snapped up US sausage and processed meats company, Hempler Foods, and merged it with the snack meats operations it already owned in the US. It acquired two more companies, Pop's E-Z Popcorn &amp; Supply (concession equipment) and Gloria's Catering (fresh sandwich maker). Proving to be a busy year for the company, in 2006 Premium Brands also bought the Bread Garden chain and convenience-food supplier Creekside Custom Foods from

    The Spectra Group of Great Restaurants
   </company>
   for about $4 million in 2006. The Bread Garden consists of express locations situated in retail outlets offering such to-go items as sandwiches, bakery, and beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   As an operation not in line with its growth plans, in 2006 the company closed down its home-delivery operations, Goodlife Foods.
