   Electronic Systems reported $392 million in sales in 2015, a 7% decrease versus 2014. A slowdown in defense spending by the US led to a 12% decline in Electronic Systems's military and space revenue. Sales to the commercial aerospace market, however, rose 10% in 2015 over 2014.

  <p>
   LaBarge Pipe and Steel was founded in 1953 by Pierre LaBarge. In 1968 LaBarge merged with Dorsett Electronics, an Oklahoma-based manufacturer of electronics for the aerospace, communications, and medical industries, to form LaBarge Inc. By 1992 defense contracts accounted for nearly three-fourths of the company's sales. With the end of the Cold War, cuts in military spending and large defense-contractor mergers forced LaBarge to seek new markets for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 LaBarge acquired SOREP Technology, a specialist in oil exploration and development products, and formed a joint venture (LaBarge Clayco Wireless) with Clayco Construction, a Houston-based manufacturer of telecommunications electronics. In 1998 LaBarge bought 10% of telecommunications company Open Cellular Systems (network systems that monitor remote industrial equipment) and formed NotiCom with Global Research Systems to make devices that give notice of approaching vehicles such as school buses. The same year LaBarge sued Transmedica for allegedly giving the Laser Lancet technology to a third company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Poor oilfield equipment sales and a slump in the military/aerospace market prompted LaBarge to obtain the rest of Open Cellular Systems and expand its network technologies business in 1999. The following year LaBarge began to trim its operations, selling LaBarge Clayco Wireless (telecommunications services) and ending its involvement in Noticom, a joint venture with Global Research Systems. LaBarge secured a $3.2 million deal in 2002 with
   <company id="106181">
    Raytheon Electronic Systems
   </company>
   to provide fiber-optic components for the F-22 Raptor, a stealth fighter plane.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 LaBarge was acquired by Ducommun Inc. for $340 million. LaBarge was combined with Ducommun's Technologies segment and renamed Ducommun LaBarge Technologies.
