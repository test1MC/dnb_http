   Cooperation is a refined art and refining a cooperative art for the National Cooperative Refinery Association (NCRA), which provides its member owners, farm supply cooperatives

   , and
   <company id="111147">
    MFA Oil
   </company>
   , with gasoline and diesel fuel through its oil refinery in McPherson, Kansas. The refinery's production rate is 85,000 barrels per day. Fuel from the refinery is allocated to member/owners on the basis of ownership percentages. In addition to the refinery, NCRA owns

   , stakes in two other pipeline companies, and an underground oil storage facility.

        <p>
   NCRA's logistical system includes 76 trucks. (In 2012 almost 40,000 barrels per day of crude was gathered from more than 6,000 oil wells, mainly in Kansas, and transported to the McPherson refinery by truck.)
  </p>
        <p>
   The system also includes more than 1,000 miles of pipelines to move crude oil and finished products from its refinery to tanks and terminals. Its Conway, Texas underground storage facility has 1.5 million barrels of refined products capacity. NCRA also has two refined products terminals (in McPherson, Kansas and Council Bluffs, Iowa).

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The cooperative's primary strategy is to gather oil and gas and make diesel and gasoline to serve it members (and the farms of rural America) while maintaining and upgrading its systems in order to stay competitive with better resourced private sector refining rivals.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 NCRA announced a $555 million investment to build a new Delayed Coking Unit at its McPherson refinery. The new facility will allow the refiner to process a larger variety of crude oils. It is scheduled to be completed in 2015 and will replace a unit that was built in 1952.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the company agreed to pay $700,000 in federal and state penalties to settle violations of environmental laws at its McPherson petroleum refinery and underground storage facility.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The enterprise has its origins in 1943, when five regional farm supply cooperatives, tired of wartime fuel shortages, created the NCRA to buy the Globe oil refinery in McPherson, Kansas.
