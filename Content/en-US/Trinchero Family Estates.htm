   Pink and slightly fizzy, white zinfandel wine is one passion of Trinchero Family Estates. The winemaker (formerly Sutter Home Winery) produces a variety of bottles under such labels as Sutter Home, Ménage à Trois, Montevina, Napa Cellars, Sea Glass, Trinity Oaks, and Fre (nonalcoholic). The winery also creates super-premium wine under the Trinchero Napa Valley label, as well as Australian wine brands Angove and Little Boomey. The Trinchero family's interest in winemaking dates to 1947, when it bought a 73-year-old Napa Valley winery that had been dormant since Prohibition. Still family-owned and -operated, chairman Bob Trinchero brought the winery to prominence in the US with a white zinfandel in 1972.

   Based in St. Helena, California, Trinchero Family Estates produces and sells wines and spirits across the US and in Australia.

   The Trinchero Family Estates' portfolio includes more than 40 brands, such as Sutter Home, Trinchero Napa Valley, Napa Cellars, Terra d'Oro, Sea Glass, Trinity Oaks, Folie à Deux, Ménage à Trois, Fancy Pants, The Wine Cube, and Fre, the #1 alcohol-removed wine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2013 US sales across all of its brands exceeded 18 million cases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Trinchero Family Estates markets and sells Joel Gott Wines, Bandit, Newman's Own, Charles &amp; Charles, and the SHOW. Its import portfolio includes Angove wines from Australia, Doña Paula wines from Argentina, Carmen wines from Chile, Shatter Wines from France, and CRUZ and Tres Agaves Tequilas from Mexico. Trinchero also owns the Reynolds Family Winery and Little Boomey brands through a supply agreement with Angoves Family Winemakers of Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the winemaker continues to specialize in vineyard-designated wines. It holds about 100 acres of estate vines in five Napa Valley appellations. Production reaches about 300 tons of grapes a year, equivalent to 15,000 cases. Trinchero Family Estates has also taken steps to renovate the Folie à Deux winery (acquired in 2004), to make its luxury brand, Trinchero Napa Valley. A hospitality and culinary center, followed by a visitor's center and administrative offices are planned.

   Trinchero Family Estates has been expanding its Trinchero National Spirits division. The company in 2013 rolled out Sugar Island Spiced and Coconut rums, a new product innovation, as well as product extension Ménage à Trois Vodka in three flavors in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its bulging portfolio, Trinchero Family Estates works to expand its roster of brand names. In 2013 the company added the Taken Wine Company brands to its growing portfolio, including the 2010 Taken Red Wine, the 2011 Complicated Red Wine, and the 2012 Complicated Red Wine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with its portfolio expansion, Trinchero has broken ground on a $300 million expansion to consolidate bottling and shipping operations and to double its wine processing capacity at its Westside facility in Lodi. As part of the move, Trinchero partnered with Northern California's Power Automation Systems to move and store more than 72,000 pallets of wine.

  <p>
   The company banks on social media to target Millennial females, particularly with its launch of Fancy Pants wines. During a test launch with a national leading retailer, the Fancy Pants brand became one of the top five new brand launches of the last 12 months. The national launch included a 2011 Red Blend and a 2012 Pinot Grigio. These two varietals are driving growth in the $7-10 price segment.
