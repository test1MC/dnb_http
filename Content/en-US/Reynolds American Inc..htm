   They say there's no smoke without fire and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), the #2 US cigarette manufacturer, is giving off plenty of heat. Reynolds American owns cigarette manufacturer RJR Tobacco, which produces many of the top-selling cigarette brands - Camel, Doral, Eclipse, Pall Mall and Newport - and smokeless tobacco maker

   Reynolds American (RAI) operates through the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (aka RJR Tobacco), which accounts for more than 80% of its total sales and ranks as the second-largest cigarette maker in the US. Its familiar brands include Camel, Pall Mall, Winston, Kool, and Doral. RAI's smokeless tobacco business, American Snuff, represents 8% of sales, while Santa Fe Natural Tobacco, also 8% of sales, manufactures and sells cigarettes and other tobacco products under the Natural American Spirit brand. Santa Fe products are made from all natural, additive-free tobacco. RAI's Niconovum USA subsidiary (acquired in 2009) makes nicotine replacement gum, mouth spray, and pouches under the Zonnic brand in Sweden. R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company makes electronic cigarettes under the VUSE name, and is the market leader with an around 36% share.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Lorillard subsidiary (pocketed in 2015) makes Newport, Kent, Old Gold, and True cigarette brands.

  <p>
   RJR Tobacco's manufacturing plants are in the Winston-Salem, North Carolina area, while American Snuff's facilities are in Memphis, Tennessee; Clarksville, Tennessee; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Santa Fe's manufacturing plant is in Oxford, North Carolina and Lorillard produces cigarettes in Greensboro, North Carolina.

  <p>
   RJR Tobacco distributes its cigarettes primarily through a combination of direct wholesale deliveries from a local distribution center and public warehouses throughout the US. Its largest customer is
   <company id="59751">
    McLane Company
   </company>
   , one of the nation's largest distributors of grocery and tobacco products. McLane accounted for 28% of the tobacco products maker's revenue in 2015, while sales to distributor
   <company id="42167">
    Core-Mark
   </company>
   accounted for around 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Santa Fe continues to advertise and promote at retail locations and in adult venues, and uses print advertising in consumer magazines, direct mailing, websites, and other publications in the US where permitted.
  </p>
  <p>
   RAI's advertising costs have been rising. In 2015, the company spent $140 million on advertising, compared to $72 million in 2012.

  <p>
   RAI reversed a trend for falling sales in the US in recent years amid a general decline in cigarette smoking, posting an exceptional 26% increase in sales to $10.6 billion in 2015. This came on the back of a 3% increase in 2014, before which the company had been on several years of decline. RJR Tobacco and Santa Fe both grew sales strongly due to higher volumes, a favorable product mix and higher net pricing, and contributions from acquired Lorillard provided a boost.However, in 2014 the company reported a 3% increase in revenues thanks to a 1% growth in RJR Tobacco due to higher net pricing; a 5% growth in American Snuff due to higher pricing and an increase in moist snuff volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has been fluctuating recently, increased 121% on prior year to $3.2 billion. This was a result of increased sales, and a gain on the divestiture of acquired Lorillard's Winston, Kool and Salem cigarette brands, and e-cig brand Blu, as part of the anti-trust conditions for the purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities fell by $1.4 billion to $196 million, primarily due to changes in accrued liabilities, including income taxes and other working capital.

   Cigarette manufacturers are having a tough time of it of late given a general decline in smoking in the US, increases in state excise taxes and governmental regulations and restrictions, but Reynolds American looks to be coping with market conditions. While unit volumes have fallen in the low single digits, prices are up and have scope to increase further. The company is also increasing its focus on non-cigarette products, including moist snuff, which has higher margins and grew 2.5% in 2015, and its VUSE e-cigarette line, which is the market leader in the US. VUSE is now present in more than 100,000 retail outlets in the US following a concerted effort in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reynolds American has sought to insulate itself against the currency fluctuations and economic turbulence taking place outside the US, and focus itself on the US market. In 2016, Reynolds American sold the international rights to its Natural American Spirit brand name to the Japan Tobacco Group for around 5 billion in cash. The sale also includes the brand's international distribution and marketing companies. The international rights to nearly all of RAI's cigarette trademarks are now owned by international tobacco companies, allowing RAI to focus on brand growth in the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   RJR Tobacco's marketing approach uses a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands' shares of market against competitive pricing pressure.

  <p>
   R. J. Reynolds formed the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1875 in Winston, North Carolina, to produce chewing tobacco. In the late 1890s, Reynolds lost two-thirds of the company to the American Tobacco Trust, but he regained control in 1911 after the trust was dismantled by the government. Two years later the company introduced Camel.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Reynolds died in 1918, leadership passed to Bowman Gray, whose family ran the company for the next 50 years. Camel held the #1 or #2 cigarette position throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and Reynolds became the largest domestic cigarette company. In response to growing health concerns in the 1950s, the company introduced its filtered Winston (1954) and Salem (1956) brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to growing antismoking sentiment, Reynolds Tobacco began diversifying into foods and other nontobacco businesses beginning in the 1960s. Acquisitions included Chun King, Patio Foods, American Independent Oil, Del Monte, Inglenook wines, Smirnoff vodka, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Sunkist beverages, and Canada Dry, all of which it had sold by 1991. In September 1985, Reynolds acquired Nabisco Brands (Newtons, Oreo, Planters nuts) for $4.9 billion. In 1986, the parent company was re-named RJR Nabisco Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 1988, RJR Nabisco agreed to be acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). The deal, valued in excess of $25 billion, closed in April 1989. After being privately held for a period, KKR took RJR Nabisco Holdings public in 1991. In early 1995, KKR divested its remaining holdings in RJR Nabisco. Also that year Andrew Schindler was promoted to CEO of the firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to 1999, RJR was a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. (RJRN). In 1999, following the sale of the company's international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco for $8 billion, the remaining tobacco and food businesses were separated and RJRN was renamed Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. (NGH). In June the former parent company, RJRN, was renamed RJ Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., and became an independent, publicly traded company again, with RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company as its wholly owned subsidiary. (The separation was accomplished through a spinoff of the domestic tobacco business to RJR Nabisco stockholders.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2002 RJRT acquired the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, maker of the Natural American Spirit additive-free cigarette brand, for $340 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2003 the company said it would focus marketing activities on its Camel and Salem brands. It also launched a two-year plan to cut costs by $1 billion, which included cutting jobs by 40%. By the end of 2003, RJRT had cut 1,400 jobs. Shortly thereafter, the company announced merger plans with
   <company id="43762">
    Brown &amp; Williamson
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Before combining with RJRT to create Reynolds American in July 2004, Brown &amp; Williamson had been ordered to cut back on promoting its Kool brand, which was associated with hip-hop music. The issue carried over to Reynolds American, which agreed in October 2004 to settle several related lawsuits in New York, Illinois, and Maryland by paying $1.5 million toward antismoking campaigns and severely restricting Kool promotions that critics said targeted Black youth.
