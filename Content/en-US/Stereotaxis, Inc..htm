   Stereotaxis can drive in the fast lane through your veins because it has the road map to your heart. The company's systems are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms known as arrhythmias, as well as coronary artery disease. Via digital remote control, doctors steer catheters, guidewires, and stent delivery devices through blood vessels all the way to the chambers of the heart (and all the way back out, if necessary) in a procedure that is less invasive than traditional heart surgeries. Stereotaxis markets the cardiology instrument control system to interventional surgery labs (or "cath labs"), research hospitals, and large commercial medical centers worldwide.

   More than half of the company's revenues come from sales in the US, where it has manufacturing facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, and Maple Grove, Minnesota.

   The company's primary product platform is the Epoch system, which is made up of the Niobe advanced robotic magnetic navigation system and the Odyssey clinical information system. It also offers the Vdrive robotic navigation system for interventional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and it receives revenues from sales of disposable supplies used with its equipment. In addition to developing and manufacturing its proprietary navigation systems, Stereotaxis has research and marketing alliances with

   The company's revenue decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year. It reported $38 million in revenue for fiscal 2013 after bringing in a little more than $46 million in fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   More alarming was the drop in net income in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous period. The company suffered a net loss of more than $68 million in fiscal 2013 after claiming a net loss of $9 million in fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow actually increased in fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 levels, however the company still has negative cash on hand.

   Stereotaxis is working to increase market penetration of its Niobe system and the Odyssey data integration tool both in the US and abroad. In turn, an increase of system installations also leads to recurring sales of compatible disposable supplies. Through research and development efforts, the firm works to enhance its systems and supplies to keep pace with technological innovations in the medical device field.
