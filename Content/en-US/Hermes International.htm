   Hermès International is saddled with a reputation for luxury. The company, which got its start making harnesses for horse-drawn carriages, makes and sells luxury goods in nearly 15 categories, including leather goods, scarves, ties, watches, stationery, gloves, tableware, jewelry, perfume, men's and women's apparel, footwear, textiles, and home goods. More than 170 years old, the firm operates about 315 Hermès stores worldwide, with more than 50 shops in the US. It also sells its goods through about 20 other retail outlets. Descendants of founder Thierry Hermès own 74% of the company. Patrick Thomas became the first person outside of the family to lead the company when he was announced as sole CEO in 2006.

  <p>
   Unlike many other luxury goods companies, Hermès does not grant licenses to other companies, and it makes most of the products it sells.

   To keep all product categories at peak performance, Hermès in recent years has been adding to its portfolio through investments and joint ventures. The luxury goods firm bought a majority stake in Swiss watch maker Joseph Erard Holding in 2013. Hermès also purchased a 25% stake in the Swiss movements maker Vaucher Manufacture for nearly $20 million to boost Hermès business in expensive mechanical watches. Vaucher makes high-precision movements used in watches made by

   and others. Among other investments, Hermès owns crystal-maker Les Cristalleries de Saint-Louis, silversmith L'Orfèvrerie Puiforcat, shoemaker John Lobb, and several fabric firms. Hermès also owns 32% of

   , the German camera maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also expanding into India -- Delhi, to be exact -- with its 51%-owned joint venture with an unnamed prominent Indian family. The purpose of the joint venture is to open stores there to offset sales that have yet to reach targets in Japan.

  <p>
   Hermès was founded in 1837 by harness-maker Thierry Hermès. The company won acclaim for its unique carriage design, and gained favor among European noblemen. The company's saddle stitch, notable for both its aesthetic and utilitarian qualities, became a trademark of sorts; Hermès craftsmen, working always by hand, spent 20 to 40 hours on custom-made saddles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thierry's son, Emile-Charles, followed in the family business. In 1879 he moved the company headquarters to 24, rue du Fauborg Saint Honoré, an address that was to become one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in all of Paris. His decision to move, however, was more practical than prescient. Emile-Charles simply moved his business to be nearer his wealthy customers in the carriage trade. In 1922 he sold his stake in the business to his brother Emile-Maurice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emile-Maurice, more than any other, was responsible for making the company what it is today. Something of a visionary, he saw the introduction of the automobile not only as a threat to the family's saddlery business, but also as an opportunity to diversify the business, and create accessories for a suddenly more mobile society. Under his direction, Hermès introduced travel-related leather goods, including saddlebags, luggage, wallets, handbags, and even jewelry. Emile also chose the well-known logo, that of a horse-drawn carriage, based on a drawing by Alfred De Dreux.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1900s, Emile brought the zipper to France when he purchased a two-year patent on the Canadian invention. Soon the zipper became associated with Hermès, and it appeared on handbags, jockey silks, and leather gloves. The company's line of leather apparel is said to have resulted from a design request for a zippered leather golf jacket by the Prince of Wales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ready-to-wear clothing was introduced in the 1920s as Emile handed the reins of the company to his son-in-law Robert Dumas. It was Robert who introduced the first Hermès scarf in 1937. Silk ties were introduced in 1949, and perfume in 1950. Robert continued to pursue diversification while maintaining the company's reputation for quality -- a difficult task, especially in the 1970s, when man-made materials like plastic and polyester dominated the fashion scene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Dumas died in 1978 and his son Jean-Louis took control. Previously a buyer for Bloomingdale's, Jean-Louis brought an outsider's eye to the company. He introduced young designers to strengthen the brand's youth appeal. He bought manufacturers of glassware, silverware, and tableware, as well as shoemaker John Lobb, in the 1980s. The company's sales skyrocketed, and Jean-Louis added stores in Asia, the Pacific Rim, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1993, with the family retaining more than 80%. In July 1999 Hermès took a 35% stake in the design business of its womenswear couturier Jean-Paul Gautier. In 2000 the company unveiled a New York store on Madison Avenue. Hermès also entered Portugal for the first time and construction began on a franchised store in Moscow. In December the company acquired about 31% of German camera and lens manufacturer Leica.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hermès saw continued expansion in Asia, Europe, and the US in 2001. The company expanded its leather working business in 2002 and focused on promoting the craftsmen and women behind its products through public campaigns.
