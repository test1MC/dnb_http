   Looking to get the most sparkle out of plain ol' tap water? Selling under its SodaStream and Soda-Club brands, SodaStream manufactures home carbonation systems used by consumers to make soft drinks and sparkling water from tap water. The company's systems -- which it sells through more than 60,000 retail stores -- include decorative counter-top soda makers, as well as soda bottles, CO2 cylinders, and various soda flavors. To complement its products, SodaStream also offers CO2 refills and cylinder exchanges through retailers. It distributes its products either directly or through third-party companies to some 45 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. SodaStream went public in late 2010.

  <p>
   The company intends to use a portion of the proceeds that it raises as part of its IPO (up $109 million) to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. It would also use some of the proceeds to fund the construction or purchase of a manufacturing facility. Currently, the company operates a pair of manufacturing plants in Israel; it boasts offices in Germany, the Netherlands, the US, South Africa, Switzerland, and the UK.

   Prior to going public, SodaStream was owned by Fortissimo Capital Fund, which held a 31% stake. Fortissimo Capital acquired SodaStream in 2007 and subsequently restructured the company. Since then SodaStream has expanded its presence into more than a dozen countries and has improved its soda maker product offerings (e.g. the introduction of upscale and decorative designs). The company traces its roots back to the 1970s.

  <p>
   SodaStream's plan to invest in its manufacturing operations is part of its long-term growth strategy, which includes expansion into new geographical markets and, more to the point, converting bottled soda-drinking consumers over to its products through various sales and marketing campaigns. The US market -- being one of the biggest consumers of soda products in the world -- is a key target of the company's expansion efforts. To this end, in mid-2013 the company partnered with

   </company>
   -owned KitchenAid to launch jointly-developed home carbonation systems under the KitchenAid brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   SodaStream has seen a steady rise in consumer interest in its products in recent years, and it has experienced an increase in its profits as a result. Other factors contributing to the increase includes a decrease in production costs, a modest price increase in its soda maker products, and general cost-cutting measures.
