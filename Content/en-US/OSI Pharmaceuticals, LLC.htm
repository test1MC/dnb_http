   Fighting disease in small ways is what OSI Pharmaceuticals is all about. The
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   indirect subsidiary focuses on small molecule cures for diseases like cancer, allowing for treatment by pill rather than IV infusion. Its top seller Tarceva treats non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer and is in development for other indications as well. Partner
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   co-promotes the drug in the US, and it is marketed internationally by
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   . OSI also has a pipeline of drug candidates focused on new anti-cancer compounds. UK subsidiary Prosidion manages the company's small-molecule patents for diabetes and obesity treatments.

  <p>
   OSI was acquired by Japanese drugmaker
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   for $4 billion in 2010. Astellas Pharma had made an unsolicited $3.5 billion acquisition proposal as part of its plans to expand its therapeutic and R&amp;D oncology operations in the US market. OSI's board of directors rejected the bid, saying it undervalued the company, and recommended that shareholders also reject Astellas' tender offer.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Astellas raised its bid to a more palatable $4 billion and OSI's board accepted the new offer. The acquisition was completed in mid-2010, after which OSI became a subsidiary of
   <company id="138741">
    Astellas Pharma US
   </company>
   . OSI benefits from the transaction by gaining access to Astellas' global marketing and R&amp;D platforms.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the months after acquiring OSI, Astellas closed two of OSI's facilities in New York (in Ardsley and Melville) and relocate its oncology research to a facility in a business incubator at Farmingdale State College in New York.
  </p>
  <p>
   OSI remains focused on developing its oncology pipeline and expanding the number of approved uses for Tarceva. The drug is in clinical trials for breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancer and as a front-line treatment for lung cancer in combination with Avastin. Other candidates in the oncology pipeline include treatments for ovarian, lung, and cancer of the adrenal glands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to cancer therapeutics, OSI operates a diabetes and obesity R&amp;D center through its Prosidion unit. The center works to develop drugs for regulating blood glucose, increasing insulin sensitivity, and fighting obesity; moves candidates through early proof-of-concept trials; and then out-licenses them to larger firms.

   have all licensed the company's patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like many other pharmaceutical companies, OSI is looking to cash in on the emerging field of personalized medicine which uses a patient's genetic makeup to help guide the selection of drug or treatment options. The idea is that by reducing the amount of non-effective drugs or treatments used, healthcare costs will be reduced and patients can be treated with more precision. OSI intends to continue to focus on diabetes, obesity, and oncology but with an eye toward targeted therapy drug discovery, development, and research.
