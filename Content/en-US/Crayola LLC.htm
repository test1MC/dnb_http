   Crayola has cornered the market on colors. The crayon maker's 10 most popular colors include blue, red, violet, green, carnation pink, black, turquoise blue, blue green, periwinkle, and magenta. It produces about 12 million crayons a day, as well as other Crayola art products for children, such as markers and craft and activity kits. Crayola also makes Silly Putty, the iconic silicone putty with utility, and inkTank pens and markers for adults. The firm's products are packaged in many languages and sold worldwide. Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith sold their first Crayola crayons in 1903, when a box of eight cost a nickel. Crayola is a subsidiary of

   Crayola rules the crayon market. While no one outside the company knows its exact share, it's estimated to be at least 80% of the US market. High brand recognition and intense consumer loyalty allow Crayola to charge a price premium of as much as 300% above its competitors. However, competition has heated up in recent years. Retailers, including rivals
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   , have been heavily discounting Crayola products to spur sales, cutting into Crayola's profits. Also rivals, including

   -owned Roseart, are jockeying for position.

  <p>
   To bridge the gap into digital media, Crayola partnered with

   in 2012 to create the colorful Crayola Lights, Camera, Color! app and the Silly Face Swaps coloring page that can be personalized digitally with Crayola coloring tools. In 2013, the pair rolled out Crayola ColorStudio Barbie and Hot Wheels apps for coloring on the go.
