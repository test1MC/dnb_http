   Thomas Nelson is a top commercial publisher of Christian-related materials. The company produces about 10 major Bible translations in the English language and biblical reference products including commentaries, help texts, and study guides. Thomas Nelson also publishes religious and inspirational titles, hosts inspirational conferences (Women of Faith), and produces Christian-oriented and family-focused products for adults and children, including books, games, and audio and video materials. The company can trace its roots back to 1798, when Thomas Nelson began selling Bibles in a town square in Edinburgh, Scotland. Majority-owner

   When 19-year-old Salim Ziady came to the US from Lebanon in 1950, he financed his education by selling Bibles door-to-door. After changing his name to Sam Moore (Ziady means "more"), he founded National Book in 1958. It merged with Bible producer Royal Publishing three years later and went public in 1962. In 1969 Royal bought and merged with the US operations of Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, a UK-based Bible publisher founded in 1798. As part of the deal, Moore kept the Nelson name and logo.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 Thomas Nelson commissioned a revision of the King James Bible, which led to the creation of Thomas Nelson's proprietary New King James Version, first published in 1982. During the 1980s, the company made a marginally successful move into magazine publishing and greeting cards.

   In 1992 Thomas Nelson bought Christian publisher and record company Word from Capital Cities/ABC. It greatly expanded its gift and stationery lines in 1995 with the purchase of manufacturer C.R. Gibson for $67 million. Poor performance in its Royal Media division (music, radio, and magazines) led to losses in 1996. To focus on its core business, it sold its women-oriented
   <i>
    Aspire
   </i>
   magazine (launched in 1994) and discontinued
   <i>
    Grandparenting.
   </i>
   It also sold its music unit to Gaylord Entertainment for $110 million; and in 1997 closed down the rest of the Royal Media subsidiary. That year the company introduced
   <i>
    Nelson's Electronic Bible Reference Library
   </i>
   on CD-ROM.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Thomas Nelson celebrated its 200th year in business in 1998, the company again took stock of its operations. To save on production costs, it began to close C.R. Gibson's manufacturing operations, opting instead to outsource the work. The next year, Thomas Nelson began to consolidate all of its administrative operations at it headquarters. The company continued cost-cutting measures in 2000 as sales declined. Also that year it expanded into the e-book market, allowing digital downloads of 17 titles, and acquired  the then-named New Life Treatment Centers, which hosts women's inspirational conferences. Upon completion of the acquisition, New Life's name was changed to Live Even Management (LEM).
  </p>
  <p>
   Its gift operations became the target of Thomas Nelson's belt-tightening at the beginning of the decade. In 2000 the company discontinued its candle-making subsidiary. The assets of C.R. Gibson, a subsidiary that designed and sold photo albums, stationery, and other gift items, were sold off the next year. In 2001 the company discontinued its Remuda Ranch Center, which specialized in helping women with eating disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company laid off about 5% of its staff in 2003 and underwent a reorganization as it tried to keep afloat in a tough market. That same year, Sam Moore, who had been functioning as company chairman, president, and CEO, dropped the "president" role from his title, and the company appointed Michael S. Hyatt as president and COO. In 2005 Hyatt became CEO; Moore remained as Chairman.

   In 2006 cable veteran Leo Hindery and his private equity investment firm InterMedia Partners and its subsidiary Faith Media took Thomas Nelson private in a $473 million buyout deal. The company changed hands again in 2010, when InterMedia Partners sold the majority of Thomas Nelson to private equity firm Kohlberg &amp; Co.
