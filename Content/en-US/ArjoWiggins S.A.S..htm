   subsidiary manufactures and markets a swath of paper products. Its lineup bridges five business segments: Creative paper for business writing and fine packaging; Graphic coated and non-coated paper for publishing and printing; Coated US paper for digital printing, custom text, and covered goods; Industrial for decor, medical (sterile wraps), and thin papers; and Security such as banknotes, secure documents, and synthetic papers. ArjoWiggins sells its paper goods across Europe, Asia, the Americas, and, through subsidiary

   , the US. Holding about 25 paper mills today, the company dates back to a 1469 paper mill in Arches, France.

  <p>
   ArjoWiggins' paper trail begins in 1850, when Edward Wiggins and Henry Teape became partners in a paper company that had been in business since the 1700s. The new partnership was known as Jones, Wiggins and Teape. Later, it became Wiggins Teape, Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1962 UK tobacco company B.A.T Industries acquired a minority interest in Wiggins Teape, which by that time was a large specialty paper manufacturer. By 1970 B.A.T owned the whole company. In 1978 B.A.T acquired Appleton Papers, a US paper manufacturer, and became the world's leading maker of carbonless paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   B.A.T continued to lessen its dependence on tobacco until a hostile takeover threatened in 1989. To protect itself, B.A.T sold off many retail and manufacturing interests and spun off Wiggins Teape Appleton as an independent company. The same year, under chairman and CEO Stephen Walls, Wiggins Teape Appleton merged with Arjomari-Prioux, a leading French paper maker. Another French company, St. Louis, traded its interest in Arjomari-Prioux for a 40% stake in the new company, Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arjomari was formed in the 1950s when four paper mills -- Arches, Johannot, Marais, and Rives -- merged to form Arjomari, taking its name from the first two letters in the names of each mill. Arjomari then merged with Prioux-Dufournier in 1968, forming Arjomari-Prioux, and began making coated paper and distributing graphic arts products. Arjomari-Prioux and Wiggins Teape Appleton merged in 1989 to form Arjo Wiggins Appleton. The combined entity operated 46 European and US mills.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately the new company emerged in the midst of an economic slowdown in Europe and a recession in North America and the UK. Combined with excess industry capacity, this led to pricing pressure and paper-thin profit margins. At the same time pulp prices fell, hurting the company's pulp profits, particularly evident in the company's 43%-owned SOPORCEL (Portugal).
  </p>
  <p>
   Walls departed in 1992 amidst rumors that he was stymied from making acquisitions by St. Louis, which was loath to dilute its interest in the company. That year the company cut its dividend by 19%, leading to a rapid sell-off and takeover rumors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internal strife continued, and by 1996 the company was working on its third CEO and third CFO since inception. However, thanks to restructuring and better market conditions, the company's profits improved in 1997. Plans to merge with Sappi International, a South African specialty paper maker, collapsed that year, and French industrial company Worms &amp; Cie (largely owned by the Agnelli family of Italy) took over St. Louis' 40% stake. In 1998 the carbonless and thermal operations continued to struggle, raising concerns over the long-term prospects of the business.
  </p>
  <p>
   ArjoWiggins restructured in 1999 by creating three divisions (based on product lines), each headed by its own chief executive. Amid the shuffle came the departure of CEO Phillippe Beylier after less than two years at the helm. The next year Worms &amp; Cie announced it would buy the 40% of Arjo Wiggins Appleton that it didn't already own in a deal worth about $3.5 billion. In November 2001 the US employees completed a $810 million buyout of Worms &amp; Cie's US assets, renaming the new company
   <company id="105122">
    Appleton Papers, Inc.
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   Worms &amp; Cie changed its name to Sequana Capital in mid-2005. Later that year Charles Dehelly took over as CEO of ArjoWiggins. In yet another restructuring, Dehelly stepped down as CEO in mid-2008. Sequana CEO Pascal Lebard was named chairman and CEO of ArjoWiggins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2007 ArjoWiggins entered talks to acquire recycled paper pulp maker Greenfield SAS, a unit of Cascades. That deal closed early in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 it picked up Danish paper recycler Dalum Papir from Dalum Holding for about â‚¬63.5 million. ArjoWiggins also started a new operation in China called Image Paper Asia, a joint venture with fellow subsidiary and paper distributor Antalis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sequana carried out a restructuring in 2008 that saw ArjoWiggins' fine paper and thin paper operations go to Antalis. It also reduced ArjoWiggins' operating areas from four to three.
