  <p>
   Making the company an attractive acquisition target, Swank had been posting sales increases in recent years despite the economic downturn. The accessories maker attributes the rise to larger orders of men's belts and personal leather accessories made by club stores and department stores. Many of these retailers are altering their merchandise programs to target the increasing demand for affordable small luxuries.

  <p>
   Swank has pursued more licensing agreements, particularly for private-label products. Sales of merchandise under its dozen licensed labels, however, expose Swank to extended payment terms.
