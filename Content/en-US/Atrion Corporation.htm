   Atrion makes helpful devices for medical procedures. Its products range from aortic punches used in vein graft surgeries to one-way valves used to control fluids and gasses, as well as a tiny balloon catheter used to unblock tear ducts. Subsidiary Quest Medical makes intravenous and cardiovascular fluid delivery products; its MPS2 Myocardial Protection System manages fluid delivery to the heart during open-heart surgery. Its Halkey-Roberts business manufactures plastic inflation widgets used in health care equipment, marine and aviation devices, and other inflatable products. Subsidiary Atrion Medical Products manufactures plastic medical products and offers contract manufacturing and medical device assembly.

  <p>
   Fluid delivery devices account for about 40% of revenues, while cardiovascular products account for 30%. Opthalmic products and other (medical and non-medical) products bring in about 15% of revenue each. Among its quirkier niches, Atrion is a leading manufacturer of the little plastic cases used to store contact lenses, and it makes the valves and closures used in life vests.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atrion has more than 500 active patents and patent applications pending.

  <p>
   The company's products are sold in more than 60 countries. Sales outside of the US account for more than 40% of the company's revenues, with about 10% coming from Canadian customers. Atrion maintains research and development and manufacturing plants in Alabama, Florida, and Texas.

  <p>
   The company's products are marketed through its own direct sales agents in the US and through independent distribution companies internationally. Atrion's customers include medical facilities (hospitals, clinics, and doctors offices), as well as equipment manufacturers that incorporate the company's devices into their products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company advertises its products in trade journals, as well as by attending industry trade shows and sponsoring symposiums.

  <p>
   Atrion has experienced modest but steady sales growth across the years. In 2014 revenue increased 7% to $140.8 million, driven by sales growth in the fluid delivery and cardiovascular products segments (but partially offset by declined sales of its ophthalmology products).
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing revenues have also led to higher profits over the past five years. Net income increased 5% to $27.8 million in 2014. Cash flow from operations dropped 15% to $31.2 million that year due to changes in current assets, increases in accounts payable, and treasury stock purchases under the firm's stock repurchase program.
  </p>

  <p>
   Atrion expands its product lines primarily through its growing research and development programs. (In 2014, R&amp;D expenditures were double what they had been in 2010.) Additionally, the company acquires third-party patents and partners with outside experts to enter new niche markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other growth and operational improvement initiatives include increasing manufacturing capacity and streamlining purchasing processes. The firm aims to develop and deliver custom products for both small and large customers, with the added goal of quick and cost-effective delivery. Recent launches include a line of swabable valve products that minimize the risk of needle-sticks for medical personnel and the MPS2 (the second generation of that product).
