   When it comes to making wire mesh products, don't mess with ACS mesh. ACS Industries makes wire products, primarily knitted wire and woven mesh, but also specialty and wire cable. The company serves customers in the electronics, aerospace, refining, and pharmaceutical markets; it also targets the automotive and industrial manufacturing industries with such products as air-bag filters, exhaust components, joint seals, and mufflers. The diversified manufacturer makes a lineup of household and institutional cleaning products, including scouring pads, mops, brooms, and brushes, through its Scrubble Products division. ACS Industries was founded in 1939 as a manufacturer of knitted copper pot cleaners.

   The company continues to evolve through an aggressive investment in product R&amp;D that serves the specialized needs of a wide range of industrial customers and governments, notably the US

   . In construction technologies, it introduced a vertical arm grapple fork in late 2010. The fork, used on wheel loaders handling long, bulky pipe, features dual clamp arms that enable loaders to efficiently and safely move racks of pipe. More groundbreaking, in 1968 the company was first to bring to market a quick coupler system for wheel loaders.

   Several acquisitions have further fueled ACS's growth, moving it from solely an engineering and sales business to stand as a vertically integrated manufacturer. (Instead of purchasing finished fine wire, the company buys raw wire rod and processes it in-house into the various diameters required to make its mesh.) The company's plants now dot the US, Mexico, and China, and regional sales offices, worldwide. ACS has particularly courted Asia's growing consumer and heavy-duty highway vehicle markets.
