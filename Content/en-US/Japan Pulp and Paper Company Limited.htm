   Japan Pulp and Paper looks really good on paper. The company, which traces its roots back to 1845, makes printing paper, newsprint, paper bags, containerboard, folding box board, and paper-based stock used in products such as wallpaper and food containers. It also makes personal care papers such as tissue, toilet paper, and paper towels and makes recycled paper. Japan Pulp and Paper doesn't operate any timber mills but its subsidiaries buy pulp from other companies to make finished paper products. Outside Japan, the company has operations in about 20 countries around the world.

  <p>
   Japan Pulp has its operations across North America, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, and Central and South America. It earns about 60% of its revenue from Japanese operations, followed by Asia, which contributes roughly 20%.

   Japan Pulp extends its geographical footprint by opening offices in select markets. In 2014 the company opened a new representative office in Hanoi, Vietnam, to enhance its local market research capabilities in the Vietnamese market. In 2015 the company established a new representative office in Manila, the Philippines, to capture new demand and further business opportunities in the Philippine market.
