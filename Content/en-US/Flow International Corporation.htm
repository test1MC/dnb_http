   I won't lie, Flow International's products can be a bit abrasive. But that's a good thing for customers in the aerospace, automotive, food, and paper industries, among others. The company (a Waterjet Holdings subsidiary) manufactures and supplies ultra-high-pressure waterjet and abrasive waterjet systems to both small shops and major industrial companies in more than 60 countries around the globe. Its waterjet machines, which come in both standard and advanced models, are used for cutting everything from metal and stone to food and paper. Additionally, Flow International  sells consumable waterjet system parts (such as seals and orifices) and services.

  <p>
   Since its inception, the company has delivered more  than 12,000 waterjet and abrasive waterjet systems to customers in more than 60 countries. Representing about one-third of total sales, its consumable parts are offered online at flowparts.com in the US and floweuropeparts.com in Europe. Flow International markets its waterjet systems through a consultative sales approach centered on increasing awareness of waterjet technology. Waterjet cutting, for example, is considered to be a growing alternative to traditional material cutting methods, which use lasers, drills, saws, knives, plasma, routers, soda blasting, and electrical discharge machining techniques.

   On the innovation front, in 2014 the company introduced the HyPlex Prime, a next generation direct drive ultrahigh-pressure pump technology which represents the newest advancements in highly efficient, direct drive waterjet pumps. It also introduced the only non-contact material height sensing solution available in the industry, the DynaBeam Laser Sensing System, which provides superior accuracy to traditional height monitoring methods.

  <p>
   Former
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   employee Michael Pao founded Flow Industries in his basement in 1971. Between 1974 and 1983 the company developed the Waterknife waterjet cutting system, capturing 80% of the world's market, and changed its name to Flow Systems. The company went public in 1983 and changed its name again, to Flow International, to reflect its global coverage. Pao resigned in 1991 to pursue other interests and telecom industry executive Ronald Tarrant became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions fed growth during the 1990s. The company acquired Spider Staging (access systems, 1992) and robotic waterjet equipment companies Dynovation Machine Systems (1994) and ASI Robotics Systems (1995).
  </p>
  <p>
   Flow introduced its FlowMaster in 1996 and also sold a $3.5 million precision machining tool to
   <company id="11093">
    Northrop Grumman
   </company>
   . The next year the company introduced the BENGAL 4X4, a compact waterjet system, and sold its Access &amp; Services unit (job-site platforms and industrial cleaning services) to SafeWorks to focus on its core technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Flow bought Robot Simulations Limited (robotics software) and certain assets of CIS Robotics (robot programming, UK). The next year it bought the high-pressure systems business (for food processing and auto and aerospace manufacturing) of Sweden-based Asea Brown Boveri (now
   <company id="40615">
    ABB
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Flow signed a deal with three food companies (
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10388">
    ConAgra
   </company>
   ) in 2000 to develop UHP technology for shelf-stable foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the automotive industry began to slump in 2001, Flow cut 10% of its worldwide workforce to trim expenses. That year the company inked a deal to provide drink maker
   <company id="46046">
    Odwalla
   </company>
   with its Fresher Under Pressure systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ronald Tarrant retired as CEO in 2002 and was succeeded by Stephen Light, who previously served as president and CEO of Omniquip Textron Group. Faced with a company that had substantial technology in waterjet cutting and milling, but which seemed to lack strategic direction and was $107 million in debt, Light refocused Flow on its core business. Through a series of divestitures, Light was able to restore growth to the core waterjet business and to retire debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flow completed a restructuring plan intended to return it to profitability in fiscal 2005. The company reduced its workforce, consolidated facilities and operations, and closed or divested selected operations. After evaluating the workforce and skill levels needed for the future of its business, Flow implemented plans to cut redundant positions and realign and modify some roles based on skill assessments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Flow divested its non-core Avure Technologies general press operations, which included the North America press segment, the international press segment, and the non-ultrahigh-pressure portion of the food business, which was a part of its food segment. The businesses were acquired by
   <company id="102459">
    Gores Technology Group
   </company>
   , a private equity buyout firm. Flow entered into a manufacturing agreement with Gores to provide ultrahigh-pressure pump components and related spare parts for the Fresher Under Pressure business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2005 and early 2006, Flow was awarded two multimillion-dollar contracts with aircraft manufacturer
   <company id="40566">
    Airbus'
   </company>
   UK unit. Under the first contract Flow's waterjet system machined wing structures for Airbus' A350 plane. The second contract enlisted Flow to make and install a multi-axis composite machining center, abrasive waterjet, and routing machine tool system at the Filton plant for the A350 program.
  </p>
  <p>
   The strategic redirection paid off in numerous ways, resulting in a financially healthier company and a higher public profile, as Flow's waterjet machines were shown cutting custom motorcycle parts on
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Channel
   </company>
   's popular
   <em>
    American Chopper
   </em>
   program (later seen on Discovery's Turbo channel). Flow also won a contract from
   <company id="44448">
    SanDisk
   </company>
   , the manufacturer of flash memory cards and USB drives, a market with fast-paced growth in the field of consumer electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   After four years as CEO, Stephen Light set plans to retire once a successor could be named. Light said he had previously planned to retire at the end of the 2008 fiscal year, but moved up his retirement after realizing that strategic plans set in 2006 called for a CEO who could give at least five years' commitment to fulfilling the new strategy, which envisioned profitably growing the company to $500 million in annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   After conducting a strategic review, advised by Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital, Flow's board decided against selling the company, saying it was in the company's best interests to proceed with the strategic plan adopted in 2006 and finding a CEO to succeed the retiring Stephen Light.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2007 the company named Charles (Charley) Brown as Light's successor. Brown previously served as a senior executive at Black &amp; Decker (now
   <company id="11397">
    Stanley Black &amp; Decker
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="10824">

   </company>
   , and
   <company id="14396">
    Pentair
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Flow International signed an options agreement to buy privately held competitor OMAX Corp., and the two companies completed a definitive merger agreement in 2008. OMAX makes precision-engineered, computer-controlled, abrasive waterjet systems. Both companies are based in Kent, Washington. Flow planned to pay $75 million in cash and stock for OMAX. Terms of the deal were renegotiated as Flow's stock price fell during 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   approved the merger in 2008, stipulating a consent decree that requires Flow to provide waterjet competitors with royalty-free licenses to two patents held by OMAX.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2004 Flow and OMAX were in patent litigation, which the companies dismissed in 2009, as completion of the merger was pushed back again. Flow paid $10 million to OMAX and increased the amount held in escrow for the merger to $15 million under the legal settlement terms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third Point LLC, once a major stockholder of Flow International, lobbied for the company to go private, saying the company would save money. After two appeals for Flow International to put itself up for sale went unheeded, Third Point said it would be willing to make a buyout bid. In fiscal year 2008, the company negotiated the purchase of  Flow International's warrants from Third Point.
  </p>
  <p>
   The credit crisis and weak business conditions held up completion of the merger, as Flow pursued alternative financing. Finally, in 2009, Flow stated it would not acquire OMAX, saying the purchase would be too dilutive for its shareholders.
