   Stanley Furniture needs lots of rooms to spread out. The company, established in 1924, primarily makes wood furniture that retails in the upper-medium price range. Its products include furniture for adult bedrooms, dining rooms, youth bedrooms, home offices, and living rooms, as well as for home entertainment centers. Youth furniture is made under the Young America brand. Stanley Furniture makes and markets furniture styles such as European and American traditional lines, as well as contemporary/transitional and country/casual. With a manufacturing facility in North Carolina, the company sells its products through furniture and department stores. International customers account for about 10% of sales.

   Maintaining manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Southeast Asia, Stanley Furniture operates its business primarily in the US, but generates double-digit revenue from international customers.

   The furniture maker provides two major product lines through its namesake brand and its Young America brand. Under the Stanley Furniture name, it produces fashion-conscious adult furniture that is sourced overseas and marketed in upscale channels. The company also makes furniture for the infant and youth segment under the Young America brand. The line is made domestically and accommodates customized special orders.

   To stay competitive in the tough retail environment, the company has been streamlining its operations. Since 2005, when Stanley Furniture first noticed a slowdown in demand, the company has slashed its workforce by half and consolidated its manufacturing network from four facilities to one. It has also been working to keep costs down by sourcing certain materials from China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, particularly for its higher end furniture. The effort allows Stanley Furniture to log higher profits margins for these items.

        <p>
   Like others in furniture-making, Stanley Furniture has seen its sales decline since 2008. Home sales, which fuel the industry, have slowed on the average nationwide and have been linked to decreased furniture revenues. Also, while these are on the rise now, in general consumer confidence and disposable income have shrunken amid the economic downturn in the US and internationally.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net sales for Stanley Furniture dropped some 6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 due to lower unit volume for its Young America product line and costs associated with modernizing its domestic plant located in Robbinsville, North Carolina. (Since 2010 the company has invested some $8 million in the plant.) It logged declines despite seeing sales and unit volume increases for its Stanley Furniture product line. The furniture company posted profits in 2012 vs. 2011, thanks to a decline in both selling, general, and administrative expenses and cost of sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow, meanwhile, stood at a negative balance for 2012 due to cash used in investing activities, such as short-term investments and $2.7 million in capital expenditures for plant modernization and to improve its systems and website. Additionally, Stanley Furniture is investing $1.7 million in leasehold improvements as it works in 2013 to consolidate its showroom and corporate offices in High Point, North Carolina.

        <p>
   Stanley Furniture, which has developed a broad domestic and international customer base, sells its products to some 1,900 customers, 10% of which are international. The company sells its products predominantly through independent sales representatives to regional furniture chain stores, buying clubs, e-tailers, interior designers, small specialty retailers, and independent furniture stores.
