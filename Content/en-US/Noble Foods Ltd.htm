   Noble Foods should win a prize for knowing the secrets of the egg. As one of the largest UK egg producers, the company oversees all aspects of the chicken/egg cycle. The company sources eggs through more than 400 producers with whom Noble Foods has long-term contracts. As part of its business, the company packs more than 72 million fresh shell eggs weekly for its major retail customers and produces value-added egg products for its industrial and foodservice accounts. Its retail egg brands include The Happy Egg Co., Big &amp; Fresh, Goldenlay, and Woodland. At the end of their laying careers, Noble's hens become poultry products at the company processing plant.

  <p>
   Operating from five manufacturing sites, Noble Foods' Milling Division supplies poultry and pig feed to livestock producers throughout the UK. Originally set up to supply the company's own farms, over the last twenty years the Milling Division has grown to be one of the country's major feed manufacturers.
