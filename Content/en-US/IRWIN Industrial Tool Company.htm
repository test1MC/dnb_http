  <p>
   The company operates as part of Newell Rubbermaid's tools segment, which contributed about 15% of its parent's total revenues in fiscal 2014. The Tools segment generated mid-single-digit core sales growth in North America, as strong volume growth from Lenox products was partially offset by the impact of a slower-than-expected transition of an Irwin distribution center in 2014.

   IRWIN regularly rolls out new items to extend the reach of its portfolio of products. In 2013, for instance, it launched the Impact Performance Series line of screwdriving bits, nutsetters, socket adapters, and bit holders, as well as a series of folding utility knives using proprietary bladelock technology.
