   The company's power systems division provides components, which it casts, forges, machines, and fabricates, to the industrial gas turbine, and aerospace markets. Doncasters' fastener systems segment makes fasteners (critical engineered and tension control, ceramic ferrule, weld stud) which are used in transportation (automotive, marine, aerospace, agriculture), commercial construction (bridges, highways, parking structures, machinery), power generation, and industrial applications (appliances, automation).

  <p>
   Doncasters' revenues declined 8% from 2013 to 2014. This was fueled by reductions in sales within its power systems division, which reflected lower market demand. Specialized engineering divisional sales were also lower in 2014 due to lower demand for metals from certain customers and weaker petrochemical market demand.

  <p>
   Doncasters traces its beginnings in 1778 in Sheffield, England, when Daniel Doncaster established crucible steel-making for the making of hand tools. Today it is owned by Dubai International Capital, a Dubai-based international investment company.
