   HP Hood tries to cream the competition -- with ice cream, sour cream, and whipping cream. The leading US dairy producer also makes fluid milk, cottage cheese, and juices. Its home turf is New England, where it is one of the few remaining dairies to offer home milk delivery, serving some 15,000 customers. However, Hood's products are distributed throughout the US to chain and independent food retailers and convenience stores and to food service purveyors. In addition to its own and subsidiary brands, the Massachusetts company makes private-label and licensed dairy products and owns regional dairy producer
   <company id="111117">
    Crowley Foods
   </company>
   . HP Hood operates about 15 manufacturing plants nationwide.

        <p>
   HP Hood has evolved from a regional New England dairy business to a nationwide operations. Taking advantage of a competitor's interest in one of its regional dairy subsidiaries, Hood in 2011 sold
   <company id="113214">
    Kemps
   </company>
   (which it had purchased in 2004 alongside Crowley Foods) to much larger rival
   <company id="40314">
    Dairy Farmers of America
   </company>
   (DFA). Minnesota-based Kemps, which employed about 1,100 people at the time of the sale, makes and markets milk, ice cream, and other dairy products under the Kemps, Hood, Hagan, Green's, and Arrowhead brands. As part of the transaction, DFA took ownership of two milk processing plants, an ice cream and milk facility, and a plant that makes yogurt, sour cream, and cottage cheese.

   The deal came on the heels of several potentially lucrative agreements with big-name food companies and suppliers. Hood holds a licensing agreement with
   <company id="10722">
    The Hershey Company
   </company>
   , inked in 2010, to make and market a line of Hershey's-branded shelf-stable single-serve milk and milkshakes. (Given Hershey's complete penetration in the US food sector, the agreement has given Hood the opportunity to become a truly national dairy company.) Hood also produces Blue Diamond Almond Breeze almond milk under license from the
   <company id="54760">
    Blue Diamond Growers cooperative
   </company>
   , Baileys Non-Alcoholic Coffee Creamer under license from R&amp;A Bailey &amp; Co., and Southern Comfort Eggnog, which is licensed from
   <company id="11781">
    Brown-Forman
   </company>
   .

        <p>
   One of Hood's most successful products is its Simply Smart line of fat-free and low-fat milks. Another is the dairy beverage Calorie Countdown. Although introduced back in the low-carb diet craze, Calorie Countdown products continue to be popular. Hood's Lactaid brand of lactose-free reduced-fat milk holds the nation's #2 spot in the skim and low-fat milk sector, just behind private-label brands.
