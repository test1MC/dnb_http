   (the world's #1 cosmetics group), L'Oréal USA boasts a host of consumer and luxury brands, including Garnier, Maybelline, Lancôme, and Kiehl's. It also owns salon professional product makers Matrix and Kérastase, as well as mass market label

   Like all divisions within the L'Oréal group, L'Oréal USA is organized by its particular distribution channel: North America. Its structure is anticipated to foster a more responsive consumer-facing operation. To this end, the parent also continues to invest heavily in product research and development intended to win a local following.
  </p>
  <p>
   L'Oréal USA covers about 30 global beauty brands, including Garnier, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Kerastase, Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline, Redken, Urban Decay, and Yves Saint Laurent Beauté.

   In addition to its New York headquarters, L'Oréal USA has R&amp;D, manufacturing, and distribution facilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, and Washington.

   Although developing markets, such as Asia and Latin America, are the parent's geographic priority, North America delivered a solid increase in profitability in fiscal 2013. L'Oréal USA's sales increased by more than 5% over the prior year and accounted for about one-quarter of the group's revenue.
