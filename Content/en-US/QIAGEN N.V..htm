   QIAGEN puts the "gene-ie" back in the bottle. The company makes the tools researchers need to extract and purify nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), making them easier for researchers to see and analyze. QIAGEN has more than 500 products, including disposable kits used to collect, handle, and purify samples; automated workstations used to prepare nucleic acids samples; and disposable testing agents to detect health conditions or predispositions. Its customers include drug development companies, academic and government researchers, and diagnostics labs. The company also provides some contract research services including DNA sequencing. QIAGEN sells its products in more than 40 countries via direct sales and distributors.

  <p>
   QIAGEN operates two business segments, Consumables and related revenues, and Instrumentation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumables unit, by far the larger of the two at nearly 90% of revenue, makes consumable tests and kits used for nucleic acid purification and molecular diagnostic testing. Key test kits include those to detect the human papilloma virus (HPV) and swine flu.The company also provides bioinformatics solutions, including the Ingenuity, CLC bio and BIOBASE portfolios.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Instrumentation segment provides products that automate the use of consumables for a range of laboratory needs. Automation platforms include QIAsymphony (molecular testing), Rotor-Gene Q (make sequences of DNA and RNA visible), GeneReader NGS System (Sample to Insight next-generation sequencing (NGS) solution), and Modaplex  (a multimodal automation system).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US accounts for some 40% of revenue. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa together contribute 32% of revenue, while the Asia-Pacific region and rest of the world contribute 20%. The company's top seven emerging markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey), count for 15% of total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   QIAGEN's products are marketed in 130 countries. It has consumables manufacturing facilities in Germany, China, the UK and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Some of the company's products are developed and sold through strategic alliances with other diagnostics firms. It has distribution agreements with Abbott Laboratories, Roche, and Siemens, for example, in which QIAGEN supplies assays that can be run on instrumentation systems sold by those companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has more than 500,000 customers globally. The molecular diagnostics sector provides 50% of revenue, and the applied testing, pharma, and academia sectors combine for the remaining 50% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   QIAGEN likes its sales teams to have degrees in molecular biology or related fields so they can provide direct technical support to the company's customers. The company markets through print media, including catalogs and articles, and through seminars and direct marketing campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising costs for the years ending December 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $7.2 million, $7.0 million, and $7.6 million.

  <p>
   The strong US Dollar negatively impacted the top line in fiscal 2015, with sales falling 5% to $1.3 billion. When factoring out currency movements, revenue from Consumables grew 3% and Instruments 5%. The acquisitions of Enzymatics NGS's technology and consumables and BIOBASE added 2% to sales growth, while the rest of the business provided 1 percentage point of growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income defied the fall in revenue and climbed 9% to $127 million as currency exchange movements were felt positively in terms of administrative, R&amp;D, and sales and marketing expenses. QIAGEN's cash position strengthened, with cash from operations rising 10% to $317 million.

  <p>
   QIAGEN's growth strategy is based on making relevant acquisitions of companies and technologies. In 2015, it acquired a technology from AdnaGen that allows for the molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells from blood samples. The technology is added to QIAGEN's pipeline of liquid biopsies; liquid biopsies are a cheaper and less invasive method of molecular testing than tissue biopsies.
  </p>
  <p>
   It partnered with Cell Microsystems for rights to commercialize the Cell Raft Array technology used in the isolation and analysis of single cells -- an emerging area of research. The pipeline addition complements its REPLI-g product line. QIAGEN also partners with Biotype Diagnostics GmbH to develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic workflows, based on QIAGEN's Modaplex platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also develops its own products and technologies, and in 2015 introduced the GeneReader NGS System, a next-generation Sample-to-Insight solution. It received regulatory approval for use with

  <p>
   The company has made a series of acquisitions in recent years, including OmicSoft Corporation in 2017, Exiqon A/S in 2016, MO BIO Laboratories in 2015, and Enzymatics and BIOBASE in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017, QIAGEN acquired OmicSoft Corporation, which specializes in multi-omics data management infrastructure software for researchers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company completed the $95 million acquisition of Denmark-based Exiqon A/S, a provider of RNA analysis solutions with a proprietary Locked Nucleid Acid technology. The acquisition will expand company's presence in Sample to Insight solutions for RNA analysis for approximately $95 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2015, the company acquired California based MO BIO Laboratories, a provider of technologies to analyze the impact of microbial diversity. The acquisition adds a complementary portfolio of sample technologies to QIAGEN's next-generation sequencing solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company acquired the enzyme solutions business of Enzymatics, a U.S. company whose products are used in an estimated 80% of all next-generation sequencing workflows.
