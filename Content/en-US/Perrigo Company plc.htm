   Perrigo makes its name by making sure you never see it. One of the world's largest manufacturers of generic and private-label OTC (over-the-counter) pharmaceuticals and supplements, the company makes products that use similar packaging and discount pricing to compete with leading national brands. It makes more than 4,900 consumer products, including pain relievers, cough and cold remedies, digestive aids, animal health products, and smoking cessation products -- some of which are sold under its own Good Sense brand. It also makes about 800 generic prescription products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs, or raw drug ingredients), and nutritional (dietary supplement, infant feeding) products.

  <p>
   In 2013 Perrigo completed a large acquisition that the company expects to further its international expansion efforts: Perrigo purchased Ireland-based drugmaker
   <company id="47964">
    Elan
   </company>
   for some $8.6 billion. The purchase added a number of development-stage drugs for neurological conditions including Alzheimer's and bipolar disorder, as well as royalty rights on multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri (marketed by
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen Idec
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   To complete the deal, Perrigo formed a new holding company in Ireland; the firm's name changed from Perrigo Company to Perrigo Company plc.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   During fiscal 2015, related to the acquisition of Omega, Perrigo realigned its reportable segments. The Consumer Healthcare (CHC) segment is the largest unit, bringing in some 60% of the group's total revenues. CHC is responsible for sales of OTC products, including such brands as Good Sense, Sergeant's, Sentry, Herron, Bright Beginnings, and Pet Armor. Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH), which comprises the newly acquired Omega operations, develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes European OTC products; its products fall into the natural health; vitamins, minerals, and supplements; cough, cold, and allergy; lifestyle; anti-parasite; and personal care categories. The Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment includes the Rx pharmaceuticals business, and the Specialty Sciences focuses on the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's manufacturing operations are conducted through subsidiaries Quimica y Farmacia (Mexico) and Wrafton (UK), including the production of OTC and store-brand pharmaceutical and nutritional products. Perrigo manufactures generic prescription drugs at facilities in the US and Israel through its Perrigo Rx division, and subsidiary Perrigo API (formerly Chemagis) makes APIs in Israel.

  <p>
   About a fifth of Perrigo's sales originate overseas. Primary non-US markets include Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Israel, and Mexico. The company has distribution and manufacturing facilities in Australia, Israel, Mexico, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   Perrigo's US-based customers include such megaretailers as
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10984">
    CVS
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="17060">
    Costco
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11601">
    Walgreen
   </company>
   and wholesalers such as
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   . Wal-Mart is its largest customer, accounting for 15% of Perrigo's fiscal 2015 sales (down from 19% in fiscal 2014).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also markets new drugs through the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   's OTC monograph system, wherein drugs that have been deemed safe and effective can be produced without pre-market approval.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising costs came in at some $55,7 million in fiscal 2015, up from $41.4 million in 2014 and $26.1 million in 2013. Perrigo uses print and online ads, as well as direct mail campaigns, to promote its consumer health and nutritional products. The generic prescription drug segment markets through physician relationships.

  <p>
   The firm has seen steady increases in sales over the last several years. Perrigo's fiscal 2015 (ends June) sales topped $4.6 billion, a 13% increase versus the prior year, largely due to the addition of the new BCH segment as well as increases for the Rx Pharmaceuticals and Specialty Sciences segments. Specialty Sciences more than doubled its earnings, thanks partly to rising royalties for Tysabri. These gains were partially offset by a decline in the CHC segment, which faced added competition in the contract manufacturing market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has slipped since 2013. In fiscal 2015, it dropped 38% to $128 million on higher operating costs and acquisition expenses. Cash flow from operations, which has maintained an upward trend, grew 73% to $1.2 billion (driven by changes in current assets and liabilities).

  <p>
   Perrigo has grown its operations through acquisitions of new or complimentary product lines and by entering new geographic markets. Along with snapping up other companies' products, Perrigo has its own in-house research and development team that whips up generic formulations of name brand products and also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating its own products. New consumer health products launched in fiscal 2015 included generic versions of Ensure, Ensure Plus, and Frontline Plus.
  </p>
  <p>
   New branded consumer health product launches in fiscal 2015 included a new skin care line in the Nordic region and a new dual-action cough line in six new markets; the segment has a number of products nearing release, including a line of men's vitamins and the Urostemol line of urological products (both in the UK). In nutritionals, Perrigo is partnering with Ferrara Candy Company to produce branded gummy vitamins and supplements across the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Rx segment, Perrigo aims to create first-to-market generic formulations of branded drugs nearing their patent expiration date. It focuses on hard-to-produce formulations such as topical medicines, controlled substances, and specialty drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2015 the FDA approved a number of new Perrigo products, including generic versions of Pennsaid, Advil Congestion Relief Tablets, Astrepo Nasal Spray, and Vanos Cream.
  </p>
  <p>
   To provide enhanced shareholder services and improve visibility, Perrigo transferred its stock listing from the
   <company id="101245">
    NASDAQ
   </company>
   market to the
   <company id="41286">
    NYSE
   </company>
   in 2013.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Perrigo acquired European OTC company Omega for $4.4 billion. The deal strengthened its position in the European OTC market and helped boost its overall strategy of expanding internationally. Also that year, the company purchased Gelcaps Exportadora de Mexico (the former Mexico-based operations of pharmaceutical firm
   <company id="59997">
    Patheon
   </company>
   ) for $35.8 million, gaining softgel manufacturing technology to its business in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perrigo plans to buy Naturwohl, which makes the German dietary supplement brand Yokebe, for €130 million. It is also buying a portfolio of established OTC products from
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   for €200 million. Both of those purchases will further expand the company's European OTC operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired a portfolio of women's health care products from US-based
   <company id="16711">
    Lumara Health
   </company>
   for $83 million.

  <p>
   Brothers Luther and Charles Perrigo moved from New York to Michigan in 1887 and opened a general store. Soon they began packaging home remedies. Charles left the company, but Luther continued, incorporating in 1892. Their family ran the business for most of the next century.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Perrigo began making drugs and personal products. In 1979 Michael Jandernoa became VP of finance for the firm, which by the next year led the store-brand products industry. In 1984 it bought Bell Pharmacal Labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perrigo went public in 1986 as part of manufacturing conglomerate the Grow Group, then was bought by management in 1988 and taken public again in 1991. Perrigo built its own packaging and labeling plant in 1992.
