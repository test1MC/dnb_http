   DNA is in Numerex's blood. The company is a provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) products and services. M2M consists of using a Device (sensor or meter) to capture an event (location or environmental status) relayed through a Network (wireless, wireline, or hybrid) to an Application that translates the data into actionable information. Through its cloud-based service development platform called Numerex FAST, the company aids companies and government entities with monitoring, measuring, and managing their assets. Numerex's combined network services, hardware, and application development capabilities are targeted at various market segments, including energy, security, financial services, health care, and supply chain.

  <p>
   Numerex makes most of its money (69%) through subscription and support services. The rest comes through sale of it embedded devices and other hardware.

  <p>
   Numerex, based in Atlanta, is more established in the US (94% of sales), but it does some business in Canada, (4% of sales)and  in Mexico and Australia. It is working to expand into additional countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   The company sells its M2M offerings typically on a subscription basis to partners that provide M2M development and support for end users, primarily enterprises and government entities. These partners include system integrators, resellers, and OEMs that  consulting groups, wireless network operators, and supply chain partners. One hardware customer accounts for 14% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   It uses an indirect sales model for its unbranded "white label" products through value-added resellers (VARs), SIs, and OEMs, who integrate Numerex products and services into their own. It also indirectly markets and sells certain Numerex branded products and services like the Uplink alarm security platform through distributors and dealers.

  <p>
   Numerex's revenues have been on the uptick for the past five years. Overall sales grew 20% to about $94 million in 2014, when subscription revenue increased 26%, compared to 20% from 2012 to 2013. Embedded devices and hardware sales grew about 10% in 2014 as the company introduced more 4G products and cut prices for legacy 2G hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit was up nearly 200% to $1.74 million for 2014 from 2013. While increased revenue was part of the higher profit, Numerex substantially benefited from a pretax gain on the sale of a privately held business, which amounted to more than $1 million.

  <p>
   As part of its strategy to provide more offerings, it introduced a satellite-based system for tracking assets. It can be used around the world and has reporting frequency of as little as five minutes. That built on a 2013 service offering for an unlimited satellite data plan for its M2M products.

  <p>
   The company periodically makes acquisitions to expand its technological capabilities. In 2014 it paid $37.5 million for Omnilink, a fellow M2M company that will expand Numerex's position in the security, tracking, and monitoring market segments. The prior year it bought the intellectual property and business of Texas-based AVIDwireless to support the development of Numerex next-generation M2M platforms and managed services. AVIDwireless' technologies have been implemented in several M2M market segments, including oil field site management systems, intelligent tracking, wireless temperature monitoring, wireless tank and well monitoring, and intermodal system and asset tracking.
