   Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology (HART) hasn't gotten around yet to manufacturing hearts from scratch but is making headway in growing other, hollow organs for use in transplants. The business segment that
   <company id="102348">
    Harvard Bioscience
   </company>
   has operated since 2009 produces bioreactors and synthetic scaffolds that use stem cells to develop replacement organs such as tracheas. A small number of successful surgeries have been performed with HART products to replace patients' airways. Experiments are also underway to grow more complicated organs such as lungs, heart valves, and esophagi. HART filed an IPO in in late 2012 but withdrew it in mid-2013.

  <p>
   HART planned to use the proceeds for research and development, sales and marketing, business development, working capital, and general corporate purposes.

   HART is a clinical-stage operation with a focus on developing bioreactor products to market to doctors and researchers. These devices would be used for growing organs outside the body for transplant purposes. The company is presently also developing infusion pumps whose primary use will be to inject cells into damaged tissue. In the longer term, HART has its eye on producing bioreactors that would regenerate more-solid organs such as lungs, gastrointestinal tracts, livers, kidneys, and even hearts.

  <p>
   So far, HART has not generated any revenue. It doesn't expect any substantial sales until it has gained the approval of regulatory agencies to market its bioreactor systems and scaffolds to transplant surgeons. Between 2010 and 2011 all of the company's operating expenses (administrative, sales and marketing, research and development) doubled and even tripled as Harvard Bioscience ramped up its investment in regenerative medicine.

  <p>
   As the main market for trachea transplants is in cancer treatment, HART believes that its products hold important advantages over alternative methods such as radiation therapy, tracheotomies, and chemotherapy, including a longer survival rate. Together with tracheas damaged by other means, the company sees a potential world market for the use of its products in tracheal transplants of about $300 million per year. HART plans to use its experience with tackling tracheal problems in developing products to replace other, slightly more complex organs. It especially wants to target organs whose loss is life-threatening in that it is easier to get regulatory approval and patients' consent for their replacement. The company's vision is to concentrate on making medical devices such as bioreactors and scaffolds rather than cellular therapies as the former represent lower costs in clinical trials. HART also wants to continue its collaboration with physicians at leading institutions such as the

   and
