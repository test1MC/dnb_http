   American Standard Brands was formed in early 2008 through a merger of three companies: American Standard Americas, which was the bath and kitchen products division of American Standard Companies (now
   <company id="40026">
    Trane
   </company>
   ); plumbing fixture maker
   <company id="131254">
    Crane Plumbing
   </company>
   ; and vitreous china fixture manufacturer
   <company id="117845">
    Eljer
   </company>
   . The combination created a major force in the industry with a broader product and brand portfolio (including the American Standard, Crane, Eljer, Porcher, Fiat, and Jado brands) and enhanced global distribution opportunities.
