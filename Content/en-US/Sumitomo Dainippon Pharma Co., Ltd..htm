   develops and markets central nervous system and respiratory drugs in North America; its top-selling product is insomnia therapy Lunesta. SDP also makes food and feed additives, veterinary drugs, fine chemicals, and diagnostic reagents used in research and clinical laboratories.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, revenue increased 11% to ¥387.7 billion, primarily due to growth in North America (which rose 25% on sales of the atypical antipsychotic Latuda) and China (which rose on sales of antibiotic Meropen and hypertension agent Almarl). Sales of Xopenex dropped, partially offsetting growth. Sales in Japan also dropped as products lost patent protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income doubled that year to ¥20 billion due to the increased sales, as well as higher investment earnings. Cash flow from operations remained flat at ¥50 billion.

  <p>
   Like most of its Japanese competitors, the company wants to become a global pharma powerhouse. Outside of acquisitions, SDP pursues drug development operations in hopes of expanding in new and existing markets. It is expanding into Europe and Oceania, in addition to China, North America, and Japan. It is also pursuing alliances in Central and South America.

   In 2013 the company entered into an R&amp;D and commercialization agreement with Edison Pharmaceuticals through which it gained rights to develop and market mitochondrial disease agents EPI-743 and EPI-589. The following year former partner

   was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for the antipsychotic Latuda. (However, in 2015 Takeda and DSP terminated their partnership for the commercialization of Latuda in Europe.)

  <p>
   SDP was formed from the 2005 merger of Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. The company uses its relationship with Sumitomo Chemical and the resulting economies of scale to help it grow in its home market and to expand overseas.
