   The highlight of Hilite International's day is to&#160;manufacture high-volume, high-tech auto components and systems. Its lineup is used&#160;in&#160;many powertrain (engine and transmission)&#160;applications. Hilite's hydraulic and electromagnetic products (on/off valves and variable pressure solenoids)&#160;enhance fuel efficiency,&#160;emissions control, and torque. Hilite sells to&#160;global auto OEMs&#160;such as
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41758">
    BMW
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41867">
    Honda
   </company>
   , and brake systems suppliers such as
   <company id="14127">
    BorgWarner
   </company>
   . The company, established in 1999, operates through eight locations spanning&#160;Asia, &#160;Europe, and North America.

   Hilite filed for bankruptcy in 2009, emerged the same year, and recapitalized with the help of its&#160;lenders (primarily Carreras' investment group, Carreras Kestner &amp; Co.). It was acquired by
   <company id="47011">
    3i Group
   </company>
   in 2011 for £112 million (about $181 million).

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Hilite intends to grow its international reach through its three locations in Germany, two in the US, and three in China.

   Hilite continues to focus on its bottom line as it places its 2009 bankruptcy in the rear view mirror. In 2012 it sold its heavy duty emissions control operations to auto parts giant
   <company id="10423">
    Cummins
   </company>
   . Hilite made the divestiture in order to focus on growing its core business of powertrain components for passenger cars on a more international scale.

   James Lineberger, the company's first chairman, acquired Hinderliter Industries' automotive division through his Lineberger &amp; Co. investment firm in 1986. He renamed the unit Hilite Industries. The acquisition included Surfaces, Inc. (brake-proportioning valves), Pitts Industries, Inc. (electromagnetic clutches), and Machined Parts Company (stamped components).
  </p>
        <p>
   Hilite's sales increased during the early 1990s as safety concerns grew among consumers. The company's brake-proportioning valves became popular components for antilock braking systems. Hilite went public in 1994.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company entered the specialty components and assemblies market in 1995 by purchasing North American Spring and Stamping (NASS), a maker of auto electronic components for airflow sensors and electronic controllers for antilock brakes and airbag systems.
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   put the division on probation in 1996 because of poor performance. Hilite restructured to regain Ford's preferred provider status for NASS. The company recorded a loss in fiscal 1997, due in part to the restructuring.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Hilite and NASS settled charges made by Hilite that NASS had misrepresented certain material facts during its acquisition; as a result, about $2 million of the original purchase price was trimmed. Joseph Carreras, through his Carreras Kestner &amp; Co. investment firm, took Hilite private in 1999. Lineberger stepped down as chairman, and Carreras became CEO. The next year the company acquired Northern Stamping and its two manufacturing locations in Ohio.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 Hilite purchased French automotive and electrical components maker EBEA S.A.&#160;In 2002&#160;Hilite bought Germany-based Hydraulik-Ring, a producer of electrical components for engine and transmission applications.
  </p>
        <p>
   Hilite&#160;bolted on&#160;a strategic license agreement with
   <company id="47830">
    Clean Diesel Technologies
   </company>
   in 2008. The non-exclusive deal enabled Hilite to&#160;use Clean Diesel's ARIS airless injection technology for SCR control, touted to minimize oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions and fuel consumption.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011&#160;UK-based
   <company id="47011">
    3i Group
   </company>
   invested&#160;£112 million (about $181 million)&#160;to&#160;gain control of Hilite from CEO Joseph Carreras.
