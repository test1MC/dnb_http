   Creative Technology wants PC audiophiles to be entertained and plugged into the latest gear. The firm is a leading manufacturer of digital entertainment products, including portable audio players (Zen), PC sound cards (Sound Blaster), headphones, speakers, Webcams, and pocket video cameras. Creative also makes music and PC keyboards and mice. The company's subsidiaries include Cambridge SoundWorks (PC speakers), Broadxent, and Creative Labs, among others. Creative's customers include retailers, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Creative Technology, which does business in Asia, Europe, and the US, was founded in Singapore in 1981 and is run by its chairman and CEO Sim Wong Hoo.

  <p>
   In 1981 Sim Wong Hoo (chairman and CEO) and Ng Kai Wa (later joined by Chay Kwong Soon) used a $6,000 stake to found Creative Technology as an engineering services company. It began making Apple II clones for the Chinese market in 1984; two years later it started producing PC clones. From 1983 to 1988 most of Creative's revenues came from PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   With stiff competition in the PC market, Sim shifted Creative's focus to sound cards and other PC enhancements. The company introduced its first Sound Blaster audio card in 1989; Sound Blaster soon became the industry standard. That year Creative launched PJS, an artificial intelligence-based Chinese-language operating system, and Views, a complementary word processor and desktop publisher with a more than 70,000-character alphabet. Also in 1989 Tandy (now
   <company id="11441">
    RadioShack
   </company>
   ) ordered a large supply of Game Blasters -- a sound card targeted at gamers -- for its 8,000 Radio Shack stores, giving Creative a strong foothold in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Creative launched the first of its market-dominating upgrade kits, the Sound Blaster Multimedia Upgrade Kit, a software package bundled with a high-performance CD-ROM drive and a set of software applications. The company went public in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growing popularity of multimedia products was music to Creative's ears. More computers were selling with sound cards and multimedia capabilities pre-installed, so the company signed deals to supply manufacturers including
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   . Creative also diversified: In 1993 it acquired ShareVision Technology (videoconferencing products) and E-MU Systems (digital sound production systems).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also tried its hand at communication products. In 1994 it acquired modem maker Digicom (now Broadxent). The next year it released Phone Blaster, which combined voice mail, e-mail, and fax transmission functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cracks began to show in Creative's progress in 1995. The slowing of the sound board market caused a steep drop in profits and prompted the company to restructure and refocus on sound products. Ng resigned that year, and Chay left in 1996. Creative introduced Graphics Blaster add-on graphics accelerator cards and signed a deal for
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung
   </company>
   to build its CD-ROM drive products that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Opting to add new technology quickly through acquisitions, in 1997 Creative bought speaker maker Cambridge Soundworks; ENSONIQ, maker of audio chips and electronic musical instruments (now part of E-MU/ENSONIQ); and the NetMedia Group of core logic chipset maker
   <company id="16039">
    OPTi
   </company>
   . In 1998 the company acquired Silicon Engineering, a maker of communications, multimedia, and storage integrated circuits. In 1999 Creative debuted the Nomad MP3 player, which played digitally encoded music downloaded from PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sharp declines in Creative's Internet investments and the broader electronics market led the company to restructure its operations in 2001. Creative closed a factory, cut its staff by 10%, wrote off substantial losses in its investment portfolio, and recentered its operations on its core lines of digital audio products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company acquired graphics chip maker
   <company id="52760">
    3Dlabs
   </company>
   in a deal worth about $105 million. Years later, in 2006, Creative whittled away at 3Dlabs' operations and refocused the graphics unit on the portable handheld device market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2008 the company sold its corporate headquarters in Singapore for a gain of about $145 million. The proceeds were used to reduce debt. In 2009 it formed a new subsidiary, ZiiLABS (formerly 3DLabs) to develop the next generation of media-rich processors and platforms.
