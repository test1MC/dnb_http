   In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes -- and those things tested by MTS Systems. The company produces testing systems that simulate repeated or harsh conditions to determine mechanical behavior of materials, products, and structures. Its systems are used worldwide in infrastructure markets, from inspecting steel to locomotive rail testing. MTS caters to auto makers with road simulators. In aerospace, MTS tests aircraft fatigue. Services include maintenance and training. MTS also supplies industrial sensors (Temposonics) to increase machine efficiency and safety. About three-quarters of the company's customers operate outside the US.

  <p>
   MTS's test segment primarily comprises products for the testing of ground vehicles (accounting for 50% of the segment's revenue) and products for testing materials in industries that include power generation, aerospace, vehicles, and bio-medicine (30% of the segment's revenue). Structure-testing products for aerospace, wind energy, structural engineering, petroleum, and other industries account for the remainder of the test segment's revenue. Product orders range in value from a few hundred dollars to $11 million, but the average order is about $115,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sensors, which account for 20% of sales, automate machinery to increase safety and productivity. They're used in such industries as the manufacturing of plastic injection molding machines, steel mills, fluid power, oil and gas, and alternative energy. Sensor product orders are sold at unit prices ranging from $25 to $10,000, with an average price of $500.

  <p>
   MTS has manufacturing plants in China, Germany, and the US (in Minnesota and North Carolina). Other offices are located across Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and North America. Asia generated about 40% of overall sales in 2013, while Europe accounted for a third and the US, a quarter.

  <p>
   The test segment has sales staff in the US and China and sales and service subsidiaries in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the UK. Sold through a direct sales force and independent distributors, MTS's sensors are engineered and assembled in North Carolina, Germany, and Japan.

   Behind both a high backlog (some $300 million) and new orders within its test segment, revenue was up 5% in fiscal 2013 (year-end September) to $570 million. The company's test segment grew 7%. Sales for the sensors segment, however, decreased 5%. MTS' profits increased 12% due to the higher revenue levels.

  <p>
   The company's long-term goal is to reach $1 billion in sales. It plans through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions, as well as aggressively building out its infrastructure, expanding its product offerings, and pursuing more opportunities with key customers around the world. To that end, it opened an engineering test lab in China with
   <company id="157741">
    Chery Automobile
   </company>
   in 2014. It's the company's first vehicle testing lab in China. It also launched a new line of sensors, called the T-Series, for the energy market.

  <p>
   MTS Systems, a spinoff of
   <company id="14573">
    Research, Incorporated
   </company>
   , was started in 1966 to make software so automakers could replicate test track conditions in the laboratory. MTS's first products measured auto body endurance. Donald Sullivan, who became president in 1982 and CEO in 1987, pulled the company through a market slump in the early 1990s by steering it into the factory automation business. The move was initiated by the 1992 acquisition of small startup Custom Servo Motors, a maker of compact, powerful motors used to control fabrication and packaging motions in factory applications. Sullivan was named chairman in 1994, replacing company co-founder George Butzow.
  </p>
  <p>
   To feed revenue momentum, the company made some of its systems compatible with
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   's Windows NT environments, and it tailored tools to specific customers. In 1996 the Japanese government bought a $23 million seismic simulator in the wake of the 1995 Hanshin earthquake. The company moved into the aerospace products market in 1997, creating titanium-based component subsidiary AeroMet. (MTS shut down AeroMet in late 2005, saying the unit could not achieve a sustainable business model.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Sullivan stepped down as CEO in 1998 and was replaced by longtime
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   executive Sidney (Chip) Emery. MTS in 1999 bought engine design testing specialist DSP Technology. A drop in profits for the fiscal year, partly the result of the purchase, prompted MTS to restructure and lay off nearly 10% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company won a $37 million contract from the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   to design, manufacture, and install an advanced roadway simulator. The next year MTS sold its electronic assembly operations to
   <company id="100964">
    PEMSTAR
   </company>
   and expanded its line of software products for the auto industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   MTS sold its automation division in 2003 to
   <company id="11156">
    Parker Hannifin
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company signed an agreement with
   <company id="43106">
    National Instruments
   </company>
   in 2004 to cooperate on research and development of a low-cost framework for noise and vibration testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 MTS sold its Powertrain Technology (engine testing) division to A&amp;D Co., Ltd. of Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chip Emery left the CEO's post in early 2008 and was succeeded by president/COO Laura Hamilton. Emery remained chairman until the end of fiscal 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid 2008 the company sold off its Nano Instruments business to Agilent Technologies. The deal marked MTS's exit from supplying nanoindentation systems and related equipment, used in verifying structural integrity of semiconductor devices, and coatings and thin films.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2008 the company widened its pipeline to China. MTS acquired the assets of SANS Group, a Chinese supplier of materials testing systems, for nearly $44 million. The Shenzhen-based firm makes electromechanical and static-hydraulic testing machines, among other products. The deal builds upon MTS' move to establish a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai, in 2007. A sales office was first opened in China in 1985.
