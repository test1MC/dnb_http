   Renewable Energy Group, or REG, wants alternative fuel to become a regular thing for its customers. The company sells SoyPOWER brand biodiesel throughout the US, controlling about 40% of US sales. Biodiesel is a clean burning fuel made from waste, including vegetable oil, corn, grain, and soybeans. REG owns four and manages five plants that make about 260 million gallons of biofuel per year; that fuel is sold to fleet operators, the military, and mining, agriculture, and home-heating companies. In addition to its production and distribution activities, REG also builds biodiesel production plants for other firms.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company biodiesel segment has facilities in Ralston, Iowa; Houston, Texas; Danville, Illinois; Newton, Iowa; Seneca, Illinois; Albert Lea, Minnesota; Mason City, Iowa; and New Boston, Texas.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   REG produces most of its biodiesel from a wide variety of lower cost feedstocks, including inedible corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. It also produces a smaller portion from higher-cost virgin vegetable oils. In 2012, it sold 188 million gallons of biodiesel, of which 25 million gallons were purchased from third parties and resold.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company biodiesel segment gets its revenues from the purchases and sales of biodiesel and raw material feedstocks acquired from third parties, sales of biodiesel produced under toll manufacturing arrangements with third party facilities, sales of processed biodiesel from company facilities, related by-products, and renewable energy government incentive payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   REG's services segment offers services for managing the construction of biodiesel production facilities and managing ongoing operations of third party plants. It collects fees related to the services provided.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has a national distribution system. Each of its facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both, and a logistics and supply chain management staff, for facilitating the distribution of its products. It also leases more than 330 railcars, and leases biodiesel storage tanks at 18 petroleum fuel terminals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 REG had 328 customers;

   accounted for 36% of the REG's revenues that year.

  <p>
   The company's revenue grew by 23% in 2012 due to higher biodiesel sales, reflecting increased production capacity at its Seneca facility and the Albert Lea facility. The company did not toll manufacture any gallons in 2012 for third parties (as it did in 2011 when it tolled 5.6 million gallons at the REG Houston facility) due to the absence of federal credits. Higher revenues were partially offset by lower prices in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped by 75% in 2012 as the result of higher biodiesel costs (due to higher volumes sold) partially offset by slightly lower feedstock prices. In addition, a decrease in soybean oil prices and higher heating oil prices resulted in reduced market value of its derivative financial instruments related to biodiesel sales in the fourth quarter of 2012.

  <p>
   REG's expertise in design, build and upgrades experience has helped the company to improve and test new production technologies that enable lower operating costs, improved yields, and expand its ability to use lower cost feedstocks. This expertise has also allowed the company to quickly and cost effectively upgrade and integrate the acquired biodiesel plants. It is focused on improving its production process efficiency and quality and to deploy best practices throughout its network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company teamed up with Dutch Hill Terminals, a leading heating oil terminal in New Jersey, to market biodiesel and biodiesel blended heating oil at its Clifton, New Jersey location. The deal gives REG additional capacity to serve markets in the Northeast.
  </p>
  <p>
   Biodiesel government incentives expired in December 2011 but reinstated on January 2013 retroactively for 2012 through fiscal 2013.

   As a part of its long term growth strategy, in 2013 REG agreed to buy Oklahoma-based

    Syntroleum,
   </company>
   a leader in Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquids and renewable diesel fuel technologies, and as well as its 50%-owned subsidiary Dynamic Fuels. The deal moves REG into renewable diesel, and boost its advanced biofuel business, enhances its intellectual property portfolio, and grows its geographic footprint and customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 REG purchased a 30-million gallon per year capacity biodiesel plant in Mason City, Iowa (formerly owned by Soy Energy, LLC) for $17 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it also acquired BullDog Biodiesel, LLC (an idled 15-million gallon per year nameplate capacity biodiesel facility near Atlanta) for $2.6 million, and a biorefinery in New Boston, Texas for $300,000.

  </p>
  <p>
   REG went public in 2011 with an IPO. It used the $60 million in proceeds of purchase the Danville, Illinois manufacturing plant it formerly  leased.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010, REG leased commercial‐scale biodiesel plants in Newton, Iowa and Danville, Illinois, making the company North America's largest wholly‐owned biodiesel manufacturing and marketing source. Shareholders in Central Iowa Energy and Blackhawk Biofuels approve the sale. The facilities, now named REG Newton and REG Danville, added an additional 75 million gallons per year of production capacity to REG's operations. The company that same year acquired another biodiesel plant, from ARES Corporation in Clovis, New Mexico, with a production capacity of 15 million gallons per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed in 2003 by West Central Cooperative.
