   Dal-Tile Corporation never fails to floor its customers. The company is one of the world's largest and best-known ceramic tile makers. It designs, manufacturers, and distributes ceramic, porcelain, glass, metal, and natural stone tile products to the construction and development, architecture, and do-it-yourself markets. Most of its products are sold under the popular Dal-Tile or American Olean brand names. Founded in 1947, Dal-Tile has manufacturing plants across the US and Mexico and is a subsidiary of flooring giant

    Mohawk Industries
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dal-Tile has about 10 manufacturing plants in Mexico and the US. It plans to open its 11th manufacturing plant in Tennessee by 2015.

   Its products are not sold to the public. Instead, they go through company-owned service centers, independent contractors, and through retailers such as
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   , mostly in North America. To best serve the unique needs of each of these channels, the company operates three strategic business units: Daltile, American Olean, and Home Center Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dal-Tile is distributed through independent distributors in Mexico. The American Olean brand is primarily distributed through independent distributors and company-owned service centers that service both residential and commercial customers.

   Dal-Tile is part of Mohawk's ceramic segment, which contributed 36% of net revenue in 2013. This segment's revenue skyrocketed by 66% from 2012 to 2013 due to higher volume, a favorable product and price mix, the Marazzi acquisition made by its parent, and strong growth within the residential and commercial channels.

  <p>
   In order to grow, Dal-Tile continues to invest in capital expenditures, principally in new equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency, and develop new capabilities.It is also expanding its international presence through investments in China and Mexico and through its parent's 2013 acquisition of the

   in Europe and Russia.

   Robert Brittingham founded Dallas Ceramic Company in 1947. It opened a plant in Mexico during the 1950s, and in 1980, the same year it acquired Keystone Ridgeway (porcelain ceramic mosaic), the company became Dal-Tile.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 Brittingham and company president John LoMonaco were charged with illegally dumping lead-contaminated waste at Seagoville, near Dallas (convicted in 1993, the two were fined $6 million).
   <company id="43091">
    AEA Investors
   </company>
   bought Dal-Tile in 1990 for $650 million (Brittingham received about $345 million), and the company stopped using lead-based materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charles Pilliod of AEA became CEO of Dal-Tile in 1993, replacing 34-year veteran Bill Cox. The next year former
   <company id="10162">
    Baker Hughes
   </company>
   executive Howard Bull became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dal-Tile bought Armstrong World Industries' (a subsidiary of
   <company id="10129">
    Armstrong Holdings
   </company>
   ) American Olean unit (glazed and unglazed tile) in 1995. The deal gave Dal-Tile a 30% share of the North American ceramic tile market and Armstrong a 34% stake in Dal-Tile. In 1996 Dal-Tile went public and introduced Home Source tiles for do-it-yourselfers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Dal-Tile recorded a $110 million loss, in part from inventory write-downs. The company cut 10% of its workforce; Bull resigned, and Jacques Sardas, CEO of auto parts maker Sudbury, replaced him. (Sardas left the company when it was acquired in 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After failing to gain control of Dal-Tile, Armstrong sold its stake in 1998. In 1999 Dal-Tile merged its R&amp;M Supplies and Dal-Minerals subsidiaries into its Dal-Tile Corporation subsidiary. The following year Dal-Tile formed a joint venture (Dal Italia) with Italy-based tile maker EmilCeramica. As the economy slowed,
   <company id="43091">
    AEA Investors
   </company>
   sold its stake in Dal-Tile to carpet maker
   <company id="14105">
    Mohawk Industries
   </company>
   in 2002 for $1.5 billion, even though the company's sales and profits continued apace. The acquisition gave Mohawk more than a 25% market share of the tile flooring business in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dal-Tile touted a nearly 16% increase in operating margins in 2005, and the company expanded plants in the Southwest. However, by the next year, the story had changed. In 2006 Dal-Tile had to cut jobs and close plants, citing slow sales of glazed tile beginning in 2004. Sales continued to decline over the next few years, especially as the construction and financial markets crashed in 2008.
