   If money grew on trees, they'd be De La Rue's trees. One of the world's largest non-governmental printer of banknotes, the company prints more than 150 national currencies. De La Rue also prints financial documents (such as high-security paper, travelers checks, stamps, and passports) and supplies banknote sorters and cash optimization software. Customers include some 150 central banks and other financial institutions. The financial printing firm also works with governments worldwide to develop secure identification technologies, such as biometric ID programs.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   De La Rue operates approximately 20 manufacturing plants in about a dozen countries worldwide, including China, Russia, South Africa, the US, and the UK. Nearly 85% of the company's revenue comes from the UK.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through four main divisions: Currency, Cash Processing Solutions (CPS), Security Products, and Identity Systems (IDS).
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Currency unit primarily provides printed banknotes, and is De La Rue's largest revenue-generator (about 63% of total sales in fiscal 2012).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Security Products division, which includes authentification offerings, accounted for 11% of sales in fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CPS division, which offers cash sorting services for banks and cash-in-transit companies, accounted for 12% of sales in fiscal 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The remaining 14% of sales in 2012 came from IDS, which provides passports, drivers licenses, and other forms of identification.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   De La Rue's revenue increased by about 14% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was a result of revenue growth in both the Currency and CPS business units.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company's profits decreased by 52% in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011 due to increase in operating expenses.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   De La Rue remains focused on its fundamental strengths. The company hopes to return its business to an operating profit through a combination of revenue growth and reductions in operating costs.

  <p>
   Thomas de la Rue, a printer's apprentice born in 1793, showed an early interest in putting things on paper. He tried publishing newspapers in his home of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, but left at the age of 25 to seek his fortune in London. After a stint making straw hats, he hit upon a color process for printing playing cards. His cards were a success, and De La Rue began making stationery, wedding cards, and railway tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
   De La Rue's typographical printing process proved to be more economically successful than line engraving, and in 1853 the company was contracted to print adhesive fiscal stamps for the government. Two years later the company won a contract to make postage stamps for the British Post Office, and in 1860 it printed its first currency for the colony of Mauritius. In 1896 it converted from a family partnership to a private partnership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concerns over De La Rue's monopoly on postage stamps led the government to cancel the company's bread-and-butter business in 1910. After a short contract printing one pound and 10 shilling notes during WWI, the company diversified, but with little success. De La Rue went public in 1921.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Stuart de la Rue, a fourth-generation family member, left the chairmanship in the mid-1920s, the company finally began to revive its prospects. Expanding its printing business into the Middle East and Asia in the late 1920s and 1930s, the company managed to fulfill demands during WWII in spite of the destruction and occupation of some facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war, the company branched out beyond printing. In the 1960s and 1970s it began making ATM equipment and cash-handling systems. But lean times in the 1980s dragged down the firm's earnings, and the company started to untangle its web of holdings. To sell its failing Crosfield pre-press business in 1989, however, it had to battle publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, who held a 21% stake in De La Rue. (He sold his holdings the next year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Jeremy Marshall was appointed CEO in 1989. Paring down the company to its core businesses of security printing and payment systems, he sold off operations, closed factories, and consolidated operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The early nineties were a boom time for the reinvigorated company. Many Eastern bloc countries that had relied on Moscow for their currency turned to De La Rue, boosting sales by 30%. After a long battle in 1994, it bought security papermaker Portals, adding the ability to design better anti-counterfeiting materials. That year De La Rue was among the partners in a consortium,
   <company id="58070">
    Camelot Group
   </company>
   , chosen to operate Britain's lottery.
  </p>
  <p>
   But slowdowns in demand for currency and faltering noncore units hurt the company's fortunes. In 1997 it began reducing its printing capacity, and it sold its Garny physical security business the next year. Also in 1998 Marshall stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Ian Much, who had to battle takeover rumors surrounding the company. In 1999 De La Rue laid off some 500 workers and sold its smart card business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company moved into Internet security with the buy of UK-based InterClear Service. Also that year it established a new division to focus on security and identification activities. In 2001 De La Rue bought Currency Systems International, a maker of super-fast sorting machines. The next year, the company purchased the banknote printing operations of the Bank of England.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 De La Rue won the contract to print Iraq's new Saddam Hussein-free banknotes. It's estimated this print job brought in about $20 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 De La Rue reorganized its cash systems division and established a global services division, which provides Internet security and protection and identification services (holographic printing, security paper and threads, and drivers license and passport issuing systems, including electronic passports). Also that year, Leo Quinn was named chief executive, succeeding Nicholas Brookes (who became chairman). The company divested its interest in Sequoia Voting Systems, which provides touch-screen voting machines in the US, in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 De La Rue sold Cash Systems, its money handling arm, to
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   for $701 million. (The sale did not include the firm's Cash Processing Solutions Division.) Looking to tackle new challenges, Quinn also announced his resignation as chief executive in 2008. He was succeeded at the start of 2009 by James Hussey, managing director for De La Rue's security paper and print division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company joined with its joint venture partners, including
   <company id="43504">
    Fujitsu Services
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="93842">
    Royal Mail
   </company>
   , to sell their interest in lottery operator Camelot Group to
   <company id="130523">
    Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan
   </company>
   for about Â£390 million ($590 million). Later in 2010 the company disclosed quality and production paper irregularities at its main plant. Hussey took full responsibility for the glitch, and subsequently resigned. He was replaced by Tim Cobbold, who joined De La Rue from
   <company id="93500">
    Chloride Group
   </company>
   . Also that year De La Rue rejected a takeover bid from
   <company id="103757">
    Oberthur Technologies
   </company>
   .
