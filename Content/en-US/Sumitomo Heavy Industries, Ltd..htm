SHI operates through more than 190 companies in Asia, Europe, and the US, serving automotive to chemical, construction, electronics, medical, and utility markets. Japan is its largest market.

  <p>
   SHI's net sales in 2014 climbed ¥29.4 billion, to ¥615.3 billion. With the exceptions of its industrial machinery as well as ships segments, the growth was fueled by all its business segments during the year. The company has a goal to generate ¥700 billion in net sales by 2016.

  <p>
   Going forward, SHI plans to grow globally by generating additional revenue from its product lines of power transmission and control equipment and plastic injection molding machines. It also plans to expand its lineup of energy-saving products by launching products and models that comply with premium efficiency motor regulations that come into effect in Japan during 2015. In addition, SHI plans to create local companies for its sales network in the fast-growing Southeast Asian region.
