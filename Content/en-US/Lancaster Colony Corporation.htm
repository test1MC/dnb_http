   Lancaster Colony provides some of the necessary ingredients  -- caviar, candles, and wine glasses -- practically guaranteed to result in a romantic meal. The company makes specialty foods, including Romanoff caviar,

   </company>
   salad dressings, Chatham Village croutons, Texas Toast, and other specialty bread, pasta, and sauce products. Lancaster Colony's food products are available through US food retailers and foodservice operators, mainly restaurants. The company also offers private-label services. In addition to food, the company supplies other amenities by making and selling candles and associated glassware and accessories under the Candle-lite brand name.

   Specialty foods, glassware, and candles company Lancaster Colony operates its business in the US.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Lancaster Colony's revenues have been trending steadily upward within the $1 billion range in recent years. To this end, the company remains focused on growing its specialty foods segment, which accounts for about 87% of sales and is more profitable than its candles and glassware segment. (Candles and glassware, which are sold in mass merchandise and retail markets, bring in the remainder of sales.)
  </p>
        <p>
   It's leveraging the strength of its retail brands to boost its product sales and introduce new add-on products. Lancaster Colony's also working to further improve its foodservice sales through brand recognition and product quality. The company also looks to expand its products portfolio through strategic acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Specificially, the company makes regular capital investments in its business to support its existing food operations. For example, it began construction of a new frozen yeast roll facility in Horse Cave, Kentucky, in 2008 and significantly expanded the plant in 2011 to meet future capacity demand. Lancaster Colony expects to continue its capital investments in 2013, having dogeared some $22 million.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's sales increased by 4% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011, attributable to increased sales from the specialty foods segment (which accounts for 87% of Lancaster Colony's total revenue) to offset sales slips in the glassware and candles business segment. The company points to higher retail and foodservice sales from expanded foodservice volumes and food product introductions for the specialty foods segment sales boost. The decrease in sales of the glassware and candles segment came from lower candle volumes, as Lancaster Colony in 2012 exited certain lower-margin businesses including some seasonal candle programs. Despite the revenue increase, the company logged a double-digit decrease in profits due to the rising cost of sales, selling, and general and administrative expenses.

   Investors led by John J. Gerlach and his son Bernie founded Lancaster Colony in 1961 as a holding company for several companies they had invested in since 1945. Their first purchase, made just after WWII ended, was Lancaster Lens (renamed Lancaster Glass), a taillight maker. During the 1950s the group bought National Glove (work gloves), Pretty Products (Rubber Queen kitchen, bath, and auto accessories), Indiana Glass, and Jackson Corp. (plastic housewares). In 1961, when the group bought Pitman-Dreitzer (Colony-brand glassware and gift items), the diverse business units were combined as Lancaster Colony. First year sales were about $30 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Although somewhat broad in scope, the businesses that were added to Lancaster were tied by similar production methods and distribution channels. They were also tied by region (most early purchases were in Ohio). The company had added Barr Rubber Products and Enterprise Aluminum (cookware) by 1967, and it went public in 1969.
  </p>
        <p>
   The next year Lancaster ventured into specialty foods when it bought
   <company id="109378">
    T. Marzetti
   </company>
   , a family-run company that began as a restaurant and expanded into selling coleslaw and salad dressings. Also in 1970 the company launched Tiara Exclusives, which used home sale party plans and homemakers to sell glassware. Two years later it acquired candle maker Candle-lite, founded in 1840. Lancaster added another candle maker, Christian &amp; Co., in 1973. Also in the early 1970s, it acquired Koneta Rubber, a maker of splash guards and bumpers.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lancaster began to aggressively expand its food business in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The company added Quality Bakery (Mountain Top pies) in 1977, New York Frozen Foods in 1978, Inn Maid Products (noodles) in 1981, and Pfeiffer (salad dressings) in 1983. Lancaster consolidated the housewares division with its candle businesses.
  </p>
        <p>
   A recession during the early 1980s slowed sales of floor mats and accessories to auto manufacturers, but it improved aftermarket sales, as consumers chose to fix up old cars. After closing National Glove in 1986, Lancaster bought two companies specializing in truck accessories: LRV Corporation (bed liners and accessories for trucks) and Amar (aluminum running boards), which was renamed Dee Zee.
  </p>
        <p>
   Hostile takeover talk from home furnishings maker Newell prompted Lancaster to reincorporate in Ohio (moving from Delaware, where the antitakeover laws were weaker) in 1992.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's specialty food business continued to grow internally and through acquisitions. Lancaster added Reames Foods (noodles) in 1989, Girard's Fine Foods (salad dressings) in 1991, Romanoff (caviar and sauces) in 1993, and Dolefam Corp. (Cardini's salad dressings) in 1995. Jay Gerlach became CEO in 1997, taking over for his father, Bernie, who died that year. Also that year the company bought Chatham Village Foods (croutons). Lancaster's sales passed $1 billion in 1998.
  </p>
        <p>
   Troubles in Lancaster's automotive aftermarket business led to a 1999 dip in the company's profits -- the first time since 1990. Also in 1999 the company purchased floor mat makers Southeast Mat and Coulver Industries. Further expanding its specialty foods unit, in 2000 Lancaster acquired Sister Schubert's Homemade Rolls, a yeast rolls maker.

   The next year the company acquired Ausmac, maker of the Mamma Bella brand of specialty frozen breads. In June 2002 the

   Everyday potpourri pots made by Lancaster. The government said candles in the pots may have caused overheating.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 Lancaster acquired Warren Frozen Foods, a frozen pasta products manufacturer. In 2004 the company shut down its automotive floor-mat manufacturing facility in Waycross, Georgia. It liquidated its LIFO glassware operations the following year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lancaster closed its industrial glassmaking operations in 2007. It also sold two of its glassmaking operations, Indiana Glass and E. O. Brody, to
   <company id="113551">
    Anchor Hocking
   </company>
   and the bulk of its automotive accessory business that year. In 2008 the company sold the last of its auto accessory unit -- Dee Zee, a maker of aluminum running boards and other goods for light truck applications.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amid the disposals of its noncore glassmaking and auto accessory operations, Lancaster added to its specialty foods business. In 2007 it acquired the assets of Marshall Biscuit Company, an Alabama maker of frozen yeast biscuits and rolls, for $23 million.
