   The house the Marlboro Man built, Altria Group, owns the largest cigarette company in the US. Altria operates through subsidiary
   <company id="55933">
    Philip Morris USA
   </company>
   , which sells Marlboro -- the world's #1-selling cigarette brand. Controlling about half of the US tobacco market, Altria manufactures cigarettes under the Parliament, Virginia Slims, and Basic brands, among many others. Altria, however, has diversified from solely a cigarette maker to a purveyor of cigars and pipe tobacco through John Middleton Co.; smokeless tobacco products through
   <company id="11533">
    UST
   </company>
   ; and wine through Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Another subsidiary, Philip Morris Capital Corp. holds a group of finance leases. Altria also owns a 27% stake in
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Altria Group operates through three business segments: Smokeable products, Smoke-less products, and Wine. The company's cigarette (manufactured by Philip Morris USA) and cigar products (sold by Middleton) are combined into the single smokeable products segment, which accounted for 90% of Altria's revenue during 2015. Smokeless tobacco products (7% of revenue), sold under subsidiary
   <company id="11533">
    UST
   </company>
   , include the Copenhagen and Skoal brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wine sales make up the remainder of Altria's revenue. Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, a subsidiary of
   <company id="11533">
    UST
   </company>
   , is a producer of wines from Washington State. Its total wine shipment volume amounts to almost 9 million cases (2015). The company owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other regions and foreign countries.

  <p>
   Altria's tobacco products are primarily sold to wholesalers, large retail operations, and the armed forces. The group promotes its products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Wholesale distributor
   <company id="59751">
    McLane Company
   </company>
   is the largest customer of Philip Morris USA, UST, and Middleton, accounting for 27% of Altria Group's consolidated net revenue in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ste. Michelle's distributes its wines domestically to restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers. It focuses on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In total, the company spent $25 million on advertising in 2015, compared to $30 million and $7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   Altria Group's annual sales have been slowly rising over the past few years on higher cigarette prices and as demand for its non-cigarette products has grown with the strengthening economy. Its profits have been growing at an even faster clip as its cost-reduction measures have been bearing fruit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Altria's revenue grew almost 4% to $25.43 billion during 2015 as all product sales grew. Most of the top-line growth was driven by higher pricing for its smokeable products, and as Phillip Morris USA grew the retail market share of the Marlboro and other cigarette brands. Smokeless product sales grew 4% with higher pricing and as UST increased the Copenhagen and Skoal brand retail share, while wine sales rose 8% on higher shipment volumes, especially for its Ste. Michelle brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue growth in 2015 drove Altria's net income up 3% to $5.24 billion. The company's operating cash levels jumped 25% to $5.81 billion during the year thanks to higher cash-based revenues and the end of federal tobacco quota buy-out payments in late 2014.

   Altria has been adding new products, such as electronic cigarettes, to attract more customers and diversify its income streams. The company also looks forward to the proposed largest-ever beer company merger (announced November 2015) between
   <company id="54451">
    SABMiller
   </company>
   (which it owns a sizable minority stake in) and
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV
   </company>
   , as the combined brewery would generate $55 million in annual revenue, boast nine of the world's top 20 beers by volume, and would be responsible for about a third of the global beer supply. In 2014, Altria's Nu Mark unit purchased electronic cigarette business Green Smoke for about $110 million in cash and up to $20 million in incentive payments. The move boosted Altria's supply chain, product lines, and customer service, and positioned its products to attract a younger audience.

   Marlboro, the principal cigarette brand of Philip Morris, has long been a profit driver for the cigarette company. But a decline in the brand's popularity among younger smokers (ages 18 to 25) has Altria and investors particularly worried because Marlboro accounts for more than two-thirds of Altria's operating income. In response, Altria is introducing new versions of Marlboro (some lower priced) designed to widen its appeal among younger smokers and fend off competition from less expensive brands, including Pall Mall from
   <company id="55935">
    Reynolds American
   </company>
   and Maverick from
   <company id="55993">
    Lorillard
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To stay profitable amid declining shipments, the company has incrementally raised the price on all of its cigarette brands -- including market leader Marlboro -- and most of its smokeless tobacco brands. Also, Altria recently finished wrapping up its cost reduction program (which began in 2011) for its tobacco and service company subsidiaries to trim cigarette-related infrastructure in light of projected cigarette volume declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Altria operates in a haze of lawsuits. Altria and its Big Tobacco rivals continue to try to resolve lawsuits over smoking-related illnesses, which account for the majority of cases pending against Philip Morris and Altria. The industry has reached settlements with US states amounting to nearly $250 billion, and a number of civil suits are pending.

   In April 2014, Altria Group purchased e-vapor business Green Smoke, Inc. and affiliates for $110 million cash, along with up to $20 million in incentive payments. The move expanded its product lines designed to appeal to a younger audience.

   In 2013, Nu Mark introduced its MarkTen e-cigarettes in a couple of test markets. In the cigar arena, Middleton expanded the Black &amp; Mild Jazz product across the nation in 2013, helping to boost that line's sales. In smokeless products, Copenhagen expanded its Southern Blend line.

  <p>
   Philip Morris opened his London tobacco store in 1847 and by 1854 was making his own cigarettes. Morris died in 1873, and his heirs sold the firm to William Thomson just before the turn of the century. Thomson introduced his company's cigarettes to the US in 1902. American investors bought the rights to leading Philip Morris brands in 1919, and in 1925 the new company, Philip Morris &amp; Co., introduced Marlboro, which targeted women smokers and produced modest sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the firm's larger competitors raised their prices in 1930, Philip Morris Companies countered by introducing inexpensive cigarettes that caught on with Depression-weary consumers. By 1936 it was the fourth-biggest cigarette maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm acquired Benson &amp; Hedges in 1954. It signed ad agency
   <company id="104369">
    Leo Burnett
   </company>
   , which promptly initiated the Marlboro Man campaign. Under Joseph Cullman (who became president in 1957), Philip Morris experienced tremendous growth overseas. After dipping to sixth place among US tobacco companies in 1960, it rebounded at home, thanks to Marlboro's growing popularity among men (Marlboro became the #1 cigarette brand in the world in 1972).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 Philip Morris bought the nation's seventh-largest brewer,
   <company id="55826">
    Miller Brewing
   </company>
   , and with aggressive marketing it vaulted to #2 among US beer makers by 1980. To protect itself against a shrinking US tobacco market, in 1985 Philip Morris paid $5.6 billion for General Foods (Kool-Aid, Post, Stove Top). In 1988 it bought Kraft (Miracle Whip, Velveeta). The next year Philip Morris joined Kraft with General Foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Australian Geoffrey Bible became CEO. By late 1998 the company and its rivals had settled tobacco litigation with most states, agreeing to pay about $250 billion over 25 years to receive protection from further state suits.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Philip Morris bought three cigarette brands (L&amp;M, Chesterfield, and Lark) from the Brooke Group. The US government filed a massive lawsuit against Big Tobacco, and Philip Morris admitted -- no kidding -- that smoking increases the risk of getting cancer and other illnesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Philip Morris vowed to appeal after a state court awarded $74 billion in punitive damages to Florida smokers. The court later ruled that Philip Morris, Lorillard, and the Liggett Group would pay at least $709 million in the case regardless of the outcome, but would not have to pay damages until after the appeals are resolved. A Los Angeles jury awarded Richard Boeken $3 billion in punitive damages. The company appealed even after Boeken later agreed to reduced damages of $100 million. (Boeken died in 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2000 Philip Morris completed its purchase of Nabisco Holdings for $18.9 billion. In June 2001 Philip Morris spun off Kraft Foods in what was the second-largest IPO in US history; it retained an 84% stake in the company and 97% of the voting rights.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2002 CFO Louis Camilleri succeeded Bible as CEO; in September Camilleri became chairman upon Bible's retirement. In July 2002, Philip Morris sold Miller Brewing to
   <company id="54451">
    South African Breweries
   </company>
   for $5.6 billion ($3.6 billion in SAB stock and the assumption of $2 billion in Miller debt) in July 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the ongoing saga of tobacco-related litigation, Philip Morris said it would appeal an October 2002 verdict by a California jury that ordered the company to pay $28 billion in punitive damages, the most ever in an individual tobacco liability lawsuit (later reduced to $28 million). In January 2003 Philip Morris changed its name to Altria Group in an effort to distance itself from its tobacco litigation. In April a Florida appeals court threw out the state's multibillion-dollar judgment (made in 2000) against Philip Morris USA and four other US tobacco companies, stating that thousands of Florida smokers could not lump their complaints together in a single case.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2003 Philip Morris USA lost an Illinois lawsuit, which claimed the company's use of the word "light" was misleading and violated Illinois consumer fraud laws. The judge ordered Philip Morris USA to pay damages of $10 billion and post a $12 billion bond. The Illinois Supreme Court has lowered the bond to $7 billion and agreed to hear Philip Morris USA's appeal of the original verdict.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Altria purchased a $4.8 billion stake in Indonesia's third-largest tobacco firm, PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, which makes kreteks, or clove cigarettes. Also in 2005 the company formed a long-term alliance with
   <company id="59411">
    China National Tobacco Corp
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006 Altria unseated Roger Deromedi from Kraft's top spot and appointed Irene Rosenfeld to head the company. The executive realignment was part of Altria's plan to spin off Kraft. Deromedi, a 28-year Kraft veteran, had been under fire for the unit's stale sales since taking over as sole CEO in 2003. Rosenfeld spent more than 20 years at Kraft and exited the firm in mid-2003 as president of Kraft Foods North America. The former chairman and CEO of Frito-Lay, Rosenfeld is known for her integration expertise, as well as restructuring and turning around companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2007 Altria completed the spinoff of Kraft Foods to Altria shareholders. Also in 2007 Altria bought US cigar maker John Middleton from privately held Bradford Holdings. Based in Pennsylvania, John Middleton specializes in machine-made cigars -- most notably the Black &amp; Mild brand. The deal was valued at $2.2 billion. A year later, in March 2008, Altria spun off its
   <company id="55957">
    Philip Morris International
   </company>
   arm, also to shareholders, and moved  its headquarters from New York City's Park Avenue to Richmond, Virginia to be closer to its bread and butter operations. (As part of the move, Altria in late 2007 agreed to sell the headquarters that has housed the firm since 1982 to a unit of privately held Global Holdings for some $525 million. Altria relocated about 100 of its about 500 employees in the move from New York City to Richmond.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2009 the company purchased smokeless tobacco maker UST, as well as its wine business. The $11 billion deal gave Altria a significant foothold in the US smokeless tobacco market, garnering popular brands Copenhagen and Skoal into Altria's fold. Following the acquisition, Altria consolidated the sales forces of  UST's U.S. Smokeless Tobacco brands and Philip Morris USA and relocated U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company to Richmond, Virginia. Altria has since launched a new versions of certain brands designed to compete with value-priced brands, such as
   <company id="55935">
    Reynolds American
   </company>
   's Grizzly and
   <company id="51536">
    Swedish Match AB
   </company>
   's Timber Wolf.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2009 the passage of the Family Smoking and Tobacco Control Act by the US Congress gave the
   <company id="144161">
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   unprecedented authority to regulate tobacco products, including the authority to regulate marketing, ban candy flavorings, and reduce nicotine in tobacco products.
