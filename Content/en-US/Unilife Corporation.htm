   Needle pricks are never fun, but Unilife hopes its medical devices make the practice a little safer and simpler. The company develops and manufactures retractable syringes, including the Unifill ready-to-fill syringe, which allows pharmaceutical companies to prefill the device with an injectable drug or vaccine, and the Unitract 1 mL syringe, which is designed for hospital use and for patients who self administer medications like diabetes sufferers. Unilife is especially focused on the development of wearable injectors, which has the potential to be the next big thing in drug delivery.

  <p>
   With integrated safety features, Unilife's products are designed to help customers comply with needlestick prevention laws that protect health care workers from accidentally acquiring blood-borne diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C.

   Pennsylvania-based Unilife rings up about 60% of its sales outside the US. Many of its largest customers are based in Europe.

  <p>
   Unilife's sales have been erratic in recent years. In fiscal 2014 (ended June), the company reported $14.7 million in sales, an increase of 436% versus the prior year. (The impressive growth followed a previous annual comparison when sales were cut in half.) Unilife credited the increase in revenue to increasing demand from customers for its products and services. The firm receives customization, industrialization, licensing, and development fees and other payments from customers for its injectable drug delivery systems. Unilife received $2.3 million in revenue from Sanofi, with which it had an exclusive licensing agreement that expired during fiscal 2014. However, that agreement was replaced by a long-term supply agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historically, product sales have not been a meaningful contributor to Unilife's revenue. However, the company expects product sales to increase in fiscal 2015 as it increases commercial sales to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unilife hasn't turned a profit in the last three years reporting a loss of $57.9 million, $63.2 million, and $52.3 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Research and development expenses increased in fiscal year 2014 by $12.4 million, or 57.0%, compared to fiscal year 2013, primarily due to increased payroll and related costs.

  <p>
   Injectable drug delivery is a rapidly developing market and the use of prefilled syringes is increasing in countries with more advanced health care resources, such as North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia. As a prefilled syringe maker, Unilife is hoping to tap these markets as demand surges for products that are more convenient and safer than traditional plastic syringes. It may compete with emerging needle-free devices and even newer nanotechnology or DNA drug delivery systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   As far as its pipeline, the company is developing product extensions of the Unifill and Unitract syringes. These product lines, dubbed Unifill Select and Unitract Clinical Range, are intended for use with drugs and vaccines indicated for intramuscular injection rather than subcutaneous injection. They also feature detachable needles, so that health care workers can select needle width and gauge based on the age and size of the patient.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce operating costs, Unilife cut some 40% of its workforce in 2016. It cut 17% of its workforce in 2015.
