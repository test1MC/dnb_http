   Life is Wonderful over at Stewart and Lynda Resnick's eclectic empire, The Wonderful Company (formerly Roll Global). Its holdings include POM Wonderful, the hip and trendy pomegranate juice with its distinctive bulbous bottle, as well as upscale water bottler

   The Wonderful Company is an international supplier of pomegranate juice, FIJI-brand water, almonds and pistachios, and lemons and oranges. It also owns the world's largest flower-delivery service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Wonderful Pistachios &amp; Almonds unit harvests more than 70,000 acres of pistachio and almond trees annually, selling products under the Wonderful, Almond Accents, and Everybody's Nuts brands. Wonderful Pistachios &amp; Almonds also offers private-label nut products. Wonderful Citrus, the company behind Cuties-brand mandarin oranges, boasts more than 47,000 acres of navel and Valencia orange, lemon, Minneola, and Clementine mandarin orange trees. Its Delano, California, citrus processing plant is one of North America's largest orange and lemon packing operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also on Wonderful's roster is FIJI Water, which is sourced from an artesian aquifer on the island of Fiji and distributed internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Justin Vineyard &amp; Winery, based in Paso Robles, California, supplements its FIJI Water business. The water operation shares its global sales force with the wine business as it taps Justin's wine-making expertise. The move, which comes as Wonderful has been faced with increased taxes from the military-led government in Fiji, signals that it is looking to diversify its FIJI Water subsidiary.

  <p>
   The Wonderful Company continues to upgrade its stable of businesses and brands and move into to new niches through the uses of acquisitions. In 2016 Wonderful Citrus acquired I. Kunik Company, a major distributor of Persian limes grown in Mexico, and B&amp;S Grupo Exportador, a major supplier of Persian limes to the worldwide market. As part of the transaction, Wonderful Citrus also acquired nearly 2,000 acres of Persian lime orchards in Mexico, making it the largest lime grower in the country when combined with its existing lime acreage.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company expanded its operations on the West Coast through the purchase of Mercier California, the US operations of the Mercier Group, one of the worldwide leaders in the grapevine nursery industry. The operations are located in California's North Coast, and the deal specifically fortified the operations of Vintage Nurseries, its producer of grafted grapevine rootstock for the wine grape, table grape, and raisin markets.

   Stewart Resnick, a
   <company id="129257">
    UCLA
   </company>
   Law School graduate, is recognized as the financial and organizational brains of Roll. Lynda Rae, an art lover and marketing guru, started her own advertising agency when she was 19 years old. Each had established careers when they married in the early 1970s. Together they have built their company through a series of acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the Resnicks' first purchases was Teleflora, which they bought in 1979. Originally called Telegraph Delivery Service, Teleflora had been founded in 1934 by Edwin Douglas. The Resnicks also bought alarm company American Protection Industries (API), which they set up as their holding company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1985 the Resnicks acquired
   <company id="108460">
    The Franklin Mint
   </company>
   from Warner Communications (now
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   ) for around $167 million. Founded in 1964 by Joseph Segal (who in 1986 started the
   <company id="57399">
    QVC
   </company>
   television shopping network) as General Numismatics, the company originally focused on coins and other metal objects. It went public in 1965 and changed its name to The Franklin Mint in 1968. It was purchased by Warner in 1981 but it failed to prosper. The Resnicks, who had been eyeing the company for some time, saw a greater opportunity in the collectibles market rather than in coins and greatly expanded that part of the business. In 1991 The Franklin Mint turned its first profit since 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Resnicks bought
   <company id="11006">
    Mobil
   </company>
   's Apex Orchards, an almond and pistachio grower in the San Joaquin Valley, in 1986. The next year, they added the California agribusinesses of Texaco (formerly ChevronTexaco, now
   <company id="103877">
    Chevron Corporation
   </company>
   ) to their holdings. (Texaco had become owner of the Central California operations when it acquired Getty Oil in 1984.) The Resnicks formed their agribusiness unit, Paramount Farms, in 1989. That year they sold API; however, they retained the name until 1993, when they renamed their holding company Roll International, after another agricultural company they had acquired.
  </p>
  <p>
   The couple had planned to take The Franklin Mint public in 1992, but its poor earnings prior to 1991 and a cool IPO market changed their minds. Instead they focused on expanding the mint's line of collectibles through licensing agreements and added commemorative plates to their line. In the early 1990s, the company began opening The Franklin Mint retail stores. The Franklin Mint had 50 gallery shops in US shopping centers and more than $600 million in US sales by 1996. The following year, Teleflora bought Redbook Florist Services, giving it more subscribers (though still lower sales) than rival floral company
   <company id="41921">
    FTD
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Ever in the news, Lynda bought the high-collared "Elvis dress" worn by the late Diana, Princess of Wales, for more than $150,000 in 1997 for display in The Franklin Mint Museum. A memorial fund for Diana sued The Franklin Mint in 1998, charging it with unauthorized use of the princess' image on various items. (The suit was subsequently dismissed.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the Resnicks looked into selling the company, reportedly because its legal problems had tarnished Lynda's standing among American socialites. In 1999, however, Lynda was named a trustee for the
   <company id="130157">
    Aspen Institute
   </company>
   , a high-brow intellectual group for societal leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paramount Citrus became one of the US's largest fresh citrus marketers after it purchased 4,000 acres from
   <company id="10303">
    Dole Food
   </company>
   for $55 million in 2000. Suterra, Roll's pest-control business, bought Concep, a pheromone company, the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Resnicks filed a $25 million malicious prosecution claim in 2002 against the estate of Princess Diana and a memorial fund in her name. (Two years later, the Resnicks successfully sued the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund in a dispute over Diana memorabilia.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The couple began planting 6,000 acres of pomegranate trees in 1996 and as the trees begin to bear fruit, the Resnicks began marketing pomegranate juice to consumers. POM Wonderful made its debut at a 2003
   <company id="104463">
    Victoria's Secret
   </company>
   lingerie show where drinks called "Sexy Flirts" (sugar-rimmed glasses of POM and vodka) were served. It was also the official cocktail (this time as POMtinis, a play on martini) of the 2005 Oscars awards ceremony in Hollywood.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Roll sold The Franklin Mint, which at one time was the world's largest collectibles firm, with operations in 15 countries. Less grand now, Franklin distributes goods (die-cast cars and airplanes, precision modeling, and its
   <company id="10706">
    Harley-Davidson
   </company>
   -branded items) via wholesale and the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mr. Resnick and Los Angeles businessman and entrepreneur Selim Zilkha formed a 50-50 joint venture (Jatropha Farm) in 2008 with Global Clean Energy Holdings to commercialize a renewable, alternate energy source. A goal of the venture is to acquire and develop raw land in the state of Yucatán in Mexico to grow jatropha (
   <em>
    Jatropha curcas
   </em>
   ) trees. The fruit and seeds of the trees, which are not edible and are not grown as a food crop, can be made into oil for use as biomass, biodiesel, or feedstock. Jatropha hopes to eventually market the prod

  <p>
   In late 2010, the company changed its name from Roll International to Roll Global LLC. It later changed its name to The Wonderful Company in mid-2015.
