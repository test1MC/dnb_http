  <p>
   Decathlon has been growing at a consistent rate, and in 2015 reported revenue of â‚¬9.1 billion, a 12% increase on 2014. The steady advancement of revenue is largely down to persistent store openings: In 2015, it opened 140 retail outlets, including the first ever in Slovakia and Thailand.

  <p>
   To maintain growth and reach new customers, the company has been expanding outside of France. It opens stores in areas with natural recreational opportunities and an established sports-oriented customer base. New markets in 2015 include Slovakia and Thailand, but its main international focus by far is China. In 2015, Decathlon opened 51 new stores in the country, an increase of nearly 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decathlon keeps its product pipeline ticking over, churning out 2800 new products in 2015. New products include a twin-reservoir sports bottle that allows users to switch between two drinks at the click of a wheel.
