  <p>
   Seed capital definitely gave birth to Carraro S.p.A. -- the company opened its doors in 1932 as the maker of a seeder. By 1951 it was producing autoseeders. Still targeting the agricultural market, Carraro manufactured its first tractor in 1958.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s the company focused on the Carraro tractor; its "3 horses" marque won recognition throughout Europe. The company created its axles and transmissions division in 1973, and by 1979 axles accounted for more than 36% of company sales. By the 1980s the enterprise had entered the global marketplace, although its acquisitions remained in its homeland: OMG (automotive components, 1986) and SIAP (forgings and gears, 1988).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carraro opened a division in Illinois in 1992, entering the North American market. The company went public in 1995 and embarked on a strategy of relocating its plants to gain market share in Europe and overseas. In 1997 the company formed a joint venture with India-based Escorts Ltd. (tractor transmissions and axles) and opened an office in Japan. The next year it bought Poland-based Fabryka Osi Napedowych SA (heavy bus and truck axles). It also bought the Argentina factory of Agco, a maker of tractors and agricultural machinery. Carraro continued its global expansion in 1999 when it bought a US-based axle and transmission plant from the Torrington Company, established Carraro Korea, and opened a tractor transmission plant in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Carraro acquired gear, axle, and driveline maker O&amp;K Antriebstechnik (Germany) from CNH Global.

   After a loss of nearly $25 million in 2001 (the worst year in the company's history), Carraro returned to profitability in 2002. The company accomplished the turnaround by streamlining its operations and leveraging its technical and sales alliances. The company managed to keep up the trend in 2003, in part through a greater share of the automotive market.
