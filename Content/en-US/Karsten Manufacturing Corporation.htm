   If there's a PING in your swing, it's got to be from Karsten Manufacturing. The company (dba PING) designs and produces customized PING golf clubs. (The clubs are named for the sound they make when striking the ball.) Karsten also supplies golf bags, gloves, headwear, and related gear. It provides club-fitting services, systems, and training at golf courses and pro shops across the US, as well as an online fitting program. Those who swing with PING include international professionals, including Mark Wilson, Maria Hjorth, Sherri Steinhauer, and Angel Cabrera. The company was founded in 1959 after Karsten Solheim designed a revolutionary putter in his garage. His youngest son, John, leads the family-owned firm.

  <p>
   Phoenix-based Karsten Manufacturing supplies golf clubs and related products to some 70 countries worldwide. Its business is supported by an office in Canada.

   The golf clubs maker sells its products through golf shops and at golf courses worldwide. Other PING retailers include Valley Golf Center, PGA Tour Superstore, Vans Golf Shop, and Cool Clubs. To burnish its brand, the company enlists golf luminaries as sponsors. Todd Anderson, a renowned instructor and PGA Teacher of the Year who coaches PING Pro Billy Horschel and several other top-rated PGA Tour players, joined the company in 2014 as a brand ambassador.

  <p>
   While Karsten is most known for designing and making its PING brand of golf clubs, the company makes accessories, such as bags and apparel, and owns and operates Moon Valley Country Club located in its home city of Phoenix.

  <p>
   More than half a century since it was established, Karsten Manufacturing continues to innovate golf clubs. In 2014 PING launched a comprehensive new product line that employs advanced technology to give golfers more distance while still offering forgiveness and consistency for players of all abilities. Included in the line are the i25 driver, irons, fairway woods and hybrids; the long, high-flying Karsten hybrid-iron set, and the Karsten TR putters.
  </p>
  <p>
   PING uses such metals as titanium, tungsten, and steel in its clubs to improve the distance and accuracy of players' drives, and the clubs' grooved faces add backspin to balls. The company's drivers, including its G15 model released in 2010, were among the leaders in the PGA Tour's distance and accuracy stats that year. Also, the G15 was the top-selling driver that spring.
  </p>
  <p>
   While many manufacturers have outsourced their operations, Karsten still makes most of its clubs in the US. It does outsource some duties, such as golf bag manufacturing, however. The company plans to expand its operations in Japan to better serve its customers in the Asia/Pacific region, where the game of golf has become increasingly popular.
  </p>

   Karsten's signature brand is also used in marketing off the fairway. In late 2010 the company inked a trademark agreement with

   , allowing the computer maker usage of the PING name. That year Apple upgraded its iTunes application with the PING feature, a social networking tool that enables users to find out information about artists and discover music they might enjoy from friends.
