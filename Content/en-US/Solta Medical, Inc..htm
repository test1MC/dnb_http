   Attention, baby boomers, here's another chance to splash around in the fountain of youth. Solta Medical makes a noninvasive skin-tightening system that uses radiofrequency energy to get rid of pesky wrinkles on the face and hands, around the eyes, and on other creased and crumpled body parts. The company markets its Thermage ThermaCool radiofrequency generators, and single-use ThermaTips, to plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and other doctors around the world. Other products include Fraxel skin resurfacing systems to treat discoloration and Isolaz pulsed light systems for acne, and the Liposonix ultrasound fat dispersal system. In 2014 Solta was acquired by
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While the company's products are sold in more than 80 countries, about 45% of Solta's revenues come from sales to customers in North America.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Solta uses a direct sales force in the US and a network of distributors in international markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sales of its disposable ThermaTips and other consumables make up the majority of the company's product revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall revenues increased by 5% in 2011 thanks to higher Therma Tips revenues and the contributions from the sales of the new Clear + Brilliant laser anti-aging products which launched in April 2011, and the Liposonix products, which came onto the market in December 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Solta's net loss dropped by 34% in 2011 due to revenue growth outpacing the increase in operating expenses, interest expenses, and other expenses.

  <p>
   Solta Medical has developed different sizes of the tips to target specific body parts and continues to introduce new versions. It has also introduced redesigned versions of its generator (including ThermaCool NXT and ThermaCool CPT), as well as a system accessory that provides therapeutic massage and aims to reduce the appearance of cellulite.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also looking to expand sales beyond its traditional physician base of dermatologists and plastic surgeons by targeting general practitioners, OB/GYNs, and physician-led medi-spas. It also hopes to take advantage of the aging US population, which is seeking a growing volume of aesthetic procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the company is on the lookout for complementary products for the aesthetics market that it could add to its business.

  <p>
   In 2013 Solta added a complementary line of body contouring products when it acquired
   <company id="136827">
    Sound Surgical Technologies
   </company>
   for some $30 million. The purchase also added international marketing resources and cross-selling opportunities in the aesthetics and dermatology markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Solta added another new product line -- an ultrasound fat burning system called Liposonix -- through the acquisition of Medicis Technologies from
   <company id="15556">
    Medicis Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   in a deal worth up to $35 million. The Liposonix system is sold in Canada, Japan, and Europe, and the company plans to seek
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to market it in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 it acquired aesthetic products maker Aesthera for $5 million plus potential milestone payouts. The purchase added light-based acne treatment systems (Isolaz and Isolaz Pro), which Solta is working to increase sales of through broadened global distribution efforts.

  <p>
   The company changed its name from Thermage to Solta Medical in 2009 to signify the expansion of its product line beyond the Thermage brand.
