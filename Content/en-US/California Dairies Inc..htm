   Herding dairies together makes California Dairies the largest dairy processing cooperative in the US. Its 410 member/farmers provide the co-op with more than 18 billion pounds of milk a year. Its plants process milk into mainly butter, but also cheese and powdered milk for commercial and consumer use. The co-op's subsidiaries are Challenge Dairy Products (retail, foodservice, and ingredient products) and Los Banos Foods (cheddar cheese for food manufacturers). California Dairies also holds majority control of DairyAmerica, which markets nearly 50% of all the milk powder produced in the US, as well as other dairy products. The co-op exports to 50-plus countries worldwide.

   The co-op's dairy plant in Tipton, California is one of the largest in the nation. It produces powdered milk, butter, and a variety of condensed dairy products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The co-op's member dairies are located from San Diego County in the south to Marin County in northern California. California Dairies' market position is supported by six production plants (Artesia, Fresno, Los Banos, Tipton, Turlock, and Visalia), strategically located within 100 miles of major shipping ports to optimize milk reception and transportation. California Dairies produces 47% of The Golden State's milk or 9% of the milk produced in the US.

  <p>
   Already the largest diary processing cooperative in California, in late 2012 California Dairies acquired Security Milk Producers Association (SMPA), a California milk marketing cooperative. The purchase added 33 dairies to California Dairies' operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep up with demand, California Dairies expands its facilities. In 2014, for instance, it's boosting its processing capacity by adding a third evaporator to its Visalia plant.

  <p>
   Looking to become a top source of dairy nutrition globally, the co-op diversified its butterfat offerings by adding anhydrous milkfat (AMF) to its export product portfolio.

  <p>
   The co-op was created through the 1999 merger of three California dairy cooperatives -- California Milk Producers, Danish Creamery Association, and San Joaquin Valley Dairymen. Combined, it is able to pursue a global customer base for its dry milk and butter products, in addition to lobbying for dairy reforms
