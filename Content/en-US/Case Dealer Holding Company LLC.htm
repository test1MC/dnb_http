   Getting people to doze on the job is the job of Case Dealer Holding Company (formerly Western Power &amp; Equipment Corp.). Operating as Case Power and Equipment, the company sells, rents, and services bulldozers and other construction, industrial, and agricultural equipment. Case Power and Equipment offers equipment made by

    CNH Global
   </company>
   and more than 40 other manufacturers. In late 2008 Western Power &amp; Equipment was acquired by Case Construction Equipment, a unit of CNH, which then changed the unit's name to Case Power and Equipment. The company operates eight dealer locations in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

   The company was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of American United Global in 1992 to buy seven retail outlets in Oregon and Washington from Case (now a part of Netherlands-based
   <company id="52640">
    CNH Global
   </company>
   ). The next year it opened two more retail units in those same states and C. Dean McLain, former EVP with American United Global, was appointed CEO. In 1994 WPEC opened additional retail outlets in California, Nevada, and Washington. The company went public in 1995 and earmarked the $7.8 million in proceeds from its IPO to expand operations. Opening its fourteenth location that year in Salinas, California, the company also began to focus more on parts, service support, and increasing its equipment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   WPEC moved into highway maintenance equipment in 1996 by buying GCS, a California-based distributor of heavy equipment (street sweepers, sewer cleaners, and highway-upkeep equipment) to city and state agencies. The company expanded its distribution network in 1997 by acquiring Sahlberg Equipment (four stores in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska), and again in 1998 with the purchase of Yukon Equipment (three stores in Alaska).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a net loss fiscal 1999 in part from aggressive pricing and financing options offered by its chief competitors. WPEC responded by consolidating four of its smaller retail operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 WPEC announced its intention to merge with a high-tech startup company and sell its equipment business to WPEC management. In 2001, after its initial plans to acquire e-Mobile Inc. were cancelled, the company said that it would continue its search for a merger or acquisition candidate. WPEC closed three stores each in 2001 and 2002. In 2003 it stayed steady at 15 stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   WPEC acquired Arizona Pacific Materials, LLC in 2004. The next year the company sold its Hayward, California branch.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 WPEC sold the assets of its Western Power &amp; Equipment Corp. subsidiary to Case Construction Equipment, part of CNH America, LLC, which was in turn owned by CNH Global, the manufacturer of Case brand equipment. The company's name was subsequently changed to Case Dealer Holding Company, though it operates as Case Power and Equipment.
