   The Robert Mondavi Winery's customers have grape expectations. The famous winemaker produces the ever-popular
   <company id="141281">
    Woodbridge
   </company>
   and Robert Mondavi Private Selection brands. The company also makes and markets luxury wines such as Opus One (through a partnership with France's iconic Rothschild family). The winemaking operation was acquired by one of the world's largest wine companies
   <company id="11800">
    Constellation Brands
   </company>
   in 2004 for $1 billion. The winery was founded in 1966 by namesake Robert Mondavi, who died at the age of 94 in 2008. Robert Mondavi Winery's wines are part of Constellation Brands' vast portfolio that includes Simi, Mount Veeder Winery, Kim Crawford, and Franciscan Estate, among others.

  <p>
   Vintner Cesare Mondavi, owner of California's Charles Krug Winery, died in 1959, leaving his company in the hands of sons Robert and Peter. After years of bickering, Robert was voted out of the firm in 1965 (the brothers did not speak again for 20 years). Robert borrowed $100,000 from friends and founded his own winery in 1966. He later sued the family and won part of a vineyard.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Robert Mondavi Corporation prospered as California's wine market boomed in the 1970s. In 1979 it bought a Woodbridge, California, wine-making facility. That year Robert Mondavi and the Rothschilds began making Opus One; the first 12 bottles sold for $24,000 at auction. In 1988 phylloxera, a grapevine-killing insect, appeared in its Napa Valley vineyards. Needing funds to replant hundreds of acres, the company went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert's sons Tim and Michael had served as co-CEOs since 1990 (echoing the previous generation, they didn't agree on much). Robert appointed Michael sole CEO in 1994. Robert Mondavi then teamed up with other wineries in Italy (1995, Luce wine) and Chile (1996, Caliterra). A small grape crop in 1996 led to a shortage of top seller Woodbridge chardonnay, hurting sales for the next two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Robert Mondavi reduced its workforce by 4% and renovated its flagship Napa Valley winery. Robert Mondavi introduced the Io label that year to sell unique luxury blends of Rhone-style wine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Mondavi purchased Sonoma, California-based Arrowood Vineyards in 2000 for about $45 million. In 2001 Michael was appointed chairman, Tim VC, and COO Gregory Evans was named CEO. Also that year Robert Mondavi sold its Vichon Mediterranean label to Sieur d'Arques, a French wine producer. The company also announced a joint venture with Australia's
   <company id="103306">
    Southcorp
   </company>
   to sell new wines in Australia and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 a faltering economy and grape surplus forced Robert Mondavi to scale back operations and cut 100 jobs. The scale-back continued in 2004 with the sale of interest in Vina Errazuriz, a Chilean wine company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2004 the company for the first time looked to someone outside the Mondavi family to lead the board of directors. Ted Hall, head of Long Meadow Ranch Winery, became the board's Chairman while Michael and Tim Mondavi were each named Vice Chairmen. Noting his shift from the board's leadership post, Michael Mondavi said he would spend more time working with distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Michael Mondavi later resigned as Vice Chairman in September 2004 as the company announced they would divest its luxury wine labels and focus on its more affordable "lifestyle" brands. Michael then left the board altogether after speaking out publicly against the divestment plan. Soon after, Michael's brother Tim also left the company but said he would continue involvement with the Robert Mondavi Winery as a consultant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2004, Robert Mondavi was sold to Constellation Brands.
