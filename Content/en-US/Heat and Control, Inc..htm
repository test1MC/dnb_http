   Couch potatoes are grateful to Heat and Control, a key link in the snack food chain. The company makes equipment systems to process and package baked and fried snacks, meat, poultry, and seafood. Its offerings include single-piece process-machinery as well as multiple components for a complete operating line -- high-capacity spiral ovens and fryers to conveyor systems. Heat and Control's French fry system can turn 50,000 pounds of potatoes into fries in an hour. The company also distributes Ishida's automatic weigh filler, for saving labor and ingredients, and green equipment systems, for reducing air pollution, fuel, and water use. The Caridis family controls the company.
