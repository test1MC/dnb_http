   Over the years Hoover's has expanded the breadth of information available on its website and the tools available to its customers. The company has added such features as corporate family tree information, enhanced list-building capabilities, and customized data feeds that allow customers to present the information in a variety of internal formats.

  <p>
   In a continued effort to enhance its offerings and leverage its database of information, in 2014 the company launched Mobile IQ. The mobile prospecting solution delivers real-time intelligence to customers' smartphones and mobile devices. In 2013 it launched Hoover's Analytics, which helps businesses identify their target markets. The previous year Hoover's launched Hoover's Optimizer, a service that allows customers to cleanse, match, and append basic data points to improve the quality of customer and prospect files.

  <p>
   Hoover's was the brainchild of entrepreneur Gary Hoover. A veteran of
   <company id="104003">
    Citibank
   </company>
   and several retailers, Hoover in 1982 founded Bookstop (which would go on to become the #4 book chain in the US). During his tenure there Hoover found that his stores' books covered everything from travel to sports, but none covered companies, industries, and the people who lead them. Those subjects had always fascinated him.
  </p>
  <p>
   After selling Bookstop to
   <company id="16513">
    Barnes &amp; Noble
   </company>
   in 1989, Hoover started The Reference Press in 1990 with co-founders Alta Campbell (the company's first editor-in-chief), and Hoover's
   <company id="40487">
    University of Chicago
   </company>
   classmates Patrick Spain and Alan Chai. The company published its first book --
   <i>
    Hoover's Handbook 1991: Profiles of Over 500 Major Corporations
   </i>
   -- later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 the company partnered with
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   to create its first electronic product: Hoover's Handbook Electronic Book for the Sony Data Discman. While the product flopped, it introduced The Reference Press to electronic publishing. Frustrated with the inability of its books to reach a wide mass-market audience, the firm cut its first online distribution deals the following year with
   <company id="43553">
    LexisNexis
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Spain became CEO in 1993 and began moving the company toward online publishing. Over the next several years, The Reference Press signed additional Internet distribution deals with
   <company id="43062">
    CompuServe
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T.
   </company>
  </p>
  <p>
   While these efforts increased the company's audience, The Reference Press wanted to be much bigger, much faster. In 1994 Warner Books, a unit of
   <company id="102518">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   , made an investment in the company. With that capital the firm launched the Hoover's website, featuring both free advertiser-supported and for-pay premium access to Hoover's company information.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of 1996, the company was distributing information through more than 20 online and Web-based services. That year it changed its name to Hoover's, Inc. In 1997 Infoseek (subsequently purchased by
   <company id="11603">
    Disney
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="12141">
    Media General
   </company>
   also invested in Hoover's.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Hoover's added e-commerce to its free and subscription business model, inking its first e-commerce deal with
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   . The following year the company introduced the Hoover's Online UK website and added more than a dozen additional e-commerce vendors.
  </p>
  <p>
   To acquire the capital needed to accelerate its growth, Hoover's went public in mid-1999. The company created Hoover's Online Europe in 2000 to pursue the European market. Hoover's also took a minority stake in SEC document search engine company
   <company id="59717">
    10K Wizard
   </company>
   (which it sold in 2004), and purchased Powerize, a content syndication firm which was renamed Hoover's Media Technologies (HMT).
  </p>
  <p>
   Spain stepped down as president and CEO in 2001, but remained chairman. Jeff Tarr, formerly CEO at technology support Web service company all.com, took over as president and CEO. Hoover's then shut down its European operations and the HMT subsidiary and refocused on selling online subscriptions to Hoover's. By 2002 Tarr had added chairman to his title. The following year
   <company id="10483">
    Dun &amp; Bradstreet
   </company>
   acquired the company for $119 million, and Hoover's redesigned its website.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Dwayne Spradlin, former leader of online event planning service
   <company id="138425">
    StarCite
   </company>
   , replaced Tarr as president of Hoover's. Spradlin left the company in 2006.  The next year former
   <company id="11548">
    Unisys
   </company>
   executive David Mather became Hoover's president.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company expanded when it acquired First Research, a provider of industry information, and AllBusiness.com, a website for small business owners, to add to its Internet offerings. Also that year Hoover's launched Bizmology, a blog featuring company and industry news from Hoover's editors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hoover's acquired software company
   <company id="132275">
    Visible Path
   </company>
   in 2008. Mather was replaced by Hyune Hand in 2009.  Also in 2009 Hoover's collaborated with  professional social networking company
   <company id="132274">
    LinkedIn
   </company>
   , significantly growing its people information by adding LinkedIn contact data to its subscriber site.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company launched a Hoover's site redesign with new and enhanced functionality, more interactive features, and additional workflow and integration tools. The new platform also offers expanded insight by more than doubling Hoover's coverage of contacts and companies. Also that year it introduced its Hoover's Near Here mobile app.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year Hoover's continued its relationship with LinkedIn, integrating more executive information into its product through an expanded partnership. Also in 2011 Hoover's launched a redesign of Bizmology, introduced another mobile app (Hoover's Connect+), and launched the Spotlight Reports offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company launched Hoover's Optimizer, a service that allows customers to cleanse, match, and append basic data points in order to improve the quality of customer and prospect files.
