  <p>
   Besides chickens, Simmons has been extending its reach into pet food in recent years as the result of a timely investment in beleaguered Menu Foods. Simmons' pet food unit SPF purchased Menu Foods in 2010 for some $240 million in cash and assumed debt. Acquiring Menu Foods, a private-label and contract manufacturer of wet pet food in North America, complements SPF's wet and dry pet food business and makes it one of the leading makers of pet food under private label in the US. (Contributing to the downturn of the company, Menu Foods made headlines in 2007 in North America. The Canadian firm was forced to recall 60 million cans of pet food nationwide. The food, imported from China and suspected of containing melamine, killed about a dozen pets due to kidney failure.)
