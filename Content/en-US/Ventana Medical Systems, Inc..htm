   Ventana Medical Systems wants to be a window into the cause of cancer. The company, also known as Roche Tissue Diagnostics, is a leading provider of slide staining systems (sold under the names BenchMark, NexES, and Symphony) used to automate the processing and microscopic analysis of human tissue for the detection and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Ventana also sells consumables such as reagents and slides needed to operate the systems. Its products are marketed to hospital, pathology, and drug discovery labs around the globe. Its tests and equipment are used by many cancer research centers, including the

   and

   Ventana Medical Systems (VMS) operates as a separate company within the
   <company id="137847">
    Roche Diagnostics
   </company>
   division; VMS is the primary operating entity of that division's Roche Tissue Diagnostics segment. VMS generates most of its revenues through the sale of its products to anatomical pathology laboratories. In addition to sales of the VMS slide systems and related consumables, Roche is using VMS to expand in the high-growth field of personalized tests (called companion diagnostics) that are paired with its drug treatments; such tests help determine which treatment a patient will best respond to.

        <p>
   While Roche does not break out sales for VMS, its Tissue Diagnostics business reported a 7% gain in sales in 2013 versus 2012. (VMS is the primary operating entity of the Tissue Diagnostics segment.)

   VMA in fall 2014 announced an agreement with Quintiles, Inc. to offer its companion diagnostic testing services in China for pharmaceutical and biotech companies conducting early phase clinical trials.
  </p>
        <p>
   To expand in its core tissue diagnostics business, the company is focused on increasing equipment sales to pathology labs, which in turn grows recurring revenue from related consumable sales. In addition, the firm launches new products, including the 2011 introduction of its Vantage workflow management offering to allow for faster and more efficient patient sample processing. It also introduced the BenchMark Special Stains platform, which automates the processing of samples that require special chemicals and handling, in 2012.

   Ventana's first companion diagnostic test, the HER2 assay -- which helps doctors identify breast cancer patients that are likely to respond to its Herceptin cancer treatment drug -- was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2011. In addition to developing companion tests for Roche pharmaceuticals, Ventana is also looking to grow through partnerships in the drug discovery marketplace. For example, Ventana is working with
   <company id="56562">
    TRANSGENE
   </company>
   to develop a companion diagnostic test for TRANSGENE's lung cancer drug candidate. Ventana has formed passel of collaborative agreements to develop cancer-related companion diagnostic tests with other companies as well, including
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , Syndax Pharmaceuticals,
   <company id="101165">
    Æterna Zentaris
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="91276">
    Bayer Pharma
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisitions have also fueled Roche's acquisition efforts in the field of oncology related companion diagnostics. The company acquired mtm laboratories AG, a German cervical cancer testing firm, in a deal worth some €190 million ($265 million) in 2011. That purchase built upon the acquisition of BioImagene the previous year; BioImagene brought with it a technology for personalized tissue-based cancer diagnostics. Both of the acquired businesses were absorbed into the VMS organization.
