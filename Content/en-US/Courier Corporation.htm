        <p>
   Courier's&#160;revenue was up&#160;slightly&#160;in&#160;fiscal year&#160;2012 compared to the previous year. The company reported about $261.3 million&#160;in 2012 after claiming roughly $259.4 million in 2011 and around $257.1 million in 2010.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the book manufacturing segment, revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2012 with growth in specialty trade and religious sales offset in part by a decline in education sales. Revenues in the publishing segment decreased as the company faced a difficult economy and the channel challenges of the post-Borders retail environment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Courier has experienced sales growth in digital printing for the specialty trade market as publishers increasingly use digital printing to maximize the life cycle of certain titles.

   Along with the rest of the printing world, Courier is looking to the digital publishing segment to take its business forward. Courier has&#160;been&#160;investing in its digital printing operations to help serve these custom publishing customers. In 2010, it installed digital printing presses at one of its Massachusetts facilities through a relationship with
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   .&#160; The company then formed&#160;its digital printing offering, Courier Digital Solutions.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Courier Corporation traces its roots back to the
   <i>
    Chelmsford Journal,
   </i>
   a newspaper started in 1824 by William Baldwin. In 1835 the paper was sold to the publishers of the
   <i>
    Lowell Courier,
   </i>
   which later became the
   <i>
    Lowell Daily Citizen and News.
   </i>
   The company began publishing directories for the emerging phone system in 1878. After further consolidation of the newspaper business, the Courier-Citizen Company was incorporated in 1894.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company eventually sold its newspaper business to the publishers of the
   <i>
    Lowell Sun
   </i>
   in 1941; Courier-Citizen continued as a printing company specializing in printed forms. James F. Conway, Jr., was appointed president and CEO in 1966. The company went public as Courier Corporation in 1972. Courier expanded north through the North American Directory Corporation, a joint venture with Bell Canada, in 1985. Sensing the advent of computerization, however, Courier sold its 50% share back to Bell Canada three years later and began getting out of the directory business. It also backed out of the forms business and began investing in new technology.
  </p>
        <p>
   When Conway died in 1992, his son, James Conway III, was appointed CEO. Consolidation within the printing industry led to increased competition for Courier, and technology developments brought an increased call for on-demand jobs. To keep pace with the growth of electronic media, Courier formed an electronic publishing center that year. In 1994 it formed Courier New Media to create electronic products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Courier expanded its product offerings through acquisitions in 1997, including Book-mart Press (offering shorter print runs). It also bought direct marketer The Home School Books &amp; Supplies (renamed The Home School) to boost its presence in the emerging home school education publishing industry. The company expanded its online operations in 1999 with the launch of bookhound.com (out-of-print books). In 2000 Courier entered the niche publishing market, acquiring Dover Publications for about $39 million in cash. The company sold home-schooling supplier The Home School to Christian Book Distributors in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sold a portion of its custom printing business, which created such products as anthologies and course packets primarily for college professors, in 2002 and the remainder in 2003. Courier purchased test prep publisher Research &amp; Education Association in 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   In October 2005 Courier strengthened its book manufacturing operations by buying Moore-Langen, a printer specializing in&#160;book covers, for $15 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   Courier expanded its specialty publishing operations in April 2006 by buying Federal Marketing Corporation, a New Jersey-based publisher and distributor of home- and garden-related books, house plans, and other products that does business as Creative Homeowner. Courier paid $37 million for Creative Homeowner, which had sales of $24 million in calendar 2005.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company closed its Book-mart Press short-run manufacturing subsidiary in New Jersey in 2009. The following year it acquired Highcrest Media to expand its digital operations.
