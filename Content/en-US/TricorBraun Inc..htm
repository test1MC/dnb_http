   The company has evolved by successfully acquiring and integrating about a dozen businesses (including Northwestern Bottle Company, Texberry Container, Caliber Packaging, W. Braun Company, Packaging Plus, Packaging West, Smith Container, and Cal-West Tool &amp; Mold) that has expanded its portfolio of rigid packaging products and services, and its marketplace presence.

   In 2014 the company developed and introduced anew lightweight, low-profile tube and closure which improves sustainability, logistic efficiencies, and cost savings.
