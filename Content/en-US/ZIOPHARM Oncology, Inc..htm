   Biopharmaceutical company ZIOPHARM Oncology develops DNA-based drugs for different types of cancer. The company has three cancer drugs currently in various stages of clinical development. Its most promising candidate is palifosfamide (Zymafos),  which targets cancers of bone, muscle, fat, and other types of tissues. Others include indibulin (Zybulin, which disrupts cancer cell division and migration) and darinaparsin (Zinapar, an arsenic-based drug that treats blood and solid cancers). ZIOPHARM's roots go back to 2004, when CEO and co-founder Jonathan J. Lewis started ZIOPHARM, Inc.; the next year the company merged with EasyWeb, changed its name, and went public.
