   Appropriately enough, Holders Technology is a holding company for several businesses that make high-technology goods. The company operates through several subsidiaries in China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. These businesses offer a variety of products, including laminates, resists, copper foils, and other materials used in printed circuit boards (PCBs); drills, routers, and lamination equipment used to make PCBs; and special-purpose gloves, shoe covers, and wipes used in the clean rooms where semiconductors and other electronic devices are made. The company's non-PCB business is LED lighting. Holders distributes LED-related components, lighting products, and lighting systems.

  <p>
   Some 74% of Holders' business is from its PCB operations with LEDs accounting for the rest. While the PCB business is dominant for Holders, it lost revenue in 2015 (ended November) from 2015 while the LED business grew in the year-to-year comparison.

  <p>
   Europe has been Holders' biggest market, accounting for 68% of revenue in 2015. UK clients generated 30% of revenue with the rest supplied by customers in Asia.

   Holders customers are principally in the telecommunications, medicine, defense, automotive, and consumer fields.

  <p>
   Revenue dropped 17% in 2015 from 2014, the fifth year of a slide in sales. Holders posted a loss for 2015, though with cost-cutting throughout the organization, the loss wasn't as deep at the 2014 loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Holders attributed its disappointing to a loss of a major PCB distributor at the end of 2014 and strengthening of the British pound against other currencies. Demand for PCB products was lower in 2015.

  <p>
   Holders continues to look for ways to remain competitive in the tough PCB market where cost is a major concern for customers. The LED business approached the break-even point in 2015 and offers prospects for growth (sales were 18% higher in 2015) as LED lighting becomes more popular in commercial, industrial, and residential settings.
