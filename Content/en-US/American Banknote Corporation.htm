   Take note -- American Banknote aims to foil counterfeiters. Doing business as ABnote Global, the firm prints secure financial- and identification-related documents, such as stock certificates and state titles. It also makes ID cards (such as driver's licenses and passports); as well as plastic phone, gift, and check cards; lottery tickets; and checks. Services include print production, warehousing, distribution, and fulfillment. ABnote Global has operations and subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. The company traces its roots to 1795 when it helped the federally chartered Bank of the United States produce counterfeit-resistant currency.

   American Banknote was founded in 1795 to print US currency (one of its founders was Paul Revere), but in 1875 the US began printing its own money, forcing the company into new business lines such as stock certificates, bonds, and traveler's checks. In 1969 B.T.B. Corp. (formerly known as B.T. Babbitt, the maker of Bab-O kitchen cleanser), acquired American Banknote. B.T.B. changed its name to International Banknote Company in 1972. The company subsequently expanded into printing items such as food stamps and eventually branched into holographics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 International Banknote merged with securities printer U.S. Banknote to form United States Banknote. In 1995 the company acquired securities printer Grafica Bradesco (Brazil). United States Banknote adopted the American Banknote name the same year.

   In 1996 American Banknote bought Leigh-Mardon (Australia's leading provider of security products). The next year it acquired the plastic cards unit of Brazil's Menno Equipamentos para Escritorio.

   American Banknote spun off its holographics subsidiary, American Bank Note Holographics, in 1998. Subsequently, questions arose about revenue statements at the unit, and American Bank Note Holographics in 1999 restated three years' worth of financial statements. In mid-1999 American Banknote was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange; later that year it filed for bankruptcy protection. Chairman and CEO Morris Weissman resigned in 2000 and director C. Gerald Goldsmith was chosen to fill the positions of Office of the Chair and chairman. (Weissman was indicted in 2001 on charges of falsifying financial statements during his tenure.) Later that year Goldsmith was named Chairman Emeritus and Steven Singer was named chairman and CEO. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2002.
