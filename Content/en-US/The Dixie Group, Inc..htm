   The Dixie Group takes its business to the rug. Once a textile concern, the company has evolved into a maker of tufted broadloom carpets and custom rugs, and proprietary yarns used in manufacturing the soft floorcoverings. Its brands, Dixie Home, Masland Carpets, Fabrica International, and Candlewick Yarn, are differentiated by product price and styling. Dixie markets and sells carpets to high-end residential customers, including interior decorators, retailers, home builders, and motorhome and yacht OEMs. Less so, it supplies carpet for the specified (contract) market, such as architectural and commercial customers, as well as consumers through specialty floorcovering retailers.

  <p>
   Based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Dixie has administrative offices in Dalton, and Calhoun, Georgia; Saraland, Alabama; and Santa Ana, California. It has about 10 manufacturing, distribution, and yarn processing facilities nationwide, largely concentrated in Alabama, Georgia, and California.

  <p>
   The company has one line of business: carpet and rug manufacturing. Residential floorcovering products sales accounted for 74% of net sales in 2013, while the remaining sales stemmed from commercial floorcovering products.

  <p>
   Dixie primarily targets the construction, replacement, and retail markets. During 2013, sales to its top ten customers accounted for 20% of its overall sales.

  <p>
   After experiencing declines for 2012, Dixie saw its revenues jump 30% from $266 million in 2012 to $345 million in 2013. The growth for 2013 was due to higher sales of its residential and commercial carpet products. Dixie attributes this group to the introduction of new products and the expansion of its wool products. The company also experienced increased revenue from its carpet yarn processing and carpet dyeing and finishing services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixie posted a net loss for 2012, but it earned more than $5 million in profits for 2013. The positive net income for 2013 was the result of the increase in sales coupled with the absence of losses from continuing operations that it previously posted in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash flow from operations has slowly depleted over the last five years. After posting nearly $27 million in operating cash flow in 2009, Dixie experienced negative cash flow for both 2012 and 2013.

  <p>
   The company has responded to the slump in the housing market by restructuring its operations to align with demand. During 2012 it relocated its tufting technologies from its manufacturing facility in Atmore, Alabama, to its facility in Eton, Georgia, to achieve a more favorable cost structure for the products and markets served from those technologies. During 2013 it also expanded its yarn processing capabilities at its Roanoke, Alabama, yarn processing facility to support its growth with internal supply and to lessen its dependence on externally supplied yarn requirements.

  <p>
   Dixie extends its product lines and geographical footprint through the use of acquisitions and joint ventures. In 2014 it acquired California-based Atlas Carpet Mills, a high-end manufacturer and marketer of commercial floorcovering products, for $18 million. To fortify its wool floorcovering operations, in 2013 Dixie obtained Robertex Associates for $6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, Dixie entered a joint venture with Desso, NV, a Netherlands-based company, for the purpose of selling and distributing floorcovering products within the hospitality market.
