   Concert Pharmaceuticals wants to use deuterium chemistry to conduct a symphony of drugs. The company's process lets it substitute deuterium (also called heavy hydrogen) for hydrogen in a chemical compound thereby making the compound more stable without changing its other properties. It also believes this process will lead to shorter time from discovery to trial for certain drugs. Concert has a handful of clinical-stage candidates in various stages of the approval process, including treatments for spasticity, kidney disease, and neurologic disorders. It collaborates with Avanir, Celgene, and Jazz Pharmaceuticals on development. Concert began its song in 2006 and took the show public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company raised $84 million in its IPO. It plans to use the funds to continue trials, development, and R&amp;D to expand its pipeline of candidates.

   Concert plans to pursue strategic development and marketing partnerships while retaining full rights to and control over certain drugs. It intends to build out its production and marketing capability in the US.

  <p>
   Since Concert doesn't have a product on the market yet, its revenues, from licensing and R&amp;D payments, has been minimal. It shows net losses for every year since its founding and an accumulated deficit of $108 million. The company expects this trend to continue for years to come.

  <p>
   The company plans to continue pushing its pipeline candidates through FDA approval, acquiring rights to additional candidates, and seeking collaborative partners to help it develop and commercialize its products.
