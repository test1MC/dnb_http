   Synseal enhances its product portfolio through the help of acquisitions. In 2014 the company acquired Prospect, a glass supplier providing insulated glass units for window frame and roof applications as well as quantities of single sheet toughened glass. Also that year, Synseal acquired the trade and operating assets of the Litchfield Group's UK window and trade extrusion and door businesses.
