   Ask and you shall receive, especially when it comes to the Internet. Ask.com (formerly Ask Jeeves) operates an online question-and-answer service. The site solicits users to ask questions, as well as answer questions from other users. Results reveal answers from a variety of sources.  Previously the operator of a search engine, Ask.com switched gears in 2010. While it still offers search on its site, it no longer compiles an index of billions of Web pages. Instead, it delivers results via an agreement with search partner
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   . Ask.com operates alongside websites such as
   <company id="51052">
    CityGrid Media's
   </company>
   Citysearch.com and
   <company id="139305">
    Lexico Publishing Group
   </company>
   's Dictionary.com as part of the Search holdings of
   <company id="52963">
    IAC/InterActiveCorp
   </company>
   (IAC).

   The company is headquartered in New York City with office locations throughout the US and the world.

   In 2012 the company acquired information portal
   <company id="53065">
    About
   </company>
   from
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times
   </company>
   for about $300 million. The deal added nearly 1,000 topic sites and more than three million unique articles to Ask.com's search-able content. It also added About's 100 million monthly unique users to its existing user base of more than 100 million global visitors.

   After brainstorming about how to provide a "more human approach" to Internet information gathering, computer scientist David Warthen and venture capitalist Garrett Gruener founded Ask Jeeves in Berkeley, California, in 1996. They put the site online in 1997, and a few months later received a $5.5 million infusion from venture capitalist Roda Group. Roger Strauch, chairman of Roda Group, became chairman of Ask Jeeves (he was replaced as chairman of Ask Jeeves by Gruener in 2001). Also in 1997 Ask Jeeves began licensing its search technology to other website operators, including
   <company id="56246">
    InfoSpace
   </company>
   (now Blucora) and Infonautics (now
   <company id="51452">
    Tucows
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Ask Jeeves hired Robert Wrubel, a former executive with Cendant's Knowledge Adventure education software unit, as president and CEO. That year Ask Jeeves launched a children's version of the site; Ask Jeeves for Kids screens out material inappropriate for youngsters. The company's Corporate Question Answering Service licensing program began to take off, attracting big-name clients such as
   <company id="13193">
    Dell Computer
   </company>
   , which used Ask Jeeves' technology to create Ask Dudley, a bespectacled, pony tailed character who helps users find their way around Dell's customer support site.
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq Computer
   </company>
   bought a stake in Ask Jeeves, and in late 1998 Ask Jeeves licensed its plain language technology to Compaq's
   <company id="52226">
    AltaVista
   </company>
   search engine (Internet investment firm
   <company id="16748">
    CMGI
   </company>
   bought an 83% stake in AltaVista in 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   Ask Jeeves received a $25 million investment in 1999, primarily from
   <company id="99739">
    Highland Capital Partners
   </company>
   and
   <company id="43423">
    Institutional Venture Partners
   </company>
   . The company went public in 1999. Later that year, its Ask Jeeves International unit began developing country-specific versions of its Web site (starting with the UK). It bought Net Effects Systems, Web-based live help services, in late 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 the company bought search engine firm Direct Hit Technologies, which provides popularity-based search results, and The Evergreen Project, a Web-based provider of educational content. It also launched a line of Ask Jeeves books. However, a slowdown in advertising on its website aggravated operating losses further, and Wrubel resigned as CEO. Board member A. George Battle was named CEO. The company also cut its workforce by 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company bought the assets of eTour, an online marketing company. The next year the company purchased
   <company id="100210">
    Octopus
   </company>
   , a software company that would help Jeeves add transactional abilities to its service. Ask Jeeves launched a site redesign the following year. Also in 2003 Chairman Garrett Gruener announced plans to resign (but to remain on the board). President Steve Berkowitz was named CEO, and Battle was named executive chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Ask Jeeves acquired additional technology assets through its purchase of the software search firm Tukaroo. Later it paid about $500 million to acquire
   <company id="100062">
    Interactive Search Holdings
   </company>
   , operator of portal Web sites such as iWon and Excite. The business unit also began expanding its international reach, launching Ask Japan (a joint venture with Tokyo-based transcosmos) in 2004 and Ask Espa√±a the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2005, Ask Jeeves was acquired for $1.85 billion by
   <company id="52963">
    IAC/InterActiveCorp
   </company>
   (IAC), the media and services conglomerate controlled by former movie mogul Barry Diller. IAC then dropped the butler mascot and rebranded the search service as Ask.com. It introduced its service in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands during 2006.  Also that year Berkowitz left the company and was replaced by new CEO Jim Lanzone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later IAC split into five separately traded companies, with Ask.com remaining under IAC. The company expanded its holdings when it acquired
   <company id="139305">
    Lexico Publishing Group
   </company>
   , the owner of Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, and Reference.com, in 2008; IAC made the acquisition in order to boost traffic to Ask.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   Only a little over a year after he joined the company, in 2009 Jim Safka resigned as CEO of Ask.com for personal reasons, and Scott Garell assumed leadership of the business. (Safka, former chief executive of
   <company id="107288">
    Match.com
   </company>
   , had replaced Jim Lanzone as CEO in 2008.)  Garell was replaced by Doug Leeds in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2010 redesigned its website; as a result, Ask.com transformed from a search engine to a question-and-answer site.
