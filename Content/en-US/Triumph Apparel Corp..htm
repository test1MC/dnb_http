   Triumph Apparel posts a profit when its customers outfit themselves to bust a move. Formerly known as Danskin, the company designs and manufactures girls' and women's dance and active wear (including tights and leotards), and it also offers women's fitness equipment, such as toning balls and yoga mats. Triumph sells its products to mass merchandisers (

   ,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   ), department stores, sporting goods stores, and other specialty shops, as well as online, under the licensed Danskin name. In early 2009 KSL Ventures acquired 55% of the company.

  <p>
   In 1882, brothers Joel and Benson Goodman started with a dry-goods store. In 1923, the company began making cotton and silk hosiery. The name Danskin, a combination of "dance" and "skin," originated in the 1950s when nylon was first used in hosiery. The name aptly described the attire introduced by the company that revolutionized dancewear: the stretch tights and leotards gave dancers the free movement that cotton outfits denied.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Goodman family sold Danskin in 1980 to a unit of Esmark; the company languished as Esmark went through a string of takeovers. Byron Hero and Edwin Dean, Esmark holding company principals, bought Danskin in 1986. By stopping sales to discounters, modernizing production, and increasing sales, the company showed a profit in 1991. Danskin went public the next year, with Esmark maintaining a 50% ownership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Failed product expansion in 1994 only managed to stack Danskin's debt. It couldn't pay back the loans, thus spawning a shareholder suit (since settled) accusing Danskin of misleading investors. Sales continued to drop and, in 1997, Danskin was delisted from Nasdaq. Management consultant Donald Schupak became chairman that year, and investors led by Onyx Partners recapitalized the company. It had been crippled for years by debt, a competitive active wear market, and slackened demand for hosiery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Catherine Volker, president of Sara Lee's Hanes hosiery division, became CEO in 1998. Under Volker, Danskin signed a licensing agreement to make a line of sheer hosiery for Polo Ralph Lauren (discontinued in 2000), and it developed the Zen Sport collection of yoga apparel. Volker resigned after 15 months on the job and was replaced by longtime Liz Claiborne accessories president, Carol Hochman.

   In May 2000 the company added the Ellen Tracy and Evan-Picone names to its list of licensed legwear. In 2001 Danskin signed licensing deals with fitness guru Denise Austin, Jacques Moret's Freestyle, and the New York City Ballet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Pennaco Hosiery division in October 2003 to management-led JBT Legwear. The deal included rights to sell hosiery under the

   To build on its own portfolio, brand giant

   approached Danskin and bought its namesake brand for $70 million in 2007. As part of the deal with Iconix, Danskin changed its name to Triumph Apparel, which it was once named.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2009 KSL ventures acquired a 55% interest in Triumph. As part of the ownership change, Hochman transitioned to lead the company's Triumph Marketing subsidiary on a temporary basis and then resigned later that year.
