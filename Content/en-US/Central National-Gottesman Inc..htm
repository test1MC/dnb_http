   All the news that's fit to print (or at least some of it) shows up on a portion of Central National-Gottesman's (CNG) products. The family-owned papermaker distributes annually 4 million tons of goods, from wood pulp to paper, paperboard, and newsprint. Markets are tapped in almost 60 countries dotting the globe. In addition to North American operations, the company's international presence is established in 22 offices spanning Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CNG community includes the Lindenmeyr family of companies, paper merchants in fine paper, paper for books, magazines and catalogs, specialized paper, and packaging grades.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has 26 warehouse locations and 52 paper stores in the US and 22 international sales offices.

  <p>
   CNG's Lindenmeyr division includes Lindenmeyr Munroe (fine paper), Lindenmeyr Book Publishing Papers (book paper), Lindenmeyr Central (magazine and catalog paper), and CNG Specialty Papers (specialized paper and packaging grades). Other units include Kelly (commercial printing products, fine papers, envelopes, specialty papers, invitations, social announcements, packaging products, and finishing products) and Spicers Paper (a distributor of fine paper to the commercial print industry).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Central National division supports the company's operations on a global basis with packaging, paper, pulp, and tissue. The division also provides administration support, as well as marketing and management functions, which include sales, financing, market research, and consulting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it sources wood pulp on its own, CNG supplements its stock by gathering all types of wood from producers in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Spain. Moreover, the company caters to customers with its wide slate of services, including sales, financing, transportation, and marketing research, as well as management and consulting expertise.

   The company caters to commercial printers, book and documentation publishers, packagers, on-demand printing, graphic designers, and business forms manufacturers, as well as various corporate, commercial, industrial, and professional buyers of paper. It sells its products through sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Southern Africa.

  <p>
   CNG's expansion strategy centers around organic growth and key acquisitions. Over the past few years, the company has acquired seven US-based paper distributors, two US-based packaging companies, and has made major investments in new offices outside of the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it bought Spicers Canada (a distributor of fine paper, sign and display media, industrial packaging and graphic arts supplies) with 15 warehouse locations throughout Canada. It joins CNG merchants Lindenmeyr Munroe, Spicers Paper (US) and Kelly Paper in the company's Distribution Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increasing its market share in Southern California, through its US Spicers Paper division, CNG in 2015 also planned to acquire the business of Performance Paper LLC, a division of CellMark.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company bought

    Bradner Central Company
   </company>
   , one of the oldest and most highly regarded family-owned paper merchants in the United States; and
   <company id="51105">
    Domtar Corporation
   </company>
   's Ariva paper distribution business, a major U.S. paper distributor, with 15 locations in the East and Midwest.

  <p>
   In mid-2012 it acquired
   <company id="112527">
    Spicers Paper
   </company>
   and
   <company id="115500">
    Kelly Paper Company
   </company>
   . Spicers Paper owned 12 warehouse facilities in the US, and Kelly Paper had almost 50 locations spanning four western US states. Based in California, both companies enhanced CNG's West Coast presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded by European immigrants in 1886, CNG has evolved from a New York-based raw materials papermaking source to rank among America's largest private companies.
