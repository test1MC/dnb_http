   Anthony Doors can shed a little light on things that are pretty cool. The company makes glass refrigerator/freezer doors, display case doors, shelving, mounts, and lighting systems, and display equipment for commercial refrigeration and merchandising end-use. Anthony Doors also offers custom glass units, replacement parts, and installation manuals, and it manufactures custom-fabricated curved/bent glass used in display cases. The company primarily caters to grocery stores, convenience stores, and specialty retailers. Besides the US, it has offices in Canada, China, and Italy. Founded in 1958 as Anthony's Refrigerations Service Company, the company was sold to

  <p>
   Anthony Doors is now part of the Refrigeration and Food Equipment operations of Dover's Engineered Systems segment. Dover's plans for its growth trajectory involve international expansion, especially as the world continues the trend toward energy conservation and the demand for energy efficient glass products grows. (Anthony Doors boasts energy savings of up to 70% by enclosing open refrigerator and freezer cases with its Anthony Retrofit doors and Anthony Optimax Pro LED lighting systems.)

  <p>
   Dover's Engineered Systems segment contributed 43% of the company's total revenue for 2013. This segment's revenue increased by 11% during 2013 as a result of organic growth and additional revenue from recent acquisitions as well as a favorable foreign currency impact.
