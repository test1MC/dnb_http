   Sidel puts its business' message in the bottle. The company -- which is owned by Switzerland-based
   <company id="92818">
    Tetra Laval
   </company>
   -- is one of the world's largest manufacturers of bottle-making equipment. It specializes in blow-molding machines that make polyethylene bottles for carbonated soft drinks, milk, fruit juice, water, and other liquids. Sidel has customers the world over in the packaging industry; its machines can also package materials in glass, metal, and cardboard. In addition, the company developed a method of making carbon-lined plastic bottles for sensitive liquids like beer, and its subsidiaries offer packaging for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, as well.

  <p>
   Beginning its life as Lesieur, the company initially made polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bottles for its own cooking oil products. Soon, however, the container became more lucrative than the contents, and Sidel entered the container industry. Based in Le Havre, France, it began exporting its first bottle-making machines in 1965.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1970s Sidel was purchased by Pont-à-Mousson, but it continued to produce PVC and HDPE (high-density polyethylene resin) bottles for noncarbonated liquids. Then, in 1980, the company took a major step and began to manufacture blow-molding machines to produce PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles, which could hold carbonated and noncarbonated liquids. In 1984 Sidel began a sustained attempt to create innovations in the PET industry. That year it also created a subsidiary in the US, one of its biggest markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Senior executive Frances Olivier led a management buyout of Sidel (for nearly $20 million) in 1987. This was a turning point for the company, as German rival Krupp was set to snap up its French competitor. Olivier proved himself to be a capable and motivating leader, continually pushing technical and marketing innovations; at one point he doled out an added four months of pay for his employees. His first managerial masterstroke was to place greater emphasis on the US soft-drink guzzling populace; soon Sidel machines were producing 75% of the PET beverage bottles in the states.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 the company was finally listed on the Paris Stock Market. Three years later its international operations got a huge boost when the company inked a contract with Malaysian company Chuan Sin, which is that country's largest mineral-water producer. Chuan Sin benefited from Sidel's totally automated SB06, a powerhouse system that produced about 7,200 bottles per hour, from bottle blowing to packing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sidel teamed up with conveyor and packager specialist Gebo in 1997 to broaden its business. The next year it expanded its Stateside operations by starting up blow-mold production in Norcross, Georgia. While Sidel's first US subsidiary opened its doors in 1984, the company had yet to capitalize on the burgeoning American market in terms of actually manufacturing blow molds in the states.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 subsidiary Sidel Actis Services rolled out its ACTIS system, an economical PET packaging system that incorporated a carbon lining to protect sensitive liquids like beer. It also bought Swedish company Norden, which made packing machines, as well as packaging for the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The

    US Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   approved Sidel's ACTIS treatment approach in 2000, clearing the way for commercializing PET bottles for beer and other oxygen-sensitive liquids.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Switzerland-based packager
   <company id="92818">
    Tetra Laval
   </company>
   made a friendly bid for Sidel as part of its plan to expand its plastic packaging equipment operations, but the EU blocked the merger later in the year. Gérard Stricher came on board as CEO, unveiled a restructuring plan, and announced a number of other management changes. All this activity was generated in anticipation of the European Commission's approval of Tetra Laval's acquisition bid, which finally came in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the Sidel Group created an Engineering &amp; Conveying business unit, building on the products and services obtained the Gebo acquisition.
