  <p>
   MNP is counting on the prediction that fasteners for aerospace and construction (especially residential building) applications are expected to outpace standard fasteners. (It develops and manufactures fasteners for both applications.) The company's biggest competition comes from alternative fastening products such as industrial adhesives and clinching and welding. It also contends with falling raw material prices, which cause fastener prices to decrease.
