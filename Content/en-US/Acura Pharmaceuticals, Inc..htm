   Acura Pharmaceuticals is working to provide accurate dosages of powerful drugs while preventing drug abuse. The company has developed a technology to add abuse-deterring agents to commonly abused pharmaceuticals. If a drug with these agents (what Acura calls Aversion Technology) is crushed and inhaled, certain ingredients will cause nasal irritation, and if an abuser attempts to dissolve the powder, it will form a non-injectable gel. Its Impede Technology works with pseudoephedrine to disrupt the process used to turn the decongestant into meth. Acura's approved products include prescription Aversion oxycodone and over-the-counter Nexafed (pseudoephedrine with Impede ingredients).

   Acura developed Aversion oxycodone in partnership with Pfizer, who owned the initial marketing rights to the drug they called Oxecta after it was approved in 2011. The larger drug company didn't see many sales of Oxecta in the two years it tried, even after it implemented the

   -suggested changes to its marketing materials. As a result, Acura in 2014 cancelled the licensing deal and took back full ownership of Oxecta, which it renamed Aversion oxycodone. The company's seven pipeline products also use Aversion Technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after Oxecta was approved, the FDA gave its stamp to Nexafed, which has been gaining in popularity ever since. Acura is working on product extensions of the Nexafed line as well as a mechanism to limit the release of active ingredients in tablets when multiple tablets are taken simultaneously.

   Acura's products are only approved for sale in the US. It has R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities in Indiana and administrative offices in Illinois.

   The company sells its prescription and over-the-counter products to pharmacies nationwide, directly and through wholesalers. Pharmacy

  <p>
   The company didn't start selling Nexafed until December 2012 so it received no revenue that year. In 2013 it reported $123 thousand in product and royalty revenue from sales of Nexafed and the last of the payments from Pfizer, respectively. Like most pharmaceutical companies that have a relatively new product, Acura is still spending more on R&amp;D than it makes. The company reported a net loss of $14 million in 2013 as it continued development of its additional Aversion products and spent on advertising and marketing for Nexafed. It's total accumulated deficit was $349 million at the end of 2013. Cash used in operations followed the same pattern and actually increased by $6.6 million.

  <p>
   Acura is looking for partnerships and collaborators who will help it develop Aversion Technology versions of other types of drugs, including stimulants, sedatives, and tranquilizers. In addition, Acura might acquire or license additional candidates or technologies to add to its R&amp;D pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also seeking partners to help it market Aversion products and Nexafed globally.
