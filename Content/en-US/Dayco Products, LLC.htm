   Dayco has been attracting additional international customers through the use of acquisitions. In 2013 it obtained Brazil's Nytron, a supplier of pulleys, tensioners, and hydraulic actuators. Dayco expanded its business in South America through the deal and inherited an approximate 40% market share in belt tensioners. Dayco has a strategy to increase its presence and reach in the region, and it has set a goal of $176 million in sales by 2015.

   Looking to the Asia/Pacific, Dayco also in 2013 purchased Precision Parts, an Australian-based manufacturer of harmonic balancers, performance balancers, and engine idler pulleys. The transaction primarily allowed Dayco to add harmonic balancers to its line of automotive aftermarket products.
