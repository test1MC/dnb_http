   Galderma Laboratories can't soothe all of the irritations of the world, but it can help with itchy, spotty, and sensitive skin. The company is the North American operation of Swiss firm Galderma Pharma. As part of its business, Galderma Laboratories focuses exclusively on developing over-the-counter and prescription dermatology products. In addition to such consumer brands as Cetaphil, the company offers treatments for a variety of skin conditions. Areas of focus include remedies for acne, rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, and melasma (darkening of the skin due to excessive melanin production). Galderma is owned by Switzerland's

   </company>
   which bought out its joint venture partner in 2014.

   The company's research involves using molecular, cellular, and in vivo bioassay systems to identify new therapies. The firm's scientists work in conjunction with dermatologists to help develop new skin treatments. Along with Cetaphil, Galderma Laboratories' lead products include Clobex to treat psoriasis, topical acne medication Differin, and rosacea therapies Metrogel and Oracea.
