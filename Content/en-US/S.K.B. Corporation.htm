   Is playing guitar better than hunting for prey? SKB can make a case for either one. The company makes hard-sided cases for guitars and other musical instruments, as well as for sporting goods such as rifles and golf clubs. Other products include cases for lighting equipment, DJ equipment, and electronics. The company's Roto-X shipping containers are rotationally molded to be lightweight, but also tough enough to withstand the stresses of transport. Originally founded as a musical instrument case maker, SKB began making rifle cases after the owners learned that hunters were adapting keyboard cases to hold guns. SKB was founded in 1977 by president Dave Sanderson and CEO Steve Kottman. Both still own the firm.
