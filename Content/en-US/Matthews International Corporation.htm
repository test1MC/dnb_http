   Matthews International might not bury its competition, but it can supply the casket and bronze marker. One of the nation's leading makers of cremation equipment and urns, bronze memorials (including Elvis Presley's Graceland marker), metal and wood caskets, and commemorative products (Baseball Hall of Fame plaques), Matthews also builds mausoleums. In addition, it provides graphic imaging products and services for the consumer packaging and retail industries, as well as merchandising services and marking and fulfillment systems. Matthews has operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, and Europe, but the US accounts for more than 60% of its sales.

  <p>
   Within its two major divisions -- Memorialization and Brand Solutions -- Matthews breaks its offerings down into six areas: cemetery products, funeral home products, cremation, graphics imaging, merchandising solutions, and marking and fulfillment systems. Graphics imaging contributes the most to overall revenue, some 35%, with cemetery products and funeral home products each accounting for about 20%.

  <p>
   The US and Europe represent Matthews' largest markets, accounting for more than 60% and about 35% of sales, respectively. Other markets include Asia, Australia, and Canada. It has facilities in the US, as well as in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey, and the UK.

  <p>
   The company's memorialization products are sold primarily to cemeteries, memorial parks, and funeral homes, as well as corporations, hospitals, schools, and other organizations. Brand solutions product and services are marketed to customers in the consumer packaged goods and retail industries.

  <p>
   Matthews has seen sales rise in recent years. The company attributes the gains to higher sales volume within its Brand Solutions business and timely boosts from acquisitions. In 2014 revenue crossed the billion dollar mark, up 12% to $1.1 billion. Although memorialization sales were down 2% as the number of casketed, in-ground burials declines, brand solutions sales, powered by the mid-2014 acquisition of Schawk (which it renamed
   <company id="42731">
    SGK LLC
   </company>
   ), were up a healthy 28%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income and cash flow from operations, however, were both down as selling and administrative expenses rose significantly, boosted by acquisition activity.

  <p>
   Much of the company's recent growth has been an expansion of its brand solutions business, which has grown from 45% of sales in 2012 to 54% in 2014. Matthews plans to extend those services globally (both organically and through acquisitions) so it can cater to multinational clients.

  <p>
   In 2014 Matthews made its largest acquisition to date with the purchase of
   <company id="42731">
    Schawk
   </company>
   (SGK). The deal, valued at more than $570 million, combines Matthews' brand solutions expertise in Europe with Schawk's experience in the US and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2015, the company purchased former rival casket and urn maker
   <company id="105541">
    Aurora Casket Company
   </company>
   for $214 million.

  <p>
   John Matthews began making stencils, signs, and steel stamps in 1850. Two of his sons joined his company in 1861; they renamed it Jas. H. Matthews Co. in 1894, after the youngest. The company developed the first vulcanized rubber printing plate in 1912 and began marking corrugated shipping containers. In 1927 it applied its plaque-making ability, which it had been using for plaques to adorn buildings, to make America's first flush bronze memorial plaque, mounted in a Florida cemetery.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Matthews International in 1976 to reflect its presence in other countries. Five years later it purchased the Sunland Memorial Park and Mortuary in Arizona to learn more about customers' needs. Matthews went public in 1994; sales continued to climb steadily.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 David Kelly joined the company as president and COO; he became CEO six months later and was elected chairman in 1996. That year Matthews sold its cemetery (3% of total revenues) and started expanding its product offerings and geographic markets through acquisitions, beginning with its purchase of Industrial Equipment and Engineering Company in 1996. Acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 (such as Gibraltar Mausoleum Construction) expanded its graphics and memorial businesses. In 1999 the company acquired Europe's leading supplier of bronze memorialization products, Caggiati SpA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthews acquired
   <company id="41742">
    The York Group
   </company>
   , the second-largest US casket maker, in December 2001. A Federal Trade Commission inquiry regarding that acquisition was closed in late 2002 with no action taken.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthews boosted its marking products capabilities in July 2004 when it acquired Holjeron Corporation, an Oregon-based industrial controls manufacturer. The same month Matthews acquired merchandising solutions provider Cloverleaf Group (formerly iDL and Big Red Rooster) to expand its presence in that market. In late 2004 the company purchased The InTouch Group, a European reprographics firm. The next year Matthews expanded its Casket Division, picking up Milso Industries to work alongside York.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Matthews appointed group president David DeCarlo to the newly-created role of vice chairman and EVP Joseph Bartolacci as president and COO. In July the firm completed the acquisition of Milso Industries, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matthews belonging to its casket division.
  </p>
  <p>
   David Kelly remained as chairman and CEO. The next year Bartolacci replaced Kelly as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2008 Matthews acquired a 78% stake in Saueressig GmbH &amp; Co., a leading European provider of prepress and gravure printing forms based in Vreden, Germany. Saueressig has manufacturing operations in Germany, Poland, and England. Saueressig operates as a subsidiary of the firm's Graphics Imaging Group. In December Matthews purchased a small European cremation equipment manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2009 the firm bought California-based United Memorial Products, a leading supplier of granite memorial products, burial vaults and caskets in the western US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2010 Matthews acquired Reynoldsville Casket Co. The Pennsylvania-based company makes and distributes caskets primarily in the Northeast.
