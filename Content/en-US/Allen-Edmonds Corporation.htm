   Allen-Edmonds' shoes stand their ground in the US. A maker of high-end men's dress and casual shoes, golf shoes, belts, leather goods and accessories, Allen-Edmonds makes most of its shoes in Wisconsin, resisting the trend of moving production overseas. Its shoes are handmade by skilled craftsmen, and Allen-Edmonds is known for its full range of sizes for men. Its footwear is sold in more than 45 company-owned stores in the US, Belgium and Italy, as well as in department stores (

    Nordstrom
   </company>
   ) and specialty shops in more than 20 countries in Europe and Latin America, and online and by catalog. Founded by Elbert Allen in 1922, the iconic American shoemaker was sold by previous owner

   to footwear retailer

   for $255 million.

   Wisconsin-based Allen-Edmonds' 45-plus company-owned stores are located primarily in major cities and business centers in California, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, some 20 other US states, and the District of Columbia. The shoemaker opened its first store in China in 2012.

   To capitalize on its position as one of the few remaining domestic shoe manufacturers, Allen-Edmonds has launched a marketing campaign called "Rediscover American Workmanship." It is also adding stores in several select cities, including Minneapolis.
