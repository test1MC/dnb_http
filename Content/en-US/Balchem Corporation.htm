   Believe Balchem when they say they have it covered. The company has developed a technology that covers or encapsulates ingredients used in food and animal health products; the encapsulation improves nutritional value and shelf life and allows for controlled time release. Balchem also provides specialty gases such as ethylene oxide (used to sterilize medical instruments), propylene oxide (used to reduce bacteria in spice treating and chemical processing), and methyl chloride (a refrigerant). It also provides SensoryEffects provide microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food, pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients.
  </p>

  <p>
   Balchem's operations are divided into four main business segments: SensoryEffects; Animal Nutrition and Health; Specialty Products; and Industrial Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its ARC Specialty Products segment offers re-packaging and distribution of select chemicals (including ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) to healthcare and other markets. The Animal Nutrition and Health segment makes and supplies products (including choline chloride) to several animal health markets and also certain derivative chemical products for industrial use. Balchem's SensoryEffects segment provides human-grade choline and microencapsulation products for a range of applications in human food, pharmaceutical, and nutrition markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's unencapsulated feed ingredients unit (BCP Ingredients) supplies the nutrient choline chloride to poultry and swine farmers. Reashure, an encapsulated choline product, increases milk production in dairy cows.
  </p>
  <p>
   SensoryEffects, the largest segment, accounts for 50% of total sales; Animal Nutrition &amp; Health, 30%; Specialty Products, 10%; and Industrial Products 10%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Balchem operates two four subsidiaries in the US: BCP Ingredients, SensoryEffects, Inc., SensoryEffects Cereal Systems, Inc., and Aberco. It also has two subsidiaries in Europe: Balchem BV and Balchem Italia, which has a manufacturing facility in Italy that makes and distributes methylamines (a building block for choline products) and choline.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates repackaging facilities in South Carolina and Missouri, and uses distribution points in New York, California, and Puerto Rico. It also has manufacturing facilities in Utah, Virginia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Nebraska, as well as in Canada.

  <p>
   Balchem has recorded rising net revenues over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it had net revenue of $552.5 million, up 2% on 2014 due to an increase in SensoryEffects results.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales for the SensoryEffects segment increased by 35% due to the acquired SensoryEffects business that contributed $69.8 million to the overall increase.  The Powder &amp; Flavor Systems and Cereal Systems product lines comprised $56.5 million and $10.2 million of the increase, respectively. Also contributing to the higher sales was an 11.1% rise in encapsulated ingredients used for baking and food preservation, primarily due to greater volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty Products segment sales were flat compared to the prior year and revenue from the Animal Nutrition &amp; Health and Industrial Products segments decreased.
  </p>
  <p>
   Balchem's net income has also risen over the last five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 net income was $59.7 million, up 13% due to higher net sales outpacing an increase in operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $103.8 million, up 22% compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is continuing to focus on leveraging its plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from core volume growth, broadening product applications of human and animal health specialty products, as well as capitalizing on its varied choline production capabilities. It invested $41.3 million in capital expenditures in 2015, up from $13.2 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Balchem integrated SensoryEffects and made significant investments in new production capacity and technology. Looking forward, growth for this segment will be fueled by its investment in agglomeration technology, Curemark, and the RDI and EFSA first-ever intake recommendations for choline. The company will continue to drive strategic growth initiatives through both organic investments in new manufacturing capabilities and new product development, as well as acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company expanded its Verona, Missouri facility by adding another ReaShure manufacturing unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014

  <p>
   In 2016 Balchem acquired Utah-based Albion International (a privately held manufacturer of mineral amino acid chelates, specialized mineral salts and mineral complexes) for $116.4 million. The acquisition of Albion continues to expand Balchem's science-based human health and wellness products and increases its product offerings in the nutritional ingredient market. Additionally, the company also benefits from a broader geographic footprint and a stronger position as a technological leader in spray-drying and ingredient delivery products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To accelerate the growth of its food and nutrition platforms with new product offerings, in 2014 Balchem spent $567 million to acquire Missouri-based Performance Chemicals &amp; Ingredients Company (aka SensoryEffects), a privately held supplier of customized food and beverage ingredient systems.

  <p>
   Herbert Weiss, Leslie Balassa, three ex-officers of the Alcolac company, and a group of Baltimore-based investors founded Balchem in 1967 in New York City. The company focused on the development of encapsulated specialty ingredients (the coating of individual particles that allow precise control of nutrient delivery). Initially, Balchem developed food ingredients used in meat processing, flavor enhancement, and dough leavening, as well as in nutritional supplements. In 1971 the company won its first big order: encapsulating the ingredients in pudding mix for General Foods. Balchem later applied the same technology to foaming agents for plastics, aquaculture supplements, and animal feeds. It also developed a line of specialty gases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Balchem boosted its gas business with the purchase of AlliedSignal's sterilant gas business (used to sterilize medical devices). Weiss retired as CEO in 1996 and was succeeded by EVP Raymond Reber. Reber left the company a few months later, and chemical industry veteran Dino Rossi replaced him. The next year Balchem developed a rumen-protected choline chloride for the animal nutrition market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Balchem restructured its operations in 1998 away from aquaculture and towards animal nutrition and other growth markets. After successful university and field trials, the company introduced Reashure, its encapsulated choline product for dairy cows.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Balchem was granted a patent for its technology that increases milk production in dairy cows. In 2001 the company acquired the choline and encapsulated product lines of DCV, Inc., and its DuCoa L.P. affiliate, which contributed to the company's increase in net sales by about 30% in 2002. In 2002 sales continued to build as the encapsulated/nutritional products segment introduced several new products and product applications for the enhancement of shelf-life and fortification of products in certain markets of the food industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Balchem's unencapsulated feed ingredients segment, also referred to as BCP Ingredients, got larger in 2007 when the company acquired two choline-related businesses. The first was in Italy from
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel
   </company>
   , and the other deal was for a company called Chinook Global Limited, whose operations were integrated into Balchem's business. Those deals nearly tripled the size of BCP Ingredients, making it Balchem's largest unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company's growth increased again with the acquisition of Maryland-based Aberco, a marketer and distributor of propylene oxide.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Balchem's capital expenditures were about $8.2 million, out of which $3.3 million was invested in its new manufacturing facility in Covington, Virginia. Balchem expanded production capacities to meet growing demand by opening the Covington plant in 2012, which doubled the output capacity for the Animal Nutrition and Health ruminant sector.
