   It's plain to Green Plains that the US heartland's cornfields offer so much more than just providing a food source. The company operates 14 corn-based ethanol facilities in Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The vertically integrated Green Plains has the annual capacity to produce 1 billion gallons of ethanol, which is primarily used as an auto fuel. It also sells ethanol produced by others. In addition, Green Plains' plants, when operating at full capacity, produce about 3.5 million tons of animal feed known as distillers grains, the primary co-product of ethanol production. Another co-product is corn oil, sold to biodiesel manufacturers and feed lot markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   Green Plains' 14 plants are located in Bluffton, Indiana; Central City, Nebraska; Lakota, Iowa; Obion, Tennessee; Ord, Nebraska; Riga, Michigan; Shenandoah, Iowa; Atkinson, Nebraska; Fairmont, Minnesota; Hereford, Texas; Hopewell, Virginia; Otter Tail, Minnesota; Wood River, Nebraska; and Superior, Iowa. It also operates an independent third party ethanol marketing business, Green Plains Trade. The largest distillers grain export markets in 2015 were Thailand, Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam.

  <p>
   The company operates in four segments. Its Ethanol production segment (the fourth largest ethanol producer in North America) accounted for 30% of Green Plains' revenues in 2015; Marketing and distribution contributed (45%); Agribusiness (distillers grains and grain), 24%; and Partnership, 1%. (The Partnership's assets include 30 ethanol storage facilities, 8 fuel terminal facilities and 2,500 leased railcars).
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Plains produces more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol, 3.5 million tons of distillers grains, and 275 million pounds of corn oil per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Plains Grain, a wholly owned subsidiary of Green Plains, is a bulk grain-storage business with three facilities across Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska. The subsidiary buys bulk grain, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats from area producers and provides grain drying and storage services to those producers. The grain is then sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Its marketing and distribution operation sells and ships Green Plains' own ethanol products, as well as those from other companies, to retailers, traders and resellers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products in feedlot, poultry and rail markets. Its railcar fleet for the marketing and distribution segment consists of 900 leased hopper cars for the transportation of distillers grains and 100 leased tank cars for the transportation of corn oil.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2015 revenues decreased by 8% to $2.9 billion due to a decline in marketing and distribution and ethanol production partially offset by an increase in revenues from agribusiness and partnership.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marketing and distribution revenues dropped by 21% due to a decline in ethanol and distillers grains revenues as the result of lower prices. Ethanol production declined by 22% due to lower average ethanol and distillers grains prices, as well as lower volumes produced and sold.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income decreased by 96% to $7 million in 2015 due to lower revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 operating cash flow decreased by 95% to $10 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategy is to be a vertically integrated, low-cost producer of ethanol and agricultural products, growing primarily through targeted acquisitions (as well as strategic capital investments where appropriate). Green Plains seeks to lock in the cost of its raw materials in long-term contracts to minimize the risk of commodity market fluctuations, works to continually improve the efficiency of its operations and expand its third-party marketing volumes, and invests in the next generation of biofuels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to provide fuel storage and transportation services. This partnership completed its IPO that year, generating net proceeds of $157.5 million, which it used to make a distribution of $155.3 million to Green Plains and paid $0.9 million in origination fees under its new $100 million revolving credit facility. Green Plains owns a 62.5% limited partner interest. This transaction was strategic and critical to the growth of Green Plains' downstream business.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company added 160 million gallons a year by acquiring two ethanol plants -- one in Hopewell, Virginia for $18.6 million; and another in Hereford, Texas for $78.8 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Green Plains purchased cattle feeding assets from Agri Beef that included a cattle feed yard and a grain storage facility.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 the company bought two ethanol plants (in Wood River, Nebraska and Fairmont, Minnesota) from Ethanol Holding Company. The acquisition increased Green Plains' production capacity by 28%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company added to its agribusiness operations by acquiring the grain elevator assets of Nebraska-based KW Carter, located near Green Plains' ethanol production plant. Doing business as JW Grain, the facility can store up to 1.9 million bushels of grain and load 25-car unit trains.
  </p>
  <p>
   After making several agricultural purchases over the years, Green Plains held a sale to reduce debt. In 2012 it sold 12 grain elevators (83% of its total agribusiness grain storage capacity) in northwestern Iowa and western Tennessee to The Andersons, Inc., for $133.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Green Plains acquired Otter Tail Ag Enterprises, a 55-million gallon annual capacity dry mill ethanol plant in Minnesota, in 2011. The $55 million deal significantly increased Green Plains' annual production capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was formed in 2004.
