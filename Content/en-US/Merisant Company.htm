   With a combination of several mass-market and nearly 20 regional brands of artificial sweeteners -- and sales in more than 100 countries worldwide -- the Merisant Company finds life sweet indeed. It is the manufacturer of aspartame-based products, such as Equal, Canderel, and Sweet Simplicity. It also makes Pure Via, a sweetener derived from the stevia plant. Merisant's customers include retail grocery stores, pharmacies, food wholesalers, foodservice distributors and operators, and other food manufacturers. And although the little blue packets of Equal are ubiquitous throughout the US, more than half of Merisant's sales come from other countries.

   Merisant makes Pure Via brand tabletop sweetener. The product's active sweetening ingredient is Reb A (made by and supplied to Merisant by PureCircle), which is derived from the stevia plant. (Extracts of the stevia plant are said to be 200 times sweeter than sugar.) Merisant partners with

   , which owns the trademark for and uses the sweetener in its beverages, to form the joint venture Whole Earth Sweetener, which distributes Pure Via to food retailers for tabletop use.
