   The company, which sells apparel and accessories for motocross, BMX, surfing, mountain biking, and wakeboarding, has been working to roll out more lifestyle-type products aside from its hard-core motocross offerings. To this end, Fox Racing offers a line of casual wear, and high-performance sunglasses and goggles for sports spectators. Its eyewear is made under an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with sports accessories maker
   <company id="43748">
    Oakley
   </company>
   , which is owned by behemoth
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Particularly because more than 35% of the company's fans are under the age of 18, Fox Racing has made its website available to smartphone users, asserting that customers can buy products in fewer than 60 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
   As one of the best-selling brands of motocross apparel globally, Fox Racing has worked with motocross riders, including Ricky Carmichael, James Stewart, Damon Bradshaw, Rick Johnson, Mark Barnett, Doug Henry, Jeremy McGrath, and Steve Lamson, as part of its research and development efforts to provide them with maximum protection and performance, as well as freedom of movement.

  <p>
   Fox Racing is looking at expanding its business across Europe. An alliance it inked in 2013 with Cofton, Maryland's Creative Logistics Solutions (CLS) is helping the company with its goal. Fox Racing is leveraging CLS's InfoShip, which communicates with Fox Racing's centralized InfoShip server located in California to process shipping transactions at its Netherlands site (in Eersel) with remote support by CLS.
