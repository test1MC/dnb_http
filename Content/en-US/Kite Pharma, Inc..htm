   This kite soars when it comes to using a patient's own immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Kite Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing engineered autologous T cell therapy (eACT) products for the treatment of cancer. eACT products harvest T cells (found in a patient's immune system) and genetically engineer them to express cancer-specific receptors. This process increases the number of engineered T cells and infuses the functional cancer-specific T cells back into the patient. The company's lead product candidate, KTE-C19, is an anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. (CD19 is a protein located on the cell surface of B cell lymphomas and leukemias.)

  <p>
   In 2014 Kite Pharma launched an IPO and received almost $128 million in proceeds. Of this total, it plans to use $16 million to fund the planned Phase 1-2 single-arm multicenter clinical trial of KTE-C19 and $30 million to fund additional trials for other indications for KTE-C19. About $20 million will go toward the advancement of any additional product candidates, and $15 million will be used to expand its internal research and development capabilities to explore the next generation of eACT technology and new product candidates. The remainder of proceeds will be used to fund working capital, including general operating expenses.

  <p>
   Kite Pharma utilizes engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT) products to treat cancer. eACT involves the genetic engineering of T cells to express either chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), or T cell receptors (TCRs). These modified T cells are designed to identify and eradicate cancer cells. The company is currently funding a Phase 2 clinical trial of a TCR-based therapy and multiple Phase 1-2a clinical trials of CAR- and TCR-based therapies. Each trial is funded by Kite Pharma's primary collaborator, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (the NCI).

  <p>
   Kite Pharma is focused on developing its selection of eACT-based product candidates for the treatment of advanced solid and hematological malignancies. It is concentrating on the advancement of its lead product candidate, KTE-C19, for the treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
