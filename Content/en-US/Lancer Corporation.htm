   "Make it a Coke" is music to Lancer Corporation's ears. The company, a manufacturer of fountain drink-dispensing equipment for the foodservice and beverage industries, makes systems for dispensing soft drinks and juice, post-mix dispensing valves for mixing syrup and carbonated water, ice dispensers, beer dispensing systems, and various syrup pumps, carbonators, and valves. Lancer is a subsidiary of Japanese commercial kitchen equipment maker Hoshizaki Electric Co.
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   traditionally is one of Lancer's biggest customers; the two companies are linked throughout Lancer's history.

   The company operates manufacturing plants and sales offices in the US, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, the Far East, and Belgium. It has a presence in more than 60 countries.

   Lancer stays in the forefront of its industry by continually looking to improve beverage dispensing equipment. Its historical ties with Coca-Cola were strengthened further in late 2010 when the two companies patented a beverage converter valve capable of using multiple ports without fluid crossover.

   Borrowing $4,200, the Schroeder brothers began making parts for beverage-dispensing machines in 1967. Lancer's first product was a quick-disconnect fitting designed for Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola designated Lancer a primary supplier and the two companies also worked out a development agreement in which Lancer would manufacture items specifically for Coca-Cola.

   Lancer revolutionized the beverage dispenser industry in 1971 by creating the first mechanically cooled soft drink dispensers. The product caught on and boosted Lancer's sales by the mid-1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lancer went public in 1985. Throughout the 1990s the company expanded its foreign operations and product offerings. In 1996 Lancer formed Lancer FBD Partnership, a joint venture with Jimmy Frank, to make frozen beverage dispensing equipment. The trend continued in 1997 with its acquisition of beverage-dispenser makers Applied Beverage Systems (New Zealand) and Commercial Vila Formosa (Brazil).

  <p>
   In 1998 Burger King signed an agreement to spend at least $10 million on Lancer's frozen beverage dispensers. Sales to Brazil and Asia were nearly halved in 1999, contributing to a $4.6 million loss that fiscal year (the company's first loss in a decade). To strengthen its distribution system, Lancer formed Advanced Beverage Solutions in 2000 to serve customers in the US Midwest. Lancer closed its Brazilian subsidiary in 2002 due to weak sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Lancer was acquired by Hoshizaki America, the US arm of Hoshizaki Electric.
