  <p>
   The consolidated annual revenues of Solocal were down 3.2% in fiscal 2012 compared to the previous year, while its net profit decreased by 17% in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011. The decline was attributed to decreases in revenue from the company's printed directories and other businesses segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's printed directories segment revenues were down by 15% in fiscal 2012 while the other businesses revenues decreased by 25% in during the year due to the sharp decrease in revenues from telephone directory enquiry services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Internet segment's revenues spiked by 8% during fiscal 2012 driven by the search activities on the company's websites and mobile sites.
