   If your heart thumps to the beat of a different drummer, AtriCure will help give you your rhythm back. The medical device maker markets the Synergy Ablation System used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib), a common type of heart arrhythmia. Cardiothoracic surgeons use the AtriCure Synergy Ablation System in conjunction with elective surgical ablation procedures to treat patients through minimally invasive procedures.  AtriCure also sells reusable and disposable cryoablation devices (probes using extreme cold) to ablate cardiac tissue. Additionally, the company offers the AtriClip Gillinov-Cosgrove Left Atrial Appendage System, or AtriClip system, designed to help surgeons exclude the left atrial appendage.

  <p>
   AtriCure's Synergy Ablation System is the only
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved surgical device for the treatment of AFib, and its AtriClip system is the world's largest-selling device designed specifically to occlude the heart's left atrial appendage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other products include the Ablation and Sensing Unit (ASU), which delivers bipolar radio-frequency energy to operate clamps and other devices, and the AtriCure Switch Box (ASB), which provides dual pulsing electrodes in clamps. These items are typically lent out, free of charge, to direct customers, and sold to distributors.
  </p>

  <p>
   Headquartered in Ohio, AtriCure also has offices in Minnesota and California as well as in the Netherlands. The company operates in the US, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   US sales account for 75% of the firm's revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US the company sell its products to medical centers through direct sales in about 45 sales territories. It markets and sells its products in other markets through independent distributors and, in European, Middle Eastern, and African markets, through a European subsidiary which has independent distributors and direct sales staff. AtriCure also sells its products to other international distributors, primarily in Asia, South America, and Canada.
  </p>

  <p>
   Revenue, which has been increasing for the past five years, rose another 31% to $107 million on higher product sales. US sales of the AtriClip system and ablation-related open-heart products grew that year; the company also saw higher sales in Europe and Asia. Products gained from the acquisition of Estech also contributed to the growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the company generates revenues, AtriCure has yet to be profitable as it pursues product development and commercialization activities such as completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals. In 2014, its net loss rose 41% to $16 million due to higher operating costs, including increased research and development expenses. At that year's end, the company's accumulated deficit totaled $138 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow has also been declining and, in 2014, the company's outflow increased 313% to $21 million.

  <p>
   The company focuses on international market expansion and penetration and product portfolio expansion and like many medical device companies, AtriCure seeks FDA approval for multiple uses of its devices. Growth efforts have included launching new products (for example, the cryoFORM cryoablatin probe for use in minimally invasive cardiac surgeries, introduced in 2015), gaining new products through the acquisition of medical device maker Estech, and advancing its clinical trial programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also markets multiple configurations of its Isolator Synergy clamps, thus garnering income from several channels from one product. One design is for ablation during open-heart procedures and one for ablation during minimally invasive procedures. All of AtriCure's clamps are single-use disposables.

  <p>
   AtriCure expanded its product portfolio in 2013 with the $34 million acquisition of Estech, a developer of medical devices and disposables for use in cardiac surgeries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company bought nContact, which makes devices for less-invasive treatment of cardiac ablations, for some $99 million. nContact's devices are used in Convergent procedures, through which ablations are performed in closed-chest surgeries.
