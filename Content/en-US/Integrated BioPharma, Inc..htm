   Integrated BioPharma has taken a bounty of businesses and coalesced them into the cohesive nutraceuticals manufacturer it is today. Through numerous subsidiaries Integrated BioPharma manufactures and distributes  vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products, and natural chemicals. Subsidiaries include AgroLabs (nutritional drinks, vitamins, supplements), Chem International (vitamins), IHT Health Products (natural chemicals), Manhattan Drug Company (vitamins and nutritional supplements sold to distributors, multi-level marketers, and specialized health care providers), and Vitamin Factory (sells private-label Manhattan Drug products online and via mail order catalogue).

   The US accounts for about two-thirds of the company's sales. It also has customers in Canada and Luxembourg.

   Integrated BioPharma, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, and distributes more than 130 nutritional products for sale through major mass market, grocery, drug, and vitamin retailers, mostly in the United States.

   Integrated BioPharma's fiscal 2012 (ends June) sales fell 10% vs. the prior year. The company blamed the decline on the decrease in the volume of nutraceutical product sales to
   <company id="17060">
    Costco Wholesale
   </company>
   , one of its largest customers. The deficit was partially offset by increased sales to
   <company id="136127">
    Herbalife
   </company>
   , its other major client. Integrated BioPharma lost money in fiscal 2012, marking its sixth consecutive year of unprofitability.

        <p>
   The company is highly reliant on two clients for the majority of its sales. Indeed, more than 75% of of Integrated BioPharma's net sales in fiscal 2012 (ends June) came from Costco and Herbalife. The loss of either of those companies as a customer could spell trouble for Integrated BioPharma so it is working to diversify and expand its customer base to become less dependent on any one or two clients for its income. Specifically it seeks to enter the retail grocery market and expand international sales. In order to do that, Integrated BioPharma has repackaged many of its products to take up less shelf space, making them a better fit for grocery store shelves (rather than hulking "club" store shelves).

   Integrated BioPharma relies on outside suppliers for the raw materials used to manufacture its products. Its principal suppliers, Creative Flavor Concepts,

   , and DSM Nutritional Products, furnish Integrated BioPharma with vitamins, minerals, herbs, and organic fruit extracts and juices.
