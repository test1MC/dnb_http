   Varta, once one of the biggest names in the battery market, has lost its buzz. After selling its consumer battery business to Rayovac (now known as
   <company id="41410">
    Spectrum Brands
   </company>
   ), and its automotive battery division to
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   in 2002, Varta in 2006 divested its micro-battery business, VARTA Microbatterie, a subsidiary the company created in 2001. Global Equity Partners Beteiligungs-Management, an Austrian buyout firm, bought VARTA Microbatterie in late 2006. Since 2007, the company has been in the process of selling the assets and equity previously part of the manufacture and sale of the VARTA lineup.

  <p>
   When Adolph Mueller saw the first Accumulator rechargeable power cell, he was so impressed that he and partner Paul Buesche started Buesche and Mueller in 1888 to make industrial batteries in Hagen, Germany. In 1890 Mueller set up Accumulatoren-Fabrik AG (AFA), a joint venture with Siemens and AEG that within 10 years was providing batteries to about 150 power plants. Mueller also introduced the electric automobile to Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   AFA established its first subsidiary in 1904. The name VARTA was an acronym standing for five German words that in English meant Sales, Charging, and Repair of Portable Batteries; it made low-current batteries, such as those used in flashlights. By 1909 AFA had gobbled up 25 smaller competitors in Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. An electric starter for automobiles was invented in 1914, and Varta developed a battery for it that became one of the company's most popular products. By the start of WWI, AFA had subsidiaries in Bohemia, Russia, Spain, and Sweden; however, most of its foreign holdings were confiscated during the war.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1920 Deutsche Edison Akkumulatoren Company (DEAC), an AFA subsidiary, developed a new steel-alkali battery. Then in 1923 AFA got a new majority stockholder: Gunther Quandt, a member of one of Germany's richest and most private families.Mueller died in 1925, the same year that AFA licensed a disposable, dry-cell battery technology (to power the radios that were growing in popularity) from Pertrix Chemische Fabrik GmbH; AFA bought the company the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Great Depression, coupled with the development of alternating current adapters for radios, played havoc with AFA's bottom line. But the company developed new batteries (DEAC's airtight alkali battery and a standard-size starter battery) and applications (airplane take-offs), and the market for portable radios and other small battery-powered devices began to grow. AFA factories were turned over to war production when WWII began, and most were either bombed or confiscated. AFA rebuilt and modernized its plants after the war.
  </p>
  <p>
   AFA began using the Varta name on all its batteries in the early 1960s and it changed its name to Varta AG in 1962. It became a holding company in 1973 and was divided in 1977 into three public companies: Varta (batteries), Altana (food and pharmaceuticals), and CEAG (air filters, pollution-control equipment).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company thrived as more and more battery-powered products arrived on the scene. But the mid-1990s saw Varta's fortunes failing -- in part due to increased competition and also because of higher lead prices. After three years of negative net income, the company made a profit in 1997. In 1999 it began a pilot production program of its ultra-thin lithium-polymer batteries for SmartCards, and in 2000 the company became part of a four-year program with DaimlerChrysler and others to develop an all-electric hybrid vehicle.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2000, DB Investor, Deutsche Bank's industrial and private equity holding company, bought almost 90% of Varta. (Until then, three children from deceased German industrialist Herbert Quandt's second marriage had owned a controlling interest in the firm.) In 2001 the company spun off its micro-battery business into a new subsidiary, VARTA Microbatterie GmbH. Varta sold its automotive battery division to

    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   in 2002.
   <company id="41410">
    Spectrum Brands
   </company>
   (formerly Rayovac) acquired the company's portable battery business the same year. Varta then began concentrating its business focus on Microbatterie.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Varta sold VARTA Microbatterie to Global Equity Partners Beteiligungs-Management, divesting its only operating unit.
