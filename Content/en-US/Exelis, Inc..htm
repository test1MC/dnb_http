   Exelis excels when it comes to high-tech modern weaponry. The company manufactures products for integrated electronic warfare, sensing and surveillance, air traffic management, information and cyber security, and networked communications. It also focuses on composite aerostructures, logistics, and technical services. Exelis generates most of its business from the US government, particularly the
   <company id="105717">
    Department of Defense
   </company>
   (about 60% of sales), the
   <company id="103845">
    FAA
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   . The company also serves commercial clients, with international customers comprising about 10% of sales. In 2015 Exelis was acquired by communications products maker

    Harris Corporation
   </company>
   .

   In 2015 Exelis was acquired by communications products maker
   <company id="10709">
    Harris Corporation
   </company>
   in a deal worth $4.7 billion. The deal will beef up Harris' presence in the government sector and would create a combined company with more than $8 billion in sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is organized into two reported segments: Information &amp; Technical Services (I&amp;TS) and Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Electronics &amp; Systems. The former, which accounts for 56% of revenue, provides logistics, infrastructure, and sustainment support, as well as a diverse set of technical services. The latter segment, also known as just C4ISR, generates 44% of revenue by making and marketing engineered electronic systems and equipment, such as force protection, electronic warfare systems, reconnaissance and surveillance systems, and integrated structures.
  </p>
  <p>
   C4ISR products include electronic systems (communications and force protection), geospatial systems (night vision and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), information systems communications, imaging and image-processing, radar and sonar systems, and space systems. Contracts won in this space have included satellite imagers for
   <company id="53072">

   and
   <company id="139140">
    GeoEye's

   Enhanced View.
  </p>
  <p>
   I&amp;TS provides systems integration, network design and development, cyber intelligence, advanced engineering, logistics, space launch, and range-support services for the US military and other government agencies. One contract with the US Air Force has Exelis providing self-encrypting solid state computer hard drives.

  <p>
   Exelis operates its business through nearly 130 locations across a dozen countries situated on four continents. (Some 4.3 million sq. ft. of its overall 6.6 million sq. ft. represents leased facilities.) The company, which generates about 90% of its revenue in the US, boasts several significant locations in half a dozen states: California, Colorado, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Utah, and Virginia.

  <p>
   Exelis relies on a handful of large customers for most of its revenue. The US military accounts for about 60% of sales, while NASA, the FAA, and other intelligence agencies make up another 25%.

  <p>
   Exelis is spinning off its Mission Systems division in a new company to be named Vectrus. About 7,000 people will join the pure-play military and government services company, which will provide infrastructure asset management, logistics and supply chain management, and IT and network communication services. The divestiture allows Exelis to focus on its four strategic growth platforms: critical networks, ISR &amp; analytics, electronic warfare, and aerostructures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Exelis aims to boost its market share -- organically for the most part -- while expanding into adjacent markets and penetrating markets outside its primary Department of Defense customer set. To balance its US-heavy sales mix, Exelis is working to grow its business overseas. In commercial markets, the company is pursuing extensions of existing technologies, looking to further cater to air traffic management data for commercial air carriers and composite structures for commercial aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Exelis is pursuing adjacent markets to use its military technology in health care. The company signed a long-term supply agreement in 2014 with NIRF Imaging to adapt components of its night vision goggles for use in NIRF Imaging's proprietary medical imaging technology.

  <p>
   The company has made a few small acquisitions to expand its product offerings. In 2013 it bought Australia-based C4i Pty. Ltd. for $16 million. The prior year it bought UK-based Applied Kilovolts and US-based Space Computer Corporation for a combined $43 million.
