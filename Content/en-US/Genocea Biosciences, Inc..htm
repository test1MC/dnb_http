   Genocea Biosciences seeks a panacea for human infection. It does this using its proprietary ATLAS technology that acts through T cells to target infectious diseases. The company's lead candidates treat herpes and prevent pneumococcus (causes pneumonia, sepsis, middle ear infection, and bacterial meningitis), respectively. Other prophylactics take aim at chlamydia and malaria. Genocea believes its T-cell methodology allows it to develop vaccines more quickly than the traditional method, which uses B cells, or antibodies. It also thinks certain infections respond better to T cell treatments, which operate at the cellular level. The development-stage pharmaceutical company was formed in 2006 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company plans to use its $66 million in IPO proceeds to fund R&amp;D for all candidates and to begin setting up manufacturing for its lead, the herpes treatment GEN-003.

  <p>
   As a development stage company, Genocea has only had grant revenue, which is spends on R&amp;D. The company has operated at a loss every year since its inception and anticipates that will continue for the foreseeable future. At the end of 2013, it reported a $74 million accumulated deficit.

  <p>
   Going forward, Genocea plans to continue working on commercializing its vaccines. While it owns the worldwide rights to herpes treatment GEN-003 and pneumococcus prophylactic GEN-004, for herpes and malaria, it is seeking development partners for its next candidates for its chlamydia and malaria preventative vaccines.
