   Even among media titans, this company is a giant. Time Warner is one of the world's largest media conglomerates behind
   <company id="11603">
    Walt Disney
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   , with operations spanning television and film. Through subsidiary
   <company id="12404">
    Turner Broadcasting
   </company>
   , the company runs a portfolio of cable TV networks including
   <company id="104096">
    CNN

   <company id="139422">
    TBS
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="138788">

   </company>
   . Time Warner also operates pay-TV channels
   <company id="104038">
    HBO
   </company>
   and Cinemax. Its
   <company id="103206">
    Warner Bros. Entertainment

   , meanwhile, includes film studios (Warner Bros. Pictures,
   <company id="104059">
    New Line Cinema
   </company>
   ), TV production units (
   <company id="141162">
    Warner Bros. Television Group
   </company>
   ), and comic book publisher
   <company id="104322">
    DC Entertainment
   </company>
   . In 2016, Time Warner agreed to be bought by
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T Inc.
   </company>
   for $85 billion.

  <p>
   The company divides its business into three reportable segments: Turner, Home Box Office, and Warner Bros. Turner consists of cable networks and digital media properties. It accounted for 36% of revenue in fiscal 2015. Home Box Office consists of premium pay television and streaming services domestically and premium pay, basic tier television, and streaming services internationally. That segment accounted for 19% of revenue in fiscal 2015. The company's Warner Bros. segment consists of television, feature film, home video, and video game production and distribution. The Warner Bros. segment accounted about 45% of revenue in fiscal 2015.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Time Warner's content and brands have a truly global reach. However, in fiscal 2015 almost 75% of the company's revenue came from the US and Canada.

  <p>
   While the company's various media holdings earn millions through advertising sales, Time Warner itself spent $2.5 billion on advertising in fiscal 2015.

  <p>
   Time Warner's revenue was $28.1 billion in fiscal 2015. That was an increase of $759 million (or 3%) compared to the company's revenue the prior fiscal year. The primary reason for the spike was increased sales from its Warner Bros. segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income was $3.8 billion in fiscal 2015. That was an increase of $6 million compared to its fiscal 2014 net income. The increase in net income was largely the result of the Time Warner's increased revenue during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior fiscal period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time Warner ended fiscal 2015 with $3.8 billion in cash flow from operations, which was an increase of $170 million (or %5) compared to fiscal 2014.

  <p>
   Time Warner is greater than the sum total of its parts. Like other media conglomerates, the company focuses on maximizing the profit potential of its original content by distributing that material through multiple channels. For example, a film produced by Warner Bros. can be shown in theaters, aired for subscribers on HBO, and then aired again on one of its advertising-supported cable outlets. The company also uses its vast array of media outlets to cross-promote its movies, TV shows, and magazines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Networks segment has adopted a successful programming strategy: TBS has positioned itself as a popular outlet for sitcoms and other comedy programming and TNT has focused largely on airing dramatic movies and TV shows.
  </p>
  <p>
   Back in 2015 Time Warner spun off its Publishing unit (
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc.
   </company>
   ) that had been struggling with the challenging environment of declining print readership.

  <p>
   Though formed in 2001, AOL Time Warner was the result of decades of advancement in the media industry. An elder statesman compared to relative newcomer America Online, Time Warner's roots extend back to 1922 -- the year that Henry Luce and Briton Hadden founded publisher Time Inc., and brothers Harry, Abe, Jack, and Sam Warner established the origins of Warner Bros., which later became Warner Communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   America Online's ancestry stretches back to the early 1980s when Stephen Case joined the management of a company called Control Video. Later renamed Quantum Computer Services, the company created the online service that would become America Online in 1985. Quantum Computer Services changed its name to America Online in 1991. It went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   As America Online was germinating, Time Inc. and Warner Communications were eyeing each other. The two companies merged in 1990 to form Time Warner. Gerald Levin was appointed CEO in 1992. To shave off debt, Time Warner grouped several of its properties into Time Warner Entertainment in 1992, in which U S West (which later became
   <company id="47905">
    MediaOne Group
   </company>
   ) bought a 25% interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time Warner's 1996 acquisition of Ted Turner's
   <company id="12404">
    Turner Broadcasting System
   </company>
   further elevated Time Warner's profile on the media stage. For America Online, 1996 marked the first year the company began charging its subscribers a flat rate, vastly increasing the amount of time they spent online.
  </p>
  <p>
   America Online grew through acquisitions of
   <company id="43062">
    CompuServe
   </company>
   in 1998 and
   <company id="42472">
    Netscape Communications
   </company>
   in 1999. Meanwhile, Time Warner had created
   <company id="56589">
    Time Warner Telecom
   </company>
   and taken it public. After AT&amp;T's announcement that it would acquire MediaOne, MediaOne gave up its 50% management control of Time Warner Entertainment but retained its 25% ownership interest. AT&amp;T's acquisition of MediaOne was completed in 2000, thus giving AT&amp;T 25% of Time Warner Entertainment. (AT&amp;T later boosted its stake to 27%.)
  </p>
  <p>
   America Online announced that it would acquire Time Warner in early 2000. To please European regulators, Time Warner subsequently abandoned its plans to combine the Warner Music Group with
   <company id="41769">
    EMI Group
   </company>
   's music operations. After a lengthy review by regulatory bodies, America Online acquired Time Warner for $106 billion and formed AOL Time Warner in 2001. Case became chairman, and Levin was appointed CEO. The newly formed company soon began streamlining, cutting more than 2,400 jobs in the process. (It cut another 1,700 jobs at America Online later that year.) Also that year America Online invested about $100 million in
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Levin retired from the company in 2002 and was replaced by co-COO Richard Parsons. The following year AOL Time Warner finally succeeded in buying
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   's stake in Time Warner Entertainment (Comcast gained its share of TWE when it bought the cable assets of AT&amp;T in 2002). The following year Case and Turner both resigned their executive positions with the company, but remained on the board of directors. (Case left the board in 2005.) And in a move to distance itself from the struggling online unit, the company dropped AOL from its moniker and returned to being known as Time Warner Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Time Warner started off 2004 by ridding itself of
   <company id="103153">
    Warner Music Group
   </company>
   , which it sold for $2.6 billion to a group led by former Seagram executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and investment firm
   <company id="40463">
    Thomas H. Lee Partners
   </company>
   . It also sold the NBA's
   <company id="157341">
    <company id="46839">
     Atlanta Hawks
    </company>
   </company>
   and the NHL's
   <company id="59932">
    Atlanta Thrashers
   </company>
   for $250 million to a private investment group called
   <company id="46839">
    Atlanta Spirit
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's flagship Internet service officially shortened its name to simply
   <company id="15558">
    AOL
   </company>
   in early 2006. Also that year, Time Warner sold its book publishing unit, Time Warner Book Group, to French media firm
   <company id="41009">
    Lagardère
   </company>
   .
   <company id="103276">
    Time Warner Cable
   </company>
   joined with Comcast to acquire
   <company id="15879">
    Adelphia Communications
   </company>
   for $17.6 billion in cash and stock; as part of the deal, Adelphia shareholders sold part of their newly acquired stake in TWC through an IPO in 2007. Later that year, Time Warner sold its
   <company id="46721">
    Atlanta Braves
   </company>
   baseball team (once owned by former vice chairman Ted Turner) to
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   in a deal that valued the team at $460 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parsons retired as CEO at the beginning of 2008 and was replaced by Jeffrey Bewkes, who previously oversaw the company's entertainment divisions. Bewkes replaced Parsons as Time Warner chairman as well at the end of that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Never able to achieve significant synergies between the online media and traditional film and TV content arms despite several restructuring attempts, Time Warner was burdened with debt and suffering losses. This ultimately led the company to spin off AOL as a separate, publicly traded company in 2009. The separation valued AOL at less than $3 billion, far less than the $124 billion valuation of the original AOL-Time Warner merger. In another high-profile disposal during 2009, Time Warner spun off its remaining stake in Time Warner Cable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company's Filmed Entertainment unit released the final film in the immensely popular Harry Potter series.
   <em>
    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
   </em>
   was the year's top film in terms of ticket sales, pulling in a colossal $1.3 billion in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Time Warner spun off its print publishing operations. In 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   .
