   Since its inception in 1740, Whatman knows what it takes to separate the wheat from the chaff. The UK-based company makes filters, membranes, and specialty products for applications in the analytical, health care, and bioscience markets in some 70 countries. The company's products can be found in medical devices and diagnostic testing kits. Whatman has also developed technology for the isolation, transportation, storage, and purification of DNA for gathering genetic information. Whatman makes other products such as blotting papers, syringe filters, and chromatography products. The company is part of

   GE Healthcare is investing in the future by moving manufacture of its Whatman products from Maidstone (UK) to GE Healthcare sites in Tonglu, Cardiff, and Lindesnes, where it is improving manufacturing technologies and in-process control measures.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Founded in 1740 in Maidstone, Kent, by paper maker James Whatman the Elder, Whatman PLC was acquired by GE Healthcare in 2008.

  <p>
   Whatman began as a small paper mill in the English countryside of Kent, established by James Whatman in 1740. Upon marrying Ann Harris that year, James took over the operations of the newly built paper mill (Turkey Mill) Harris had inherited from her late husband Richard Harris. By 1753 Whatman was exporting his paper to America. In 1759 James Whatman died and his wife ran the business for the next four years till their only son, James II, assumed leadership of Turkey Mill. James II mentored William Balston, who took over the mill when James II suffered a stroke in 1790. Four years later James II sold the business to two men with whom Balston partnered until 1805, when he set up his own paper mill at Springfield. By 1835 that mill employed more than 100 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Balston turned the mill over to his sons, William and Richard, who continued to expand the company. In 1861 the firm, named W&amp;R Balston, employed 250 people. The following year a fire destroyed most of the mill, but the brothers rebuilt the facilities within three months. It was Richard Balston who led the company into the 20th century. As WWI approached, it was asked by the British government to produce filter papers needed for the production of weapons. The company, which sold its products under both the Whatman and Balston names, soon begun to concentrate on filter papers rather than its traditional line of fine papers.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the slump of the 1930s, the company cut its production to a three-day workweek for five years and continued to concentrate on filter-paper products. Its customers included laboratories, hospitals, and schools. In 1944 Whatman No.1 filter paper was used by scientists in research that led to Nobel Prize-winning work in paper partition chromatography and a significant advance in medical research. Beginning in 1957, the company began to phase out production of handmade paper and started to expand its filter product line to include products that met the technical demands of its customers. By 1968 the company's filters were being used in laboratories in almost every country in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   W&amp;R Balston emerged into more markets when it merged with fellow filtration-materials company Reeve Angel International in 1974. Reeve Angel had served as Balston's sales representative in North America for more than 50 years before the merger. The new company regained the Whatman name, and Whatman Reeve Angel was soon traded publicly on the London Stock Exchange. It continued to prosper and grow throughout the 1980s, and in 1984 it experienced significant expansion, including the creation of marketing subsidiaries in Singapore and France, increased capacity of production in the UK and the US, and the introduction of mail-order catalogs in the UK and the US. The company was reorganized in 1990 to better accommodate its growing business, and its name was shortened to Whatman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expansion continued throughout the 1990s. Acquisitions included the filter membrane business of Belgium-based Cyclopore in 1993 and a 55% stake in US-based Polyfiltronics (analytical devices) in 1996. (Whatman purchased the remaining 45% of Polyfiltronics the next year.) In 1999 Whatman announced that it had developed a procedure to isolate and store DNA.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its industrial-filtration business (filtration products for plant machinery) to
   <company id="11156">
    Parker Hannifin
   </company>
   in 2000 and announced that it would start focusing on expanding its bioscience business, which centers on DNA purification technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 Whatman acquired HemaSure, a US-based blood filtration company; it also expanded its health care operations with two acquisitions. To cut costs and improve efficiencies, restructuring measures were taken, including the plan to cut the number of manufacturing sites by half. Chief executive David Smith resigned that year, and COO Tim Coombs was appointed to fill the position. The next year deputy chairman Simon May was appointed chairman upon the retirement of Andrew Smithers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whatman's management was once again reorganized in 2002. Tim Coombs resigned and Simon May stepped back into the position of deputy chairman to make way for Whatman's new chairman Bob Thian.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003, the company sold its HemaSure operations to
   <company id="12221">
    Pall

   . That same year Howard Kelly, previously VP and general manager of Intercontinental, Asia, and Japan for
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   's BioScience Division, became chief executive. He resigned in 2005 and was soon replaced by Bill Emhiser, formerly president of North American Operations for Proteome Systems. The company later sold its Fitzco business unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Whatman sold its GenXTrak DNA extraction business to
   <company id="121034">
    Tepnel Life Sciences
   </company>
   . (Tepnel later became part of
   <company id="106189">
    Gen-Probe
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008
   <company id="43439">
    GE Healthcare
   </company>
   purchased Whatman for $713 million in order to bolster its life sciences offerings. Following the purchase, Whatman's name was changed from Whatman plc to Whatman Limited, and the company began operating as a subsidiary of GE Healthcare.
