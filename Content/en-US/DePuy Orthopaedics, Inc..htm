   The knees have it -- and the shoulders, elbows, hips, wrists, and ankles too. DePuy Orthopaedics, a subsidiary of
   <company id="47954">
    DePuy
   </company>
   (itself part of
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , or J&amp;J), is one of the largest designers, makers, and distributors of orthopedic devices and supplies. In addition to replacement joints, its 200-plus products includes the Ci system, which includes computer hardware and software needed to assist surgeons in such procedures as full knee replacement surgery and ligament balancing. DePuy Orthopaedics was founded in 1895 by Revra DePuy. One of J&amp;J's fastest-growing businesses, the company continues to innovate and expand through research and development efforts, as well as through acquisitions.

   DePuy Orthopedics works to regularly roll out new products. Indeed, in 2013 the company received pre-market supplement approval from the
   <company id="144161">
    US Food and Drug Administration
   </company>
   for its DePuy CREAMAX Total Hip System. The parent company in 2013 also launched technologies for the ATTUNE Knee System, the ATTUNE Rotating Platform Knee, and the Anatomic Patella.
  </p>
  <p>
   R&amp;D programs have also produced new, innovative products within the division. In 2011 the firm received FDA approval for its ALPS foot and AFFIXUS hip fracture surgery systems. It also launched an instrumentation system for use with its Global Advantage shoulder replacement implants.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company discontinued making all metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-metal hip implants.
  </p>

   DePuy Orthopedics has faced some legal and financial difficulties over the 2010 recall of its ASR hip replacement systems. As part of the recall, which was announced after studies were released showing a high rate of patient pain and secondary surgery, the company promised to cover the expenses of patient monitoring, as well as any surgery to remove and replace the recalled devices. Some patients have filed injury suits against DePuy Orthopaedics as a result of the recall.

   The division aims to expand greatly through its parent's purchase of Swiss orthopedics firm
   <company id="136313">
    Synthes
   </company>
   for some $21.3 billion in 2012. The deal potentially boosts DePuy into the top spot in the global orthopedics industry, adding products including plates and bolts for bone trauma repair and surgical power tools. In a related transaction, in 2012 orthopedics firm
   <company id="12777">
    Biomet
   </company>
   paid $280 million for DePuy Orthopaedics' trauma operations, which included screws, nails, plates, and other fixation devices. The asset sale helped to clear up any potential anti-competitive market overlaps related to J&amp;J's purchase of Synthes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the firm acquired Finsbury Orthopaedics, a UK maker of hip, knee, and ankle implant devices. Historical purchases include the 2006 purchase of Hand Innovations, a manufacturer of implants used to treat distal radius (wrist) fractures and other upper extremity injuries, which solidified DePuy Orthopaedics' presence in the upper extremities market.
