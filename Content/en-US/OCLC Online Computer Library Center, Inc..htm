   Working to reduce the cost of information, OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a membership cooperative that provides access to the world's information. The group offers services and tools to some 74,000 member libraries in about 170 countries. Services include computer-based cataloging, preservation, and library management. OCLC additionally facilitates interlibrary loan services, administers the Dewey Decimal Classification system, and operates the WorldCat database, an online resource for finding library materials. OCLC was founded in 1967 by presidents of the colleges and universities in Ohio. OCLC, which stands for Ohio College Library Center, opened its first location in

   's main library.

  <p>
   OCLC operates in about 170 countries across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The organization generates some 77% of its revenue from the Americas. The remainder comes from outside the US.

  <p>
   OCLC's revenue increased by 2% in fiscal 2013 compared to the previous year. The company claimed $206.6 million in revenue for 2013 after reporting $203.4 million in 2012. The revenue growth was due to increased adoption of new services and a modest price increase.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from libraries and institutions outside of the US increased by $1.4 million to $54.8 million in fiscal 2013. The spike was primarily due to increased revenues from Bibliotheca in Germany.

  <p>
   As part of its operations, OCLC regularly maintains and enhances its existing services, such as Connexion, QuestionPoint, CONTENTdm, EZproxy, and WorldCat, through heavy investing activities. The company provides more than 5,000 libraries in Africa, Australia, and Europe with integrated library management systems and works to release regular enhancements. The systems include Amlib, Bibliotheca, CBS, LBS, OLIB, SunRise, and TouchPoint.
  </p>

   OCLC also concentrates on expanding its capabilities with the addition of data centers. To this end, it opened a new data center in Toronto in 2012 as part of a plan to operate local and global systems at Webscale service levels. The Toronto location is OCLC's fifth globally and allows the group to deliver its namesake WorldShare Management Services to member libraries in Canada. Soon after, OCLC opened additional data centers in London and in Sydney, Australia. It already has a pair of primary operations data centers in the US. In 2013 another data center came online in Europe.
