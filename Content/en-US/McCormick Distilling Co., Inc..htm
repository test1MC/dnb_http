   McCormick Distilling is best known for its imported Tequila Rose, a strawberry-flavored liqueur, used as a mixer with tequila. The company also makes and imports a variety of other distilled spirits, including vodka, gin, rum, bourbon, and whiskey. It also makes ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages like the scarily named Tarantula margaritas. McCormick operates a tasting room and gift shop at its headquarters in its hometown of Weston, Missouri. The company, which was founded in 1856, touts its distillery as the oldest, continuously operated distillery in the US.

   To grow its business, McCormick Distilling in 2015 expanded its portfolio of premium spirits with the acquisition of London-based Broker's Gin Ltd. With the addition of Broker's Gin, the deal elevated its presence within the premium gin market.

   In addition to acquisitions, the company also opened a new distillery in April 2016.
