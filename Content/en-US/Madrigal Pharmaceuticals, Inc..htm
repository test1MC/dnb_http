   Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is focused on developing novel small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular-metabolic diseases and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NASH). Its lead candidate is MGL-3196, an oral drug for the treatment of NASH and hypercholesterolemia. Looking to enter new areas of development, Synta Pharmaceuticals merged with private firm Madrigal in 2016 and took the latter's name. Prior to the merger, Synta's preclinical research efforts included potential therapies for autoimmune diseases, transplant acceptance, respiratory conditions, and cancerous tumors. In late 2015 it terminated trials for its then-lead program, oncology candidate ganetespib.

  <p>
   Madrigal's ganetespib candidate was being evaluated for the treatment of about a dozen forms of cancer (including NSCLC, breast, and rectal) and, as such, was the company's lead contender for reaching commercialization. However, in 2015 the company terminated its GALAXY-2 trial of ganetespib and cut much of its R&amp;D activities related to the compound. The trial was stopped after its independent monitoring committee concluded that ganetespib was unlikely to demonstrate any improvement in the likelihood for survival.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has no manufacturing facilities and relies upon contract manufacturing organizations to produce its supplies for clinical trials.

  <p>
   As a development-stage firm, Madrigal has yet to turn a profit and doesn't expect to do so until it completes trials on (and gains

   approval to market) one of its candidates. Thus far, nearly all of the company's revenues have been derived from collaboration fees; it has also earned a few grants to fund its research from the likes of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company has made no revenue since 2012. Since it was founded, Madrigal has incurred losses as it spends money for R&amp;D activities. In 2015 its net loss dropped 20% to $68.7 million, due largely to the early termination of the GALAXY-2 trial for ganetespib late that year. As of the end of the year, the company had an accumulated deficit of $706.2 million.

  <p>
   Also in 2015, operating cash outflow totaled $71.4 million (versus $78.9 million in 2014).

  <p>
   To help fund its development efforts, the company pursues strategic collaboration and licensing agreements with other drug makers. Madrigal may enter other favorable partnerships on select development programs, though it also plans to pursue commercialization of some candidates on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Synta Pharmaceuticals merged with Madrigal Pharmaceuticals in mid-2016, the combined firm agreed to sell off the rights to its cancer platform, including the HSP90 drug conjugate program, to Tarveda Therapeutics.
