   Simple staples are the secret to Gruma's success. The company is the world's #1 maker of corn flour and tortillas, marketed under name brands Maseca corn flour, and Mission and Guerrero tortillas. US subsidiary,
   <company id="113985">
    Gruma Corporation
   </company>
   produces tortillas and tortilla chips, and corn flour for US and European grocery stores, restaurants, and institutions.
   <company id="51120">
    Grupo Industrial Maseca
   </company>
   (GIMSA), Gruma's publicly traded Mexican subsidiary, produces more than 50 varieties of corn flour for the country's food manufacturers, including tortilla and tortilla chip producers, and, less so, packaged corn flour for retail customers. More than 60% of revenue comes from the US and Europe. Gruma was founded in 1949.

  <p>
   In the US and Europe, Gruma sells corn flour and packaged wheat and corn tortillas, which should have a higher margin than flour. In Mexico, the company produces, distributes, and sells corn under MASECA brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The holding company's US subsidiary, Azteca Milling is based in Texas and produces corn flour.

  <p>
   In just a few years, Gruma's sales to the combined US-Europe market has grown to 62%, up from 40%. Mexico and Central American combine to supply 34% of the company's revenue. Revenue from the Asia/Pacific region account for 4% of revenue after a 16% increase in 2015.

  <p>
   Gruma's tortillas might be flat, but sales are anything but. Revenue increased 17% in 2015, propelled by a 23% rise in sales in the US and Europe. Sales were higher in all of its markets for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, however, plunged to a net loss thanks to losses stemming from discontinued operations. The company wrote off losses investments related to MONACA and DEMASECA as well as receivables Venezuelan companies owned Gruma subsidiaries. (Gruma left Venezuela in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations decreased in 2015 from 2014.

  <p>
   Gruma is focusing on its core business: corn flour, tortillas, and wheat flour production. It's also looking to expand its product portfolio to flatbreads. The company is riding the wave of increasing popularity of Mexican food and, more importantly, tortillas, in the US, Europe, Asia, and Oceania markets. Specifically, it's looking to expand in the retail and food service tortilla markets, to take advantage of significant opportunities for growth in the US. Gruma is also focusing on maintaining its Mission and Guerrero tortilla brands as the #1 and #2 brands in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond the US, the company is pursuing opportunities in Europe, as well as the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania, where its wraps and flatbreads are increasingly used in recipes other than Mexican food.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Gruma sold its wheat flour operations in Mexico to Grupo Trimex.

   To gain greater access into the European food market, in 2004 Gruma acquired Nuova De Franceschi &amp; Figli, a corn-flour plant in Italy and Ovis Boske, a tortilla plant in Holland. The company also purchased three US tortilla plants from

   (CHS). With an eye to other regions, it has purchased two Australian tortilla plants, Rositas Investments and Oz-Mex Foods, and a UK tortilla-, pita-, chapatti-, and naan-maker, Pride Valley Foods. Pursuing markets in Asia and Oceana, in 2007 it opened its first tortilla plant in the region, located in Shanghai.
