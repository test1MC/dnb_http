   Euramax Holdings is into metal and vinyl, but it's not involved in the music industry. Operating through Euramax International and other subsidiaries, Euramax produces metal fabricated products used in residential repair and remodeling, commercial construction, and RV markets in North America and Europe. Core lines include preformed drainage systems for roofs, metal roofing and siding, roll-coated aluminum, and aluminum siding for RVs. Most of Euramax's products are fabricated from aluminum, but the company also manufactures materials out of vinyl, steel, and copper. Customers include contractors and home improvement retailers, distributors, and RV OEMs.

  <p>
   Euramax is headquartered in Norcross, Georgia. It operates through around 30 facilities in the US, one in Canada, and seven in Europe. The company generates nearly 70% of its total sales from North America. The Netherlands generates almost 20%, while the UK, France, and Canada account for the remainder.

  <p>
   Euramax divides its operations across four segments: US Residential Products (35%), US Commercial Products (34% of total sales), European Roll Coated Aluminum (23%), and European Engineered Products (8%).

  <p>
   After declining 10% the previous year, the company's net sales fell 1% from 2012 to 2013 due low consumer confidence and economic uncertainty negatively impacted the RV and transportation markets. The US Commercial Products segment was also negatively affected by continuing economic uncertainty in the commercial construction markets combined with excessive snow fall and extreme weather conditions throughout many of its core sales markets during the year. Additionally, sales volumes of specialty coated steel and aluminum coils declined in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Euramax suffered a net loss of almost $25 million in 2013, after posting a net loss of $37 million in 2012. Each year the company faces high costs and expenses associated with running its business, including large selling and general expenses and around $55 million paid on its interest amount. It had a total long-term debt load of around $535 million by the end of 2013.

  <p>
   The company uses acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2012 Euramax acquired Cleveland Tubing, a maker of corrugated plastic parts and drainage products, for nearly $6 million. The deal beefed up Euramax's expertise in its US Residential Products segment.
