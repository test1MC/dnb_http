   Lumileds is a leader in LEDs. Formerly Philips Lumileds Lighting, the company designs and produces LED core materials and packaging that are integrated into general lighting products. Its red, amber, blue, green, and white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), including its high-brightness LUXEON line, are used in indoor and outdoor lighting, LCD displays, traffic signals, automotive lighting, and camera flashes. LUXEON LEDs are designed to match the brightness of other light sources such as incandescent, halogen, and fluorescent bulbs, but are smaller, last longer, and draw less power.

  <p>
   Lumileds makes LEDs for four markets. For illumination the company makes spotlights, downlights, high bay and low bay lighting, indoor area lighting, architectural and specialty lighting as well as retrofit lamps. For the automotive market Lumileds supplies lighting for OEMs and aftermarket use. The company claims 50% of autos in Europe and a third around the world are equipped with its lighting. Flash LEDs made by Lumileds go into smartphones and tablets to get better photographic images. Lumileds also offers its LUXEON LEDs for the display market including HD, FHD, and UHD.

  <p>
   Lumileds sells products worldwide directly and through distributor Future Lighting Solutions, which also provides engineering support services for companies developing solid-state lighting systems around LUXEON components. Lumileds established a research and development facility in China to improve its ability to develop products with Chinese manufacturers, marking a significant R&amp;D investment by Philips in its LED business; Future Lighting Solutions also stepped up its marketing efforts in China that year.
