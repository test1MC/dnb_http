   Starkey Laboratories, dba Starkey Hearing Technologies, is a leading US maker of digital, wireless, and invisible hearing aids and other hearing devices for adults and children. Its hearing aid lines offer improved filtering and response technology (including BluWave signal processing) to eliminate whistling and background noise interference. Starkey also makes hearing protection devices for industrial workers, swimmers, hunters, and musicians; hands-free communication and mobile headsets; and audio monitors and music headphones. CEO and owner William "Bill" Austin started the company in 1967.

  <p>
   The company's major brands include Audibel, NuEar, MicroTech, and Starkey. Starkey has launched a number of innovative products throughout its history, including the X Series line of digital hearing aids and its AMP device, an invisible hearing aid for people who aren't quite ready for hearing aids. The company's Wi Series advanced wireless hearing aids enable wearers to stream stereo sound directly from their TVs or radios to their hearing aids without any body-worn relay devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company conducts research in auditory perceptual science and signal processing technology through its California-based Starkey Hearing Research Center (SHRC). SHRC employs more than 300 interdisciplinary scientists and engineers who develop products and carry out hearing-related medical research in collaboration with the

   Starkey markets its products through its own sales force as well as online and through independent dealers including audiologists. As of yet it hasn't gone the retail route -- selling through big-box stores or even

   , the fastest-growing distribution channel for hearing aids -- as it believes its future lies in the growth of small stores.

   The company provides its hearing devices to some US military branches, including veterans.

   On its mission to provide newer and improved products, Starkey introduced new offerings in 2015 that included the Z Series of wireless products featuring next-generation technology. In 2016, the company launched its made-for-iPhone hearing aid Halo 2, as well as the Muse family of hearing aids and the SoundLens Synergy invisible hearing aid.

   Other innovations over the past several years have included the Xino Tinnitus device for patients with ear ringing difficulties, and Starkey Pediatrics, which offers

   In 2016 Starkey formed a partnership with technology startup Bragi, which had recently introduced the world's first wireless hearable. Together, the companies aim to revolutionize the hearing aid industry with new technologies.

  <p>
   The company began as a hearing instrument repair business called Professional Hearing Aid Service. In 1971 Austin bought Starkey Laboratories, which at the time was a small earmold company, and merged his business under the Starkey Laboratories name. In 2012 the company adopted the name Starkey Hearing Technologies to identify the business with the hearing products and services it provides.
