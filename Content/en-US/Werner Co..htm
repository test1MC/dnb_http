   If your reach exceeds your grasp, perhaps you should buy a Werner. The company is one of the world's top producers of ladders. For the do-it-yourselfer, Werner makes extension, step, attic, and platform ladders made of wood, fiberglass, or aluminum. In addition to traditional ladders, Werner manufactures a full line of professional-grade platforms, scaffolding, stages, climbing equipment, and ladder jacks and accessories. Its brand portfolio includes namesake Werner, Knaak, Weather Guard, Green Bull, Keller, and Abru, in addition to other licensed names. Founded in 1922 by Richard Werner, the company is owned by a trio of investment firms.

   While Werner is headquartered in Pennsylvania and operates divisions in Illinois and Kentucky, its ladder business extends worldwide. It has manufacturing, distribution, and sales operations in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, and the UK. Werner turns out most of its products for the Mexican market at its expansive facilities in Juarez, the world's largest ladder factory. It also takes 18 warehouses located from California to Florida to Connecticut to keep products close to customers.

   To climb to the top of the ladder industry, Werner is expanding its product line to the professional sector and extending its business beyond the US. In 2013 the company entered the Canadian market and launched a multicultural initiative, including websites in Spanish, French. and Chinese, to reach professional contractors and consumers worldwide, including the many Hispanics working in the US construction sector. Werner also makes acquisitions to build its business.

   In September 2012 Werner acquired Illinois-based Knaak -- with its Knaak and Weather Guard brands -- from
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson's
   </company>
   Commercial and Residential Solutions business. The deal gave Werner a leg up in jobsite storage equipment, such as rolling workbenches, storage chests, workstations, hand tool boxes. Weather Guard products include truck and van equipment the likes of shelving and cabinets and racks for full-size and compact pickups, vans, and utility vehicles. Previously, in 2010 Werner purchased Abru, a top-rung ladder manufacturer based in England. Abru also makes heavy-duty platforms, scaffolding, and rotary clotheslines, and its products are sold by major building supply retailers in the UK (including
   <company id="116281">
    B&amp;Q
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103286">
    Homebase
   </company>
   ). As part of the deal, Abru continued to operate from its headquarters and factory in England. The two companies are focused on strengthening Abru's brand in the UK and extending its reach throughout Europe, which in turn helps to expand the influence of Werner's business.
