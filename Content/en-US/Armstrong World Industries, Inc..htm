   Look up! You just might see an Armstrong product. Armstrong World Industries, operating as Armstrong Ceilings, designs and manufactures ceilings, wall systems, and suspension systems for residential and commercial spaces. Its products include fiberglass ceilings, wood ceilings, and metal ceilings, as well as ceiling grids, trims, accessories, and moldings. AWI operates about 25 plants in nine countries around the world. Armstrong World Industries split into two in 2016: It separated its flooring business from its ceilings business via a spinoff that created two independent, publicly traded companies (AWI and Armstrong Flooring).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Prior to the separation, the company operated through three primary segments: Building Products, Resilient Flooring, and Wood Flooring. Post-split, AWI is composed of the single Building Products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   AWI's Building Products segment generated more than 50% of the company's total revenue in 2015. It produces ceiling systems (including suspended-mineral and soft fiber, as well as metal types) for commercial, institutional and residential buildings. It also sources complementary ceiling products. The segment operates plants in 10 US states, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Russia, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its legacy Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments, which were spun off to create Armstrong Flooring, previously accounted for nearly 30% and the remaining 20% of revenue, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   AWI is also engaged in a joint venture with steel processor
   <company id="15179">
    Worthington Industries
   </company>
   called Worthington Armstrong Venture (WAVE). That venture operates nine plants in five countries that make suspension system (grid) products for use with AWI's ceiling systems.

  <p>
   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for more than two-thirds of annual sales. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region is next, contributing about 15%, followed by the Asia/Pacific region with nearly 10% of annual sales. In addition to its plants in the US, AWI also has global business offices in Australia, Canada, China, France, India, and the UK.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products are sold to contractors, distributors, home centers, wholesalers, and other retailers for residential and commercial use.
  </p>
  <p>
   About two-thirds of AWI's consolidated net sales are to building materials distributors. Large home centers, such as

    The Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's Companies
   </company>
   , account for about 15% of sales. The firm spent $10.6 million on advertising in 2015, down from $10.9 million in 2014 and $12.4 million in 2013.
  </p>

  <p>
   Net revenues have been declining over the past five years. In 2015, net revenue fell 4% to $2.4 billion; this was largely due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange currency rates. As far as segment performance, the Building Products and the legacy Resilient Flooring units saw growth in sales (by a nominal 1% and 2%, respectively), but the legacy Wood Flooring segment saw sales decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been fluctuating as of late. It rose 48% to $94.2 million in 2015, due to gains from discontinued operations. Cash flow from operations slipped 2% to $203.7 million that year.

  <p>
   While AWI has restarted work at some plants as housing starts in the US have inched up, the company continues to restructure its operations to get back toward growth. In 2016, AWI split its Flooring business from its Ceilings (Building Products) business to create two independent, publicly traded businesses. The plan was designed to improve the strategic focus, streamline operating structures, and improve the capital allocations of both divisions to strengthen them going forward. AWI plans to pursue domestic and international growth through strategic investments, new manufacturing facilities, and an expanded sales force.

   In 2015 completed construction of a new mineral fiber ceiling plant in Russia. However, it also made the decision to idle a plant in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, to strategically refocus its resources, the company exited its European flooring business by halting funds to its Germany-based subsidiary DLW. Additionally in 2014, to capture sales in a resurgent housing market, the company launched a new brand program,
