   bioMérieux is a maker of
   <i>
    in vitro
   </i>
   diagnostics with a focus on infectious diseases. The French company makes software, instrument systems, and chemical reagents used by clinical laboratories to test for infections such as sepsis, tuberculosis, hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and AIDS, as well as for cancers and cardiovascular conditions. It also makes industrial tests that food, cosmetics, and drug companies use to check their products for harmful bacteria. bioMérieux sells its products in more than 150 countries. The company got its start in 1897 when Louis Pasteur's assistant, Marcel Mérieux, founded the Institut Mérieux to develop vaccines and reagents; the Mérieux family still controls the firm.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   bioMérieux' Clinical Diagnostics division includes the instrument systems and reagents used for testing while Industrial Microbiology covers the food, cosmetic, and drug company tests. The former accounts for about 80% of revenue.
  </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company has operations in about 70 countries around the globe and generates nearly 90% of revenues outside its native France. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined account for nearly half of all revenue; the Americas account for about a third, and the Asia/Pacific region accounts for the rest.
  </p>
        <p>
   bioMérieux operates 21 production sites and 22 R&amp;D sites.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company sells its products through more than 40 subsidiaries and a large network of distributors. Customers are typically in the agri-food, cosmetics, or pharmaceutical industries.

        <p>
   bioMérieux revenues have been on the rise for the past five years. In 2014, revenue rose 7% to €1.7 billion on higher demand for its microbiology segment's VITEK 2 and VITEK MS mass spectrometry systems. Growth in the recently acquired firm BioFire also helped boost earnings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income, which has been fluctuating, fell 18% to €135 million as operating expenses related to marketing, acquisitions, and R&amp;D increased. However, cash flow from operations rose 24% to €298 million that year.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company pursues a growth strategy based on geographic expansion, acquisitions and partnerships, and product innovation. In the area of partnerships, it struck six deals in 2014, including agreements with COPAN (to automate clinical microbiology labs), Astute Medical (to develop an immunoassay test),
   <company id="100282">
    Illumina
   </company>
   (for a sequencing solution for epidemiological typing), and
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   (to validate its existing THxID-BRAF test).
  </p>
        <p>
   Also that year the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   granted a bioMérieux subsidiary (BioFire Diagnostics) an eight-year, $240 million contract to develop bio-threat tests for US military use.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 the company launched four new products, mostly in clinical microbiology.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US military contract was a nice win since bioMérieux had just acquired BioFire Diagnostics late in 2013. The company paid about $450 million for the firm and its Utah-based R&amp;D center, which gave the parent company its entry into molecular biology.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired Applied Maths, a biosciences software developer, expanding its new EpiSeq service in next-generation sequencing for epidemiological monitoring and control of infections.

        <p>
   In 1963 Alain Mérieux partnered with Becton, Dickinson and Company to form a diagnostics development company. Eleven years later Mérieux bought out his partner's share of BD Mérieux, renamed it bioMérieux, and began setting up subsidiaries in Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   By 1986 bioMérieux looked outside to expand its operations. Its first target was fellow French firm API Systems (bacterial identification). With an eye on acquiring a group of biotech companies, Mérieux teamed with Compagnie Générale d'Industrie et de Participations (now part of Wendel Investissement) to form holding company BioParticipations in 1988. That year the new company bought McDonnell Douglas' bacteriology unit Vitek and merged it with bioMérieux's US operations to create bioMérieux Vitek.
  </p>
        <p>
   As genetics technology developed in the early 1990s, BioParticipations focused on biotechnology. In 1994 the group along with CGIP bought half of TRANSGENE. The company had been focused on genetic therapies since 1992; it was founded as a contract research firm in 1979 by biologists Pierre Chambon and Phillippe Kourilsky with backing from France's state-owned bank Paribas (now BNP Paribas Group). In 1995 Mérieux and CGIP increased funding to BioParticipations and changed its name to bioMérieux Alliance.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the late 1990s the group continued to grow through internal development, acquisitions, and partnerships. In 1996 bioMérieux and Affymetrix agreed to develop an automated disease diagnostic system, and the next year it aligned with Gen-Probe to develop nucleic acid probe tests. TRANSGENE went public in one of 1998's largest IPOs and signed major deals with Human Genome Sciences and Schering-Plough. In 1999 bioMérieux Alliance expanded its quality control operations with the purchase of almost half of Silliker Laboratories, a network of microbiology labs in North America formed in 1967, to create Silliker bioMérieux.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 the company merged with Pierre Fabre, the French pharmaceutical and dermo-cosmetics firm founded in 1961 by pharmacist Pierre Fabre. The company changed its name to bioMérieux-Pierre Fabre. The companies parted ways in 2002.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 bioMérieux augmented its production capacities in Brazil, Europe, and the US, while its research efforts paid off with the launch of FoodExpert-ID, one of the first high density DNA chips used for food and animal testing.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired a minority stake in ReLIA Diagnostic Systems, a US company making point-of-care tests; bioMérieux distributes the company's products in China. Also in 2006 bioMérieux sold its hemostasis product line to
   <company id="47955">
    Trinity Biotech
   </company>
   and decided to phase out US production of microplates used in the diagnosis of HIV.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2007 bioMérieux bought Australia-based BTF, an industrial microbiology testing company. And in 2008 it acquired privately held Swedish diagnostics company ABBIODISK, which makes infectious disease tests; cancer diagnostics company AviaraDx (based in San Diego); and
   <company id="117112">
    PML Microbiologicals
   </company>
   , a maker of culture media and other microbiology products.
