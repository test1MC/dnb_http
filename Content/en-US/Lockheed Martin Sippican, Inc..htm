   Lockheed Martin Sippican specializes in naval cat and mouse, focusing on military intelligence and defense systems for submarines and naval surface ships. Areas of operation include Sea-Air Systems (expendable probes, oceanographic instrumentation, communications, submarine antennas, and Stinger Missile fuzes), Countermeasures (chaff, infrared, and acoustic decoys), and Underwater Vehicles (self-propelled acoustic and anti-submarine training targets). A subsidiary of

   In addition to its one-quarter million foot complex in Massachusetts, Sippican has a warehouse in El Paso, Texas, and a manufacturing facility across the border in Ju√°rez, Mexico. Sippican works collaboratively with neighboring scientific and educational institutions, including the Massachusetts Ocean Technology Network, the Naval Submarine League, and the Navy League of the US, to name a few.

   and the

   . Additionally, the division manufactures the M934E6 electromechanical fuze for the Stinger Missile, which is a proven missile system in combat situations. The fuze performs the timing and initiation functions of the flight motor ignition, as well as the arming and detonating of the warhead.

  <p>
   When Sippican was acquired in 2004 by Lockheed Martin it became part of Lockheed's Maritime Systems and Sensors division located in Manassas, Virginia. As such, Sippican gained access to Lockheed's vast array of engineering, technical, and financial assets.
