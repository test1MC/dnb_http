   Smith &amp; Wesson has built a successful business shooting for the stars. Operating through subsidiary Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation makes and markets pistols, revolvers, tactical rifles, and police accessories, as well as gun-safety devices under the M&amp;P Series name. The company, founded in 1852, also sells handcuffs and hunting rifles and car, boat, and home alarm system packages. Smith &amp; Wesson is the exclusive importer of Walther pistols with US production rights for the Walther PPK model. To diversify and add breadth to its brand, the company licenses its name to makers of apparel, watches, sunglasses, gift sets, and more.

  <p>
   Smith &amp; Wesson sells its products globally. Besides the US, the company serves Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It maintains production facilities for its firearms in Springfield, Massachusetts, and in Houlton, Maine.

  <p>
   Smith &amp; Wesson aims to diversify its products portfolio as the company evolves from being a gun maker to a top supplier of a variety of arms. As a result, the company has traded sales of revolvers in favor of pistols. Smith &amp; Wesson is also working to expand its products in the areas of tactical and long-gun lines, as well as non-firearm products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company supports its firearms business through deals with other companies to make Smith &amp; Wesson-branded products. A licensing agreement with BBC Imagewear, inked in 2009, provides Smith &amp; Wesson with branded T-shirts, jackets, and shirts. A similar deal with Kudzu/The Game offers branded hats and caps and hats, T-shirts, jackets, gun pads, license plates, decals, pins, patches, key chains, glassware, and mugs with the Thompson/Center Arms logo. Its licensing agreement with TruckVault calls for Smith &amp; Wesson-brand lockable steel handgun safes for homes, vehicles, and public safety agencies, including police, government agencies, fire departments, and the military.

  <p>
   Smith &amp; Wesson has seen its net sales rise in recent years, particularly following the November 2008 US presidential election as consumers began to stockpile arms for fear of losing some rights under new leadership. In 2011, however, Smith &amp; Wesson logged slightly fewer orders across the company's firearms businesses -- returning to more normal levels temporarily as compared to the strong consumer demand it has experienced for years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2012 net sales increased 20% and net income rose 119% as compared to 2011. Net cash outflow during the same reporting period was $1 million vs. $20 million in 2011. Net sales increases can be attributed to a 25% rise in handgun product sales and a 94% increase in sales of modern sporting rifles, thanks to the late fiscal 2011 introduction of a new sport model that was competitively priced. International sales, meanwhile, accounted for 4% of Smith &amp; Wesson's sales. The company's net income boost came from rising operating income due to increased sales volumes. Its net cash outflow in 2012 was primarily related to cash used in financing activities, such as repurchasing Convertible Notes.

  <p>
   Smith &amp; Wesson taps several distribution channels to get its products in the hands of customers. Customers include distributors, government and military agencies, businesses, retailers, and consumers, as well as federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers. The company, which spent $14.7 million on advertising and promotion expenses in 2012, leverages its websites to market products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has increased its sales in recent years by forming and maintaining its own sales force instead of relying on the representatives of independent manufacturers to sell its products, including its line of polymer pistols.

  <p>
   In 2016 Smith &amp; Wesson acquired laser sighting systems company Crimson Trace Corp. for $95 million. The company established its Electro-Optics Division from Crimson Trace's assets and operations.

   Amid a shift in government spending, the company exited the perimeter security systems business in 2011. It moved to divest its perimeter security division -- Tennessee-based Universal Safety Response (later renamed Smith &amp; Wesson Security Solutions) to Detroit, Michigan-based FutureNet Group in mid-2012. Smith &amp; Wesson Security Solutions has provided barriers, and installation and other services used in approximately 110 military installations and more than a dozen federal agencies and commercial facilities. The operations generated about $130 million during the past three years, accounting for some 10% of Smith &amp; Wesson's sales.
