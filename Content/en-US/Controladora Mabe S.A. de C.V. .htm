   It's certain that Mexico's Mabe is the largest producer of appliances in Latin America. The home appliance maker operates more than a dozen production facilities in Mexico and throughout Central and South America. It also has operations in Canada. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes stoves, refrigerators, and washers and dryers under the brands GE, Easy, IEM, and Serviplus. Mabe commands nearly half of the total large appliance market share in Mexico and exports its products to more than 70 countries worldwide. The company was founded in 1946 by Egon Mabardi and Francisco Berrondo. The US industrial giant

   Mabe is expanding beyond Mexico. In recent years it has entered the Brazilian, Canadian, and Chilean markets. In 2008 it began operations in Russia through a business alliance with Europe's Fagor.

  <p>
   In the US, Mabe has a long-standing relationship with GE that dates back to 1987. In 2012 the company signed a new 10-year agreement with GE for the production of dryers at its Saltillo plant in Mexico. It acquired the US company's operations in Chile (in 2008) and makes and markets GE Appliance brands in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is shutting down its dryer manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada citing the high Canadian dollar and weak consumer demand. The Quebec plant will cease operations in late 2014. Nevertheless, global demand for major household appliances is expected to grow nearly 4% annually through 2017 as the housing recovery in the US picks up steam, the standard of living continues to rise in China, and developing countries post robust growth.
