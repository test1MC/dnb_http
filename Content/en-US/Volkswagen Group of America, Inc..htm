   Volkswagen AG recognizes that its US operations are crucial to its global goals. Volkswagen of America's parent company ponied up $4 billion for investment in its US operations. Of that amount, $1 billion went toward the construction of a new manufacturing plant in Tennessee that opened in 2011. The facility has a capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles per year. Volkswagen AG's ultimate goal is to reach 800,000 car sales (VW and Audi) by 2018.
