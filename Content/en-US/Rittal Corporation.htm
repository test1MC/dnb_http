   ! What does this company do? Rittal Corp. makes industrial and IT enclosures and racks that industrial, electronic, and telecommunications companies use to keep equipment protected and wires in place. Products include industrial cabinet systems, electronic sub rack systems, shielded enclosures, and interactive terminals. Rittal also makes climate control systems for its enclosures (filter fans, panel heaters, heat exchangers), and power distribution systems (adapters, bus bars, fuse bases, switches). Rittal is the US subsidiary of Germany-based enclosure maker Rittal GmbH.

  <p>
   Rittal's parent company was established in 1961 and owns more than 10 production sites, nearly 65 subsidiaries, and 40 agencies in more than 70 countries and manufacturing facilities spanning 4 continents. Headquartered in Ohio, Rittal has additional US locations in Reno, Nevada, and Houston.

  <p>
   Rittal's long list of products has included designed cabinets that allow for external data pockets which hold system-related documentation. By designing these pockets on the exterior, the cabinet or enclosure can stay closed, thus reducing the chance of arc flash hazards, change in ambient temperature, or unauthorized access. The company's branded RiLine industrial enclosures are designed to house and protect networking equipment in harsh environments.

  <p>
   United with its parent, Rittal's growth strategy involves international expansion in China, India, and Germany. Rital also switched its headquarters from Chicago to Urbana, Ohio, to recognize a greater capacity for manufacturing in 2013.
