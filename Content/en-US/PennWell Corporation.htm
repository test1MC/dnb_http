   No need to go all the way down to the well for your oil and gas info. PennWell publishes more than 130 print and online magazines and newsletters, including business-to-business titles
   <em>
    Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Dental Economics
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Hydro Review
   </em>
   . It also conducts 60 conferences and events; publishes websites, books, maps, and directories; and offers research and database services. While its core industry remains oil and gas, PennWell also covers electronics, fire services, aerospace and defense, technology, and dental. The firm was founded as the Petroleum Publishing Company in 1910 when P.C. Boyle purchased
   <em>
    The Oil Investor's Journal
   </em>
   (later renamed
   <em>
    Oil &amp; Gas Journal
   </em>
   ).
