   Take a seat -- Faurecia is one of the world's largest automotive seat makers. In addition to car seats, it also manufactures emission control systems, vehicle interiors and doors, and front-end systems. Although Europe accounts for over 50% of sales, it supplies most major carmakers, including

   subsidiary, merged in 1999 to create Faurecia. Faurecia has struggled to keep its CEO seat filled, going through three executives in less than five years.

  <p>
   Faurecia operates four business units. Emission Control Technologies, the largest segment accounting for around 36% of sales, designs and manufactures exhaust systems; Automotive Seating, representing 28% of sales, designs and assembles vehicle seats, seating frames, and adjustable mechanisms; Interior Systems (25% of sales) makes instrument panels, door panels and modules, and acoustic components; and Automotive Exteriors (11%) designs and manufactures front ends and safety modules.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Faurecia has 330 sites, including 30 R&amp;D centers, in 34 countries around the world. Europe is the company's largest market at some 55% of sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   Faurecia works with some of the biggest names in the automotive industry. Its five main customers represent 72% of sales. VW leads the way with 22.7%, followed by Ford (15.9%), PSA (Peugeot Citroen, 13.3%), GM (7.6%), and Daimler (7.1%).

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, sales climbed 9% to €20.7 billion. Product sales (parts and components) were up 6.0%, while sales of tooling, R&amp;D, prototypes and other services were down 15.6%. Catalytic converter monolith sales (precious metals and ceramics used in emission control systems) were up 12.4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 123% to €371.8 million, due to higher margins in Europe and an upturn in product sales in North America, partially offset by lower sales in South America as a result of the region's difficult economic climate, and lower sales in Asia (despite reduced costs). The company's cash position strengthened markedly due mostly to the sale of the Automotive Exteriors business, up to €1.25 billion from a low base.

  <p>
   Faurecia signed a definitive agreement to sell its Automotive Exteriors business, which had revenue of around €2.0 billion in fiscal 2015, to Plastic Omnium for €665 million. The deal does not include Faurecia's composites business, its Smart plant in France, or two joint ventures in Brazil and China. The sale of the business is to reduce debt, which it will do almost entirely.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faurecia has high hopes for its composites business, as the automotive industry looks increasingly towards lightweighting in search of greater fuel efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Faurecia formed a joint venture with Beijing WKW Automotive Parts in order to strengthen its position in China.

  <p>
   Bertrand Faure opened his workshop in Levallois-Perret, France, in 1914 to manufacture cushions and spring backs for automotive seats; spring pads were developed in 1929. The company diversified into bedding in 1954. The following year it opened a factory near Etampes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bertrand Faure continued to grow through geographic and product-line expansion. The company boosted its metal and foam seat-making operations in France, and in 1971 it expanded into Germany with the purchase of automotive seating component manufacturer Schmitz. Faure bought French bedding maker Mérinos in 1973 and then changed its company name to Epéda-Bertrand Faure. Between 1977 and 1978 Epéda-Bertrand Faure expanded its automotive seating business through acquisitions in Spain and Portugal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Epéda-Bertrand Faure diversified into the luggage business with the 1982 purchase of Delsey. That year the company was floated on the French stock exchange. In 1983 Epéda-Bertrand Faure further strengthened its car-seat business in France with the purchase of Autocoussin (structures and foam) and Cousin Frères (mechanisms). Another plant in Germany was opened in 1986 to supply BMW. That year Epéda-Bertrand Faure invested in Canadian CASE, a leading North American maker of car-seat mechanisms. The company also reorganized its automotive activities under the name Bertrand Faure Automobile.
  </p>
  <p>
   Epéda-Bertrand Faure acquired Luchaire, a defense materials and aerospace and automotive equipment manufacturer, in 1987. The following year the company bought automotive seating structures maker Sicam (Italy) and seating foam and structures firm Molaflex (Portugal). In 1989 the company forged joint ventures in the UK, Japan, and Canada for the manufacture of car seating.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 the company had reorganized into four product segments: automotive seats, bedding, luggage, and aerospace equipment. The automotive seating business was conducted under the name Bertrand Faure, while the rest of the group changed its name to EBF. Bertrand Faure purchased RHW, a leading German maker of car seats, in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year EBF's board of directors decided to focus the company on automotive seating and initiated a vast restructuring plan. EBF sold its bedding concerns in 1994. As part of its restructuring, EBF changed its name back to Bertrand Faure. Two years later Bertrand Faure opened offices in Beijing and São Paulo.
  </p>
  <p>
   Peugeot S.A. subsidiary ECIA and Bertrand Faure merged in 1999 to form Faurecia. In 2000 Faurecia bolstered its North American presence by purchasing US-based automotive exhaust system maker AP Automotive Systems; it renamed the subsidiary Faurecia Exhaust Systems. The company acquired Sommer Allibert's car interiors business early in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding in Asia, Faurecia purchased Chang Heung Precision Co. Ltd., a Korean maker of exhaust systems, in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2004 the headcount at high-cost Western European locations has been reduced, while headcount in low-cost regions has increased.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company opened a new plant in China for the manufacture of automotive seats and interior modules for Ford.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 CEO Pierre Levi stepped down amid a corruption scandal involving Faurecia employees who allegedly offered kickbacks to managers at customers, including Volkswagen and BMW. CFO Frank Imbert was named interim CEO, then director Gregoire Olivier followed as CEO. Yann Delabrière succeeded him in early 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 sales in North America grew by 42%. The company opened seven new plants in the US in 2006 and 2007 -- in Michigan (seats, interior modules, front end modules), Ohio (interior modules and exhaust systems), and South Carolina (seats).
  </p>
  <p>
   In Asia, Faurecia's sales grew by 21% in 2007 over the previous year. To keep up momentum Faurecia continues to invest in the region.
