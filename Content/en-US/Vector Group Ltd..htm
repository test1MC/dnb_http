   Vector Group is small potatoes next to Big Tobacco, running a distant fourth in the US market. The holding company's Liggett and Vector Tobacco subsidiaries manufacture discount cigarettes under brands including Liggett Select, Grand Prix, Pyramid, and Eve, and several private-label brands of cigarettes for other companies, including the USA brand. The company manufactures cigarettes in North Carolina and distributes them throughout the US. Vector Group's real estate unit,
   <company id="41943">
    New Valley
   </company>
   , owns about 70% stake in the New York City broker Douglas Elliman Realty. It's looking to acquire other properties. All of Vector Group's revenue is derived from the sale of discount cigarettes.

   Beyond cigarette manufacturing, Vector Group's New Valley subsidiary is engaged in the real estate business through its stake in Douglas Elliman Realty, the operator of the largest residential brokerage company in the New York metropolitan area. In 2012 New Valley increased its stake in Ellimen from 50% to nearly 71%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vector Group's indirect subsidiary, Zoom E-Cigs LLC, launched the ZOOM brand of electric cigarettes in early 2104, gaining a foothold in a new and growing market.

   The company's primary customers are candy and tobacco distributors, the military, and large grocery, drugstore, and convenience store chains. One customer accounted for 17% of Liggett's sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010. Liggett accounted for about 3.5% of the total cigarettes shipped in the US. All of its cigarette sales are in the discount segment.

   Vector Group's sales declined 4% in 2012 versus 2011, to about $1.1 billion. Net income fell 59% over the same period to $30.6 million. The decline in 2012 reversed three consecutive years of increasing sales for the cigarette maker. While the company has been increasing prices across its portfolio of discount brands over the past few years, volume has declined.

  <p>
   Liggett's discount niche -- which it pioneered back in the 1980s -- has become increasingly crowded and competitive as makers of premium cigarettes have begun selling the brands at discount prices and launching discount brands of their own. (
   <company id="11179">
    Altria
   </company>
   's spinoff of its international unit,
   <company id="55957">
    Philip Morris International
   </company>
   , sparked increased competition for Vector by pushing Altria into the discount niche.) Indeed, discount cigarettes have been the fastest-growing segment of the US tobacco industry for more than a decade. Currently, Liggett holds a 12.1% share of the overall discount market segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Being small, relative to its heavyweight competitors, has its benefits. Under the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) reached in 1998, the three largest cigarette makers must make settlement payment to 46 US states based on how many cigarettes they sell annually. Smaller companies, such as Liggett, need only make payments if their market share exceeds 1.65% of the US cigarette market. The settlement gives Vector's tobacco subsidiaries a sustainable cost advantage over their competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Liggett's long-term business strategy is to build volume and margin in its core discount brands, and increase distribution. The company may pursue strategic acquisitions of smaller tobacco manufacturers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Former computer analyst Bennett LeBow founded Brooke Partners in 1980 (renamed Brooke Group in 1990) to acquire troubled companies and turn them around. Many of LeBow's early investments were in the computer industry. He eventually expanded into other areas, including tobacco (with the purchase of Liggett in 1986).
  </p>
  <p>
   Founded in 1822 by the Liggett family as a snuff maker and joined by George Myers in 1873, Liggett &amp; Myers produced several popular cigarette brands, including L&amp;M and Chesterfield. Liggett slipped during the 1950s and 1960s by failing to exploit the market for filtered and low-tar cigarettes. Although Liggett launched a successful discount brand under LeBow (Pyramid), its US market share continued to dwindle.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like Liggett, many of LeBow's other businesses were slipping. In 1993 Western Union (bought in 1987 and renamed New Valley) and computer maker MAI Systems (bought in 1985) entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That year LeBow paid about $20 million to Brooke Group shareholders who sued a group of company officers who they believed were stripping assets and using the company for personal loans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frustrated in the US, Brooke Group turned to developing new markets. In 1993 the company began a joint venture with Russian cigarette maker Ducat. In 1995 New Valley emerged from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company made deals with 41 states regarding tobacco-related Medicaid payments. But most of Liggett's state deals were negated when in late 1998 it joined a $206 billion settlement hammered out with 46 states by its much larger rivals. As part of the deal, Liggett did not have to chip in as long as its market share stayed below its 1997 level of 1.67%.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut debt, Liggett sold its L&amp;M, Chesterfield, and Lark brands to Philip Morris for $300 million in 1999. (The deal also kept Liggett's market share well below 1.67%.) Also in 1999 an Alabama court rejected an agreement that would have allowed Liggett to settle tobacco-related lawsuits with a limited fund. That year the US government filed a massive lawsuit against the Big Tobacco companies to recover health care costs and profits allegedly derived from fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the firm changed its name to Vector Group to remove the old name's stigma of sick-smoker lawsuits. The company said it would appeal a Florida's $790 million verdict against it. Later Vector Group sold its Liggett-Ducat subsidiary (Russia) to cigarette manufacturer Gallaher for $400 million. A Florida judge upheld the July 2000 verdict; meanwhile Vector angled for a global settlement of all punitive cases, payable to a public health trust fund over a 30-year period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, along with Brown &amp; Williamson, Lorillard (Carolina Group), Philip Morris, and R.J. Reynolds, faced paying Florida smokers $145 billion after losing a lengthy court battle in 2000. Three years later a state appeals court threw out the case, saying that the thousands of Florida smokers named in the case could not lump their complaints in a single lawsuit. That decision is now under review by the Florida Supreme Court.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2001 Vector launched OMNI, a reduced-carcinogen cigarette, which  received a lukewarm acceptance and hit a slow burn in sales. OMNI generated a disappointing $5.1 million in revenue for 70.7 million units. (Vector gave up on the product several years later.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year the company created Liggett Vector Brands, a new unit that combines the sales and marketing functions of its Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco subsidiaries. Vector also bought The Medallion Company, a discount cigarette manufacturer (USA and Marlin brands), for $110 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vector closed its Timberlake, North Carolina, production plant and laid off 150 workers in 2003. The company moved operations to a nearby cigarette plant in Mebane, North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vector announced in August 2004 that it would sell its reduced-nicotine cigarette brand, QUEST, on the Internet beginning in 2005 and is seeking FDA approval to sell QUEST as a device for quitting smoking. (In 2009 the company decided against seeking FDA approval of Quest as a smoking cessation aide, citing the significant time and expense involved in seeking it.) However, it switched gears in November 2004 by putting an indefinite hold on a national rollout of QUEST. The company said a review of marketing data made such a move necessary. Vector laid off approximately 330 full-time and 135 part-time positions that December.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2005 the company began supplying Montego deep-discount brand cigarettes exclusively to more than 2,200
   <company id="40091">
    Circle K
   </company>
   and Mac's convenience stores in the US. In November it entered into a similar deal with
   <company id="11412">
    Sunoco
   </company>
   , which operates 800-plus Sonoco APlus convenience stores, to make and supply Silver Eagle brand cigarettes to its stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   Howard Lorber succeeded LeBow as CEO in 2006. Later that year Vector entered into a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service that called for the company to pay about $42 million related to a gain stemming from a 1998 and 1999 deal with Philip Morris.
  </p>
  <p>
   To tap the popular and more politically correct smokeless tobacco market, Vector launched Grand Prix-branded snus in May 2008. The pouched tobacco product is made in Sweden and rolls out in a trio of varieties.
