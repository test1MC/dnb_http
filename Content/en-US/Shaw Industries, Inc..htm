   Go ahead, walk all over them -- Shaw Industries is one of the world's largest carpet manufacturers. The company offers woven and tufted broadloom carpets, as well as other flooring products including laminate, ceramic tile, and hardwood made by subsidiary Anderson Hardwood Floors. Its carpet brands include Tuftex, Anderson, Caress, HGTV HOME, and LifeGuard. The company also rolls out a line of filament fiber carpet and hardwood flooring containing recycled content. Shaw sells its residential lines to distributors and retailers in North America and abroad, and its commercial products directly to contractors through Shaw Contract Flooring. Warren Buffett's

  <p>
   Shaw makes more than 3,000 styles of carpet and laminate and wood flooring under more than 30 brand names and some private labels. It also sells ceramic and vinyl tile and sheet vinyl along with installation services. Through its Tuftex division, it also makes artificial sports turf.

   The carpet maker reported more than $4.8 billion in sales for 2014. (Revenues were impacted by the closure of the company's rugs division in early 2014 and lower carpet sales, offset by higher sales of hard flooring products).

   Shaw belongs to parent

   Shaw continues to tweak its product mix to stay on top. In 2014 Shaw announced plans to open a new carpet recycling facility in Ringgold, Georgia, replacing its previous rug distribution facility, with an investment of around $17 million. The plant, which recycles nylon and polyester carpet, will produce recycled material that can be used in a range of applications. Its $100 million investment in the new tile follows $250 million spent expanding it carpet, tile, hardwood flooring, yarn extrusion, and distribution facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company agreed to implement the Central &amp; Collaborative Forecasting and Inventory Optimization solution from OM Partners within its Hard Surfaces division. The solution provides expertise in the floor covering industry, integration with planning and the ability to extend functionality into areas such as S&amp;OP and Supply Chain Network Design, to the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company invested $40 million to expand its existing hardwood manufacturing facility in Tennessee by 60% to meet the growing demand for its Epic engineered flooring product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its presence in the Asia market, in 2013 Shaw opened a 210,000-square-foot carpet tile plant in Nantong, China.

  <p>
   In 1946 Clarence Shaw and John McCarty established the Star Dye Co. to dye tufted scatter rugs. Following Shaw's death in 1958, his son Robert became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert and his brother Bud created Star Finishing Co. in Dalton, Georgia, in 1960 as a supply firm to the carpet industry. In 1967 the brothers entered carpet making by acquiring the Philadelphia Carpet Co., a Georgia manufacturer since 1958. This company was merged with Shaw-owned companies to form the Philadelphia Holding Co., with Bud as president.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm went public in 1971 and changed its name to Shaw Industries. In 1972 it bought New Found Industries (fine-gauge carpet yarns) and set up a plant for making shag carpets. Shaw Industries bought Elite Processing Co. (dyeing) and Syntex Yarns in 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 Shaw Industries' stock moved to the New York Stock Exchange from the American Stock Exchange. The company restructured sales operations in 1982 to eliminate outside distributors. The in-house sales strategy worked and sales to retailers jumped from 45% of revenues in 1982 to 80% by 1985. By then Shaw Industries had become the US's top carpet maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company boosted sales by almost 40% in 1987 with the acquisition of competitor West Point-Pepperell's carpet and rug division. It followed this acquisition with the purchase of the carpet divisions of
   <company id="16337">
    Armstrong World Industries
   </company>
   , which gave the company carpet plants in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Salem Carpet Mills, the #2 US publicly held carpet maker, in 1992. That year it also bought Amoco Fibers' polypropylene carpet fiber plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shaw Industries expanded internationally during the 1990s. It acquired two UK carpet makers, Kosset Carpets and Abingdon Carpets, in 1993 and entered the Australian market with the purchase of Capital Carpet Industries and Invicta Group Industries. The next year it entered the Mexican market with the establishment of a joint venture Terza, S.A. de C.V.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shaw Industries bought UK carpet maker Coats Viyella and stakes in Mexican carpet makers Tapetes Luxor and Santa Rosa in 1995. Depressed consumer demand, rising raw material costs, and an accounting change caused a slump in Shaw's net income that year. Bud retired as chairman in 1995, and Robert took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Shaw entered carpet retailing -- a move that alienated retail customers who felt Shaw was in direct competition with them -- by introducing its own chain of stores and acquiring carpet retailers Bell-Mann, Bode Flooring, Carpetland USA, Doster Floor Covering, and New York Carpet World. The company's earnings declined that year and proceeded to decline in subsequent years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its money-losing UK subsidiary, Carpets International, in 1998. It bought the #4 carpet maker Queen Carpet (now a Shaw division), owned by the family of Robert's longtime friend, Julian Saul, who was named president of Shaw. The company's retail experiment ended that year when it sold 275 stores to the Maxim Group (now
   <company id="116591">
    Flooring America
   </company>
   ) for about $93 million in cash and stock. (Flooring America filed for bankruptcy two years later.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sold its Australian operations to New Zealand-based Feltex Carpets Limited. Warren Buffett's
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway

   purchased 87% of Shaw Industries in early 2001 and then acquired the remainder of the company in 2002. In 2003 Shaw acquired Georgia Tufters, maker of tufted bathroom and scatter rugs, for an undisclosed price. Later that year the company bought about a half dozen yarn, tufting, dyeing, finishing, carpet recycling, needlebond, and distribution facilities from

   .
  </p>

   In 2005 Shaw acquired

    Honeywell's

   nylon carpet fibers business. Along with the facilities and operations, the deal included the Zeftron and Anso brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shaw's co-founder and CEO Robert Shaw handed the reigns over Vance Bell in mid-2006. Working up through the company ranks, Bell had served Shaw for 30 years. Mr. Shaw retains his membership on the company's board and stands as a strategic advisor.
  </p>
  <p>
   A new joint venture between Shaw and
   <company id="111571">

   in 2009 gave birth to Clear Path Recycling. The effort will capture about 5 billion post-consumer PET bottles to produce recycled PET, an ingredient for each company's line of sustainable goods.
