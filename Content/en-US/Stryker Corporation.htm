   Is this an operating room or Dad's workshop? Stryker's surgical products include such instruments as drills, saws, and even cement mixers. The company's Orthepaedic segment makes artificial hip and knee joints, trauma implants, bone cement, and other orthopedic supplies. The MedSurg equipment segment houses microsurgery instruments, endoscopy equipment, and communications and patient handling tools. Stryker's Neurotechnology and Spine unit provides rods, screws, and artificial discs for spinal surgeries, as well as coils and stents for cerebral vascular procedures. The firm's products are marketed globally to hospitals, doctors, and other health care facilities via direct sales personnel and distributors.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's Orthopaedic (formerly reconstructive) segment makes up the largest portion of sales, accounting for 42% of annual revenues in 2015. The division's leading products include the Triathlon and Scorpio knee implant systems, Simplex bone cement, the VariAx and Hoffman systems, and the Oasys spinal implant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stryker's MedSurg division is almost as large, bringing in nearly $3.9 billion in sales (or 39% of total revenues). The MedSurg Equipment division includes surgical navigation systems, endoscopic systems, emergency medical equipment, and other medical devices. Its biggest customers are hospitals and other care providers who have to invest a decent chunk of cash in order to upgrade their surgical equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's smallest segment -- Neurotechnology &amp; Spine -- accounted for 19% of sales in 2015. It provides both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Spinal implant products include cervical, thoracolumbar, and interbody systems used in various therapies.
  </p>

  <p>
   Stryker operates about 30 manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia/Pacific region. While it markets its products in more than 100 countries and is looking to grow in international markets, sales in the US continue to make up the majority (about 70%) of annual revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the US, Stryker uses its own sales and marketing force, maintaining separate, dedicated sales teams for each of its core product lines to doctors, hospitals, and other care providers. By allowing for specialization, each team can provide expertise and guidance directed specifically to customers in each of the medical specialties Stryker serves. In markets outside the US, Stryker's products are sold through company-owned subsidiaries, as well as third-party distributors and medical device dealers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Stryker's revenues have increased steadily over the last five years. In 2014 it grew 3% to $9.95 billion due to growth across all segments, especially the MedSurg division. That unit saw growth through acquisitions, increased sales volume, and changes in its product mix.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the higher revenues, net income has fallen for the past five years. However, it more than doubled in 2015, rising 179% to $1.4 billion. That turnaround was primarily due to the higher revenue and a decrease in recall expenses. Cash flow from operations increased 50% to $899 million that year -- again thanks to a decrease in recall payments.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Stryker expands its operations through a balance of internal R&amp;D programs, partnerships, and a steady stream of acquisitions. Focus areas of growth including widening its presence geographically and expanding its product offerings in core and complementary fields of medicine. Geographically, the company targets Brazil, Russia, India, and China through both its standard line of products and its lower-cost Trauson brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spends between 5% and 7% of annual revenues on R&amp;D programs each year. In the Orthopaedics segment, the company has followed the implant strategy of staying on top of the latest technology by consistently upgrading and introducing new versions of its popular brands. In 2015, for instance, it received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   clearance for its Mako total knee application.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company launched the LITe (less invasive technologies) ALIF Procedural Solutions and Aero-AL Anterior Lumbar Interbody and Fixation platforms, adding to its growing portfolio of ALIF products.

  <p>
   Purchases in recent years have brought the company new software and manufacturing technologies and entered it into new lines of business, such as minimally invasive devices for treatment of stroke and brain conditions. In 2014 Stryker's buying streak continued as it picked up four new companies: MedSurg company Patient Safety Technologies for $120 million, small joint replacement manufacturer Small Bone Innovations for about $358 million, operating room equipment maker Berchtold Holding AG for an undisclosed amount, and hip arthroscopy product maker Pivot Medical. In 2015, the company acquired private Canadian firm CHG Hospital Beds, which markets beds across Canada, the US, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Stryker bought personal products maker
   <company id="140161">
    Sage Products
   </company>
   for $2.8 billion. Sage, which specializes in items that prevent hospital-acquired conditions, is now part of Stryker's MedSurg segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, the company purchased
   <company id="48120">
    Physio-Control
   </company>
   for almost $1.3 billion and Instratek for an undisclosed amount. Physio-Control develops and manufactures monitors/defribillators and CPR-assist devices, which will serve as fitting add-on to Stryker's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) business. Instratek is a Texas-based maker of orthopedic implants and endoscopic instruments for use in hand and foot procedures.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Stryker was founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer Stryker.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Stryker was founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer Stryker, an orthopedic surgeon who had invented several orthopedic devices. It was incorporated in 1946 as a Michigan company. The company expanded through organic measures and occasional acquisitions over the following decades, while the Stryker family kept a hand in its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in 2009 Stryker set out to further diversify its operations through acquisitions. In 2010 Stryker purchased supportive surface maker (think: beds and tables)
   <company id="110341">
    Gaymar Industries
   </company>
   for approximately $150 million in cash. The two companies were already well-acquainted through a longstanding supply and sales agreement in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its $1.5 billion acquisition of
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   's neurovascular division in 2011 added minimally invasive devices (such as coils, stents, and balloon catheters) for the treatment of cerebral conditions such as brain aneurysms and hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stryker further boosted its neurovascular operations later that year when it acquired Concentric Medical, a maker of clot removal products for use in ischemic stroke procedures, for some $135 million. Following these acquisitions, Stryker rearranged its operating structure from two divisions into three: Reconstructive, MedSurg Equipment, and Neurotechnology and Spine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's OP-1 bone growth product was so successful that in 2011 the company sold the product franchise to
   <company id="56016">
    Olympus
   </company>
   for $60 million. During 2011 Stryker acquired synthetic bone graft material maker
   <company id="57016">
    Orthovita
   </company>
   for some $304 million in cash. It also spent $150 million to purchase France's Memometal Technologies for its in hand and foot device products.
