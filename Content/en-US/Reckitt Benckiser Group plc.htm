   With a cart full of household and personal care products, Reckitt Benckiser (RB) cleans up the consumer marketplace. The company makes and markets a diversity of name brand necessities (under the three categories of Health, Hygiene and Home), 19 of which are the "Powerbrands" that comprise 80% of revenue. These include air fresheners (Air Wick), household cleaners (Lysol, Vanish), laundry products (Woolite), dishwashing detergents (Finish), condoms (Durex), and anti-acne treatments (Clearasil). It also makes over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and products for hair removal, denture cleaning, and pest control. RB also operates a standalone food division. The company sells its products in 200 countries worldwide.

        <p>
   The global consumer goods company organizes its business geographically into two broad segments based on grouping by consumer behavior: ENA - Europe (inc. Russia/CIS and Israel), North America, and Australia/New Zealand; and DvM (Developing Markets) - Africa, the Middle East (excl. Israel), Turkey, Asia and Latin America.
  </p>
        <p>
   Reckitt Benckiser operates three main product segments of Health, Hygiene and Home. Health and Hygiene are the company's biggest focuses, and together pull in 74% of net revenue. It also operates a small food segment, which includes French's mustard, one of RB's 19 'Powerbrands' and the leading mustard brand in the US.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   RB has operations in more than 60 countries, with headquarters in the UK, Amsterdam, Dubai, and Singapore, and sells to almost every market worldwide. Sales are weighted towards the ENA region at around two-thirds of revenue; the ENA also makes the vast majority of food sales. The DvM section brings in 30% of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also has 16 selected 'Powermarkets', which are those with higher growth and rising middle classes. RB doesn't make public all 16, but one is China.

        </p>
        <p>
   Total net revenue growth was flat in 2015, at £8.9 billion; in like-for-like terms, i.e. excluding unfavorable currency effects, growth was 6% on prior year. Growth of 8% in the Health segment (to £2.9 billion, or 33% of total) was counterbalanced by falls in Hygiene and Home (down 1% to £3.6 billion and 5% to £1.7 billion respectively). The standalone Food segment was flat at £349 million. Growth was flat in both the EMA and DvM regions.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations tracked net revenue - flat at £2.3 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   Exceptional items amounted to a loss of £133 million - £76 million came from re-structuring and acquisition integration costs, while £57 million was a result of the disposal of the Medcom hospital business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income nearly halved in 2015 in prior year, to £1.7 billion. However, this was because of an exception gain in 2014 relating to the divestiture of the pharmaceutical business, rather than weak performance in 2015.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The Reckitt Benckiser strategy is based on its 'Powerbrands' and 'Powermarkets', as well as 'Project Supercharge', a re-structuring program. All three of these have been adapted or developed as a response to adverse market conditions. Project Supercharge is intended to re-focus on its strengths by consolidating resources and providing greater support to the company's key products - its Powerbrands. To this end it has jettisoned smaller portfolio initiatives, such as the Medcom hospital business in Russia. Supercharge has also been the trigger to reduce the operating regions from three to two, bringing developing markets under a single leadership. RB expects annual savings of £100-150 million once the re-structure is complete. Organizationally, the re-structure is intended to increase agility in the marketplace by reducing levels of decision-making and bringing a greater level of focus on specific customer groups.
  </p>
        <p>
   Reckitt Benckiser is eyeing up emerging markets - particularly China, which is now one of 16 designated 'Powermarkets' - as key to long-term growth. To reflect this, the company has raised China's profile internally, as well as the seniority and compensation of the regional management team: RB now focuses its most talented members on China. China is also a guinea pig for e-commerce initiatives (25% of revenue in China comes from digital sales), which are then rolled out across the globe. Indeed, e-commerce is a growing pillar for the business, and more than 50% of media impressions are through online and the increase in the quantity and depth of customer data is heightening sensitivity to customer demand.
  </p>
        <p>RB is weighing up the sale of its entire food business, which includes brands such as French's Mustard and could fetch some £2 billion. The company is trying to generate cash in preparation for the purchase of Mead Johnson, a baby nutrition company.</p>
        <p>
   In 2016, RB has faced a spate of negative press over a series of deaths in South Korea attributable to RB products, fines in Australia for misleading packaging and a dispute over CEO pay.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The downturn in Europe curtailed activity on the acquisition front in 2015. In 2014, RB purchased the K-Y brand of intimate lubricants from Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary McNeil for its sexual wellbeing unit, which includes condom brand Durex. The deal is expected to make significant contributions to the unit's business in Brazil and the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2017, the company agreed to acquire
   <company id="104556">
    Mead Johnson Nutrition
   </company>
   , a maker of baby formula, for $16.6 billion. Seeing as Reckitt Benckiser already owns prophylactic brand Durex, the acquisition of the baby formula company looks a hedge on a grand scale: If Durex sales go down, one assumes baby formula sales will go up, and vice versa.

        <p>
   Reckitt &amp; Colman's roots can be traced to Jeremiah Colman, who bought a flour mill near Norwich, England, in 1804. In 1823 his nephew James joined the company, and their business was incorporated as J. and J. Colman. Jeremiah died in 1851 and James' son, also named Jeremiah, became a partner, taking over the operations when his father died in 1854. The company moved to Carrow that year.
  </p>
        <p>
   Colman worked to make the Carrow facilities as self-sufficient and waste-free as possible. The factory had its own foundry, print shop, paper mill (to make containers), and fire brigade. By-products from the milling process were sold to farmers for cattle feed and fertilizer. The company continued to expand, adding wheat flour and using the leftover starch from milling operations to make laundry bluing.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1903 the mill acquired Keen, Robinson &amp; Co., a manufacturer of spices. J. and J. Colman got a lock on British mustard sales in 1912 when it acquired its only major competitor, Joseph Farrow &amp; Company. A year later it joined another rival, starch maker Reckitt &amp; Sons, in a joint venture in South America. The joint venture between Colman and Reckitt was a success, and in 1921 they pooled their overseas operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   The two companies created Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd. in 1938 to manage their operations, although each company maintained a separate listing on the London Stock Exchange. In 1954 they formally merged into a single entity.
  </p>
        <p>
   Reckitt &amp; Colman formed its US subsidiary in 1977, and during the 1980s it made a number of acquisitions (Airwick air fresheners, Gold Seal bath products) to expand its presence in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1990 the firm picked up such brands as Black Flag (insecticide), Woolite (fabric care), and Easy-Off (oven cleaner) when it bought Boyle-Midway from American Home Products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company gained the Lysol brand in 1994 when it bought L&amp;F Household from Eastman Kodak. To help finance the $1.6 billion deal, Reckitt &amp; Colman sold its flagship Colman Mustard unit to
   <company id="93845">
    Unilever
   </company>
   . Its French's operations in the US (mustard, Worcestershire sauce) were its only remaining food business.
  </p>
        <p>
   Michael Colman, the last active family member, stepped down as chairman in 1995. In 1996 it sold its US personal products unit.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Reckitt &amp; Colman bought certain cleaning products brands, including Spray'n Wash and Glass Plus, from
   <company id="40403">
    S.C. Johnson &amp; Son
   </company>
   for about $160 million. CEO Vernon Sankey resigned in 1999, and Michael Turrell became the acting chief executive.
  </p>
        <p>
   Johann A. Benckiser founded Benckiser in 1823 in the Netherlands to make industrial chemicals. The company launched Calgon Water Softener in 1956 and released Calgonit automatic dishwashing detergent in 1964. From 1982 to 1992 a number of acquisitions expanded the company's market in Central Europe and North America. By 1999 Benckiser's products were sold in 45 countries, including Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Reckitt Benckiser announced plans to unload 75 brands to focus on more growth-oriented brands. As part of an effort to expand its presence in the Asia/Pacific region, Reckitt Benckiser bought Korean household products maker Oxy Co. (Oxy Clean fabric treatment) in 2001.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the company won FDA approval to market Subutex and Suboxone in the US. Both are drugs for the treatment of opiate dependence. They are available in 24 other countries.
  </p>
        <p>
   In early 2006 Reckitt Benckiser completed the previously announced acquisition of Boots Healthcare International (BHI) from Boots Group (now Alliance Boots) for about about £1.9 billion. BHI is a leading UK maker of drugs such as Nurofen (ibuprofen) and Strepsils (sore throat remedy).
  </p>
        <p>
   Attempting to spin some positive press and focus on its environmental efforts, the company announced in 2007 that it had set a goal to reduce the total carbon footprint of its products by 20% by 2020. Since then, Reckitt Benckiser has reduced the amount of plastic in its Vanish cleaner packaging by 70%. The company in 2008 also became one of 40 companies to be awarded the champion status in the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative (SDSI).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company added to its lineup in 2008 when it acquired Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, known for its Mucinex brand.
  </p>
        <p>
   In April 2011 Reckitt Benckiser acquired India's Paras Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  for about £460 million ($726 million).
