   Things are heating up at BTU International. BTU makes, sells, and services thermal processing equipment and controls for the manufacture of printed circuit boards and for semiconductor packaging. The company provides its PYRAMAX branded systems for solder reflow (for printed circuit boards), as well as technical ceramic sintering, electrical component brazing, and the deposition of film coatings. BTU equipment is also used to make photovoltaic solar cells and solid oxide fuel cells, and for sintering nuclear fuel. The company sells its products to the alternative energy and electronics assembly markets, mostly manufacturers of computers, printed circuit board assemblies, and consumer electronics products.

  <p>
   BTU caters to many corners of the map through its operations in the US and international subsidiaries in China, the UK, Singapore, and Malaysia. The company's most profitable geographical group by far is the Asia/Pacific region; this area of the world generates around 65% of its total sales each year.

  <p>
   BTU markets and sells its products primarily through its direct sales force and independent sales representatives to multinational original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturing companies (Uniscope is a key customer in China). It also targets the electronics, alternative energy, automotive, and other industries.

  <p>
   After enjoying a record-setting year in 2010, BTU saw its revenues and net income plummet for 2011 and 2012. Revenues fell 24% from $76 million in 2011 to $58 million in 2012. The declines in 2012 were driven by a 34% drop in sales from the US and a 27% drop from its main market, the Asia/Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   These decreases were majorly due to a 75% drop in overall alternative energy systems sales driven by the continued weakening of the worldwide solar industry which began in the second quarter of 2011. BTU was also stung by a 28% dip from parts and service and other market systems sales in 2012 due to the cyclical nature of the parts and service business combined with a decrease in other market system sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   BTU also suffered net losses for 2011 (nearly $3 million) and 2012 ($11 million). Its net loss increased in 2012 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $424,000 in 2012, due to the continued slowdown in the company's solar market product line and a decrease in other operating income.

  <p>
   Internationally, BTU will continue to look outside the US for the bulk of its sales. The company has increased its engineering and manufacturing capabilities in China to take advantage of a growing demand for its electronic products. (Roughly 60% of the company's employees reside outside the US.) Despite the recent downturn in the solar market, BTU is determined to expand its alternative energy related operations, especially as they pertain to solar energy. It also strives to penetrate further into the electronics markets while also tapping new customers and keeping a lid on costs.
