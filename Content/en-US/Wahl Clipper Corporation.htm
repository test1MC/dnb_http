   Wahl has boosted promotion of its home haircutting kits. It's also pushing newer products, such as its Wahl Lithium Ion Grooming Kit that is said to be the first grooming tool to be powered by rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The fastest-growing segment also rolled out men's-specific items, the PRO ION Clipper with Lithium Ion, BravMini+, and KM5 Professional 2 Speed Clipper products.

   Wahl has concentrated on increasing its presence overseas. In recent years the company has opened subsidiaries in Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. It also expanded its footprint in the US by recently completing a 124,000-sq.-ft. expansion at its primary Sterling, Illinois, plant.

  <p>
   Besides strategically adding subsidiaries to secure its foothold globally, Wahl has grown internationally in recent years through acquisitions. Its purchase of UK-based Kim Laube &amp; Company added pet clippers to its products portfolio and its Swenson Canada buy brought grooming appliances.
