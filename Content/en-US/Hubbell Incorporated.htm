   You don't have to go into space to check out this Hubbell. The company makes electrical and electronic products for commercial, industrial, telecommunications, and utility applications. Its electrical segment, which accounts for more than two-thirds of sales, includes wiring, connector and grounding products, lighting fixtures and controls, and other electrical equipment used by electricians and electrical contractors and maintenance personnel. The power segment includes distribution, transmission, substation, and telecommunications products used by electric utilities. The company gets most of its sales in the US.

  <p>
   Hubbell has manufacturing or sales facilities across the Americas, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East. It has joint ventures in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The company generates more than 85% of sales from the US, with Canada, the UK, and Switzerland representing its three largest international markets. Products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the US, Canada, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Mexico, China, Italy, the UK, Brazil, and Australia. Hubbell also maintains offices in Singapore, China, India, Mexico, South Korea and countries in the Middle East.

  <p>
   The company sells its electrical segment products through a wide variety of channels, including electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential lighting websites. Special application products are sold through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers, and OEMs. High voltage products are sold primarily by direct sales to customers through its sales engineers.

  <p>
   Hubbell has reported five straight years of significant growth (2010-2015). Revenues rose by 1% in 2015 to peak at a record-setting $3.39 billion. The historic growth was the result of electrical segment acquisitions and higher organic volumes attributed to growth in high voltage projects and improvements in the residential sector. Power segment sales also grew by 4% in 2015 due to acquisitions and higher organic volumes driven by an increase in distribution and transmission spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Hubbell's net income declined 15% to $277 million in 2015 due to a spike in expenses associated with acquisition costs. Hubbell's operating cash flow also decreased by 15% in 2015 due to unfavorable changes in inventories and in current liabilities.

  <p>
   Hubbell is focused primarily on organic growth through new product launches and enhanced sales and marketing efforts. It is increasing selling prices to offset rising costs of raw materials and components. The company continues to increase the amount of materials, components and finished goods that are sourced from or manufactured in lower-cost countries, including Mexico and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also grows through strategic acquisitions. In 2016 Hubbell acquired R.W. Lyall &amp; Company, an expert in the design and application of components and assemblies for the natural gas distribution market. The purchase price was $129 million, and the acquisition was integrated into its Electrical segment.
