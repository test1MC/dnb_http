   Bio-Rad Laboratories makes a most excellent array of research laboratory and medical testing equipment. The company manufactures and supplies more than 8,000 products through two segments. Its clinical diagnostics segment makes products used in blood, fluid, and tissue testing to detect diseases such as diabetes. Its life science unit offers instruments, apparatus, reagents, and software used in lab settings to study life processes, potential drugs, and food pathogens. Bio-Rad has a sales force that sells directly to such end users as clinical labs, pharmaceutical firms, hospitals, government agencies, and universities. More than two-thirds of sales come from outside the US.

  <p>
   About 65% of Bio-Rad's revenues come from its clinical diagnostics segment with life science accounting for the rest. Bio-Rad operates manufacturing facilities in the US, Singapore, China, and Europe.

  <p>
   Headquartered in the US, Bio-Rad operates in several countries across North America and Europe, as well as in Brazil, Russia, Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore. Europe accounted for 39% of the company's revenue in 2015, while the the US accounted for 36% and the Asia-Pacific region for 19%. The company has development and sales operations in the US, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK.

  <p>
   Much of Bio-Rad's global growth comes from customers in emerging markets in Eastern Europe and China. The company sells directly and through distributors in some 35 countries. It maintains separate sales staffs for the clinical diagnostics and life science units. Customers include hospitals, laboratories, universities and medical schools, industrial research organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biotechnology researchers, food producers, and food testing laboratories.

  <p>
   Bio-Rad's sales slumped 7% to $2.01 billion in 2015 from $2.19 billion in 2014. Without the impact of foreign currency, 2015 sales would have risen 1.6% compared to 2014. US sales were unaffected by the strong dollar and they rose 4% in 2015. Sale sin all other regions were lower in 2015 from 2014. Bright spots in the life science segment were Bio-Rad's Droplet Digital PCR, western blotting, process chromatography media, and cell biology products. Clinical diagnostics had better sales of its quality control and immunology products while sales of blood typing and infectious disease products dropped.
  </p>
  <p>
   The picture was a bit different on the bottom line with Bio-Rad posting a 27% profit increase to $113 million in 2015. The company cut costs for selling, general and administrative (down 6%) and research and development (down 12%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $186 million in 2015, 32% lower than 2014.

   Bio-Rad develops new technologies for researcher and clinicians. For researchers working with DNA, it is developing an approach to DNA sequence analysis that could reduce the sample-to-answer time to less than four hours. Areas in which the technology could be used include assays for cancer, immune compatibility, and prenatal screening.

  <p>
   In 2015, Bio-Rad partnered with
   <company id="100282">
    Illumina Inc.
   </company>
   to develop next-generation sequencing workflow for single-cell analysis. The end-to-end commercial tool would enable high-throughput sequencing of thousands of individual cells, which should make the process faster and less expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bio-Rad joined the Consortium for Sequencing the Food Supply Chain, which was established by scientists from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   Research and
   <company id="40297">
    Mars Inc.
   </company>
   The consortium is combining advanced genomics with informatics tools to observe microbial communities in food and detect hazards in the food supply chain that can threaten safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is dependent on the capital spending of its customers. Academic research customers could be affected by reductions in research budgets, especially for basic research. The pharmaceutical industry has seen several mergers, which could consolidate some of Bio-Rad's sales for lab supplies.

  <p>
   In 2014, Bio-Rad bought GnuBIO, which develops DNA sequencing technology. GnuBio's DNA sequencing technology incorporates the functions of DNA sequencing into a single workflow and it should strengthen Bio-Rad in the clinical diagnostics sequencing market. The GnuBIO assets were valued at some $46 million.
