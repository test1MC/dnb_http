   Atmel is a leading maker of microcontrollers, which are used in a wide range of products, from computers and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, e-readers) to automobile motor control systems, television remote controls, and solid-state lighting. In addition, the company offers touchscreen controllers and sensors, nonvolatile memory devices, and radio frequency (RF) and wireless components. Its chips are used worldwide in consumer, communications, industrial, military, and networking applications. Most of Atmel's sales come from customers outside the US. In mid-2016 the company was bought by Microchip, a chip maker, for $3.6 billion.

  <p>
   In 2014 Atmel realigned its business segments for allocation of resources and focus on core its markets. The company created the Multi-Market and Other segment while eliminating the former Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   But it's the Microcontroller segment that leads the way for Atmel, accounting for 70% of the company's sales. The segment includes Atmel's general purpose microcontroller and microprocessor families, AVR 8-bit and 32-bit products, SMART ARM-based products, Atmel's 8051 8-bit products, and designated commercial wireless products, including low power radio and SOC products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nonvolatile Memory segment, 12% of sales, includes electrically erasable programmable read-only, erasable programmable read-only memory ('EPROM') devices and secure cryptographic products. The Automotive segment, 11%, makes devices for automotive electronics, including products using radio frequency technology. The new segment, Multi-Market and Other, is 7% of sales, and includes application specific and standard products for aerospace applications and legacy products.

  <p>
   The company generates about 60% of its sales from Asia, including about a third from China and Hong Kong. After China and Hong Kong, the US is Atmel's largest market, accounting for 15% of sales with sales in Germany at 14%.

   Atmel markets its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) via a direct sales force, as well as through distribution partners; each method accounts for about half of revenue.

   Revenue rose 2% to $1.4 billion in 2014 from $1.39 billion in 2013, boosted by a 4% increase in microcontroller sales. The unit experienced demand from industrial, automotive, and communications markets. The addition of Newport Media, acquired in mid-2014, also abetted microcontroller revenue. Sales in the nonvolatile memory segment were up 9% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the bottom line, Atmel went from a $22 million loss in 2013 to a $32 million profit in 2014. Profit was pushed by revenue growth as well as a lack of charges the company contended with in 2013. Cash flow from operations jumped 41% higher in 2014 to about $180 billion from $127 million in 203.

  <p>
   Looking to pursue a "fab-lite" strategy of streamlining existing facilities and relying more on silicon foundries (contract manufacturers of semiconductors), Atmel has sold most of its manufacturing plants and now operates only one fab, located in Colorado. Wafer fabs are highly expensive to build and maintain, mostly due to the cost of semiconductor production equipment, and pushing some of those costs off on the foundries, many of which have state-of-the-art plants, is attractive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atmel has increased the release of new products in the past three years, aiming to provide customers with high performing microcontrollers than use little power. The company has found a place for its products within the Internet of Things, the conglomeration of devices that communicate through the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has pushed its line of maXTouch products for touchscreens in smartphones and tables. The products have found acceptance in automotive, consumer, and industrial markets. While that line thrives, Atmel sold its XSense line of touch sensors to UniPixel in 2015. Atmel maintained possession of the XSense patent portfolio, which it licensed to UniPixel.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its sale to Dialog, Atmel gets access to a range of new customers within Atmel's portfolio. Dialog expects to benefit from Atmel's products primed for the Internet of Things. The combined company would have about $2.7 billion sales annually. The deal is expected to close in the 2016 first quarter.

   In agreeing to be bought by Microchip, Atmel ended a deal to be purchased by
   <company id="101549">
    Dialog
   </company>
   . Atmel management said company shareholders would get a better return from the Microchip deal. Atmel was on the hook for a $137 million termination fee to be paid to Dialog. The Dialog offer had been valued at $4.6 billion when it was made, but the value of Atmel stock has declined since then. The Atmel-Microchip deal enables the companies to gather competitive strength with complementary technologies and products.

  <p>
   In 2014 Atmel acquired Newport Media Inc., a provider of advanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products. This acquisition expands Atmel's wireless portfolio with the addition of 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Those product should speed up Atmel's introduction of low-energy Bluetooth products.

   George Perlegos -- a former
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   design engineer and co-founder of chip maker SEEQ Technology (later acquired by LSI Logic, now
   <company id="13932">
    LSI Corp.
   </company>
   ) -- founded Atmel in 1984. (The name was short for Advanced Technology for Memory and Logic.) The enterprise started with a $30,000 investment and a $5.1 million design contract from
   <company id="15718">
    General Instrument
   </company>
   ; it soon added military and corporate contracts. In 1991 the company went public and introduced the first three-volt flash memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atmel built its business by developing fast, power-efficient chips -- perfect for portable electronics. It acquired Concurrent Logic, a maker of field-programmable gate arrays (user-programmable chips), in 1993. One year later Atmel became the #1 producer of EEPROMs (electrically erasable programmable ROM chips) when it bought SEEQ's chip business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its product line, in 1995 Atmel licensed SRAM (static random-access memory) technology in an alliance with Paradigm Technology (now part of
   <company id="44018">
    IXYS
   </company>
   ) for use in creating multimedia chips. It purchased RISC chip technology (which uses shorter instruction sets for faster processing) from Norwegian chip maker Nordic VLSI in 1996.
