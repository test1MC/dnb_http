   COFCO is many things, among them an oil and food importer and exporter and a bottler for
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   products in mainland China. The company holds a monopoly on mainland China's grain trade, but COFCO's manufacturing and financing interests are broadly diversified and include tea, wine, edible oils, ramen noodles, canned food, confectionery, ingredients, livestock and meat, as well as commodities trading, hotels, timber, ethanol, packaging, real estate, and insurance. Nine divisions and 30-plus subsidiaries market products and services under name brands, such as Fortune edible oils, Le Conté chocolate, Jellee candies, Jojok meat, Great Wall wines, and the Gloria Hotel. COFCO is owned by the Chinese government.

   China's leading food manufacturer seeks to fuel its growth through acquisitions, but not always successfully. In 2011 COFCO's Australian unit, Tully Sugar, bid A$120 million (more than $125 million) for local cooperative Proserpine Sugar Mill (PSM), but was rebuffed. Its target's board chose to enter administration instead. PSM rejected a earlier takeover proposal from Sucrogen.

   In April 2014, COFCO paid $1.5 billion for a 51% stake in Noble Group's agricultural products trading unit in a bid to broaden its access to food supplies abroad.

   Strengthening its wine portfolio, COFCO acquired French wine producer Chateau de Viaud in early 2011. The deal established COFCO as the first Chinese wine merchant to own a winery in France's prestigious Bordeaux region (which yields some of the world's most expensive vintages). The company said purchasing Chateau de Viaud presented a new path to the global marketplace for COFCO's Great Wall wine brand, which is sold in China.In 2009 the company acquired bankrupt Beijing-based instant noodle maker Wu Gu Dao Chang. Later that year COFCO paid ¥194 million ($23 million) to take over Maverick Food (previously a joint venture between US pork producer

   and Belgium company Artal Group). The purchase strengthened COFCO's meat industry production chain.
