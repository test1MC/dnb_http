   serves as administrative agent on $340 million in revolving credit facilities for subsidiaries of Wise Metals which enable it to grow and expand its businesses.

   Seeking some guarantee of financial stability in terms of wage costs, in 2012 Wise Metals Group the company signed a new five-year labor contract with its largest union, United Steelworkers Local 200.

   That year the company completed a $25 million expansion of its Alabama Reclamation Operation in Muscle Shoals, a move that expanded its capabilities and added more than 40 new employees.
