   As one of the nation's largest lip-care product makers, Blistex intends to gloss over its competition. The company is best known for its slew of slick lip treatments and treats sold under the Blistex name. Products range from medicated berry balm to a lip massage or infusion. Dipping into other personal care niche markets, Blistex product lines include Stridex acne medication, Foille first aid ointment, Kank-A which provided solutions tailored to specific oral pain needs, and Ivarest, a skin care brand. Blistex sells its products primarily through supermarkets such as

  <p>
   The company's strategy has focused on growth through Blistex brand-building promotions and product proliferation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Blistex launched Ultra-Rich Hydration to the Blistex Enhancement Series line-up, which includes Blistex DeepRenewal (an anti-aging lip treatment with Coenzyme Q10 and hyaluronic spheres); Blistex Silk &amp; Shine (which delivers satiny smooth lips plus a light glossy shine); and Blistex LipVibrance (which offers moisturization and protection plus a touch of color and shimmer).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also maintains its top line through licensing agreements. Among the more creative, it sealed a deal with the maker of the Mexican soft drink Jarritos to market a co-branded mandarin-orange flavored lip balm targeted at the burgeoning Hispanic market in the US. In 2014, it introduced Blistex Orange Mango Blast.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blistex added Lip Vibrance (a balm with subtle color and shimmer) to its portfolio in 2013.

  <p>
   In 2011, the lip balm company entered the foot care niche by purchasing the Odor-Eaters brand portfolio from privately-held
   <company id="101174">
    Combe Incorporated
   </company>
   . Odor-Eaters is the #1 brand in controlling foot odor and wetness with insoles, powders, and sprays. Blistex looks to tap Odor-Eaters' broad distribution, which includes the US and more than 30 international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jumping on the anti-aging bandwagon, Blistex in 2011 launched Deep Renewal, an anti-aging lip treatment, and Blistex Revive &amp; Restore.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blistex was founded it in 1947.
