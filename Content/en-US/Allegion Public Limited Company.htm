  <p>
   Allegion believes the future of the security industry lies in addressing the needs of an increasingly connected world. It plans to invest in the electronic side of its business in order to grow. It will capitalize on trends such as increased global urbanization, the shift toward electronic and intelligent security products, and the anticipated global rebound of commercial and residential construction markets.

  <p>
   In early 2014 Allegion acquired Schlage Lock de Colombia S.A., one of the largest mechanical lock manufacturers in Colombia. The acquisition will enable Allegion to leverage its branded residential and commercial product lines to grow its presence in the Spanish-speaking South American security market.
