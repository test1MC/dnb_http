   Making sausage might not be a pretty process, but Viscofan tidies it up at the end. The company is one of the world's largest makers of artificial sausage casings. It manufactures casings in some 14 countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Viscofan sells its cellulose, collagen, and plastic casings and food film to food processors; it produces both edible small diameter and non-edible large diameter collagen and plastic casings. About 61% of Viscofan's revenue comes from customers in Europe, Asia and its home market, Spain. The company was founded in 1975.

  <p>
   Spain's Viscofan has production sites in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Brazil, China, Mexico, Uruguay, and the US.

  <p>
   Viscofan's revenue increased 8% to €741million in 2015 from 2014 with stronger sales primarily in Western Europe and Asia. The strength of the US dollar in relation to the Euro helped increase North American sales 10% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company packaged a 13% increase in net income with its sales rise. Profit hit €120 in 2015, compared with €106 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also was higher in 2015, reaching €138 million from €109 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Growing daily consumption of animal protein among the world's population -- particularly in markets such as China, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe -- presents an opportunity for companies such as Viscofan. To capitalize on this growth, the Spainish casings company is adhering to its "BeMORE" strategy launched in 2012 and running through 2015. The strategy aims to strengthen Viscofan's leading position in the market by becoming more efficient and increasing penetration of emerging markets for its casings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company pronounced that it successfully emerged from the BeMORE strategy in 2015 and re-upped with more BeMORE plans. It seeks to improve technology, service, and costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold it Industrias Alimentarias de Navarra (IAN) subsidiary, which processes and cans olives, asparagus, and other vegetables under the Carretilla brand. Viscofan received about €56 million.

  <p>
   Founded in Pamplona, Spain, in 1975, Viscofan became a worldwide leader in sausage casings during the 1980s. In the mid-1980s the company was banned from doing business in the US for ten years for stealing trade secrets from rival Envirodyne Industries (now Viskase Companies). Still, Viscofan's share of the world market grew from 8% in 1987 to 12% by 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Industrias Alimentarias de Navarra (IAN), a Spanish producer of canned vegetables, in 1988. Two years later Viscofan acquired Naturin GmbH &amp; Co., a German maker of casings. Sales soared from the purchase, which was followed in 1992 by job cuts. Viscofan also added facilities in Peru and Brazil in the early 1990s. The company acquired a majority stake in Gamex, a casings maker in the Czech Republic, in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   After its US ban was lifted, Viscofan reentered the country in 1995, quickly capturing about 3% of the market. By the following year the company had increased its share to 10%, mainly by undercutting the prices of rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   With demand exceeding supply at its Detroit plant, in 1998 Viscofan established another US plant in Montgomery, Alabama. A listeria scare in the US and economic woes in Russia hurt sales in 1998 and 1999. In 2000 Viscofan added a plant in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a plan to pare down non-core operations, in early 2003 Viscofan's IAN subsidiary announced the sale of its canned fruit business to Iberfruta. The next year the company increased its production capacity in Brazil and invested in a facility in Mexico. In 2005 Viscofan purchased Serbian firm Koteksprodukt, a producer of collagen big caliber casings, and TEEPAK, a casing maker with plants in the US and Mexico.
