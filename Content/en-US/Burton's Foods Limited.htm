   When the cookie crumbles, Burton's Foods still has plenty of pounds (sterling). Doing business as Burton's Biscuit Co., the company is one of the UK's largest suppliers of biscuits (cookies in the US). Burton's bakes up such iconic brands as Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels, and, under a manufacturing agreement with

   chocolate biscuits. Its other brands include Viscount and Maryland cookies. Burton's also makes private-label biscuits and some confectionery products. Its lineup is distributed and marketed in Europe and North America. Founded in 2000, the company is the result of a merger of Burton's Gold Medal Biscuits and Horizon Biscuits. Burton's has been owned by

   Burton's invests heavily to stay ahead of the competition. It recently concluded a three-year, Â£40 million capital investment program that included upgrading and updating its production facilities and providing updated training for employees. It also invests in R&amp;D to develop new products like its savory line, which includes Cathedral City Baked Bites cheddar crackers and Fish 'n' Chips salt and vinegar crackers.
