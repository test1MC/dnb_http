   Celgene lines up cells and genes to create good health. The biopharmaceutical company's lead product is Revlimid, which is approved in the US, Europe, and other select markets as a treatment for multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer). Revlimid also is used to treat a blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The company's second-biggest seller is another treatment for MDS called Vidaza; the drug is also approved to treat leukemia in Europe. Other products include Thalomid, used to treat patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma, as well as breast cancer treatment Abraxane and lymphoma drug Istodax. The firm has other drugs in development that combat inflammatory diseases and cancer.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revlimid is by far the company's biggest seller, making up some two-thirds of Celgene's annual sales. Its other top selling products -- Vidaza, Otezla, Pomalyst, and Abraxane -- make up most of its remaining revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of blood cancers and diseases, Celgene receives royalties on sales of ADHD drugs Focalin, Focalin XR, and Ritalin LA, which are licensed to and sold by global drugmaker
   <company id="114003">
    Novartis
   </company>
   . The company also makes a small amount of revenues from its Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary, which is is researching stem cell therapies for diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis, and its Lifebank USA unit, which operates a blood bank in which parents may choose to store their newborn's cord and placenta stem cells as a way to combat possible blood diseases the child might contract later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is developing novel small molecules that target PDE4, an intracellular enzyme that regulates the production of multiple pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Other therapies in the works include CC-122 and CC-220, which are being tested for hematological and solid tumor cancers, MS, and for neuro-inflammation.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for about 60% of revenues, with Europe accounting for most of the rest of sales. However, Celgene is working to expand its global presence. Its products reach customers in more than 50 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to global sales and service locations, Celgene operates manufacturing plants in the US (Phoenix) and Switzerland (Boudry and Zofingen) that meet a majority of its needs, though some of the firm's products are made by third-party manufacturers. The company also has sales and research offices in California, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington, DC.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Celgene sells its products through a global direct sales force, as well as via independent representatives in select markets (primarily in Latin America). In the US, products are distributed primarily to wholesalers and, in the case of Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Thalomid, specialty pharmacies (the drugs must be handled under special risk-management programs due to blood clot risks associated with the drugs). Otezla is marketed directly to consumers through print and television advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10984">
    CVS
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   are the company's two largest customers, representing 11% and 8% of sales, respectively, in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In international markets, the company's products are distributed to hospitals, clinics, and retailers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's strategies of making select acquisitions, finding new uses for existing drugs, and conducting proprietary R&amp;D to keep its pipeline well-stocked seem to be paying off. Celgene has achieved rapidly climbing revenues in recent years as its product offerings have grown, including a 21% revenue increase to $9.2 billion in 2015. Higher sales of Revlamid, Abraxane, Otezla, and Pomalyst, both in the US and abroad, have helped strengthen the company's earning power. These gains were partially offset by declines in sales of Vidaza and Thalomid.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income had also been on the rise but in 2015 it dropped 20% to $1.6 billion. This was primarily due to increased R&amp;D expenses related to collaborations, as well as higher selling, general, and administrative expenses to support the group's inflammation and immunology products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations, like revenue and net income, had been on the rise, but fell 11% to $2.5 billion in 2015. Celgene's lower net income led to that drop, as did an increase in cash used in accounts receivable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Key focus areas for the company include hematology, oncology, inflammation, and immunology. Though Celgene has a little breathing room before it loses market exclusivity on most of its products, the firm is still working avidly to avoid the dips in revenue that go hand-in-hand with patent losses by adding or developing new drugs and pipeline candidates through internal development, collaborations, and acquisitions. Vidaza's patent expired in the US in 2011, for instance, though no competing generic versions of the drug have been approved so far. In 2013 Celgene contracted with Sandoz to sell a generic version of Vidaza in the US; the drug's regulatory exclusivity is expected to continue in Europe through 2018. Celgene's other major drug patents aren't set to expire for several years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many of the firm's internal programs are focused on getting its marketed drugs approved for other indications. For instance, Revlimid is in clinical trials to treat ailments including forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukemia, as well as to treat newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, and Istodax is under development for solid tumor cancers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is looking to gain US approval for Vidaza to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML); it is already used for AML indications in Europe. Abraxane is being tested to treat skin, lung, bladder, and other cancers. Other candidates target additional hematological cancers, solid tumors, anemia, and inflammatory conditions. In 2015, Otezla was granted approval by the European Commission for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the largest up-front payment for a biotechnology licensing agreement to date, Celgene in 2015 paid $1 billion to gain access to innovative cancer treatments being developed by Juno Therapeutics. The collaboration deal gives Celgene the option to partner with Juno on the commercialization of its cancer drugs and cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases; Juno will retain responsibilities for R&amp;D and commercialization in North America, while Celgene will take on the development and commercialization duties in the rest of the world. The deal also gives Celgene a 10% stake in Juno.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Celgene entered into a global development deal with Agios. The partners are testing AG-881 for the treatment of brain cancer. In another collaboration with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   subsidiary
   <company id="10176">
    MedImmune
   </company>
   , Celgene is exploring the treatment of blood cancer through the MEDI4736 antibody.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has collaboration agreements with Lycera, Nurix, and
   <company id="163008">
    Epizyme
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company moved to expand its position in the field of innovative cancer therapies when it bought privately held Quanticel Pharmaceuticals for some $100 million. Through the deal, Celgene gained access to Quanticel's platform for the single-cell genomic analysis of cancer and its lead programs targeting epigenetic modifiers. Also that year, Celgene bought
   <company id="162997">
    Receptos
   </company>
   , gaining that firm's ozanimod candidate for the treatment of multiple ailments including relapsing multiple sclerosis. That deal was valued at $7.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2017 Celgene agreed to buy Delinia, a private biotech with a focus on developing novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, for an initial payment of $300 million plus a potential $475 million in milestone payments.
