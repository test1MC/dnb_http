   Digital Angel puts a British accent on two-way communication equipment. The company develops emergency identification products for use in global positioning systems and other applications and distributes them in the UK. Digital Angel's conventional radio systems provide such services as site monitoring for construction companies and manufacturers while its trunked radio systems serve the security needs of large customers, such as local governments and public utilities. In mid-2012 the company announced a strategic shift toward the development of games and applications for mobile devices. It has several titles in progress.

  <p>
   Founded as a computer sales business by Larry and Scott Axon in 1988, Applied Cellular Technology (ACT) foundered until it turned its sights toward the wireless communications market in 1991. ACT specialized in mobile communication and data collection using wireless computers. Veteran technology executive Richard Sullivan came onboard as CEO in 1993. ACT went public the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 ACT started an acquisition streak to accumulate know-how in computer-aided design, retailing applications, and satellite subsystems, among other areas. In 1998 it pulled out of a proposed merger with Able Telcom Holding over shareholder concerns about ACT's stock price, and instead it bought industrial heating and cooling control company Control Technology Specialists.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 ACT, restructuring to offer a more complete list of digital communications services, changed its name to
   <company id="44498">
    Applied Digital Solutions
   </company>
   . That year the company began selling off non-core operations, including its electronic controls and contracting subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued in 2000 when the company bought WebNet Services, e-commerce company Timely Technology, and animal tracking chip developer Destron Fearing, which Applied Digital combined with its digital mini-transceiver technology development operations to form subsidiary Digital Angel. Also late in 2000, Applied Digital acquired a controlling interest in SysComm International (later InfoTech USA and IFTH Acquisition), a systems integrator and computer hardware reseller.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 the company restructured debt agreements with IBM Credit and other creditors; throughout that year, the company continued to sell off non-core businesses. (Further rounds of both debt restructuring and asset sales continued into 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Applied Digital completed sales or closures of all non-core businesses, leaving it with three operating segments: its Advanced Technology unit, which included the VeriChip injectable tracking device and Thermo Life thermoelectric generator; Digital Angel; and 52%-owned InfoTech USA. That year the company spun off Digital Angel as a separate, public company by merging it with Medical Advisory Systems (which changed its name to
   <company id="60740">
    Digital Angel Corporation
   </company>
   ); Applied Digital retained a majority stake in the new company.
  </p>
  <p>
   VeriChip won
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for its product in 2004. It acquired wireless identification product provider
   <company id="112447">
    eXI Wireless
   </company>
   in 2005. VeriChip went public early in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2007 Applied Digital Solutions acquired the 45% of its
   <company id="60740">
    Digital Angel
   </company>
   subsidiary that it didn't previously own and merged the two companies, eliminating redundant costs associated with both companies being publicly held. The company officially changed its name to Digital Angel in mid-2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Digital Angel's strategy in 2007-2008 revolved around a restructuring plan heavily focused on divesting itself of various business lines and subsidiaries, with the goal of concentrating on its two remaining business segments: animal identification and emergency identification.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its overall restructuring plan, in early 2008 the company pared down its ownership stake in VeriChip to 45%, and sold that remaining stake in VeriChip and related assets to R&amp;R Consulting Partners for about $1.6 million in cash later that year. R&amp;R Consulting Partners is a company controlled by Scott Silverman, the former chairman and CEO of Digital Angel.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Digital Angel had previously pinned much of its marketing and development efforts on the VeriChip product, the controversial offering (due to fears that it could be used to track and monitor a wide range of human activities, ala Big Brother) was never profitable for the company and failed to gain widespread adoption.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other units and subsidiaries that the company sold or wound down included IFTH Acquisition Corp. (also known as InfoTech USA), Florida Decision, Computer Equity, Perimeter, OuterLink, Thermo Life Energy, and Xmark (which VeriChip -- still majority-owned by Digital Angel at the time -- sold to to Stanley Canada in 2008 for nearly $48 million in cash.)
