   Xcerra puts semiconductors to the test to make sure that your smartphone works. The company makes automated test equipment (ATE) that chip makers use to test semiconductors as they're manufactured and as part of the final package test. The company's equipment also tests printed circuit boards (PCBs). Its equipment runs tests on devices used in smartphones, modems, PCs, TVs, imaging instruments, and a variety of others. The company sells through four brands: atg-Luther &amp; Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies, LTX-Credence, and Multitest. Xcerra handles some of its manufacturing, but outsources most of it to
   <company id="16141">
    Jabil Circuit
   </company>
   . Most of the company's sales are to customers in Asia.

  <p>
   Sales of Xcerra's semiconductor test equipment accounts for nearly 80% of revenue. The company's automated test equipment (ATE) test platforms are the Diamond series (which includes the flagship Diamondx test system) tests, microcontrollers and cost sensitive consumer and digital-based devices; the X-Series, which tests analog-based devices and those for power, automotive, mixed signal, and RF applications; and ASL platform, which tests linear, low-end mixed signal, precision analog, and power management devices. The company's electronic manufacturing services provide the rest of its revenue.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts, Xcerra has offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. While the US is the company's biggest single geographic market, about 60% of sales come from Asia. Individual markets include Hong Kong/China (17% of revenue), Taiwan (12%), and the Philippines (11%).

  <p>
   After sharp revenue increases in the past three years, Xcerra's revenue slid 19% to $324 million in 2016 (ended July) from about $398 million in 2015. The company blamed the drop on weaker demand from semiconductor customers who were responding to overall economic conditions. Sales were lower in its two product markets and all but one of its geographic markets. Customers in China Hong Kong provided the only increase in 2016 with a 29% sales jump. Xcerra attributed lower service revenue in the Semiconductor Test segment on better reliability of its products, which cut demand for post-warranty service contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even with lower expenses across the board, the company's profit tumbled 60% to $11 million in 2016 from $28 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Xcerra went into negative cash flow ($227,000) in 2016 because of the net loss, a loss on an asset sale, and higher inventories. The company had $42 million cash from operations in 2015.
  </p>

  <p>
   Xcerra knows a company can't be all things to all people, and plans to concentrate its sales, consulting, and service efforts on key accounts, as its industry is so customized. Its top 10 customers make up more than 50% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In accordance with that strategy, the company sold its semiconductor test interface board business to Fastprint Hong Kong Co., a subsidiary of Shenzhen Fastprint Circuit Tech Co. The interface board business made PCBS designed to serve as an interface between the tester and the semiconductor device being tested. Since it was not a testing instrument Xcerra sold it off.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also maintains a lean operation by outsourcing manufacturing and using strategic alliances to outsource distribution, repair, and support functions.

   In 2015, Xcerra acquired Titan, which develops develops testing products for the automotive, RF/Wireless, and mixed signal test markets, for about $2 million.

  <p>
   Xcerra was created from the 2008 merger of LTX Corp. and rival Credence Systems.
  </p>

  <p>
   Graham Miller, Roger Blethen, and others formed LTX in 1976. The company unveiled a linear/mixed-signal test system in 1977 and began developing testers for digital chips via its 1984 acquisition of Trillium. The company launched its enVision programming software for digital testing in 1993 and introduced a digital test system the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Miller served as chairman and CEO for 20 years; Blethen succeeded him as CEO in 1996. LTX restructured in 1996, integrating its West Coast digital and East Coast mixed-signal divisions to focus on Fusion testers (later known as the X-Series). An overall slowdown in the semiconductor industry caused LTX to implement another restructuring in 1998, including facilities consolidation and a 30% workforce reduction, and led to a loss for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's first Fusion system was shipped to
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   in 1998. In 2000 the company sold its iPTest line of specialized semiconductor component testing systems in order to better focus on the Fusion product family. The next year LTX formed a manufacturing partnership with
   <company id="16141">
    Jabil Circuit
   </company>
   , a provider of electronic manufacturing services, for assembling and testing the Fusion systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2002 the company reduced its workforce by 27% in the face of dismal conditions across the semiconductor industry. The company expanded its offerings through its 2003 acquisition of privately held StepTech, a maker of chip testing instrumentation. In 2005 LTX cut headcount by another 28% as tester sales slumped again.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roger Blethen stepped aside as CEO in late 2005; he remained as chairman of the board. Blethen was succeeded by David Tacelli, a 17-year veteran of LTX who had been the company's president and COO since 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   LTX merged with Credence Systems in 2008, creating LTX-Credence Corporation. The combined company made its headquarters in Milpitas, California, where Credence was based. The merger agreement called for Credence CEO Lavi Lev to become executive chairman of the combined company, while LTX CEO David Tacelli took over as president and CEO. Credence shareholders owned just a hair over half of the merged company's shares after the transaction closed, and LTX took five of the nine seats on the combined board of directors. The stock-swap deal was valued at about $177 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lavi Lev resigned as chairman near the end of 2008, and was succeeded by Roger Blethen once again.
  </p>
  <p>
   LTX's sales in fiscal 2008, which ended just before the merger was completed, were down by 8% from the year before, reflecting poor business conditions. Chip makers, especially those making memory devices, were further challenged by lower sales in the second half of calendar 2008, leading many to slash their capital expenditure budgets for 2008 and 2009, which didn't bode well for test equipment vendors.
