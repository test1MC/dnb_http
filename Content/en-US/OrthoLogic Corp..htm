   OrthoLogic, doing business as Capstone Therapeutics, is trying to make sense of scarred skin and damaged hearts with its biopharmaceutical products designed to repair the body's tissues. The biotechnology company is focused on a couple of synthetic peptide technologies that may accelerate healing. Its Chrysalin program has yielded several potential therapies, including TP508, which the company is evaluating as a treatment for vascular diseases, as well as diabetic foot ulcers. OrthoLogic acquired another candidate, AZX100, in 2006 and has begun clinical testing on the drug as a treatment for dermal scarring.

   Industry veteran Allan Weinstein founded OrthoLogic (as IatroMed) in 1987 to develop advanced bone-healing products. Renamed OrthoLogic in 1991, it went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched its OrthoLogic 1000 bone-healing stimulator device in 1994. To boost sales, the firm replaced its distributor network with its own direct-sales force in 1996. But sales actually fell, prompting OrthoLogic to expand its product line through purchases. That year it bought Sutter Corp., maker of a continuous passive motion (CPM) device for knees. In 1997 the firm began selling Hyalgan (from Italian drugmaker Fidia). It also bought the CPM device units of two other firms. That year Weinstein left the company and Thomas Trotter took over as CEO; other new officers were soon brought aboard.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 OrthoLogic took a minority stake in Chrysalis BioTechnology; the company is developing the synthetic peptide Chrysalin, designed to accelerate wound and fracture healing. In 1999 OrthoLogic signed an agreement to provide equipment to Aetna U.S. Healthcare's members to boost flagging sales. Also that year the FDA approved its SpinaLogic device. The next year the firm partnered with Johnson &amp; Johnson unit DePuy AcroMed to sell its SpinaLogic devices around the world, but it stopped selling Hylagen.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 OrthoLogic decided to divest its CPM business. The company sold its bone growth stimulation devices business in 2003. In 2004 OrthoLogic bought out Chrysalis BioTechnology, which the firm is using to develop such new products as Chrysalin, a drug to stimulate fracture healing.
