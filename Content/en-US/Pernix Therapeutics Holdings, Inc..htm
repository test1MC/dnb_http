   While some consider golf a cure for what ails you, others need actual medicine. Pernix Therapeutics, formerly Golf Trust of America, sells branded and generic drugs for allergies, minor infections, and sleep problems. Its products include Cedax for upper respiratory infections, Silenor for insomnia, Khedezla and Cedax antibiotics for middle ear infections, probiotic Rezyst, and cough and cold treatments Zutripro, Rezira, and Vituz. Recent additions include pain killer Zohydro and migraine medication Treximet. Pernix subsidiaries Cypress and Macoven market generic pharmaceuticals while its own sales force peddles the branded products. The company was formed in 1996.

   Pernix seeks growth through acquisitions and, to a lesser degree, through product development. It purchases companies and late-stage products and looks for opportunities to in-license drugs and well-developed drug candidates targeting chronic, non-seasonal, and specialty areas. To that end, in 2013 it purchased migraine treatment Treximet from GlaxoSmithKline for $250 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to all the buying, Pernix does occasionally sell as it did with its Texas-based Pernix Manufacturing in 2013 (after purchasing it the year before for nearly $5 million). The buyer, Woodfield Pharmaceutical, will continue to make the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2016 Pernix announced plans to cut 20% of its workforce. The move follows a number of acquisitions made by the firm, which led to growing net losses.

   In 2013 Pernix bought Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, which netted its Silenor sleep aid, for $25 million in order to broaden its treatments for central nervous system ailments. The previous year it had picked up generic pharmaceutical maker Cypress and its branded subsidiary Hawthorn as well as Great Southern Laboratories, which became Pernix Manufacturing. It sold the manufacturing unit in 2013.
