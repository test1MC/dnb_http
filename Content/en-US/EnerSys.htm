   EnerSys' batteries are there when industrial-strength power is needed. The company makes stationary industrial batteries that provide uninterruptible power and backup power for electronic systems and motive power batteries for big equipment, such as forklifts. Other products include battery chargers and accessories and batteries used for industrial and military applications. The battery manufacturer sells directly and through distributors to more than 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries. It serves distributors, warehouse operators, retailers, airports, and mine operators as well as customers in the telecom, electric utilities, emergency lighting, security systems, and space satellites markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   EnerSys distributes its battery products through two product lines: reserve power products and motive power products. Reserve power batteries are marketed under the ABSL, ABSL Power, ABSL Space, ArmaSafePlus, Cyclon, DataSafe, Genesis, Hawker, Huada, Odyssey, Oerlikon Battery, PowerSafe, and SuperSafe brands; motive power batteries, under the Douglas Battery, Express, Fiamm Motive Power, General Battery, Hawker, Huada, and Ironclad brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each product line contributes half of the company's sales each year. EnerSys operates globally through three geographic regions of the world: Americas (headquarters in Pennsylvania), Europe (Switzerland), and Asia (Singapore).

  <p>
   EnerSys serves customers in more than 100 countries, and generates 55% of its revenue from the US. The company has manufacturing facilities in the following locations: Longmont, Colorado; Hays, Kansas; Richmond, Kentucky; Warrensburg, Missouri; Cleveland; Horsham, Pennsylvania; Sumter, South Carolina; and Ooltewah, Tennessee.
  </p>
  <p>
   International locations reside in Monterrey and Tijuana, Mexico; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Sao Paulo. The EMEA region has locations in Targovishte, Bulgaria; Hostimice, Czech Republic; Arras, France; Hagen and Zwickau, Germany; Bielsko-Biala, Poland; Newport, Culhman and Thurso, UK; Port Elizabeth, South Africa; and Tunis, Tunisia.

  <p>
   The company distributes, sells, and services reserve and motive power products throughout the world, principally through company-owned sales and service facilities, as well as through independent manufacturers' representatives. It has end users across a range of sectors including in telecom, UPS, electric utilities, security systems, emergency lighting, premium starting, lighting and ignition applications, OEMs, and space satellites.

  <p>
   EnerSys' revenues dipped 8% from $2.51 billion in 2015 to $2.32 billion in 2016. The decline was fueled by decreases across its main segments of reserve power (11%) and motive power (4%). The company also experienced declines across the EMEA (17%) and Americas (4%) regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income declined by 25% from $181 million in 2015 to $136 million in 2016. This was due to the lower revenue combined with an additional $3.2 million legal charge in 2016. Operating cash flows jumped from $194 million in 2015 to $308 million in 2016.

  <p>
   EnerSys' growth strategy centers around strategic joint ventures, geographic expansion, and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it launched ZBC (Zero Battery Change) Designer software, an industry-first interactive modeling software that identifies the most efficient and cost-effective energy configuration for companies running forklift fleets. That year it also secured two new contracts from the

   for production and supply of valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries using EnerSys' proprietary thin plate pure lead technology. The Hawker ArmaSafe Plus batteries to be supplied will be used by the

  <p>
   In 2015 the company continued its geographic expansion into rapidly growing markets, with the purchase of Australia-based, ICS Industries Pty. Ltd., a full line shelter designer, manufacturer with installation and maintenance services company serving sectors like telecommunications and utilities, serving customers in Australia and Asia Pacific region.

  <p>
   Like rival Exide Technologies, EnerSys traces its corporate roots back to the formation of The Electric Storage Battery Company (ESB) in the late 19th century. The corporate predecessors of EnerSys came out of ESB's industrial battery business.
  </p>
  <p>
   EnerSys formed in 2000 when company management and
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   acquired Yuasa's Motive Power and Stationary Power operations. It bought
   <company id="90103">
    Invensys
   </company>
   ' Energy Storage products group in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 2004; the next year it expanded its Australian operations with the acquisition of First National Battery, a distributor of motive power batteries and chargers. Also in 2005 EnerSys acquired the motive power business of Italy's FIAMM for €25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 EnerSys purchased the assets of
   <company id="15114">
    Orbital ATK
   </company>
   's lithium primary battery business. The business, known as the Power Sources Center, has made batteries for aerospace and military equipment for more than four decades. Orbital ATK signed a five-year supply agreement with EnerSys as part of the transaction. The Power Sources Center manufactures ambient-temperature lithium reserve and active primary batteries. Also in 2006 EnerSys acquired the assets of Chaozhou Xuntong Power Source Company Limited (CFT), a Chinese manufacturer of valve-regulated, lead-acid batteries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 EnerSys created a joint venture in Tunisia with automotive battery manufacturer Accumulateur Tunisie Assad SA. The company owns 51% of the JV, EnerSys-Assad SARL, which makes industrial batteries. Also that year EnerSys completed a $350 million refinancing and launched its EcoSafe line of batteries for renewable energy storage applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   EnerSys expanded its European presence through the acquisition of a metal fabricating facility in the Czech Republic to serve its industrial battery customers. In 2007 it bought Energia AD, a Bulgarian producer of industrial batteries, for approximately €13 million and acquired the lead-acid battery business of Leclanché, a Swiss firm. EnerSys restructured its European operations, integrating Energia while reorganizing certain commercial and production operations on the Continent.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2009, EnerSys expanded its niche battery operations by acquiring Keystone Mountaineer Power Systems, a supplier of batteries and chargers to the mining industry. Keystone Mountaineer primarily sells to northern Appalachian coal mines. Later that year, EnerSys bought the Oerlikon Battery business of Switzerland-based Accu Holding. The business consisted of OEB Traction Batteries and Oerlikon Stationary Batteries -- both makers of industrial batteries used in telecom, utilities, rail, and material handling applications -- along with a Swedish sales subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   EnerSys in 2010 swallowed up industrial battery maker Douglas Battery. The acquisition added a strong brand and battery designs, along with established distribution channels and customer base. Douglas Battery products included motive power and stationary batteries used in construction, medical, and telecommunications applications. EnerSys retained the Douglas brand, sales team, and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 EnerSys purchased ABSL Power Solutions, a UK-based manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries. ABSL Power Solutions supplies lithium-ion cells and batteries for defense and aerospace applications, such as satellite systems, to Europe and the US. Also that year, EnerSys obtained battery manufacturing assets from Greece-based partner Ergon Batteries. That deal bolstered the company's distribution and services operations in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2012, it established a new joint venture in India to produce batteries for industrial applications. EnerSys has majority ownership in the joint venture with Energy Leader Batteries India Limited, an industrial battery produced based in India. The company established previous joint ventures located in Germany (EAS Germany GmbH, which produces large format lithium-ion cells) and South Africa (Powertech Batteries, producer of batteries for industrial uses).
