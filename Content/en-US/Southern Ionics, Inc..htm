   Neither iconic or ironic, Southern Ionics (SII for short) simply gets on with the job of manufacturing a number of specialty and basic chemicals, beginning with aluminum-based products (for the paper and water treatment industries) to zirconium (for makers of titanium dioxide -- the most widely used white pigment). Its core markets include manufacturers of cement, molecular sieves, pharmaceuticals, refinery and automotive catalysts, and zeolites. SII has about 10 manufacturing plants spread throughout the southeast US and Texas. President and CEO Milton Sundbeck owns Southern Ionics.
