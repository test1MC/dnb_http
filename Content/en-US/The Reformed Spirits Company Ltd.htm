   Martin Miller's Gin is distilled by obsessive gin makers at The Reformed Spirits Company for obsessive gin connoisseurs around the world. The premium gin, which has won many awards for its quality and taste, is distilled in a century-old copper still outside of London, then shipped to Iceland where it's blended with spring water. Reformed Spirits has given close attention to packaging and public relations to establish Martin Miller's as a top premium brand. The company exports to Asia, Australia, Ireland, Russia, and the US. Reformed Spirits was founded in 1998 by an entrepreneur, the late Martin Miller, along with friends David Bromige and Andreas Versteegh.
