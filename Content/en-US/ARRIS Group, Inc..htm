   ARRIS brings the idea of broadband home. The company makes communications equipment and components used to enable broadband voice and data transmission and to build television broadcast networks. Products include cable network headend gear, Internet protocol switching systems, modems, and other consumer premises products. It also sells such related hardware as cable, connectors, and other supplies used for mounting and installation. ARRIS primarily markets to large cable-network operators. In 2016, ARRIS acquired
   <company id="51540">
    Pace
   </company>
   , a telecom equipment maker based in the UK for $2.1 billion.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Pace deal combines that company's hybrid fiber-coaxial and optics products with ARRIS's products. It also expands the geographic reach. With the acquisition, ARRIS shifted its country of incorporation to the UK. Called in inversion, the deal allows ARRIS to lower its tax bill in the US. The company remains headquartered in the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's organizational structure has two segments: network and cloud and customer premises equipment (CPE).
  </p>
  <p>
   The network and cloud business makes equipment that telecommunications and cable companies get programming to customers. It accounts for 35% of sales. CPE makes the equipment that customers use to get programming. That includes set-top boxes and DSL and cable modems. It accounts for 65% of the revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARRIS runs its  own factories and also outsources some manufacturing operations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ARRIS's manufacturing operations are in Taipei, Taiwan; Tijuana, Mexico; and Manaus, Brazil. Its contract manufacturers are in Brazil, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ARRIS runs its own sales staff working in offices throughout the world. Value-added resellers also sell the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 21% of the company's revenue comes from Comcast and another 14% comes from Time Warner Cable.
  </p>

  <p>
   ARRIS's revenue dropped 10% in 2015 to $4.8 billion from $5.3 billion in 2014. The CPE unit's sales fell 15% in 2015 from 2014 because of new product introductions and platform transitions by some customers in 2014 that didn't which did not recur in 2015. What's more several customers reevaluated their video strategy. Broadband CPE products, however, rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   Network &amp; cloud results rose 1.5% driven by professional services while infrastructure sales diminished.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $343.8 million in 2015, down from $459.8 million in 2014.

  <p>
   With the Pace deal, ARRIS looks to establish a global footprint for the combined company's products. ARRIS has room to grow, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region, which accounts for about 3% of revenue. Pace will not add to the Asia/Pacific sales right off the bat. In its last annual report Pace lump the region in with "Rest of World," which accounted for less than 2% of revenue. The companies also want to take advantage of research expertise in each company to develop new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made some job cuts after the merger became final. And in August 2016, the company appointed Bruce McClelland as CEO. The former CEO, Bob Stanzione, became executive chairman and continues as chairman of the board of directors.

  <p>
   Formed as a division of Anixter Bros. (later renamed
   <company id="10809">
    Anixter International
   </company>
   ) in 1969, ANTEC became a wholly owned subsidiary of that company in 1993 and went public later that year. The company made several strategic acquisitions in 1994, including broadband consulting company Electronic System Products, broadband power supply manufacturer Power Guard, and telecommunications equipment maker Keptel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 ANTEC and Northern Telecom (later
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel Networks
   </company>
   ) created a joint venture called Arris Interactive to sell voice and Internet access equipment to cable operators. ANTEC also opened a research and development facility near Atlanta that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   When cable giant -- and major customer -- TCI stopped its capital spending in 1996, ANTEC's sales and profits suffered into the next year. The company in 1997 acquired optical node and distribution amplifier maker TSX. The next year Anixter sold its stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Nortel's broadband operations (formerly LANcity) became part of Arris Interactive, reducing ANTEC's stake in the joint venture from 25% to 19%. That year the company moved its headquarters from Illinois to Georgia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 John Egan, who joined ANTEC in 1973 and served as CEO since 1980, passed the torch on to president and COO Robert Stanzione; Egan remained chairman. Later that year the company laid off workers when AT&amp;T Broadband, its largest customer, began canceling orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid continued slowing sales of telecom gear, the company announced in 2001 that it would continue cutting staff. Also that year ANTEC increased its stake in Arris Interactive from 19% to 51%. ANTEC effectively became a subsidiary of the combined company, which changed its name to ARRIS Group. The company bought privately held cable modem termination system maker Cadant in 2002 and network traffic flow specialist Atoga in 2003. The company also bought assets of cable modem termination systems maker Com21 and sold its engineering services product line in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 ARRIS reached an agreement to acquire
   <company id="107138">
    TANDBERG Television
   </company>
   for about $1.2 billion, but it was eventually outbid by
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   for the company. ARRIS went on to buy network distribution equipment maker
   <company id="12825">
    C-COR
   </company>
   for $680 million that year. The purchase had the immediate effect of broadening ARRIS' access, transmission, video, and software offerings. It also expanded the company's international presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 ARRIS bought the assets of EG Technology to expand its video product lines. The deal included patents and video compression technology for digital networks. Also that year ARRIS acquired the assets and intellectual property of
   <company id="105391">
    Digeo
   </company>
   for about $20 million in cash. The transaction added technical expertise in video networking and a multimedia delivery services platform to its product portfolio. ARRIS hired about 75 Digeo employees as a result, adding an engineering team to increase its R&amp;D efforts.
