   Those who know a vehicle's inner workings may know GKN's components. GKN serves its customers through its four segments: Aerospace, Driveline, Powder Metallurgy and Land Systems. Core products include driveshafts, propshafts, torque management, and chassis components for light vehicles and trucks; airframe and engine structures for aircraft; and axles, wheels, and tractor attachments for agricultural, construction, and other off-highway vehicles. GKN has operations in more than 30 countries, and its customers include most of the top vehicle and aircraft manufacturers around the world, including Boeing, Airbus, Fiat Chrysler, and Ford Group.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Of GKN's four business segments, Driveline and Aerospace are the two largest at around 45% and 30% of total revenue, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   Driveline is a supplier of automotive driveline systems and solutions and has a fairly even spread across GKN's three regions. Aerospace supplies aerostructures, engine products and electrical wiring systems to the global aerospace industry; its biggest customers include Airbus and General Electric, and military comprises 25% of sales. Powder Metallurgy produces metal powder and then creates automotive components though its two subsidiaries, Hoeganaes and GKN Sinter, and Land Systems supplies power management products for the agricultural, construction and industrial equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   GKN operates facilities in more than 30 countries. Europe, including the UK, is the largest region by revenue at around half of all sales, while the Americas sales are around 40%; the Asia/Pacific region and Africa comprise the rest. Half of GKN's workforce is located in Europe (including the UK), with around a quarter each in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region/Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales and Marketing
  </p>
  <p>
   GNK counts among its biggest customers Fiat Chrysler, Airbus, Ford ,VW Group, GM Group, Renault Nissan, United Technologies, General Electric, Boeing, and Toyota Group. Its primary served markets are agriculture, construction, defense, forestry, industry, civil, military, integrated aerostructures, and engine systems.

  <p>
   External conditions meant 2015 was a somewhat turbulent year for GKN given how its fortunes are closely tied to its customer markets, and while total sales of £7.2 billion represented 4% growth on prior year, positive growth was not consistent across operating segments. The two biggest segments, Driveline and Aerospace (£3.5 billion and £2.5 billion in total sales, respectively), grew by 3% and 12%, but Powder Metallurgy and Land Systems shrank by 1% and 10% to £0.9 billion and £0.7 billion, respectively. Powder Metallurgy suffered in China and Brazil in particular, although this was to some extent counterbalanced by a solid performance in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities was flat in 2015, at £940 million
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   GKN pursues four key strategic objectives, which include strengthening capacity in Mexico, the US and China, and innovating in technology. In the former, the company invested in composite and metallic manufacturing in Mexico, and completed a manufacturing site in Seattle that supports the Boeing 737 MAX assembly line. In the latter, GKN acquired Sheets Manufacturing Inc, an engine inlet lipskin producer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adverse market conditions put pressure on the Land Systems segment, and to address falling sales management cut costs; this incurred a re-structuring charge of £11 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace is undergoing a transition as some aircraft programs are approaching end-life, while others are ramping up; 2016 sales are expected to be flat as a result. GKN is looking to capitalise on expected growth in vehicle production in China, North America, Europe and India, and so Driveline and Powder Metallurgy can expect above-market growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also values developing new technologies, for instance it developed a new air intake in the aerospace sector that combines ice protection and noise reduction for the first time, for which it was shortlisted for the European Clean Sky Initiative award. Additionally, GKN is looking to expand its presence in the 3D printing (additive manufacturing) field, and has received its first orders for 3D printed parts, for military use. GKN's eDrive business, which makes axels for electric vehicles, is small at present but is expected to grow as sales of electric vehicles rise over the coming years.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   GKN acquired Dutch aerospace firm Fokker Technologies in October 2015, which supplies doors, flaperons, flaps and landing-gear components, among other things, to the construction of the Lockheed Martin F-35, the world's most expensive military aircraft. Fokker also already has an established presence in China, and its acquisition will ramp up GKN's presence in the regional market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also acquired was Sheets Manufacturing, the acquisition of which will enable GKN to produce streamlining lipskin products on an industrial scale.
  </p>

  <p>
   The "G" in GKN stands for John Guest, who began an iron-smelting operation in 1767 in Wales. The "K" is for Arthur Keen, who helped start a bolt company in the 1860s, and the "N" is for John Sutton Nettlefolds, a partner in a UK company that made woodscrews, wire, and metal rods. In 1902 the three businesses formed the GKN Group. Keen became its first chairman, and the company soon expanded its steel operations into forging, rolling, and stamping. By the end of WWI, the enterprise's main businesses were steelmaking and manufacturing fasteners. In 1920 GKN bought John Lysaght, a maker of automobile chassis, wheels, and body parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   GKN expanded during the Depression, WWII, and afterward as demand for autos skyrocketed. During the 1960s GKN solidified its auto parts position through acquisitions. GKN ventured into the defense market in 1962. Later that decade GKN bought a stake in Uni-Cardan AG (West Germany), a maker of constant velocity (CV) joints.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s GKN expanded internationally. With Brambles Industries (Australia), it formed GKN CHEP, the UK's first cargo pallet service. Near the end of the decade, GKN focused on the US market for CV joints. In 1979 the company bought Parts Industries Corporation of America (then, the US's #4 auto parts distributor) and bolstered its European auto parts position by buying the Unigep Group of France and Armstrong Autoparts and Sheepbridge Engineering of the UK. About that time GKN sold its money-losing GKN Bolts and Nuts Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   GKN diversified its service operations after posting a loss in 1980. The next year it bought a stake in Redland Purle (now Cleanaway), the UK's largest private-sector waste-disposal company. GKN picked up Meineke Car Care Center (formerly Meineke Discount Muffler Shops) in 1983. It strengthened its auto businesses, although it sold much of its steel interests in 1986. That year the company changed its name to GKN plc. In 1988 GKN bought a stake in Westland (helicopters, UK) and formed a joint alliance with
   <company id="56156">
    Jaguar
   </company>
   to make auto body pressings. By the end of the decade, the UK accounted for only a third of GKN's total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The early 1990s' recession hurt sales and profits as vehicle sales in the US and Europe dropped. GKN's non-automotive efforts included buying the rest of Westland in 1994. GKN bought Sinter Metals (powdered-metal components) in 1997, and in 1998 it sold its armored-vehicle business to Alvis for a 30% stake in GKN. In 1999 GKN bought Interlake Material Handling (now known as
   <company id="112828">
    Interlake Mecalux
   </company>
   ) (powdered metals, aircraft parts, and material-handling equipment, US) and integrated it into its industrial services unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   To gain a foothold in Japan, GKN formed GKN Toyoda Driveshafts, a 49%-owned, Japan-based joint venture with Toyota. GKN boosted its ownership of Australia-based Unidrive Pty Limited (CV joints, driveshaft, and propshafts) to 60% in 2000. In 2001 GKN bought an aerospace manufacturing plant in St. Louis from Boeing for about $61 million. The company plans to establish its US administrative offices there. After nearly three years of negotiations, GKN merged its Westland unit with Italy-based Finmeccanica's Agusta helicopter unit to form AgustaWestland, one of the world's largest helicopter manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2001 GKN's industrial services division -- joint ventures CHEP (pallets and transportation packaging), Cleanaway (collection, disposal, and recycling services), and Meineke Car Care Center -- merged with joint venture partner Brambles. GKN shareholders maintain a 43% stake in the merged entity, Brambles Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 GKN sold its 23% stake in armored vehicle maker Alvis plc to
   <company id="40681">
    BAE Systems
   </company>
   for about $130 million in cash. The following year the company sold Walterscheid Rohrverbindungstechnik GmbH, its tube connecting systems business, to
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton Corporation
   </company>
   . Also in 2004 GKN sold its 50% stake in
   <company id="132809">
    AgustaWestland
   </company>
   to partner
   <company id="92969">
    Leonardo - Finmeccanica
   </company>
   for about $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 and 2007 GKN shuttered three Michigan plants of its
   <company id="42243">
    GKN Sinter Metals
   </company>
   subsidiary and moved production to other US plants. The plants made powder metal engine and transmission parts for
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   . Later that year GKN bolstered its driveline operations with the purchase of Rockford Powertrain, a maker of driveshafts for the construction machinery market. The company also picked up Stellex Aerostructures. GKN paid about $200 million for the two acquisitions. In 2007 GKN bought
   <company id="12375">
    Teleflex
   </company>
   's aerospace manufacturing division, which makes aircraft engine components.
  </p>
  <p>
   After serving nine years as CEO, Sir Kevin Smith retired at the end of 2011. Nigel Stein, the former head of the company's automotive segment, became the new CEO in 2012.
