   Wazana Brothers International, doing business as Micro Solutions Enterprises (MSE), manufactures and markets imaging equipment supplies, including laser toner and inkjet cartridges. The company markets products under its own brand and sells to vendors who, in turn, rebrand its products. Israeli-American brothers and company executives Avi Wazana and Yoel Wazana established Micro Solutions Enterprises in 1994; the pair continues to own the company. Operating globally, MSE is the largest remanufacturer with US-based production facilities. The company has expanded its business by buying Laser Imaging International and Perfect Ink, both involved in manufacturing inkjet cartridges and laser toner cartridges.

   As part of its business, Wazana Brothers provides products to independent resellers and dealers, as opposed to selling directly to consumers. The company supports its reseller channel through a comprehensive dealer program that includes sales training, customized materials, and marketing programs. The company also works to properly brand itself to create a customer base of loyal end users. To this end, the company created the Micro Solutions Enterprises brand name.
  </p>
        <p>
   When the firm expanded its business in Europe, Wazana Brothers hired field sales executives in several major European markets, including France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. In this market, the company offers the MSE brand, generic packaging, and private-label options for its larger customers.
