   Appvion (formerly Appleton Papers) has an app for that -- paper. The company manufactures specialty coated paper products, including carbonless and security papers, and thermal papers. It is the world's #1 producer of carbonless paper. Sold under the NCR Paper brand, carbonless paper is used in multi-part business forms (such as invoices). Appvion makes security papers for government documents and coated products for point-of-sale displays. Its thermal papers are used in coupons, gaming and transportation tickets, and medical charts. Its Encapsys segment makes microencapsulation (a microscopic wall around a substance) materials. Appvion is the primary operating subsidiary of Paperweight Development Corp.

  <p>
   Over the years, Appvion has realigned its business to focus on coating formulations and applications (carbonless papers) and security technologies, thermal papers, and a segment that makes microencapsulation materials, called Encapsys. The carbonless papers segment generates 42% of the company's total sales, while thermal papers makes 50%. Encapsys accounts for the remaining amount.

  <p>
   The company's papers are sold to merchant distributors that stock and redistribute those products worldwide. They are also sold to printers and converters that cut, print, or further process the paper for different end uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appvion's largest customer accounted for 8% of its total sales in 2014. Each of the company's three segments depends upon a large concentration of customers for their revenues: five customers accounted for 41% of the entire revenue in the carbonless papers segment, while 41% of thermal papers' revenue was generated from five of its largest customers for 2014 as well. The largest customer in the Encapsys segment generated 73% of that segment's total 2014 revenues.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company's revenues remained flat to a positive 0.3% change, due to an increase in the sales from the Encapsys segment resulting from higher sales volume and a favorable product mix; offset by a decrease in other segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Appvion reported a net loss of $92.8 million (compared to an income of $17.3 million in 2013) due to higher costs, and increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulting from a mark-to-market loss and related to its retiree benefit plans. The company also recorded legal expenses resulting from Fox River settlement matters and anti-dumping and countervailing duties claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 operating cash flows increased to a cash inflow of $47.2 million (from a cash outflow of $22.7 million a year earlier), due to increased cash inflows from accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued pension; offset by higher cash outflows in inventories and a major net loss.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company launched AlphaÂ® Free, its first thermal receipt paper made using vitamin C, in place of traditional phenol-based thermal developers like BPA, BPS or controversial phenol substitutes. That year it also added a treated high-speed inkjet paper to its portfolio of specialty papers. ideal for transactional documents such as bills and statements, direct mail, promotional materials, and catalogs and books.

  <p>
   The company got its start as Appleton Coated Paper Company in 1907.

However, the deal was called off months later, citing unfavorable market conditions.
