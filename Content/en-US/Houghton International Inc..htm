   It might not have been called the Rust Belt if they'd used Houghton International's products more often. The Hinduja Group company is the world leader in industrial fluids, providing both high-tech fluid products and fluid management services. Houghton manufactures oils and specialty chemicals for lubrication in several major industries: metalworking, automotive, and steel as well as offshore deep-water oil drilling. Its products range from aluminum and steel rolling lubricants to rust preventatives to fire-resistant hydraulic fluids. Its Fluidcare system helps manufacturers reduce costs through chemical management and recycling.

In addition to Houghton's Valley Forge R&amp;D facility, the company also operates five research labs in Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK). Houghton's labs in China, Thailand, Brazil, and Australia provide local technical support and new product deployment.

   In 2010, as part of a settlement of a
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   complaint, Houghton sold the aluminum hot rolling oil (AHRO) business of subsidiary D.A. Stuart to
   <company id="14518">
    Quaker Chemical Corporation
   </company>
   . The FTC had claimed that Houghton's acquisition of D.A. Stuart in 2008 put it in control of almost 75% of the AHRO market in North America, allowing it to fix prices in the absence of competition. Houghton retained the rest of D.A. Stuart's business lines.

   In 2008 Houghton was acquired by
   <company id="43091">

   Houghton was founded in 1865 (only a few years after oil was discovered in Titusville, Pennsylvania, sparking the first oil boom).
