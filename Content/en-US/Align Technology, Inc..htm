   Brace-face begone! Align Technology produces and sells the Invisalign system, which corrects malocclusion, or crooked teeth. Instead of using metal or ceramic mounts that are cemented on the teeth and connected by wires (traditional braces), the system involves using an array of clear and removable dental Aligners to move a patient's teeth into a desired alignment. The company markets its products to orthodontists and dentists worldwide. Align also provides training for practitioners to model treatment schemes using its online ClinCheck application, which simulates tooth movement and suggests the appropriate Aligner. It also makes and sells orthodontic scanning and CAD (computer-assisted design) devices.

  <p>
   The company operates through two segments: Clear Aligner and Scanners and CAD/CAM Services ("SCCS"). Clear Aligner is the Invisalign product lines and it accounts for 94% of revenue. The Invisalign system is offered in more than 80 countries by more than 43,000 doctors to teenage and adult patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCCS includes the iTero intra-oral 3D scanning system for orthodontic and restorative dentistry and OrthoCAD services.

  <p>
   Align Technology has administrative and manufacturing locations in Costa Rica, Mexico, Israel, the Netherlands, and the US; it has R&amp;D facilities in Russia, Israel, and the US (California). Its products are primarily marketed in the US (accounting for about three-fourths of sales) and Europe. It also operates in areas of Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region and is working to expand sales into Middle Eastern, African, and smaller European countries. Invisalign is available in 80 countries worldwide.

   Align Technology sells its products through a direct sales force in North America and select international markets, as well as through distribution partners in other regions. The company primarily markets its products to orthodontist and dental practices, who then commit to sell the products to consumers. It is targeting general practice dentists as a primary sales growth channel, since general dentists have larger patient populations than orthodontists, who traditionally treat malocclusion. The company also distributes its products to restorative dentists including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons.

  <p>
   Align Technology has seen several years of increasing revenue and 2014 was no exception. The company reported a 15% increase, to $751 million, as all products and geographic regions saw higher sales. Clear Aligner North America net revenues increased due to both higher volumes and, to a lesser extent, a higher average selling price as customers opted for higher-priced products. Clear Aligner international net revenues increased that year, too, primarily as a result of the company's acquiring its distributor in the Asia/Pacific region in mid-2013. Price increases and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates also contributed to the rise. Finally, Scanner and Services net earnings increased due to higher volume, despite lower average selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The higher revenues in 2014 helped net income more than double to $146 million; the absence of impairment of goodwill also helped. Cash flow from operations grew 22% to $227 million, both as a result of the higher profits and an increase in accrued and other long-term liabilities and accounts payable.

  <p>
   To stay ahead of potential competitors looking to enter the clear alignment market, Align Technology continuously tries to expand sales of its Invisalign system by increasing the number of dentists and orthodontists that are committed to selling the products. It also increases brand awareness through consumer marketing programs. Geographically, the firm is looking to expand into new markets. In 2013 it transitioned Asian markets back to a direct sales model coordinated out of its new regional headquarters in Singapore. It also launched a branding campaign across Western Europe, which led to higher sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   To widen use of its products, Align Technology also develops new versions and variations of the Invisalign system, as well as tools that make it easier for dentists to adopt use of the Invisalign offerings. In 2013 and 2014 it launched the Invisalign G5 system, which helps doctors manage treatment of patients with deep bites, and rolled out the latest iterations for its ClinCheck and iTero products. It also upgraded its iTero intraoral scanner to increase practice efficiency. Some of the company's product development efforts are conducted through partnerships with other medical device firms such as

   . In 2014 Align Technology inked an agreement with Zimmer Dental; through the deal, the iTero scanner will support connectivity with Zimmer Zfx custom abutments for implants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses its efforts on expanding its sales territory coverage in all of its direct sales areas, especially in the highest-growing markets of Europe and the Asia/Pacific.
