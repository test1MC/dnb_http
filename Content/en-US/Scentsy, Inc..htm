   Scentsy throws a party to make dollars from scents. Its more than 181,000 independent consultants showcase the company's scent system to customers at home parties in the US, Puerto Rico, Canada, Guam, Germany, the UK, and Ireland. The system, marketed as a safer alternative to candles, includes a lightbulb-powered warmer and scented bars available in more than 80 fragrances. The company also sells scented travel tins, hanging air fresheners, room spray, and foaming hand sanitizer. To spread its scented message to the whole family, Scentsy offers Buddies, stuffed animals with pockets for scent packs. Husband and wife Orville and Heidi Thompson formed the company in 2004.
