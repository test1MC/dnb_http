   With sales partners worldwide, Swagelok has to speak many languages,
   <i>
    fluidly
   </i>
   . The company makes fluid system components, which include plug, pinch, and radial diaphragm valves, regulators, filters, flexible tubing, and welding systems. Its products are used in the instrumentation, oil and gas, power, petrochemical, alternative fuels, and semiconductor industries, as well as bio-pharmaceutical research companies. Swagelok also offers technical support, custom kitting, made-to-order products, and third-party sourcing services. The company was founded in 1947 by Fred Lennon in his kitchen.

  <p>
   In addition to manufacturing, the company offers value-added services such as technical support, logistics, and product distribution. Another of Swagelok's competitive edges is its attention to research and technology to develop better fluid systems for its customers. Along with global expansion, Swagelok is expanding its product base by introducing new equipment and by acquiring businesses that add to existing product lines or expand applications.

   In the fall of 2013, the company extended its reach further into Asia when it established Indofluid System Technologies Pte Ltd (Swagelok Indonesia) in Indonesia. In 2014 the company established a subsidiary in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The new entity, Bercon Fluidsystems, will operate as 'Swagelok Polska' in the Republic of Poland.
