   The pharmaceutical and the biodiesel industries don't seem&#160;like they&#160;have much in common, but they both use the chemicals produced by Codexis. The company develops biocatalysts -- chemicals used to manufacture other chemicals in a way that's easy on the environment. Its technology is used to make the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and produce biofuel from plant material. Codexis has a research agreement with
   <company id="41841">
    Shell
   </company>
   to develop new ways of converting biomass to biofuel; Shell&#160;accounts for more than half of Codexis' sales. The company&#160;is also working within other markets to use its technology to manage&#160;carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants&#160;and&#160;treat wastewater.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Codexis went public in 2010 and earned about $78 million in initial sales of its shares on the NASDAQ exchange. Codexis used the proceeds to drive organic, internal growth and is watchful for possible acquisitions.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company's facilities are located in Budapest, Hungary; Singapore; and Redwood City, California. The Americas represents 58% of Codexis' total sales, while Europe accounts for 28%. Asia generates the remainder at 14%.

   In the pharmaceuticals market, Codexis has partnerships with Merck,
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   . Codexis' custom biocatalysts aid in the manufacturing process for the cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor, as well as for the generic equivalents of allergy drug Singulair and antidepressant Cymbalta. In 2012 Codexis extended its partnership with Merck in developing catalysts for another three years. Merck uses Codexis' enzyme products to develop manufacturing processes for its therapeutic candidates.

   Codexis depends upon a small number of clients for its overall revenue. Its top five customers accounted for 77% of its revenues in 2011, with Shell accounting for 51% of the total revenue.

        <p>
   Despite posting steady revenue growth each year, Codexis has yet to be profitable. Although it did recognize 10% growth in revenue from 2010 to 2011, the company suffered a net loss of nearly $17 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   The revenue increase was due to a spike in product sales to both generic and innovator pharmaceutical customers as well as a jump in collaborative research and development revues (with Alstom). On the downside, its net loss was the result of increased research and development; and selling, general, and administrative expenses (the latter as a result of the company increasing its headcount).

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Since the strategy was so lucrative for 2011, Codexis will continue to pursue new collaborations in the pharmaceutical industry to integrate its products and services more deeply into drug development and manufacturing processes for clinical stage and commercially approved pharmaceutical products.
