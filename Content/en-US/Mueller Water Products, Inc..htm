   Mueller Water Products knows how to keep the water flowing. The company is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of hydrants, as well as valves and pipe fittings in North America. Its flow control products are used in new and upgraded municipal infrastructure, industrial, and residential and non-residential construction projects, such as water distribution networks, water and wastewater treatment facilities, fire protection systems, gas distribution, and HVAC. Mueller operates through three segments: Mueller Co., Mueller Technologies, and

  <p>
   Mueller's revenues dipped by 2% from 2014 to 2015 due to decreased sales from its Anvil and Mueller Technologies segments. Its profits also fell 44% during that same time period due to a loss on early payments of debt and the decrease in net sales. After experiencing steady growth the last three years, the company's operating cash flow decreased by 41% from 2014 to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue from Anvil decreased in 2015 due to lower shipment volumes into the oil and gas market and due to unfavorable changes in Canadian currency exchange rates. Revenue from Mueller Technologies decreased due to lower shipment volumes and fewer large projects that specified AMI (advanced metering infrastructure) metering systems.

  <p>
   Mueller Water traces its roots to Walter Industries (now
   <company id="40521">
    Walter Energy
   </company>
   ). Walter Industries acquired Mueller Water in 2005, and combined it with US Pipe. Walter subsequently spun off the merged water products company as its own public entity in 2006. The event was followed by Mueller Water relocating its headquarters from Tampa to Atlanta.
