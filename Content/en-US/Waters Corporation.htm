   </sub>
   O. The company, named after founder Jim Waters, makes high-performance liquid chromatography instruments used by researchers, scientists, and engineers to separate and identify chemicals. Waters also makes mass spectrometers that help identify chemical compounds. Its products are used for applications including drug development, food testing, and air and water quality testing. Waters' TA Instruments Division makes thermal analyzers and rheometry instruments used to determine the physical characteristics of polymers and other substances. Customers are in the academic, government, and industrial sectors; more than 70% of sales are from customers located outside the US.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Countries in Asia account for about 33% of Waters' annual revenues; the US, 30%. European countries account for about 30% of its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   With products available in about 50 countries, Waters has operations (including 14 manufacturing plants) in 27 countries. It has significant manufacturing operations in Ireland, the UK, and the US. In addition, the company uses subcontractors in Singapore to make some of the components and modules for its instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Waters operates 21 facilities in the US and has 78 international facilities, including field offices.
  </p>

  <p>
   Waters markets its products through a direct sales and service organization that includes about 95 offices and 3,100 field representatives around the globe. The sales organization targets the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life sciences, chemical, food and beverage industries. It also serves environmental testing markets through sales to universities and government agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2014, 53% of the company's sales were to pharmaceutical accounts; 32%, to other industrial accounts; and 15%, to governmental agencies and academic bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses in 2014 totaled some $12 million, compared to $11 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Water's revenues increased 4% in 2014 to $1.99 billion from $1.9 million in 2013. Sales of its LC and LC-MS instruments drove revenue higher. Instrument system sales also benefited from the ACQUITY line, which includes the ACQUITY®UPC2® system, ACQUITY® Advanced Polymer Chromatography system, and ACQUITY QDaTM Detector. Currency translation cut the Waters Division revenue by 1%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Waters' net income increased 4% to more than $431 million. Higher operating costs from acquired in-process research and development cut into profit.

  <p>
   Waters expands through organic growth and acquisitions. It is looking to emerging economies, including countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe, for continued expansion. The company also continues to invest in new products through both acquisitive and organic initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company completed the construction of its new facility in Wilmslow, UK and is consolidating it UK operations by moving its Cheshire and Manchester facilities to this new location.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Waters launched three new UNIFI Scientific Information System products: the Waters Glycan Application Solution with UNIFI, Forensic Toxicology Screening Application Solution with UNIFI, and the Natural Products Application Solution with UNIFI. Each new application features a proprietary comprehensive library of relevant molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also introduced the new Waters ACQUITY UPLC M-Class System, an industry-first nano- to microscale UltraPerformance LC system rated for 15,000 psi operation. Coupled to Waters mass spectrometers, the system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and to identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules.

  <p>
   To expand TA's thermal analysis instrument product offering and to leverage it distribution channels Waters has made a series of acquisitions. In 2014 it bought  ULSP B.V. (a manufacturer of solutions for ultra low temperature applications) for $3 million. In 2013, the company acquired LaserComp Inc. (a maker of thermal conductivity measurement instruments) for $12 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Waters also purchased Expert Systems Solutions S.r.l., a manufacturer of advanced thermal analysis instruments, for $3 million; Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd. (a developer of proteomics and metabolomics software), for $23 million; and Scarabaeus Mess-und Prodktionstechnik GmbH (a manufacturer of rheometers for the rubber and elastomer markets), for $4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2014 deal, Waters acquisition bought the Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) technology from MediMass Ltd. The REIMS technology constituted virtually all the assets of MediMass and included patent applications, software, and databases. REIMS is the enabling technology for the "Intelligent Knife" or 'iKnife,' a device in the conceptual stages of development that could potentially be used for real-time diagnostics in surgery.
