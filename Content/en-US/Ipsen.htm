   In 2013 Ipsen reported a small 3% increase in revenue due mainly to growth of specialty care and primary care lines in Russia, primary care in China and Algeria, specialty care in Brazil, and a

   </company>
   partnership in Mexico. The strong uptick in those areas was partially offset by weaker sales in Western Europe and the US.

   Net income was €153 million compared to a €27 million loss in 2012 due to several amortizations and a decline in restructuring costs. Cash from operations rose €16 million to €181 million based on improved productivity due to restructuring, lower external costs, and the improvement in Russia.
