  <p>
   The company primarily operates through Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Lanier Clothes. With annual sales of about $628 million (nearly two-third of Oxford's total) Tommy Bahama is the company's cash cow. That unit specializes in men's and women's relaxed sportswear, targeting affluent customers age 35 and older. Dainty Lily Pulitzer, with about $168 million in sales, is next. The brand markets its collections to women and girls, with more of a younger slant. Lanier Clothes, which produces tailored and casual men's apparel under license and private-label products, contributes more than 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Oxford sold its smallest business, the London-based Ben Sherman, a maker of men's sportswear that attracts style-conscious customers primarily in the UK, Europe, and the US. Ben Sherman contributed 8% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to apparel manufacturing, Oxford's Tommy Bahama and Lily Pulitzer brands operate company-owned retail and outlet stores -- 206 doors in all. The shops are concentrated in Florida and California. There are also more than a dozen Tommy Bahama-branded restaurants adjacent to Tommy Bahama retail shops.

  <p>
   The US is Atlanta-based Oxford's largest market, accounting for more than 90% of its annual sales. International markets account for 10% of sales, which previously consisted of Ben Sherman products in the UK and Europe (Oxford sold Ben Sherman in mid-2015), and Tommy Bahama merchandise in Canada and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes apparel at a plant in Merida, Mexico. It has distribution centers and sales offices in Washington, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and New York. Overseas, Oxford has sales offices in Northern Ireland, London, and Hong Kong.

  <p>
   Oxford sells its apparel on a wholesale basis to department stores and national chains, warehouse clubs, discount and specialty retailers, and other customers across the US. Its Lanier Clothes branded products are sold in more than 5,000 stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands are marketed via print media such as catalogs, online (including social media), and through trade shows.

  <p>
   Since 2011, revenues have been on the rise: Net sales in fiscal 2015 (ended January) were 60% higher than they were in 2011. Increased sales of the Lilly Pulitzer and Ben Sherman brands led to a 9% increase to $997.8 million in 2015. Lilly Pulitzer sales grew as a result of such initiatives as e-commerce clearance sales and the opening of new stores. Ben Sherman sales (which had declined in 2014) increased both in stores and online.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has also been rising as of late, climbed 1% to $45.7 million in fiscal 2015 on higher sales, which were ultimately offset by increased expenses related to opening new stores and restaurants and the payment of incentive compensation. Over the same period, cash flow from operations rose 81% to $95.4 million.

  <p>
   Oxford's strategy is to develop strong lifestyle brands with which consumers around the world can connect. For example, it is expanding its Tommy Bahama business to be available in upscale shopping malls, resorts, and other appropriate locations. It also limits the amount of sales promotions offered in its full-price retail locations and online in order to maintain brand integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2015, the company sold the Ben Sherman business for $63.7 million. The divestiture came after the brand brought a loss from operations of $10.8 million.

  <p>
   Lanier brothers Tommy, Sartain, and Hicks began a temporary business in 1942 when wartime shortages stymied their original Dictaphone and business-form company. They invested in a small operation, Oxford of Atlanta, that sold men's and boys' shirts and slacks. In 1943 the company bought its first plant. After the war Hicks left the apparel business to focus on the Dictaphone business. Between 1955 and 1963 Oxford expanded significantly, adding 18 apparel companies and 23 plants. It went public in 1960, two years before Tommy died in a plane crash, leaving Sartain as the sole brother directly involved in company operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The business became Oxford Industries in 1967 and began a major reorganization that included the sale of its rainwear and outerwear manufacturing sectors. J. Hicks, Sartain's son, became president of Oxford in 1977. The next year the firm struck a deal with Polo Ralph Lauren, its first designer-label venture, to produce Polo for Boys shirts. In the mid-1980s Oxford added another designer, Oscar de la Renta, to its collection. Slow sales and bloated inventories dogged Oxford in the mid-1980s, and the company responded by downsizing and restructuring.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oxford beefed up its designer lineup through licensing deals with Tommy Hilfiger (1993), Nautica (1996), and Geoffrey Beene (1997). It bought Western shirt company Ely &amp; Walker in 1995. The closing of two women's divisions and the continued shift to cheaper offshore production cut into the company's bottom line in 1996. But 1997 sales jumped due to the popularity of designer products. Oxford bought Next Day Apparel, a maker of private-label womenswear, in 1998 (and sold it off in 2006).
