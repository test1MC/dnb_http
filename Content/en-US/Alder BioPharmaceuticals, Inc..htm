   Alder BioPharmaceuticals wants to alter the way we treat some common ailments. Using a proprietary yeast-based development process it calls MabXpress, the company creates antibodies to improve existing treatments. It targets ailments that have never been treated with antibodies before. The company has no approved products but its lead candidate is ALD403, a migraine prevention medication. Next up is Clazakizumab, being developed by partner
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   (BMS), that treats rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Alder has several other non-specified products in early development as well. The company was formed in 2002 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   After raising $80 million in its IPO, Alder plans to spend the proceeds for the next trials of ALD403 and on development of its pipeline of products. It may also acquire other drugs, companies, or technologies though it isn't mentioning anything specific.
  </p>

  <p>
   Once its products are approved, and for the drugs currently in trial, Alder will use contract manufacturers in the US and internationally. ALD403 is being developed in IV and subcutaneous forms.

  <p>
   The company plans to develop its own sales force in the US and partner or contract with existing pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies outside the US.

  <p>
   While Alder has received some milestone and upfront payments from its partner BMS, as a development-stage company, it spends more on R&amp;D than it takes in. As of December 2013, it had an accumulated deficit of $146 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To get out of the deficit hole, Alder needs to continue working on clinical trials for ALD403, support BMS in its commercialization of Clazakizumab, and mine its pipeline for successful candidates. It also plans to continue using its proprietary MabXpress technology to develop potential candidates.
