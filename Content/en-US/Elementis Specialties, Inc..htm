   Elementis Specialties has been expanding its North American production capacity in the face of strong demand. It also increased its capacity to supply high-margin defoamers to the oilfield industry with the purchase of US-based Hi-Mar Specialty Chemicals in early 2013.

   In mid-2012 parent Elementis purchased Brazilian coatings additives company Watercryl Quimica for about $24 million to give Elementis Specialties a growth platform in the region. Half a year later Elementis Specialties made a purchase of its own, paying about $33 million for US-based coatings additives firm Hi-Mar Specialty Chemicals. Hi-Mar supplies the coatings and construction industries but it was surely its high-margin defoamers used in booming US oilfields that spurred the transaction.
