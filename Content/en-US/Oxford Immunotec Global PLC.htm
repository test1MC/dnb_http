   Oxford Immunotec took on tradition by improving the 100-year-old skin test for tuberculosis. The company developed a new type of test, called the T-SPOT.TB, that differs from the traditional TB test in that it only requires one office visit; it also believes it to be more accurate. The T-SPOT.TB test is sold in more than 50 countries. The US is its largest market, accounting for half of sales, where it is regularly administered in hospitals, correctional facilities, military bases, universities, and chronic care facilities. The company sells the test as a kit (to be analyzed by the customer) but also maintains clinical testing labs in the US and the UK for in-house analysis. Oxford Immunotec went public in the US in 2013.

   The company raised $64 million and plans to use the proceeds to hire additional sales, marketing, and customer service staff; fund research and development programs; and pay down debt.
