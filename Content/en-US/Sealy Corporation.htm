   Sealy is a slumbering giant. It's one of the world's biggest makers of bedding products and a top US manufacturer, with nearly 20% wholesale market share. Sealy makes mattresses and traditional box springs under brands Sealy, Stearns &amp; Foster, Optimum, and others, as well as specialty bedding under the Embody and Carrington Chase labels. It sells to sleep shops, furniture and department stores, and warehouse clubs in North and South America and beyond through JVs and licensee partners. Sealy also licenses its name to makers of home furnishings. Sealy joined competitor

    Tempur-Pedic

   , which acquired the company in a 2013 deal valued at $1.3 billion, to battle both

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Sealy's efforts are focused in the US and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and South America. Although the US generates more than three-quarters of the company's sales, the company also boasts more than a dozen independent licensees and joint ventures worldwide coupled with a global network of roughly 25 factories. Sealy's largest international market is Canada, representing about 15% of sales. The bedmaker is also committed to China; through its Sealy China joint venture, owned by Sealy and licensee Sealy Australia, the mattress maker opened a new 100,000-sq.- ft. manufacturing facility outside Shanghai in late 2010.

        <p>
   Sealy's operations are divided among the US, Canada, and Other International segments. The geographic structure is intended to keep the company competitive in its most significant markets as it pursues new opportunities. Sealy sells its bedding products primarily through retail stores, which account for about 93% of its total sales.

        <p>
   Sealy's 2013 sales topped $1.1 billion in 2013, representing 45% of its Tempur Sealy International's (TSI) nearly $2.5 billion in total sales. Sealy is the largest of newly-formed TSI's three segments.

        <p>
   Daniel Haynes, a cotton gin builder, first made a new, more resilient type of cotton-filled mattress in 1881 in Sealy, Texas. In 1889 he patented a machine to mass-produce his increasingly popular product. Haynes sold manufacturing rights to firms in other cities, and in 1906 he sold his patents to a Texas firm that renamed itself Sealy.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sealy expanded by advertising in national magazines and finding licensees to open mattress factories. By 1920 the company had 28 licensed plants. When doctors in the 1940s advised that people with back problems sleep on firm mattresses, Sealy designed the Orthopedic Firm-O-Rest; it was renamed the Posturepedic in 1950 after the FTC banned the use of the medical term "orthopedic" in brand names.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the 1950s Sealy sprung out geographically (it added Canadian licensees in 1954) and financially (sales quintupled to $48 million during the decade). During the 1960s it became the first mattress firm to advertise on prime-time TV.
  </p>
        <p>
   The princess had her uncomfortable pea; Sealy had The Ohio Mattress Company, one of its independent licensees. In the 1950s Ohio Mattress began entering other licensees' territories (despite exclusive territory agreements) and lowering its prices to force its new rivals to sell out. In 1963 Ernest Wuliger succeeded his father as president of Ohio Mattress and began an aggressive expansion campaign. He acquired a Sealy licensee in Texas and Oklahoma in 1967, but Sealy bought some of the licensees that Wuliger wanted. The Supreme Court found Sealy guilty that year of antitrust violations regarding price-fixing and exclusive territories. Still, by the end of the 1960s, Sealy had sales of $113 million and additional international licensees.
  </p>
        <p>
   Wuliger took Ohio Mattress public in 1970. The next year Wuliger began a series of antitrust lawsuits against Sealy that lasted fifteen years. Ohio Mattress acquired bedding maker Stearns &amp; Foster (1983) and Woodstuff Manufacturing (1985). In 1986 the legal bedding battle ended, and Ohio Mattress was awarded $77 million. In 1987 Ohio Mattress opted to buy Sealy and all but one of Sealy's nine US licensees. It acquired the holdout licensee's Sealy license later in 1987 and became the leading mattress manufacturer.
  </p>
        <p>
   Investment firm Gibbons Goodwin van Amerongen led a $965-million, junk-bond-financed LBO of Ohio Mattress in 1989; it renamed the company Sealy in 1990. Amid a downturn in the junk-bond market, from 1991 to 1993 Sealy changed owners twice, ending up with investment fund Zell/Chilmark. It also found itself in bed with a variety of new CEOs. Right after the LBO, Wuliger resigned due to conflicts with the new owners. COO Malcolm Candlish was promoted to CEO. In 1992 Candlish resigned and was replaced by Lyman Beggs, who lasted until 1995, when he was replaced by Ronald Jones, former head of Masco Home Furnishings.

        <p>
   In 1997 investment firm
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   bought a majority stake in Sealy. Sealy also sold its Samuel Lawrence bedroom furniture unit (formerly Woodstuff Manufacturing) that year. The company relocated from Ohio to North Carolina in 1998. Sealy lost $34 million that fiscal year, in part due to early debt repayment related to the Bain Capital buyout.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sealy acquired the
   <company id="12752">
    Bassett
   </company>
   bedding license and Carrington-Chase brand from Premier Bedding in 2000; the deal included the corresponding factory. Sealy also bought control of Argentina-based bedding maker Rosen and built a factory in Brazil. In 2001 Sealy announced it would close its Tennessee bedding plant because it wasn't profitable. Marking its entrance into Europe, Sealy acquired Paris-based Sapsa Bedding the same year. In 2002 David McIlquham replaced Jones as CEO; Jones remained as chairman until 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2004 Sealy was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) for about $1.5 billion. It went public in 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2008 McIlquham resigned his posts and was replaced by company executive Larry Rogers as president and CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   In March 2013 Sealy was acquired by rival Tempur-Pedic International for $2.20 per share (plus debt), or approximately $1.3 billion.
