   The McClatchy Company is the #3 newspaper business in the US (behind
   <em>
    USA TODAY
   </em>
   publisher
   <company id="163382">
    Gannett
   </company>
   and
   <company id="163305">
    tronc
   </company>
   ). McClatchy has about 30 daily papers with a combined circulation of about 2 million. Its portfolio includes
   <em>
    The Kansas City Star, The Miami Herald, The Sacramento Bee
   </em>
   (California), and the
   <em>
    Star-Telegram
   </em>
   (Fort Worth, Texas). In addition, it has a 49.5% stake in
   <company id="47289">
    The Seattle Times Company
   </company>
   , publishes more than 40 nondaily newspapers in eight states, operates online news sites in conjunction with many of its papers, and has stakes in other digital media companies.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   McClatchy has two operating segments that it aggregates into a single reportable segment. One operating segment consists primarily of the company's newspaper operations in California, the Northwest, and Texas, while the other consists primarily of newspaper operations in the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, and the Midwest.

  <p>
   To address the structural shift to digital media, the company's newspapers provide editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats from its daily newspaper to leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter; on smartphones and on e-readers; on blogs and in niche publications and websites; in e-mail newsletters and RSS feeds. In addition, its websites offer leading digital classified products such as CareerBuilder.com, Cars.com and Apartments.com and retail and national advertising on Find n Save portals. The company also operates dealsaver, its proprietary daily deals service, in all of its markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   During fiscal 2014 McClatchy's revenue decreased by $95.6 million compared to the prior fiscal period. The revenue decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in demand for advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the drop in revenue during fiscal 2014, the company's net income increased by $373 million compared to previous year. The spike was mainly due to income from equity investments and a reduction in debt.

  <p>
   Smaller in stature than some of its rivals, McClatchy is also one of the few big newspaper companies that have not diversified wholesale into other forms of media. Both Gannett and Tribune, for example, own several television stations, while
   <company id="40006">
    Advance Publications
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12444">
    Graham Holdings
   </company>
   have diversified into magazines and education publishing, respectively. Reliant on newspaper advertising and subscriptions for the bulk of its sales, McClatchy offers a portrait of the industry's downward spiral caused by readers migrating away from print publications for their news.
  </p>
  <p>
   McClatchy is still working to boost revenue by transforming itself into a mixed-media news business. It continues to invest in Internet publishing operations to reach readers online and build new followings for its mastheads.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the 1840s James McClatchy was a reporter for Horace Greeley's
   <i>
    New York Tribune.
   </i>
   When Greeley exhorted young men to go west, McClatchy went. He worked for several newspapers in Sacramento before co-founding
   <i>
    The Bee
   </i>
   (named to liken reporters to industrious insects) in 1857. The paper gained a reputation as a crusader and was known for its antislavery stance. During the 1920s the company expanded with sister
   <i>
    Bee
   </i>
   s in Fresno and Modesto, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   The McClatchy family bought out the other owners, and the company grew under its watch. Granddaughter Eleanor McClatchy ran the company from 1936 until 1978. It went public in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   McClatchy bought three South Carolina dailies from The News and Observer Publishing Co. in 1990. Five years later it bought the Raleigh-based publisher -- giving it a toehold in North Carolina's fast-growing Research Triangle area -- as well as Nando.net (renamed Nando Media in 1998), its Internet publishing company. In 1996 and 1997 the company sold five of its community newspapers. Also in 1996 Gary Pruitt, who joined the company in 1984, was named CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 McClatchy became the surprise winner in the bidding for Cowles Media Company (
   <i>
    Star Tribune
   </i>
   ), for which it paid $1.4 billion. In 1998 the company sold Cowles' magazine and book publishing divisions. The company also changed its name from McClatchy Newspapers to The McClatchy Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made several Web-related investments in 2000; it took equity stakes in StreamSearch.com (a now defunct online audio and video search engine) and BrightStreet.com (online loyalty programs). McClatchy continued to focus on the Internet in 2001 even as it cut costs to combat a slump in ad spending.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company sold its Newspaper Network unit in two parts to news service
   <company id="44274">
    Associated Press
   </company>
   and ad services company
   <company id="46937">
    Vertis
   </company>
   (now called Vertis Communications). The McClatchy Company acquired six California newspapers, including the
   <em>
    Merced Sun-Star
   </em>
   , for $41 million in early 2004. The following year Nando changed its name once again when it became McClatchy Interactive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former chairman and patriarch of the family James McClatchy, great-grandson of the company's founder, died in 2006 at the age of 85. McClatchy briefly became the second-largest newspaper publisher in the US that year after it purchased rival
   <company id="10859">
    Knight-Ridder
   </company>
   for $4.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in debt. Following the deal, the company sold several of the newly acquired newspapers, as well as the
   <em>
    Star Tribune
   </em>
   (now owned by
   <company id="43313">
    Star Tribune Media Company
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   With newspaper revenue declining industry-wide, McClatchy moved to pay down debt in 2008. The company sold its stake in
   <company id="112401">
    SP Newsprint
   </company>
   to
   <company id="105425">
    Brant Industries
   </company>
   as part of a $350 million disposal along with former partners
   <company id="40110">
    Cox Enterprises
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12141">
    Media General
   </company>
   . It also sold the online directory Real Cities Network (purchased as part of the Knight-Ridder acquisition) to online media buyer Centro.
