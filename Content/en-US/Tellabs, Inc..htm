   For Tellabs, optical is not an illusion. Optical, as in fiber optic cable, is the basis of its business. The networking infrastructure company installs and supports optical LANs (Local Area Networks) for businesses, government agencies, health care facilities, hotels, and schools (from K-12 through university). The company's Access segments offers products for the delivery of bundled services over the "last mile," or final leg, of networks. The company is owned by

  <p>
   Tellabs was bought by Marlin Equity Partners for about $900 million in 2013 and taken private. Then in 2014, Marlin combined some of Tellabs businesses with those of another of its portfolio companies, Coriant. Marlin built Coriant from its acquisition of networking companies Nokia Siemens Networks and Sycamore. Tellabs is an independent company within the Marlin portfolio with the optical LAN and access businesses.

   Tellabs' passive optical LAN business sets up and services networks for a variety of clients. Optical LAN deliver information including voice, data, Internet, and more by high-speed fiber optic cable. It uses passive switches to route information, which reduces energy demand. The company's Telco Access offerings provide a range of networking options to customers. The company also provides support and training for its products.

   Tellabs focuses on passive optical LAN technology since it was spun out of the merger of the former Tellabs and Coriant, a merger engineered by Marlin Equity Partners, which owns the companies.

   Tellabs positions optical LAN as a higher performance, more efficient alternative to copper wire-based networking infrastructure. Its technology has been the backbone of

  <p>
   Tellabs (shortened from Telecommunications Laboratories) was founded in 1975 by Michael Birck, Charles Cooney, and several others. Birck was an Indiana farm boy who later became a
   <company id="107464">
    Bell Labs
   </company>
   engineer before working at Continental Telephone and telecommunications equipment manufacturer Wescom. At nascent Tellabs, Birck developed an echo suppressor on the company's homemade plywood workbench. (Echo suppressors improve the quality of long-distance calls by eliminating voice echoes caused by slight transmission delays.) Before long, the increased use of satellites for phone transmission had created a growth market for the product, and sales jumped from $300,000 in Tellabs' first year to almost $8 million in 1977.

   became one of the company's first major customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tellabs went public in 1980. When the creation of the regional Bell companies and several long-distance services providers in the mid-1980s led to a surge of competition, Tellabs boosted R&amp;D spending and refocused on high-end products. It entered the data communications market in 1983. However, cost overruns and delays in development of its TITAN long-distance routing system threatened to sink the company, and TITAN was jokingly compared with the
   <i>
    Titanic
   </i>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1987 a $10 million contract from
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   for digital echo cancelers helped revive Tellabs, which began marketing to overseas telecom service providers and making acquisitions, including Delta Communications (Ireland, 1987). Birck's faith in Tellabs bore fruit in 1991, when the company finally introduced its TITAN line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tellabs shifted its focus from the mature North American market to central and eastern Europe. In 1993 the company acquired Martis Oy, a Finnish maker of multiplexers. It debuted the CABLESPAN distribution system in 1994. Tellabs purchased wireless network system maker Steinbrecher Corp. and synchronous optical network (SONET) technology from Canadian firm TRANSYS Networks in 1996. The next year it bought multiplexing and optical networking technology from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and increased its push into Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Tellabs bought Coherent Communications Systems (now Tellabs Virginia, voice enhancement products). It called off its deal (originally valued at about $7 billion) to acquire telecom equipment maker
   <company id="52816">
    Ciena
   </company>
   after a key Ciena contract fell through. Also in 1998, Bell Atlantic awarded Tellabs a five-year contract as its sole supplier of SONET-based digital cross-connect systems. Tellabs sales rose nearly 38% in 1998, partly on the strength of the once-disparaged TITAN line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tellabs in 1999 won supply agreements with telecom operators in Brazil and Mexico, and it opened a factory in Ireland. Also that year Tellabs acquired Internet backbone specialist NetCore. Continuing its push for globalization, it also bought the European high-speed telephone networking equipment operations of Alcatel USA (formerly DSC Communications). In 2000 the company acquired privately held telephony switch maker SALIX. Later that year Birck turned over the day-to-day operations of Tellabs to former
   <company id="10094">
    Ameritech
   </company>
   chief Richard Notebaert, who became president and CEO. Birck remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Tellabs closed facilities and laid off about 30% of its staff, amid slow sales. In 2002 Tellabs acquired privately held Ocular Networks. Two years later the company appointed former Alcatel COO Krish Prabhu as its chief executive. Former CEO Michael Birck remained chairman. Also that year the company acquired network access product maker Advanced Fibre Communications (AFC) in a cash and stock deal valued at $1.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tellabs named VP and general manager of global services Robert Pullen as its CEO in 2008, replacing Krish Prabhu, who resigned. Pullen had been hired by Tellabs as an electrical engineer more than 20 years before.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tellabs used the 2009 acquisition of WiChorus for about $165 million in cash to supplement its R&amp;D efforts. WiChorus made the SmartCore mobile packet core platform, which supports fourth-generation (4G) wireless data communications standards, like Long Term Evolution (LTE) and WiMAX, as well as the 3G standards currently in place. SmartCore was designed to provide faster speeds and more simultaneous mobile Web connections.
