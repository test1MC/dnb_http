   DSP Group loves the sound of its own voice ... chips. The company's name derives from the digital signal processors (DSPs) and related speech compression software it develops that convert speech and other audio data into digital values for cordless telephones, wireless phones, answering devices, PCs, and other consumer electronics. Top customers include landline makers

   DSP operates through three divisions - home, office, and mobile. The home division, which accounts for 84% of sales, includes wireless ICs for cordless phones, residential gateway devices, wireless chipsets for home automation applications, and fixed-mobile convergence products. For the office segment, which accounts for 16% of sales, DSP makes VoIP terminals with converged voice and data applications. Its mobile products, which provide voice enhancement and far-end noise elimination for mobile phones and mobile headsets, have yet to make an impact on sales.

   DSP Group does not manufacture its chips but instead contracts with

   Overall sales fell 1% in 2015 to $144 million due to a 5% drop in its Home segment. A 56% growth rate in the miuch smaller Office segment kept the revenue reduction to just 1%. Demand for home phone systems declined, but office demand perked up from VoIP products.

   Net income fell by more than half to $1.56 million in 2015 from $3.6 million in 2014. The company had higher R&amp;D and sales and marketing expenses in 2015.

  <p>
   Lower inventory helped cash flow from operations rise to $12.2 million in 2015 from $10.4 million in 2014.

   For future growth the company is especially hopeful about new products, such as Wi-Fi application devices, that serve home communication needs. Because a large percentage of the company's revenue comes from chipsets for fixed-line telephony, the company is also challenged with the task of developing new products as that technology is rapidly replaced by mobile telephony. DSP's XpandR-II chipset has been designed for use with
   <company id="59101">

   </company>
   's Android.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to expand beyond cordless phones, DSP is developing technology for the Internet of Things, smart home devices, and home gateways as well as VOIPO system-on-a-chip offerings for enteprise, small business, and home office applications.
