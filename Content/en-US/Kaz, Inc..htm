   While Helen of Troy doesn't breakout sales for Kaz, its Healthcare/Home Environment (HHE) business segment, which includes Kaz and PUR Water Purification Products (acquired from
   <company id="11211">
    Proctor &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   in late 2011), accounted for 43% of its total fiscal 2014 (ended February) sales, or $568 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The company credited the increase primarily to unit volume increases and, to a lesser extent, higher average selling prices. PUR water filtration products posted double-digit growth in both the faucet-mount and water pitcher systems, partially offset by lost distribution in hot/cold therapy and weak insect control sales resulting from a cool, dry spring in North America.

   Kaz relies on new products to drive sales. Notable introductions include the Vicks Germ Free Cool Mist humidifier, the Braun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer, and the Honeywell line of HEPA Clean Air Purifiers.

   Looking ahead, the consumer products maker is working to improve execution with its trading partners and streamline its operations. The company expects to complete these efforts in fiscal 2014 (ends February) and reap the benefits in fiscal 2015 and beyond. It has begun construction of a $38 million, 1.3 million-square-foot warehouse in Olive Branch, Mississippi to house the distribution operations for both its personal care and healthcare/home environment appliance businesses. The new facility will consolidate these operations and is expected to come online in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
