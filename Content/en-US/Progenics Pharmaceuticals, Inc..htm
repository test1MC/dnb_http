   Progenics develops biotech drugs with oncology applications, as well as therapeutics used in clinical settings. Its pipeline includes prostate cancer treatments as well as drugs targeting viral and infectious diseases. Progenics' sole commercial product, Relistor, blocks the side effects of opioids without lessening their pain-killing power and is approved as an injectable treatment for opioid-induced constipation in seriously ill patients. The firm has licensed out marketing rights for Relistor to third parties in order to focus on its R&amp;D activities. Progenics' EXINI Bone BSI (bone scan index) product, acquired in 2015, is a tool to help physicians analyze bone scan images. It is marketed in Europe and Japan.

  <p>
   Progenics conducts its R&amp;D activities at its Tarrytown, New York, headquarters location. The company's only marketed product, Relistor, is sold in about 50 countries.

   Like most drug development companies, Progenics' income fluctuates from year to year based on the amount of money it receives from research grants, licensing fees, collaboration payments, and royalties.
  </p>
  <p>
   As such, revenue dropped 80% to $9 million in 2015 due to the loss of revenue from its Valeant/Salix collaboration. This was partially offset by an increase in royalty income. Net income (or net loss) has generally followed revenue; Progenics entered the black in 2011 and 2014 as collaboration revenues increased, but it has lost money in other years. In 2015 the company had a net loss of $39 million. At the end of that year, it had an accumulated deficit of $501 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like net income, cash flow from operations has been fluctuating over the past few years. The company had a cash outflow of $40 million in 2015 (versus an inflow in 2014).

   Progenics' cancer therapies include an antibody-drug conjugate (a combination of protein and chemical-based therapeutics) for prostate cancer, as well as a small molecule (traditional) therapeutic for other tumorous cancers. The company is looking to license or acquire additional oncology candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its partnership with Salix, Progenics is investigating an oral version of Relistor, as well as additional pain management applications for the drug. The company has conducted other R&amp;D programs through partnerships or licensing agreements with the likes of

   In 2016, the company granted

    Bayer
   </company>
   licensing rights for the development and commercialization of antibodies that combine Progenics' prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody technology with Bayer's targeted thorium conjugate technology. Progenics received an upfront fee and could receive additional development milestone payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered a global licensing agreement with
   <company id="40249">

   in 2015. It will utilize the university-developed PyL, a clinical-stage PSMA-targeted imaging agent to help detect prostate cancer.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired a 92% stake in Swedish software company EXINI Diagnostics, which makes technologies to support medical decisions through advanced image analysis. That purchase (priced at some $7 million) helped Progenics in its efforts to expand abroad, as well as boosting the development of products to help diagnose, monitor, and treat cancer.
