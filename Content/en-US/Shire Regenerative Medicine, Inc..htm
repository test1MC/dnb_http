   Starfish regrow damaged limbs, why not humans? That's the thinking that fuels Shire Regenerative Medicine (formerly Advanced BioHealing). The company's Dermagraft is a cell-based treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. The product is composed of living cells in an absorbable mesh, and it is applied once a week over an eight-week course of treatment to seal the wound. Shire Regenerative Medicine makes Dermagraft at its facility in California and sells it to wound care centers, doctors' offices, surgery centers, and government hospitals in the US and Canada. It also has a number of pipeline candidates for additional regenerative applications. Shire Regenerative Medicine is a subsidiary of

  <p>
   Shire Regenerative Medicine uses third-party carriers to ship Dermagraft to customers in the western US from its California headquarters. It also uses a third-party distribution site in Louisville, Kentucky, to reach customers in the eastern US. Sales of the drug extended into Canada in 2013 upon regulatory approval in that market.

   Parent company Shire launched a program to reorganize the sales and marketing departments within Shire Regenerative Medicine in 2012.

  <p>
   Annual revenues on sales of Dermagraft totaled $153.8 million in 2012. Sales of Dermagraft declined 21% in 2012 due the restructuring of the Shire Regenerative Medicine sales and marketing departments. By establishing a new commercialization model for the division, Shire expects sales of Dermagraft to increase in future years.

  <p>
   Shire Regenerative Medicine seeks to expand its product offerings through research, partnership, and acquisition efforts. Its pipeline includes candidates aiming to treat epidermolysis bullosa (a genetic skin disease) and to improve arteriovenous access in hemodialysis patients. It is also exploring additional applications for Dermagraft; however, trials on Dermagraft for treatment of venous leg ulcers were halted in late 2011 after the drug failed to meet certain endpoint goals.

  <p>
   Shire Regenerative Medicine gained a new development candidate, Vascugel, through Shire's 2012 acquisition of Pervasis for some $26 million. Vascugel aims to treat hemodialysis patients suffering from arteriovenous access difficulties.

  <p>
   The company was formed in 2003 and acquired by Shire for some $740 million in 2011; its name was changed from Advanced BioHealing to Shire Regenerative Medicine in 2012. Shortly before agreeing to be acquired by Shire, ABH had filed to go public through an estimated $200 million IPO. ABH intended to use the funds to build a second manufacturing facility, for R&amp;D, to repay debt, and to acquire complementary products or businesses.
