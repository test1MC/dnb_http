   Prior to being acquired by Montagu, the Rombi family controlled the company (with a 98.5% stake) through its holding company Imarko. The Montagu transaction was valued at an estimated â‚¬300 million. Montagu plans to help develop Arkopharma, taking advantage of the fractured natural medicine market.
