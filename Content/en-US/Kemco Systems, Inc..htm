   To grow its business, Kemco Systems has continued to innovate, touting its customized, energy-efficient, and cost-saving water solutions designed for commercial and industrial clients. In mid-2014, for example, Kemco designed a Ceramic Microfiltration (CMF) system for specialty metals fabricators and metal finishing plants that continuously treats water from their metals parts washer. The CMF system removes suspended solids, metals, oils, and other contaminants and sends them away to be treated and disposed, leaving the filtered water clean enough to be reused.

  <p>
   In 2013, it designed a CMF system with a reverse osmosis component for a bacon processing facility looking to treat and reuse its fat, oil, grease, and sanitation chemical-filled wastewater; a system that earned it an award for one of the top Wastewater Treatment System projects of the year by Water &amp; Wastes Digest.
