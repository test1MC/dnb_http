   SIGA Technologies is trying to put itself on the front lines of US biodefense efforts. The drug company has a number of development programs for vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics for drug resistant infections; however, its main focus is on vaccines for bio-defense. Its smallpox vaccine Arestvyr (aka Tecovirimat, or ST-246), which is intended to both prevent and treat the disease, has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA. SIGA is also developing vaccines for use against hemorrhagic fevers and other infectious diseases and biothreats. Much of its work is done through funding from the

    NIH
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="150448">
    HHS
   </company>
   . SIGA emerged from a short stint under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2016.

  <p>
   The company filed for bankruptcy protection after it was given a court ruling to pay $232 million in damages to competitor
   <company id="162080">
    PharmAthene
   </company>
   . SIGA plans to continue operating as usual, as well as pursuing a lowering of the penalty. Because of its status as the country's only maker of smallpox treatment, the company enjoys a certain level of government protection.
  </p>
  <p>
   PharmAthene sued SIGA in 2006, claiming it should share in the potential $5 billion in sales, primarily from the manufacture of Arestvyr (the development of which it helped fund).

   SIGA's lead candidate is Arestvyr, which is still going through trials despite being fast-tracked by the FDA. Other candidates in testing include treatments and preventions for dengue fever, Lassa fever, Junin, Ebola, Marburg, and bunyaviruses. All told, the company has about $420 million in grant money available if it can deliver on various projects.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SIGA has its headquarters in New York and R&amp;D facilities in Oregon. Its treatments have the potential to be used worldwide.

  <p>
   The company uses a small force of its own personnel to sell Arestvyr to the US government. As it expands its products, and customer base, it may expand its sales force or use third-parties.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   SIGA reported a 30% drop in revenue as some contracts concluded and others got restructured. It also saw related net loss and drop in cash flow as it used operating cash for the manufacture and marketing of Arestvyr.

  <p>
   The company's key strategy is to expand its customer base beyond the US government.
