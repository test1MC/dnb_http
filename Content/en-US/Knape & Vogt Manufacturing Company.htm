   Knape &amp; Vogt Manufacturing (KV) believes in easy access to your drawers whether it's at home or the office. The company makes drawer slides, TV lifts, flat panel mounts, shelving systems, closet rods, and other storage-related hardware items. It also offers kitchen and bath storage products. The company is best known for its KV brand and GSlide brand drawer slides and Workrite brand ergonomic office products. KV sells its products mostly to original equipment manufacturers, office furniture retailers, hardware chains, and specialty distributors in the US and Canada, but it also sells directly to consumers and government agencies.

   KV seeks acquisitions to expand its manufacturing capacity, distribution channels, and product lines. Indeed, the acquisitive firm has purchased more than half a dozen companies in about as many years. Following the purchase of a business in Canada in 2013, KV shut down the Ontario plant in mid-2014 and moved production to its facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired Waterloo Furniture Components and Dynaslide from
   <company id="55544">
    CompX
   </company>
   for about $59 million. Based in Ontario, Canada, and Taipei, Taiwan, respectively, both companies produce ball bearing slide products for the OEM market, including office furniture, appliances, commercial took chests, and other products. KV also purchased a Las Vegas, Nevada-based company, Diamond Storage Concepts. Diamond sells the Hyloft brand of ceiling mounted overhead storage, wall-mounted shelving, and tire storage products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previously, KV expanded its presence in the retail and distribution channels with the purchase of John Sterling Corporation in 2011, securing its foothold among several key retailers in the US and Canada in the areas of retail storage and organization. John Sterling, which specializes in making functional and decorative home storage and organization products, also has a door hardware business that represents a new category for KV and gives the company access to new commercial and residential hardware distributors. The acquisition follows KV's purchase of GSlide Corp. based in Taiwan in 2010. GSlide designs and manufactures sliding systems for distributors and manufacturers located primarily in Asia, Europe, and North America.

  <p>
   German inventors and brothers-in-law John Knape and Englebert Vogt arrived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in the late 19th century. They were intent on creating a new bicycle brake, but someone else beat them to the patent office, so in 1898 they founded Knape &amp; Vogt Manufacturing (KV) to produce store-fixture hardware. Knape's three sons continued to run the firm after he died in 1914.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1961, and the Vogt family divested. Two years later Knape's grandson Raymond Knape left his law career to become the #2 man at KV, after his cousin Donald. The company broadened its markets with the 1967 acquisition of Modar, a furniture components maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Donald died in 1985, Raymond became chairman and CEO and adopted a new strategy: invest heavily in new product development and acquire companies with complementary product lines and markets. Two years later KV bought store-fixture maker Roll-it, its largest Canadian competitor. The company doubled the size of its shelving line by acquiring Hirsh in 1993, thereby netting Hirsh's three top customers (retailers

   ,
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Allan Perry, who had been with the firm since 1978, became the first nonfamily member to hold the posts of president and CEO. Raymond Knape retired as chairman that year. Sales fell in 1996 and the company reversed its strategy, seeking to simplify operations. KV got into the metal office furniture business (selling drawer slides to manufacturers), sold Modar in 1997, and unloaded both Hirsh and Roll-it in 1998. Moving its Canadian manufacturing operations to the US led to losses in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder John Knape's great-grandson William Dutmers became chairman in 1998; the following year he assumed the title of president and CEO, replacing Perry. In 1999 the company bought Idea Industries, a manufacturer of adjustable keyboard mechanisms, wrist rests, and the like, which it markets under the Idea@Work name.
  </p>
  <p>
   KV added to the Idea@Work line in 2001 with task lighting products and a line of flat screen monitor arms (Mantis), and announced a new generation of Keynetix keyboards. The company reorganized its business operations in 2002, saying it intended to focus primarily on kitchen and bath storage products and office products.
