   You might say Perfection Bakeries strives for excellence in baking. A leading producer of baked goods, the company makes such products as bread, hamburger and hotdog buns, and English muffins for the retail market under its flagship Aunt Millie's brand. It also supplies baked goods and mixes to the foodservice industry. Perfection Bakeries has operations in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio, and its products are distributed primarily throughout the Great Lakes region. The family-owned company was founded in 1901 by John Franke as the Wayne Biscuit Company.

   To make some extra dough, Perfection Bakeries built a nearly 10,000-sq.-ft. distribution center and store for its Aunt Millie's brand in Saginaw, Michigan. The facility began production in 2011 and serves area supermarkets. The facility's opening also marks Perfection Bakeries' return to Saginaw; in 2003 the company shuttered its Schafer Bakeries location there.
