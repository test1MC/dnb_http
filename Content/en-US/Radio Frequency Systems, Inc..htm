  <p>
   One way RFS fuels growth is by expanding its manufacturing output. In 2012 it augmented its manufacturing center in Shanghai with the opening of a new base station antenna facility to better cater to customers within the emerging Asia/Pacific region. To better serve its North American customers, the company also upped its assembly capabilities in facilities in Wallingford, Connecticut, and Warsaw, Indiana, to respond to higher demand for its hybrid feeder cabling products in 2012.
