   Remember superconductors? Remember how they were so exciting and so much more, well, super than mere semiconductors? That hype eventually went away; it's instructive to remember it for comparison with the hype currently surrounding nanotechnology. After the superconductors hype died down, there were still companies that are seriously using the technology. HYPRES (pronounced HIGH-press) makes highly specialized superconductive integrated circuits, which operate at extremely high speeds and offer advanced functionality for applications in microscopy, radio astronomy, and optical networking. Wireless communications also are a focus for HYPRES, which is touting its chips for use in broadband base stations.
