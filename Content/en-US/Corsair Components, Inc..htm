   Hardcore gaming requires hardcore hardware, and that's where Corsair Components comes into play. Through subsidiaries, Corsair Components is a designer and supplier of high-performance components and peripherals for the PC gaming market. Its two product segments, which each generate about half of sales, include high-performance memory components (DRAM modules, USB flash drives) and gaming components and peripherals (power supply units, computer cooling units, gaming keyboards and mice, headsets, and cases). Corsair distributes its products in about 60 countries across the globe under its own name, as well as under the Dominator and XMS brands, among others. It generates more than half its sales from Europe.

   Corsair has sales and other operations in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the UK, and the US. Europe is its largest market, accounting for just over 50% of revenue; the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region contribute about 35% and 15%, respectively.
