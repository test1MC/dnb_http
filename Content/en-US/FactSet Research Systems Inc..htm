   Analysts, portfolio managers, and investment bankers know FactSet Research Systems has the facts down pat. The company offers global financial and economic information for investment analysis. FactSet also offers software for use in downloading and manipulating the data. (Its products can be fully integrated with

   applications such as Excel and PowerPoint.) Among the company's applications are tools for presentations, data warehousing, portfolio analysis, and report writing. Revenues are derived from month-to-month subscriptions to services, databases, and financial applications. More than 80% of revenue comes from investment managers; investment banking clients account for the rest.

  <p>
   About 30% of the company's revenues come from outside the US. Recent geographic growth efforts include the build out of new space in Paris and New York, as well as the continued expansion of offices in India and the Philippines. It opened its 24th office, located in Dubai, in 2011. In addition to those locations, FactSet has international offices in Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Netherlands.

  <p>
   The company's success is in part due to its focus on growing its proprietary content collection efforts, as well as investing in products and applications. Concurrent with the growth of its products and services, the company has gained new clients and users both in the US and internationally.

  <p>
   Howard Wille and Charles Snyder founded FactSet in 1978. Both had previously worked for Wall Street investment firm Faulkner Dawkins &amp; Sullivan (acquired by Shearson Hayden Stone in 1977). The company spent the 1980s building its client base and developing software that allowed clients to manipulate data on their own PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   FactSet opened an office in London in 1993 and one in Tokyo the next year. In 1994 the company added Morgan Stanley Capital International and EDGAR SEC filings to its database offerings. It added World Bank subsidiary International Finance Corp. in 1995 and the Russell U.S. Equity Profile report and Toyo Keizai, a Japanese company database, the next year. FactSet went public in 1996. Market Guide's information on US firms and ADRs (American depositary receipts) as well as the economic and financial databases of DRI/McGraw-Hill were added in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snyder retired in 1999 but remained vice chairman. The following year Wille retired and Philip Hadley became chairman and CEO. The company made its first acquisition in 2000 when it bought Innovative Systems Techniques (Insyte), a maker of database management and decision support systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company then began acquiring several content businesses. Its 2003 purchase of Mergerstat gave the company a database of global merger and acquisition and related information. In 2004 the company purchased JCF Group, a provider of broker estimates and other financial data to institutional investors, and CallStreet, a provider of quarterly earnings call transcripts to the investment community. The following year the company purchased TrueCourse, a provider of corporate competitive intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
   FactSet continued its acquisition spree with the 2005 purchase of Derivative Solutions (DSI), which offers fixed income analytics, portfolio management, and risk management services to financial institutions, and the 2006 purchase of AlphaMetrics, which provides institutional clients with software for capturing, measuring, and ranking financial information.
  </p>
  <p>
   FactSet in 2007 released its ExcelConnect offering, which enables data and analytics to be compatible with Microsoft Excel. Also that year the company enhanced its wireless capabilities, giving users access to market, company, and portfolio information via PDAs and other wireless devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 FactSet expanded with the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals business, which includes a global financial database with coverage of more than 43,000 companies. The company also purchased investment banking workflow tool DealMaven, reflecting its strategy of developing tools to make client workflows more efficient.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded in 2010 with the purchase of Market Metrics, a US-based market research firm focused on advisor-sold investments and insurance products. FactSet used the acquisition to increase its global sales, leveraging its own international network to sell Market Metrics products outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 FactSet expanded its presence in the Middle East when it opened an office in Dubai.
