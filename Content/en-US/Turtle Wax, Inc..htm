   Turtle Wax would have been one of those kitchen table success stories, except founders Ben and Marie Hirsch concocted their polish in the bathtub. The family-owned company sells its cleaning and polishing products in more than 90 countries. Turtle Wax has become the leader in total car care products worldwide. The company makes more than 1,250 items, mostly under the brand names Turtle Wax ICE, Turtle Wax Black Box, and Turtle Wax Headlight Restoration. The company's other products include engine treatments, vinyl and leather protectants, and odor removers. Turtle Wax also supplies bulk chemicals to car washes, including the handful it owns and operates in the Chicago area.

   Turtle Wax sold off one of its lines of business. Partner company Transchem, which has been providing Turtle Wax with its technology and manufacturing facilities for several years to make the Professional Product line, purchased the professional products business from Turtle Wax in 2013. As part of the agreement, Turtle Wax sold its Professional Products business -- and licensed the Turtle Wax name -- to Transchem for professional car wash-related chemicals in North America.

   Facing lagging sales and stiff competition from the likes of

   , Turtle Wax has been transitioning itself from a manufacturing-based business into a consumer products marketer while investing heavily in research and development. To that end, it has outsourced its chemical manufacturing and now generates most of its revenue through car-waxing and -washing products, metal polishes, rubbing compounds, wheel and tire cleaners, and other items.

   The company is focused on building Turtle Wax by innovating in related product areas and through possible strategic acquisitions.

   Looking outside the US to diversify, Turtle Wax supplies its products to South America, Asia, Africa, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. The consumer products company serves Singapore, thanks to its 2010 efforts to expand distribution of its Total Interior Care line of multi-surface cleaner there.

   In the 1950s founders Ben and Marie Hirsch changed their company name from Plastone Polish to Super Hard Shell and, later, to the company known as Turtle Wax. Led by the Hirsch's daughter Sondra Healy, Sondra's husband Denis John Healy Sr., and son Denis John Healy Jr., for many years, the family-owned company brought in an outside CEO in 2012.
