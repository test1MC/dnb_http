  <p>
   The Electronic Systems segment contributed about 45% of L-3 Communications' total revenue in 2013. This segment's overall sales decreased by 3% in 2013 due to less demand from its microwave products due to reduced deliveries of power devices for commercial satellite communication systems and mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the US military as programs ended.
