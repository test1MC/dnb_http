   BioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI) isn't inventing new drugs, but it is looking for better ways to administer them. The development-stage firm takes already approved drugs that are normally delivered intravenously and reformulates them into buccal (absorbed by the inner cheek) and oral treatments. Drugs delivered via its BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive) and Bioral systems focus on the areas of pain management and addiction management. Its BEMA fentanyl product ONSOLIS is a buccally delivered polymer film used for the treatment of cancer pain. Recent

   -approved candidates include BUNAVAIL, for the treatment of opioid dependence (2014), and BELBUCA, for chronic severe pain management (2015).

  <p>
   In partnership with Arcion Therapeutics, BDSI is also studying the effects of Clonidine Topical Gel for the treatment of diabetes-related pain symptoms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, BDSI regained marketing rights for ONSOLIS in North America from partner

   (which kept the marketing rights in other markets, including Europe, where the product is sold under the name BREAKYL). Similarly, the company regained global rights for the development and commercialization of BELBUCA from

   in late 2016. BDSI also has an agreement with ARx for the distribution of BUNAVAIL in the US.

   The company commercializes its products around the world, but primarily in North America and Europe.

  <p>
   Reflecting the increased activity around product approvals, BDSI spent $4.8 million on advertising in 2014. It spent no money on advertising in 2012 and 2013.

   The company relies heavily on royalty earnings and contracts revenues, which tends to result in drastic fluctuations in total revenue. In 2012, the company had two windfalls: an upfront payment from Endo, and contract earnings from Meda Pharmaceuticals related to the launch of ONSOLSIS in Europe); this resulted in revenue of $54.5 million that year. Revenue dropped drastically in 2013 but rebounded 245% to $38.9 million in 2014. This was largely due to two $10 million milestone payments from Endo as the partners wrapped up large clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its founding in 1997, BDSI has incurred net losses due to expenses related to R&amp;D activity and the pursuit of candidate approvals to get products on the market. Net loss totaled $54.2 million in 2014 due to higher R&amp;D costs and commercialization expenses for BUNAVAIL. As of the end of that year, the company's accumulated deficit was $205.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow declined in 2014 to $28.8 million due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

  <p>
   BDSI is focused on expanding its product portfolio and working with distribution partners to get its existing products to market. A significant portion of its spending goes towards R&amp;D ($34.3 million in 2014, or nearly half of its total operating expenses that year).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company received FDA approval for pain management drug BELBUCA. It received FDA approval for opioid dependence treatment BUNAVAIL in 2014.
