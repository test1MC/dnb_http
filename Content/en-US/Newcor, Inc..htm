   Newcor's core business is the production of metal, plastic, and rubber parts for the agricultural, auto, and appliance markets. The company's precision-machined products segment makes shafts, axles, and large iron and steel castings. Its rubber and plastics segment makes parts for auto and truck interiors and engine and body components. Newcor's special machines unit builds machines for welding and other processes for the appliance, auto, and general manufacturing markets. Makers of cars and light trucks account for about 70% of the company's sales; makers of agricultural equipment and heavy trucks account for the rest.

  <p>
   Newcor traces its origins back to the founding of National Electric Welding Machines Company in 1932. National Electric Welding, listed on the American Stock Exchange, changed its name to Newcor, Inc., in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, it acquired such companies as Wilson Automation (1973) and Dearborn Tool &amp; Machine (1981).
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move to build its auto parts business, Newcor purchased Midwest Rubber, a maker of transmission shift boots and seals, in 1992. Two year later the company continued to expand its auto parts business. Newcor posted a loss in 1994 due to cost overruns. In 1995 it bought three rubber-products companies: Boramco, Production Rubber Products, and Rubright Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold most of its special machine tool operations in 1996 to refocus on components and assemblies. In 1997 Newcor bought Machine Tool &amp; Gear, a maker of automotive gears and rear axle shafts. The next year it acquired Deco Group (engine and powertrain components) and Turn-Matic (engine components). Heavily in debt from its acquisitions and suffering from labor inefficiencies and high scrap rates, the company closed its plant in Livonia, Michigan, and replaced some senior plant managers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Management continued its restructuring efforts into 2000 as holding company EXX bought an initial 15% stake in the company. By July 2001 EEX had increased its stake in Newcor to 31%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Newcor's debt load proved to be too great, however, and early in 2002 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. With help from a fresh investment by EEX, Newcor emerged from bankruptcy in January 2003. EEX wound up with a 99% stake in the reorganized Newcor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Newcor sold the assets of Midwest Rubber to an investment group led by the unit's managers.
