   A good-tasting, low-fat potato chip is not an oxymoron at Kettle Foods. The company produces all-natural, hand-cooked chips in flavors such as New York Cheddar, Sea Salt, Backyard Barbecue, and Spicy Thai. The company also manufactures and sells tortilla chips, roasted nuts, trail mixes, and nut butter spreads. Whereas in the past, Kettle Foods' products were only available in natural food stores, the company has extended its market reach in recent years by moving into mainstream supermarkets. Kettle's products are available throughout North America, as well as in Asia and Western Europe. The company, which was founded in 1978, was acquired by snack foods maker
   <company id="100917">
    Diamond Foods
   </company>
   in 2010.

  <p>
   Kettle sells its products throughout North America, Asia, and Western Europe. The company operates three production facilities. Its Salem, Oregon, plant has 70,000 sq. ft. while Kettle's Norwich, England, facility boasts some 123,000 sq. ft. The snack foods maker also operates a 140,000-sq.-ft. office/manufacturing plant in Beloit, Wisconsin.

  <p>
   Kettle's products are sold directly to retailers in the US and internationally, including grocery, drug, and convenience stores; mass merchandisers; and club stores. It also distributes through wholesalers.

  <p>
   Parent Diamond saw advertising expenses increase nearly 10% in 2013 in large part because of continued support of the Kettle brand.

  <p>
   Along with Pop Secret popcorn, Kettle makes up Diamond's snacks category, which experienced revenue growth of 3% -- to $438 million -- in 2013 (on top of 5% growth in 2012). The increase in 2013 is credited to a rise in sales price.

  <p>
   One of Kettle's brand differentiators is its focus on all-natural ingredients. It promises products with no trans-fats, no preservatives, no MSG, and with all-natural colors and flavors. In 2012 it became the first potato chip brand to earn verification from the Non-GMO Project when 16 of its brands were given the designation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also spurs growth with new flavors. In 2012 and 2013 Kettle introduced Maple Bacon, Sweet &amp; Salty, Cheddar Beer, and Jalapeno Jack, among other flavors.

  <p>
   Kettle Foods was owned by London-based private investment firm
   <company id="139170">
    Lion Capital
   </company>
   , which put the chip maker up for sale in 2009. Suitors interested in acquiring Kettle included
   <company id="48009">
    Frito-Lay
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="118615">
    Snyders of Hanover
   </company>
   and the UK's
   <company id="90455">
    United Biscuits
   </company>
   . Ultimately it was San Francisco-based Diamond Foods that bellied up to pay $616 million to take over the company. Diamond, primarily a snack-nut maker, was looking to diversify into potato chips to boost its bottom line.
