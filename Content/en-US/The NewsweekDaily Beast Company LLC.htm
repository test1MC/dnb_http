   This news beast knows a thing or two about current events. The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company joint venture formed after the late stereo equipment magnate Sidney Harman purchased the ailing
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   from The Washington Post in 2010 and merged it with
   <company id="52963">
    IAC/InterActive's
   </company>
   online current events magazine
   <em>
    Daily Beast
   </em>
   in 2011. The
   <em>
    Daily Beast
   </em>
   launched in 2008 by former
   <em>
    Vanity Fair
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    New Yorker
   </em>
   editor Tina Brown. Beginning in January 2013,
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   ceased offering a print version and became an online-only magazine.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The marriage of the two publishers spoke to the future of print media (or lack thereof) in the digital era. In the wake of a deteriorating advertising climate that hit the magazine industry hard,
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   had a difficult time weathering the economic storm, and circulation dropped to 1.5 million in 2010 (down from 2.6 million in 2007).
  </p>
  <p>
   IAC Chairman Barry Diller and Brown hoped the merger with
   <em>
    Daily Beast
   </em>
   would help
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   adapt to the digital era's rapid-paced news cycle, and later in 2011 a redesigned
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   debuted with a return to more photojournalism and informational graphics, as well as a focus on both young and old audiences.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the new design didn't pan out as expected, and Brown announced in October 2012 that the final print edition for
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   would be the December 2012 issue. Beginning in 2013, the title became an online-online publication, just like the
   <em>
    Daily Beast
   </em>
   . The company also reduced staff to adjust to the new format.
  </p>
  <p>
   The magazine's previous re-design in 2009 eschewed the masses in favor of a smaller, more affluent audience. Rather than detailed reports of the week's events,
   <em>
    Newsweek's
   </em>
   content featured more columns, commentary, and long reporting pieces, as well as a higher price tag.

  <p>
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   was founded in 1933 by Thomas Martyn, a former editor at
   <em>
    Time
   </em>
   magazine who wanted to strike up some competition. In 1961 The Washington Post bought it. Some 50 years later, Harman, the billionaire founder of
   <company id="10707">
    Harman International Industries
   </company>
   , bought the money-losing
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   from The Washington Post for just $1 and assumed about $47 million in financial liabilities. One of several bidders, Harman was reportedly chosen because he pledged to keep the majority of the company's staff in place.
  </p>
  <p>
   Months after he purchased
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   , Harman forged a new deal to merge the operations of
   <em>
    Newsweek
   </em>
   with those of the
   <em>
    Daily Beast
   </em>
   , which had been operating as part of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActive. Early the following year the two editorial staffs combined under the editorship of Brown. After Harman's death of complications from leukemia in 2011, his family retained its 50% stake in the company, while IAC owns the other half of the venture.
