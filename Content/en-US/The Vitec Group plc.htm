   Ready for your close-up? Vitec knows that detail is everything when cameras are involved. The Vitec Group supplies equipment such as cameras and lights for the broadcast and photographic industries (including video and live events), as well as the military, aerospace, and government (MAG) markets. The company also provides production and technical support, as well as equipment rental services and sales of used equipment. Vitec includes about 20 subsidiaries, and its products are distributed in over 100 countries. The company was founded in 1910 as W. Vinten.

   Vitec arrested four years of falling sales in 2015, posting 3% growth to £317.8 million as higher demand for products including wireless transmitters and receivers, camera monitors, mobile power and LED lighting products boosted sales figures in the Broadcast division. Net income was flat at £13 million. Cash flow from operating activities fell 9% to £32.1 million due to changes in working capital and increases in interest and tax paid.

  <p>
   Vitec is working to expand its brand presence and sales in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as expand through acquisitions. In China, it introduced a new direct distribution model. It acquired SmallHD, a maker of monitors and viewfinders, and also launched Manfrotto Digital Director, which allows photographers to operate their cameras via tablet from afar.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company sold its IMT business, which was based in the US and was included in the Broadcast Division. The disposal enabled the Vitec place greater focus on its core activities in the Broadcast and Photographic divisions.

  <p>
   In 2014, the company acquired North Carolina-based SmallHD, a leading provider of high-definition on-camera field monitors. The acquisition complements Vitec's existing video activities, including Teradek, which serves a similar customer base.
