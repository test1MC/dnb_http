   Scholle identifies expanding its performance packaging business as a key part of its strategy for growth. Consistent with this effort, it sold its Vacumet Plastics division, a supplier of metallized plastic films, in 2012 to India's Polyplex.

  <p>
   Scholle, founded in 1945, has evolved from what was historically a chemical business that specialized in nitrocellulose-based products. Scholle's concept of bag-in-a-box packaging (a flexible spouted bag held inside and supported by a rigid outside container) traces back to 1955. Its success helped transform the company to a vertically integrated producer of flexible packaging and advanced material products -- from spouts and taps to bag-in-box and buoyancy products.
