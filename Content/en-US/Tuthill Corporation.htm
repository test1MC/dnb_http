   Tuthill implements what it calls the Tuthill Business System in organizing its manufacturing and operations. The system is modeled after the famous Toyota Production System, which

   </company>
   uses for continuous improvement of its business processes and manufacturing techniques. Tuthill also follows a "Conscious Company" approach to management, which encourages all of its employees to become "radical leaders" in improving their workplaces.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has in recent years been scaling back its operations and paying down debt by selling some of its holdings. In 2012 it sold its Drive Systems division to private equity firm HCI Equity Partners. The division was reorganized into a stand-alone company and renamed TDS Drive.
