  <p>
   Charles often enhances its product portfolio through acquisitions. In 2012 the company acquired the molded high density polyethylene (HDPE) below grade enclosure product line from NewBasis, a company based in California. Charles' acquisition of the line complemented its existing enclosures and expanded its applications for current telecommunications, cable, and broadband customers. In addition, it allowed Charles to introduce new products and accelerate growth in its newest markets: wireless, utility, and vertical markets.
