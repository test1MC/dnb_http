   DePuy Synthes makes it possible for orthopedic patients to stand up straight and take a step in the right direction. Part of
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , DePuy Synthes develops and markets orthopedic joint reconstruction, spinal care products, and neurosurgical devices. As one of the world's largest suppliers of orthopedics, the company's offerings include hip replacements; knee, shoulder, and spinal implants; internal and external fixator products for bone fractures; and operating room equipment and supplies. The company's products are used primarily by orthopedic specialists and neurosurgeons to treat patients with musculoskeletal defects resulting from diseases, deformities, trauma, or accidents.

  <p>
   The DePuy organization expanded greatly through J&amp;J's 2012 acquisition of Swiss orthopedics firm
   <company id="136313">
    Synthes
   </company>
   for some $21.3 billion. The deal added surgical plates, bolts, biologic implants, and power tools for bone, spine, and soft tissue repair procedures and boosted DePuy into the top spot in the global orthopedics industry; it also became the largest business in the J&amp;J family. Following the purchase, as efforts to integrate the DePuy and Synthes organizations began, J&amp;J's orthopedics division was rebranded as DePuy Synthes.

  <p>
   DePuy Synthes's business spans four units:
   <company id="108394">
    DePuy Orthopaedics
   </company>
   (hip, knee, and shoulder replacements, trauma products),
   <company id="139090">
    DePuy Spine
   </company>
   (spine diagnostic and devices),
   <company id="139097">
    DePuy Mitek
   </company>
   (sports medicine, arthroscopy, soft tissue repair), and
   <company id="104021">
    Codman &amp; Shurtleff
   </company>
   (neuroscience and neurosurgical devices).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company contributes more than $9 billion in sales to J&amp;J's Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and is one of the parent's fastest-growing businesses accounting for nearly 40% of overall J&amp;J sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Hip and knee replacements are key to the company's reconstructive products business, which also includes shoulder implants. With more Baby Boomers wearing out joints, DePuy Synthes is looking to increase sales through continued product innovation, partnerships, and select acquisitions. For instance, in 2014 the company introduced several new products, such as the DePuy Synthes Advantage suite of products, the Conform Sheet for posterolateral spinal fusion surgeries, and the Attune Knee System. The company rolled out the mPACT (medialized Posterior Approach Cortical Trajectory) program in 2013. Through a 2013 collaboration with Brainlab, DePuy Synthes launched navigation-ready instrumentation for its leading spine systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also broadens the scope of its offerings through research and development efforts.

  <p>
   To build up its neurosurgical device line (another targeted growth area), J&amp;J spent $480 million to acquire
   <company id="138080">
    Micrus Endovascular
   </company>
   and placed it within the Codman &amp; Shurtleff organization in 2010. The combined product lines for the treatment of stroke will compliment and reinforce one another. Also, the DePuy Orthopaedics division expanded in 2009 through the purchase of Finsbury Orthopaedics Limited, a UK maker of implant systems. The acquisition added several hip replacement and resurfacing systems, as well as knee and ankle implant systems.

  <p>
   Traveling medicine salesman Revra DePuy started the company in 1895 to sell fiber splints invented to replace the wooden barrel staves typically used to set fractures. DePuy died in 1921; his widow, Winifred, later remarried and her husband, Herschel Leiter, ran the company for almost three decades.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1974 DePuy was bought by German diagnostics specialist Boehringer Mannheim, eventually placing it under the control of subsidiary Corange. James Lent, a former
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   executive, was named president of DePuy in 1985 (he became chairman and CEO in 1991). Under Lent, the company began buying international distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lent also oversaw a slew of acquisitions that increased the company's product line. DePuy bought six firms from 1991 to 1997, including purchases that moved the company into trauma products (ACE Medical, 1994) and sports medicine (Orthopedic Technology, 1996). DePuy went public in 1996 with Corange keeping a controlling stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core businesses, in 1997 DePuy sold its UK pharmaceutical and health care operations. In 1998 it bought AcroMed, creating the world's #2 spinal implant firm behind
   <company id="16492">
    Sofamor Danek
   </company>
   (now a Medtronic subsidiary).
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="41787">
    Roche Holding
   </company>
   acquired Corange (and Corange's stake in DePuy) in 1998. Roche then sold DePuy for $3.7 billion to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which made the company part of its professional division. At that point Lent became a company group chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Michael Dormer took over the helm at DePuy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 DePuy entered the biotech arena when it introduced a soft-tissue implant (made of sterilized pork belly) to repair shoulder tendons. The following year it made plans to use the material for a product that would treat tendon and ligament damage suffered by athletes and the elderly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the DePuy AcroMed division's name was changed to
   <company id="139090">
    DePuy Spine
   </company>
   ; the unit acquired Link Spine Group that same year. Mitek joined the DePuy family that year as well, and was renamed
   <company id="139097">
    DePuy Mitek
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Michael Mahoney was named to be chairman of the DePuy group of companies in 2006. The company also acquired Hand Innovations that year to widen the extremities product line of the
   <company id="108394">
    DePuy Orthopaedics
   </company>
   business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Codman &amp; Shurtleff first entered the stroke management industry in 2008 when J&amp;J contributed its Cordis Neurovascular division to the business and renamed it Codman Neurovascular.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company completed construction of a new manufacturing plant in China. DePuy also created the DePuy Institute, a research and education facility in the US, to support its growth efforts in 2008. The institute provides training for health care professionals and other technological services.
