   Hands down, Lansdowne Chemicals is the largest consumer of hydrazine hydrate in the UK.

Hydrazine hydrate is also used to produce pharmaceutical chemicals, plastic additives, herbicides and fungicides. The company's aroma unit is a leading supplier to the European aroma industry, and its nutrition unit supplies essential additives for the feed and food industries.
