  <p>
   Although aftermarket products have been the company's focus, Lund's manufacturing capabilities enable the company to produce parts to the specifications of OEMs. Lund's manufacturing processes include plastic injection molding, precision metal forming, and thermoforming.

   Streamlining its business proposition, in 2012 Lund realigned its brands from Auto Ventshade, Belmor,
   <company id="16942">

   </company>
   , Lund, Nifty, and Trenz, to three distinct brand names: Auto Ventshade, Belmor, and Lund. The company is also seeking strategic opportunities to expand its existing businesses and product offerings.

  <p>
   In 2013 Lund's parent (Lund International Holding) acquired Texas-based Tradesman Truck Accessories, a manufacturer of aluminum and steel truck and utility boxes, as well as liquid storage tanks. The deal boosted Lund's existing aluminum box offerings and expanded its capabilities into the steel box and liquid storage tank markets.

  <p>
   Lund, which traces its roots back to the 1930s, was founded in 1965 by entrepreneur Allan Lund.

  <p>
   Adding a little style to light trucks wasn't Allan Lund's first business, just his most successful. The former teacher and insurance salesman founded Lund International in 1965 to do prototype work for snowmobile, boat, and other recreational vehicle makers. It entered the light truck accessory market in 1978 with the Lund SunVisor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1987 and three years later began selling bug shields and grille inserts. Lund grew in the early 1990s as sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles exploded. Offering a broad line of branded products, the company kept its name in front of customers by sponsoring NASCAR races.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Lund won approval to sell its products in Europe. That year William McMahon, the company's CEO from 1988 through 1991, returned to lead the enterprise -- after a stint at Anagram International. Lund acquired specialty coverings maker Innovative Accessories in 1995. A downturn in the automotive accessories market led to a dip in sales the next year. In 1997 Allan Lund sold his stake in the company to Harvest Partners and retired as chairman. Also that year the company bought truck accessory company Deflecta-Shield for $90 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisition-related expenses caused a deeper loss in 1998. That year Dennis Vollmershausen, who headed construction equipment company Champion Road Machinery, replaced CEO McMahon, who retired. Lund boosted its light-truck accessories business by acquiring Auto Ventshade ($67 million) in 1998 and Smittybilt ($18 million) in 1999. To cut costs, the company announced that it would begin outsourcing its production of fiberglass in 2000. Also in 2000, Lund relocated its corporate headquarters to Deluth, Georgia, and announced plans to move its distribution center from Minnesota to Georgia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2002 Lund sold its Smittybilt and Trailmaster divisions (tubular steel and suspension products) to newly created Smittybilt Automotive Group, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2003 Lund was taken private when the company merged with Aftermarket Holdings, Inc., whose investors included Harvest Partners and Lund management. Lund International Holdings, Inc. emerged as the surviving entity.
