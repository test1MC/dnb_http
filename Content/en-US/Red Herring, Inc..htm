    Red Herring

   doesn't want to divert your attention from the real issue: technology. The tech-focused magazine covers technology issues, trends, and companies, as well as the entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who back them. It also publishes the Red Herring 100 lists, which annually name the top privately held technology startup firms. Red Herring's other operations include a Web site, newsletters, research reports, and conferences. Multimedia content on RedHerring.com includes slide shows, blogs, videocasts, and podcasts. The company is owned by French entrepreneur Alex Vieux, who serves as chairman and CEO.  Vieux previously owned a conference business called DASAR.
