   Motorists get a lot of hands-on experience with products made by Tokheim. The company manufactures gas pumps found across Europe and also offers fuel dispensing systems, retail automation systems, and "pay-at-the-pump" terminals. Tokheim sells directly and through distributors to customers that include oil companies, service-station owners, convenience stores, French hypermarkets (huge stores with service stations), and commercial customers such as trucking companies. The company has expanded outside of Europe through joint ventures in China and India. It was acquired by

   Once a big player in the North American market, in 2002 Tokheim entered into its second bankruptcy, as

   and
   <company id="10434">
    Danaher
   </company>
   carved up the North American holdings and AXA Private Equity bought 94% of the company's remaining assets. AXA then changed the company's name to Tokheim s.a.s. and moved its headquarters to France. Company president Patrick Berthon, one of the few executives remaining after the purchase, and eight other officers retained a stake in the company. Cognetas acquired Tokheim in late 2005.

  <p>
   In 1898 John Tokheim conceived the idea of a pump to dispense kerosene and gasoline from drums. The Tokheim Dome Oil Pump led to the formation of Tokheim Manufacturing in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1901. A group of Fort Wayne businessmen acquired the business in 1918 and changed its name to Tokheim Oil Tank and Pump. The company went public in 1948; it shortened its name in 1953. Tokheim endured a strike in the 1970s and an unsuccessful diversification into the making of vending machines and dental X-ray chairs in the late 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Douglas Pinner, former president of Slater Steel, was brought in as CEO to restructure the company in 1992. He refocused Tokheim on gasoline-dispensing equipment and downsized the debt-laden business. In 1993 the firm secured a contract to provide equipment to Shell Europe; it landed a deal the following year to provide 3,000 Amoco (now BP Amoco) gas stations in the US with automated dispensers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 the company acquired France's Sofitam International, a leading maker and distributor of gas-dispensing systems in Europe. In 1997 it launched an automated fuel dispenser using chips made by Micron Communications. Also that year Tokheim bought retail automation software developer Management Solutions to boost its line of retail automation systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued its growth in 1998, purchasing Schlumberger's fuel dispensing and servicing business (Retail Petroleum Systems) for $330 million. The company posted a loss that year due to merger and acquisition costs and the retirement of debt. The consolidation of the major oil companies the following year also hurt earnings as big gas marketers decreased spending for gas pumps and other service-station products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Softening demand for gas pumps and debt from the Schlumberger purchase caused Tokheim to file Chapter 11 in 2000. After securing more financing and giving 88% of the company to creditors (led by financial firm ABN AMRO), Tokheim emerged from bankruptcy in late 2000. The following year Tokheim announced that it would not retain the audit services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP; Ernst &amp; Young LLP signed on as the company's independent public accountants later that year. In early 2002 Tokheim signed a deal to supply point-of-sale terminals to
   <company id="41841">

   </company>
   . After completing the sale of its North American assets in early 2003, Tokheim's international operations were sold to France-based AXA Private Equity (94%) and nine executive managers (6%); the company's corporate headquarters were also moved to France.
