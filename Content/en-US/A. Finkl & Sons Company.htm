   Thanks to Mrs. O'Leary's cow, A. Finkl &amp; Sons has chiseled a niche for itself in the steel industry. The company was founded in 1879 when Anton Finkl developed a chisel to clean bricks rescued from buildings destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. Since then Finkl has forged ahead to become a leading global supplier of forging die steels. (A forging die is a steel block used in a hammer or press for shaping metal.) The firm also produces plastic mold steels, die casting tool steels, and custom open-die forging. Finkl holds more than 100 steel formulation and manufacturing technology patents. German steel company SCHMOLZ+BICKENBACH owns Finkl.

  <p>
   The company makes all of its products in Chicago, with distributions locations in California, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio. It also has distribution outlets in China, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UK. Finkl sells its products in the US and to some 18 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   A leading global supplier of forging die steels, plastic mold steels, die casting tool steels, and custom open-die forgings, Finkl processes about 100,000 tons of steel annually.

  <p>
   Finkl sells the majority of its products to manufacturers, including plastic processors, die casting companies and closed-die forging plants, who use Finkl steel in their manufacturing operations. Its markets include aerospace, automotive, chemicals, food, medical technology, and oil and gas.

  <p>
   The company operates as a part of the production division of SCHMOLZ+BICKENBACH. The production division contributed about 80% of the parent company's total revenues in 2015. That division's revenues declined by 4% due to the declining prices for scrap and nickel as well as decreases in the oil and gas business on account of the sharp drop in crude oil prices.

  <p>
   In 2015 Finkl, Composite Forgings, and Sorel Forge merged to form Finkl Steel, a subsidiary of the SCHMOLZ + BICKENBACH Group.

  <p>
   In 2013 Finkl phased out its century-old Chicago plant on the Near North Side and began operating a new facility on the city's South Side. The new $180 million, 53-acre factory (which is equipped with its own electric substation) will increase production dramatically, to 500,000 tons per year. The plant also has cleaner-burning melting equipment (including a 70-ton electric arc furnace) as well as new energy-efficient furnaces.
