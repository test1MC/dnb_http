  <p>
   Kellogg's largest customer is
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , which accounted for about 21% of sales in fiscal 2016 (ended January). The company's top five customers generated some 34% of Kellogg's total sales that year. The company's dependence on just a few companies makes it vulnerable to the loss of or weakness at any one of these retailers. It's also vulnerable to competition from lower-priced private-label cereal brands, to which consumers typically flock during tough times.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company markets its cereal products, in general, under the recognizable Kellogg's name as well as its "healthy" brand Kashi. Products are sold to supermarkets through a direct sales force model for resale to consumers. Kellogg uses broker and distributor arrangements for certain products  in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments. These particular arrangements are leveraged to market its products in less-developed areas or in markets outside its focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kellogg's advertising expense in 2016 was less than $1 billion, down from $1.09 billion in 2015 and $1.13 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   Kellogg continued a three-year slide in revenue and earnings in 2016 (ended January).
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues slipped 7% to $13.25 billion in 2016 on lower sales in all segments. Sales fell 13% in Europe due to flat volume and unfavorable pricing. Also US Morning Foods dropped 4% on a decline in sales of Special K.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lower revenue pushed net income lower to $614 million, a 3% decline. The company also reported higher interest expenses on a bigger level of long-term debt and higher interest rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in 2016, compared to $1.8 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   Kellogg is working at cutting costs and expanding revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Project K is a four year efficiency and effectiveness program that began in 2013. This program is designed to help the company focus on core products with increased level of value-added innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Kellogg adopted zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program in North America business. The process helped slice $100 million in annual savings in North America during 2016 (ended January). The company plans to expand ZBB program to international market.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the product side, Kellogg is extending several brands with additional offerings. They include Special K Nourish, Mini-Wheats Harvest Delights, Smorz, and Disney Dory-themed cereal (in line with the Pixar movie "Finding Dory."
  </p>
  <p>
   In the cookie aisle Kellogg advertising is bringing back the Keebler Elves to push cookies. The company also is putting attention and muscle behind the Kashi brand. It intends to promote Kashi Go-Lean products, which have been Non-GMO Project Verified, and Kashi Heart-to-Heart products, which have been fashioned to meet the USDA's organic standard.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Kellogg creates joint venture and acquires 50% stake in a sales and distribution company, Tolaram Africa, to expand its presence in Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
   Will Keith (W. K.) Kellogg first made wheat flakes in 1894 while working for his brother, Dr. John Kellogg, at Battle Creek, Michigan's famed homeopathic sanitarium. While doing an experiment with grains (for patients' diets), the two men were interrupted; by the time they returned to the dough, it had absorbed water. They rolled it anyway, toasted the result, and accidentally created the first flaked cereal. John sold the flakes via mail order (1899) in a partnership that W. K. managed. In 1906 W. K. started his own firm to produce corn flakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   As head of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, W. K. competed against 42 cereal companies in Battle Creek (one run by former patient C. W. Post) and roared to the head of the pack with his innovative marketing ideas. A 1906
   <em>
    Ladies' Home Journal
   </em>
   ad helped increase demand from 33 cases a day earlier that year to 2,900 a day by year-end. W. K. soon introduced Bran Flakes (1915), All-Bran (1916), and Rice Krispies (1928). International expansion began in Canada (1914) and followed in Australia (1924) and England (1938).
