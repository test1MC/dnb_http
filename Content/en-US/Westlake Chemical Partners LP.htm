   Westlake Chemical Partners (WCP) is a limited partnership formed by basic chemical manufacturer
   <company id="106287">
    Westlake Chemical
   </company>
   to operate, acquire, and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. WCP's business and operations are conducted through Westlake Chemical OpCo, a partnership between Westlake and WCP. WCP owns Westlake Chemical OpCo's general partner and controls Westlake Chemical OpCo's assets and operations: three ethylene production facilities, which convert primarily ethane into ethylene (with an aggregate annual capacity of approximately 3.4 billion pounds), and a 200-mile ethylene pipeline. The company went public in 2014.

  <p>
   WCP raised $270 million in an August 2014 IPO to purchase a 4.4% stake in Westlake Chemical OpCo (which in turn gave WCP another 5.6% stake, to give it an overall 10% holding).
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the offering, WCP held a 10% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo as well as the general partner interest.
   <company id="106287">
    Westlake
   </company>
   retained a 90% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo and retained a significant interest in WCP through its ownership of its general partner and 55.7% of WCP's limited partner units (consisting of 1,436,115 common units and all of the subordinated units) and its incentive distribution rights.

  <p>
   In connection with this offering, Westlake Chemical OpCo entered into a 12-year ethylene sales agreement with Westlake, under which Westlake agreed to buy 95% of Westlake Chemical OpCo's planned ethylene production each year on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10 Any ethylene not sold to Westlake and all co-products that are produced by Westlake Chemical OpCo will be sold to third parties on either a spot or contract basis. Westlake Chemical OpCoo also entered into a feedstock supply agreement with Westlake that will supply Westlake Chemical OpCo with all of the ethane (and any other feedstocks) required for that company to produce ethylene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Westlake Chemical OpCo plans to expand the capacity of one of its ethylene production facilities by approximately 250 million pounds in late 2015 or early 2016.
