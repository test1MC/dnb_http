   A titan of cheese, Leprino Foods is the worldwide leader in mozzarella-making and one of the largest privately held companies in the US. It sells its soft, cream-colored cheese to food manufacturers and pizza purveyors large and small, including such powerhouse pizza companies as
   <company id="40131">
    Domino's
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="16241">
    Papa John's
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="89521">
    Pizza Hut
   </company>
   . Besides mozzarella, the company's portfolio of products boasts string cheeses and reduced-fat cheddar and Monterey Jack. Aside from its cheese business, Leprino operates a dairy powders segment that provides whey protein concentrate, lactose, and functional proteins for use in animal feeds, yogurt, baby formula, confectionery, and baked goods. The company, which is owned by the Leprino family, sources its milk from the nation's largest dairy co-ops.

   Leprino, which holds more than 50 cheese-making patents, manufactures its cheese at company-owned factories in the US and Europe. It also has a UK-based joint venture -- Glanbia Cheese -- with Irish cheese maker

   Headquartered in Denver, Leprino has 11 cheese-making operations located throughout the US in California, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, New Mexico, and New York. Overseas, the manufacturer operates a pair of plants through a joint venture in the UK and also has a presence in Singapore. It sells cheese products to more than 40 countries.

   Leprino sells its products to pizza chains, frozen food makers, foodservice distributors, and cheese shredders. The world's largest food company,
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   , is a customer. Nestlé leverages Leprino to supply ingredients for manufacturing Hot Pockets and Stouffer's microwave pizzas.

   The cheesemaker, which holds more than 50 production and manufacturing patents, makes most of its money providing other companies with its products. To ensure that it can keep churning out cheese and other dairy items, Leprino in 2011 opened a $200 million cheese plant in Colorado that has the daily capacity to process 7 million pounds of milk and produce more than 700,000 pounds of cheese.

        <p>
   Leprino is also expanding overseas. It operates a business center in Singapore that features an Innovation Studio where chefs work to develop cheese and other dairy products for the Asia-Pacific market. The center cater to US and European restaurants that set up shop in the region.

        <p>
   To keep its business lean, Leprino in late 2013 shuttered its Raveena, Nebraska, facility. To keep it on the right side of public opinion, Leprino has launched a new program requiring its dairy suppliers to commit to ongoing animal education and comply with humane animal care practices. That followed the 2014 termination of a contract with a New Mexico dairy where workers were caught on tape abusing cows.
