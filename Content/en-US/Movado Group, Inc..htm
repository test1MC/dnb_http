   Movado Group knows that time is of the essence. Its watch brands -- including namesake Movado, Concord, and Ebel, as well as the licensed

   lines -- are sold worldwide. While its watches range in price from about $75 to $10,000 for luxury designs, the watch maker is focused on the middle market. Movado sells its watches to major jewelry store and department store chains (including
   <company id="14261">
    Nordstrom
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   ), as well as to independent jewelers (such as
   <company id="16301">
    Zale Corp.
   </company>
   ). The company operates a growing chain of more than 35 outlet stores across the US. The family of the late Gerry Grinberg, who founded Movado, controls about 70% of the company's voting power.

  <p>
   Movado operates its business through two reportable segments. Wholesale, which focuses on watch design through distribution, generates some 90% of the company's sales. Movado's retail segment, accounting for 10% of sales, comprises its outlet stores. The jewelry company divides its attention equally between the US and international segments, which each bring in 50%. Based on the customer's location, Movado conducts its business globally in Europe, Asia, Canada, the Middle East, South America, and the Caribbean. Switzerland is the company's primary hub for its international activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Movado makes its Movado, Concord, and Ebel watches primarily in Switzerland; Swiss suppliers provide the Coach lines. Substantially all of Movado's international assets are located in Switzerland and Asia.

  <p>
   New Jersey-based Movado Group rings up more than half of its sales in the US. Beyond the US, Movado's timepieces are sold throughout North and South America, Europe, Asia, and the Far East.

  <p>
   Movado achieved unprecedented growth in 2016, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $595 million. Profits, however, declined by 13% to $45 million in 2016 mainly due to a slight surge in interest expenses. In addition, operating cash flow jumped from $60 million in 2015 to $75 million in 2016 due to almost $4 million gained from operation efficiency initiatives and $6 million set aside for payroll and benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue total for 2016 was fueled by a 4% bump in luxury brands sales. This was due to higher sales from its Movado brand, partially offset by lower sales primarily from the ESQ Movado and Ebel brands. The Movado sales spike was primarily due to strong sell-through from its Movado brand distribution channels, which included higher net sales of the Movado BOLD and the introduction of new products during 2016.

  <p>
   Over the years, the company has revised its marketing strategy to focus more on accessible luxury, and moderate and fashion brands. Movado's repositioning of Coach brand watches from the fine watch department to the fashion watch category is an example of this strategy. The move is luring a broader audience to watches with price points between $75 and $2,500. This price segment is generating revenue and allowing Movado to gain market share. Fueling sales further are new product launches, such as the company's $495 Museum Classic strap and $695 Museum Classic bracelet.
