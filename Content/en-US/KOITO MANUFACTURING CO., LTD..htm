   Though it is a big company, the product output at KOITO MANUFACTURING is light. The company makes lighting equipment for automotive, aircraft, railroad, and marine applications. Products include halogen bulbs, headlights, miniature bulbs, police and emergency flashers, reflectors, and signaling lamps (rear combination lamps, clearance lamps, front turn signal lamps). The company's gas discharge headlights provide dynamic auto leveling, which, during acceleration, reduces glare for oncoming vehicles. KOITO operates about 25 production facilities in 10 countries. Founded in 1936, KOITO MANUFACTURING traces its beginnings to a railroad signal lamp company founded in 1915.

   KOITO gets more than 70% of sales from Asia; it has operations in China, Taiwan, Thailand, and India, in addition to its home base of Japan (nearly 50% of net sales). Other subsidiaries are located in the Czech Republic, Belgium, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   KOITO's net sales increased 26% from 2013 to 2014 due to increased sales from China, Europe, Japan, and North America. North America and China sales spiked due to an increase in automobile production by Japanese makers affiliated with the recovery in automobile demand in addition to increased orders from local automobile manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales in Europe increased in 2014 due to a slight pick-up in intra-regional automobile sales and the winning of more orders, despite a continuing slump in the economies of Europe. Japan sales climbed due to higher automobile production fueled by a surge in demand ahead of a consumption tax increase.

  <p>
   KOITO achieves growth through the opening and expansion of plants. Throughout 2014, it expanded plants in Alabama and Illinois and established new plants in Mexico and China.
