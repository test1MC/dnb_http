   Spin the bottle? Treasury Wine Estates Americas is game. The company produces and sells wine, including regional California bottles Beringer, Chateau St. Jean, and Stags' Leap, and markets such premium labels as Rosemount, Penfolds, and Wolf Blass -- all told, some 55 brands -- in the Americas. Founded in 1870, the company was known as Beringer Blass Wine Estates, but renamed in 2001, after Australian beer maker

   (TWE), in 2011. Part of TWE, Treasury Wine Estates Americas sells some 30 million cases of wine a year, generating 40% of its parent's sales.

   Treasury Wine Estates Americas is based in Napa Valley, California with 25 vineyards, seven wineries, 3,239 planted hectares, and four regional sales offices. It also has an office in Toronto, Canada.

   Shipments declined nearly 2% in fiscal 2013 (ended June) versus the prior year, to 15.4 million cases. Revenue was down half a percent to $704 million year over year. The company blamed challenging market dynamics in the US in fiscal 2013, citing supply constraints for luxury wine due to weather in 2010 and 2011.

  <p>
   Amid declining volume and sales, the company is looking to buoy its business with a focused investment in promotional activity and price support. In addition, with the increasing sophistication of casual wine drinkers, TWE Americas is continuing to expand its luxury and premium wines labels. It has introduced the Americas to the wines of Greg Norman Estates, Cellar No 8, Santa Barbara Wine Company, Colores del Sol (from Argentina), and Sledgehammer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the winemaker intends to drive profit growth through increased investment in consumer marketing funded by an overhead and cost reduction program. TWE expects to generate $35 million in cost savings in fiscal 2015 (ends June).

  <p>
   German native Frederick Beringer worked for the Krug winery in Napa Valley for nearly 20 years before he and his brother Jacob purchased a site in St. Helena, California (located in the Napa Valley), in 1875. (The Victorian mansion they built there, which is pictured on the Beringer label, is open to the public.) The Beringer winery reached full-scale production in the 1880s, and the label's following grew steadily. It continued operations during Prohibition, producing sacramental wine. The Beringer brothers' descendants ran the winery until 1971, when Swiss food giant
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   bought it.
  </p>
  <p>
   To build its new Wine World Estates subsidiary, Nestlé developed Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay (1976), created the Napa Ridge brand and bought Geyserville's Souverain (renamed Chateau Souverain) vineyards (1986), and established Meridian Vineyards in San Luis Obispo County (1988). In 1990 Walter Klenz became CEO. Investment groups Texas Pacific and Silverado Partners bought Wine World from Nestlé in 1996 and changed its name to Beringer Wine Estates Holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   With US wine consumption growing, Beringer broadened its wine list, reaching beyond US borders. In 1996 it added imports Campanile (Italy) and Tarapaca (Chile), and the next year it co-created the Rivefort brand in France. The company also added California wineries Chateau St. Jean (Kenwood, 1996) and Stags' Leap (Napa, 1997). Beringer went public in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company began expanding facilities for Meridian Vineyards, one of its fastest-growing labels. In 1999 the company acquired its sixth California winery, the premium wine producing St. Clement vineyards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sold one of its cheaper labels, Napa Ridge, which accounted for less than 5% of its sales, to
   <company id="107217">
    Bronco Wine
   </company>
   for about $40 million. Beringer was purchased by Foster's Brewing later that year for about $1.2 billion. That same year, the company agreed to buy Castello di Gabbiano, a 900-year-old Tuscan wine estate, which includes a castle built around 1100 and the surrounding land, a modern winery, and guest cottages, for an undisclosed sum; the company has imported Gabbiano wines since 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Foster's Americas sold its Geyserville Winery to The Coppola Companies in 2005.
