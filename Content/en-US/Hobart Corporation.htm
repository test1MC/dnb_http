   Hobart's Advansys line of low-water, energy-efficient warewashing systems uses less than a gallon of water per rack, and cleans pots and pans, as well as dishware and utensils. The ventless design saves on energy costs, because there is no fan to operate. To promote more efficient foodservice equipment, Hobart launched its Sustainable Kitchen. Supported by the Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability, the products from this unit are designed to save water and energy, as well as reduce waste.
