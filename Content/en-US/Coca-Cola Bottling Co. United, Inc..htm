  <p>
   Already the third-largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in nation, the company has plans to expand in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee under its 21st Century Beverage Partnership model with The Coca-Cola Company. Under the new model, The Coca-Cola Company and its five US bottlers, including Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United, are expanding and and entering new territories. To that end, in 2014 the company added the Oxford-Anniston market to its coverage through its takeover of Oxford Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Ultimately, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United will cover all of central Alabama and most of eastern and southern Alabama, as well as Pensacola and Valparaiso, Florida, and West Point, Georgia.

   To supply its expanded overage area, the company has spent millions on expanding its distribution and sales facilities.
