   Cytori Therapeutics focuses on the development of regenerative and oncology treatments using its cell therapy and nanoparticle platforms. Its Cytori Cell Therapy treatment has shown evidence of improving blood flow and modulating the body's immune system as well as promoting wound care. The company is investigating its effectiveness in the treatment of a number of diseases, particularly those that have unmet medical needs. Its newest arm, Cytori Nanomedicine, was established in early 2017 when the firm acquired assets of Azaya Therapeutics including a proprietary liposomal nanoparticle that expanded its existing pipeline.

   in mid-2013. In order to focus on core products, and bring in a little cash, Cytori sold its PureGraft Technologies fat grafting product line to Bimini Technologies, a company formed by the creator of PureGraft that is focused on the aesthetics market. The sale, which took place in 2013, netted Cytori $15 million.

   In 2013 Cytori's revenue dropped 16% from $14.5 million to $12.2 million as product revenue fell after it sold its PureGraft body contouring system and dissolved its joint venture with Olympus. Though the company has yet to show a profit, net losses have slowed a bit, decreasing 19% in 2013, to $26 million from $32 million in 2012 as a result of falling costs of product revenue. Cash used in operations, however, continued to grow and reached $34.5 million in 2013, a $2.4 million increase over the previous year. The company chalked it up to increased spending on R&amp;D.

   Strategically, Cytori is focused on expanding global regulatory approvals, advancing its cardiovascular pipeline, and engaging in strategic development and commercialization partnerships that will build its business and strengthen it financially. It is also working to attain profitability in its commercial business and build market access for using its Celution system for more purposes. Initiatives include publishing clinical and health economics data and indication-specific therapeutic claims along with physician education.
