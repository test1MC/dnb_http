   Epizyme is taking on the epic task of writing the epitaph for genetically derived cancer. A clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Epizyme targets cancer-causing genes by designing the therapeutics to inhibit them. It uses a highly personalized approach to choose the cancers the company contends with and the patients it selects. Epizyme has made the most progress with treatments for a leukemia and for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also working with an affiliate of
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   on the development of three other enzyme inhibitors. Founded in 2007, the company went public in 2013.

        <p>
   Epizyme plans to use the proceeds of its $77 million IPO to fund the expenses of the Phase 1 development of its leukemia treatment, possibly to partially pay for the costs related to its lymphoma treatment, to finance research and further developments of other drug candidates, and for general corporate purposes.

        <p>
   From the start Epizyme has operated in the red. Its revenues consist entirely of collaboration funding and license agreements. In 2011 the company's net loss was $21 million but was less than $1 million in 2012. However, its cumulative loss since inception is in excess of $52 million. Epizyme has in the same period raised nearly $200 million from the private placement of stock along with collaboration funding with such companies as Glaxo,

    Celgene
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="56282">
    Eisai
   </company>
   .

        <p>
   With funding from its IPO, Epizyme hopes to move quickly with the clinical development of its two leading therapeutic candidates, followed by expedited regulatory approval. If this is successful, the company plans to work with its collaborative partners to build out its product platform, particularly a portfolio of 20 inhibitors. Ultimately, it plans to develop diagnostics to identify patients that can best be treated with its therapies. Epizyme also wants to build on its commercialization rights to build product awareness in the US.
