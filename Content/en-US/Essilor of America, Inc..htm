   Acquisitions are a key driver of Essilor of America's footprint and portfolio. Following the acquisition of FGX International, Essilor became the North American market leader in non-prescription reading glasses. The firm previously acquired California-based Signet Armorlite, the holder of the worldwide license for the development, production, and distribution of

   -brand lenses. Other deals added California-based CSC Laboratories and Virginia-based Professional Ophthalmic Laboratories. In Canada, the company acquired Fundi Vision Optical Laboratory.

  <p>
   In addition to acquisitions and new partnerships, the North American optical lens maker's growth strategy focuses on breakthrough products. In spring 2013 Essilor launched Crizal Prevencia no-glare clear lenses, offering selective protection from harmful blue light and UV rays. Other innovations include the first high-performance anti-fog lens under the Optifog brand.
