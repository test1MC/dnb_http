   Swisher is still sweet on cigars. Swisher International -- not to be confused with the restroom hygiene services provider of the same name -- produces mass-market large cigars, such as Swisher Sweets, King Edward, and Optimo; premium cigars such as Dominican Hallmark and Casino Gold; and little cigars (cigarillos), which also use the Swisher Sweets and King Edward brand names. The company also makes smokeless tobacco products. Its moist and dry snuff offerings include the Silver Creek, Redwood, and Kayak brands; loose-leaf chewing tobacco sells under the Mail Pouch, Lancaster, and Chattanooga Chew names. An investment firm once controlled by the late William Ziegler III took Swisher private in 1999.

        <p>
   Connecticut-based Swisher makes its cigars in Jacksonville, Florida, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Nicaragua. It makes smokeless tobacco products in Wheeling, West Virginia. The US represents about 95% of Swisher's sales. America's largest cigar exporter, Swisher International ships more than a billion cigars annually to more than 60 countries.

   About 65% of Swisher's sales are made in convenience stores. The company sells its products in more than 3,000 retail outlets across the US.

        <p>
   Swisher opportunistically grows its product line through acquisition and invention. With the economy and Wall Street roaring back, Swisher in 2013 entered the premium cigar market with the launch of its new Royal Gold Cigars division. The high-end cigars, with retail prices approaching $10 a piece, are handmade in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.
  </p>
        <p>
   Still, Swisher's primary target has remains the lower-priced mass-market, which held relatively steady throughout the global financial crisis. The tobacco company also chases after a younger market by making a more pleasant peach-tip and grape-tip Swisher cigar. Due to its marketing strategy, Swisher has been under the watchful eye of the FDA, which in 2009 banned sales of flavored cigarettes other than menthol and could be looking to extend the reach of its ban to products labeled as cigars.

        <p>
   Newark, Ohio, merchant David Swisher, who sold goods from wagons throughout the Midwest, received a small cigar business in 1861 as payment of a debt. In 1888 two of Swisher's sons, John and Harry, bought the company and formed Swisher Brothers. John and his son Carl bought out Harry in 1913 and renamed the company Jno. H. Swisher &amp; Son. The company was the first to use rolling machines (1924), enabling it to cut the price of King Edwards to two-for-a-nickel during the Great Depression.
  </p>
        <p>
   Swisher introduced Swisher Sweets in 1958. Eight years later American Maize-Products Company (AMPCo) acquired the company. Though the cigar market shrank over the next 20 years, Swisher persevered.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1985 Swisher entered the little cigar market and acquired Corral Wodiska y Ca., maker of premium Bering cigars. In 1986 it picked up Universal Cigar, maker of Optimo, La Primadora, Santa Fe, and El Trelles brands. That year Swisher entered the smokeless market by acquiring Helme Tobacco.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amid the growing popularity of cigars in the 1990s, Eridania Beghin-Say acquired AMPCo in 1995. Eridania Beghin-Say sold Swisher to Hay Island Holding Co. (owned by William Ziegler III). Swisher International Group went public in 1996 at the height of the cigar craze. In 1998 slow sales, a cigar glut, and uncertainty over possible stricter governmental regulations began to burn away earnings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Ziegler's investment firm took Swisher private in June 1999 in a $55 million deal. He paid $9.50 a share, nearly half the price at which Swisher went public. When Zeigler III died in 2008, his son took over the business.
