   Linear Technology's high performance linear integrated circuits (ICs) create a connection from the analog world to the digital one. Its chips convert temperature, pressure, sound, speed, and other information into a digital form that can be read by digital devices. Linear Technology also makes linear devices that control power and regulate voltage in electronic systems. The company's products are used in a myriad of equipment from PCs to radar systems, satellites, and industrial instrumentation. It caters largely to communications and industrial markets, as well as to the computer, consumer goods, aerospace, and automotive markets. Linear was acquired by

    Analog Devices
   </company>
   for about $15 billion in 2017.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Analog Devices Inc. (ADI), a leading maker of analog ICs, bought Linear for its complementary portfolio of products, executives said. The combined company would have an addressable market of $14 billion, compared to ADI's previous $8 billion. ADI posted profit of about $697 million on $3.4 billion in revenue in 2015 (ended October). The deal closed in 2017.
Linear's stock was delisted in March 2017.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US is Linear Technology's largest single market, representing nearly 30% of sales. Asian customers account for more than half of sales, with Japanese customers specifically generating 15%. European customers contribute the remaining 20%.
  </p>
        <p>
   Internationally, the company has sales offices in: Dortmund, Helsinki, London, Milan, Munich, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oulu, Stuttgart, Sydney, Melbourne, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Xian, Wuhan, Singapore, Taipei, Tel Aviv, Bangalore, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver.

   Linear Technology markets its products through its own domestic and international sales teams, as well as through third-party sales representatives in South America and India and electronics distributors. It has about 20 sales offices in major metropolitan areas in the US and another 30 in Europe, Asia, and the Asia-Pacific region. The company's primary domestic distributor,
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   , accounted for more than 30% of sales in fiscal 2015 (ended June).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company has been ramping up its advertising spend in recent years. It spent $5.9 million on advertising in FY2015, up from $5.5 million and $5.4 million in FY2014 and FY2013, respectively.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Linear Technology's revenues and profits have risen over the past few years as it has focused selling its higher-margin electronic products to the Automotive, Industrial, Communication infrastructure, and Military sectors and away from lower-margin, consumer-focused electronics.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's revenue rose by 6% to $1.48 billion in fiscal 2015 (ended June) mostly driven by sales growth from its Industrial and Automotive end-market customers, though sales in all of its sector markets grew during the year. Linear's overall shipping volumes grew by 4% while sales prices increased by 3%. Its higher-margin markets sales comprised 88% of its bookings (about the same as in FY2014), which helped keep its sales strong.
  </p>
        <p>
   Higher revenue in FY2015 drove Linear Technology's net income higher by 13% to $521 million for the year, even as the company continued to ramp up its R&amp;D spending with new hiring, salary increases, and increases in related fringe benefits costs. Linear's operating cash levels inched up to $599 million as the company generated higher cash earnings during the year.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The breadth of Linear Technology's product lineup and customer base keeps the company from being too dependent on any one customer, or any particular type of end use. The company has worked to avoid competition from Asian rivals -- which tend to focus on high-volume, low-margin chips -- by offering semiconductor design and verification software lines, as well as IC manufacturing software products, to the high-end of the global electronics market.
  </p>
        <p>
   During fiscal 2015, the company continued to limit its exposure to the Consumer and cell-phone end markets in favor of the Automotive, Industrial, Communication infrastructure, and Military end markets; its preferred markets made up 88% of its annual bookings.
  </p>
        <p>
   Part of Linear's ability to compete depends on continued investment in research and development on new technology to add to its growing line of high-performance products designed to serve customers and their unique applications. Accordingly during fiscal 2015 (ended June), the company ramped up its R&amp;D staff to 1,289 employees, up from 1,244 employees in FY2014. It also increased its overall R&amp;D spend to $266.8 million in FY2015, up from $250.4 million and $235.2 million in FY2014 and FY2013, respectively.

   In 1981 Robert Swanson (chairman) persuaded five of his fellow employees at
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   to join him in a new venture. (It soon had to defend itself in a series of lawsuits filed by National Semiconductor over trade secrets and patent infringement.) Linear Technology benefited from an analog integrated circuit (IC) shortage in the mid-1980s and used profits to develop proprietary products for laptop computers and data processing equipment. The company went public in 1986.
  </p>
        <p>
   Linear Technology spent much of the 1990s expanding its design and production facilities, adding factories or design centers in Singapore (1994), Malaysia (1995), and Colorado and Washington (1997).
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite a slump that bedeviled the chip industry, Linear Technology enjoyed record sales in fiscal 1998, during which it introduced 100 new products. Because of this rapid growth, the company reorganized in 1999 and again expanded its facilities. Company veteran Clive Davies became president, and Swanson remained CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   Davies retired in 2003, and another company veteran, David Bell, succeeded him as president. Company COO Lothar Maier succeeded Swanson as CEO early in 2005 (Swanson remained executive chairman).
  </p>
        <p>
   Linear Technology opened its first European design center in early 2006, launching a facility in Munich, Germany.
  </p>
        <p>
   Like many other Silicon Valley companies that generously gave out stock options to employees, executives, and directors, Linear Technology reviewed its past stock-option granting practices. The
   <company id="150643">
    Internal Revenue Service
   </company>
   , the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   all initiated informal inquiries into the company's history of granting stock options. Linear Technology denied that it used backdating, a shady if generally legal practice in timing the issuing and sales of stock options, in granting its options, and concluded its review without finding any apparent fraud or misconduct, nor any need to restate its financial results from 1995 through 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2007 the SEC informed the company that it had concluded its investigation into Linear Technology's stock-option grants and didn't take any enforcement action.
