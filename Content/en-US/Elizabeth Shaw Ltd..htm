  <p>
   In 1937, a woman with the first name of Elizabeth put her delicious Mint Crisp chocolates on sale in her brother-in-law's shop. The venture was a great success, so she combined her name with part of her husband's old employer's (confectionery maker Page &amp; Shaw) to create the Elizabeth Shaw brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1968, the company was sold to a Bristol factory steeped in chocolate history and innovation, that was formed by former Fry &amp; Son's employee Edward Packer in 1881.
