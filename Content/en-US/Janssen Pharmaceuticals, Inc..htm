   Janssen Pharmaceuticals offers a wide range of therapeutics, including products for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), general medicine (acid reflux disease, infectious diseases), mental health (bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia), neurologics (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, migraine prevention and treatment), pain management, and women's health. A US-based arm of

   global pharmaceuticals segment, the company's offerings include Risperdal for schizophrenia, anti-infective Levaquin, ADHD drug Concerta, pain medicine Nucynta, and contraceptive Ortho Evra.

  <p>
   In addition to schizophrenia, key product Risperdal is used to treat bipolar mania and irritability associated with autism. A long-acting injectable version of the drug, called Risperdal Consta, is approved as a treatment for schizophrenia. Janssen's antipsychotic franchise also includes Invega and Invega Sustenna, two schizophrenia drugs developed using controlled oral delivery and extended-release injectable technologies. The mental health and neurology product lines have historically been major earners for

   </company>
   , but like many others before it, the segment's sales have been hit hard by patent protection losses and the rise of generic competition in the pharmaceuticals industry.

   To keep its pipeline fresh and robust, Janssen Pharmaceuticals works closely with the Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC, (a drug discovery company of
   <company id="104343">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   ) to develop new drugs in all stages of development, designed to treat a range of diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the FDA granted Priority Review for the New Drug Application (NDA) for three-month atypical antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate designed to treat schizophrenia in adults --  which would be the first of its anti-psychotic kind to have a quarterly dosing schedule, if approved. In 2014 the company received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval of Invokamet, a fixed-dose therapy combining canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride in a single tablet, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also likes to partner with others to hasten its development research. In 2014, Janssen Pharmaceuticals entered into an exclusive license agreement with
   <company id="15321">
    Vertex Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for the worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of VX-787, a novel medicine in Phase II development for the treatment of influenza A. Also that year, the company's affiliate, CNA Development, LLC, partnered with Sevion Therapeutics to research antibodies against multiple targets in several therapeutic areas, using Sevion's library platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Janssen Pharmaceuticals sold the US rights to its Nucynta pain medicine franchise to
   <company id="53505">
    Depomed
   </company>
   for $1.05 billion. The deal included two products -- an immediate-release and an extended-release version of tapentadol tablets. Janssen retained license rights for Nucynta in international markets.

   Strengthening its cardiovascular disease portfolio, in 2015 Janssen Pharmaceuticals acquired X01 Limited, a Cambridge-based startup virtual biopharmaceutical firm which develops ichorcumab, a synthetic anti-thrombin antibody. The anticoagulant is being touted as having the potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes without causing bleeding.

   In response to competitive market challenges, as well as financial setbacks related to multiple product recall announcements, J&amp;J moved to consolidate some of its pharmaceutical businesses in 2011 to save on administrative, manufacturing, and marketing costs. The firm combined its Janssen (mental health), Ortho-McNeil (contraceptives), Ortho Women's Health and Urology, McNeil Pediatrics, Ortho-McNeil Neurologics (central nervous system drugs), and PriCara divisions into the new Janssen Pharmaceuticals entity. Many of these units had previously been held by a J&amp;J subsidiary named Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the 2011 restructuring, Janssen Pharmaceuticals became part of a broader division known as the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, which also includes
   <company id="12923">
    Janssen Biotech
   </company>
   (formerly Centocor Ortho Biotech, immunology and oncology) and Janssen Therapeutics (HIV therapies).
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after the reorganization efforts were announced, Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced an agreement to sell its Ortho Dermatologics Division to
   <company id="43602">
    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for some $345 million. Ortho Dermatologics markets prescription skin care products including Retin-A Micro, Ertaczo, and Renova.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Janssen name originates back to 1953, when Belgian researcher Paul Janssen founded a global drug company called Janssen Pharmaceutica. That entity became part of Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1961, and the name has since been used on a number of J&amp;J's global pharmaceutical divisions.
