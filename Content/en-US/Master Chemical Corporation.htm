   Master Chemical hopes to be master of the metalworking-chemical universe. The company produces a variety of chemicals used by the metalworking community. Its products include cutting, grinding, and milling fluids; cutting oils; and cleaning compounds, corrosion inhibitors, and rust preventatives. Master Chemical distributes most of its chemical products under the TRIM brand name. The company, a pioneer in the practice of coolant recycling, also makes coolant management and recycling equipment under the XYBEX brand. Master Chemical distributes its products from branch locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The company was formed in 1951 by Clyde Sluhan.

   The company manufactures products for every phase of the metalworking business -- including a full line of coolants, cleaners, and fluid recycling equipment. Its Master STAGES products consist of Master Chemical's surface treatments, cleaners, and corrosion inhibitors. The TRIM line of brands include its metalworking fluids for cutting and grinding, including applications for synthetics, semisynthetics, and soluble oils. Its XYBEX recycling equipment includes filtration products, fluid mixers, fluid recycling systems, and centrifuges to remove tramp oil (hydraulic oil from a machine tool that has contaminated the cutting fluid).

  <p>
   The company's products serve several industries, including the aerospace, automotive, bearings, diecast, and medical markets. Aerospace manufacturers use the company's cutting, grinding, and cleaning fluids for needs such as alloy cutting and grinding. The automotive industry uses its products to improve manufacturing processes and extend tool life. Bearings manufacturers use Master Chemical's TRIM fluids to improve filtration, reduce residue, and reduce exposure to harmful substances in metalworking fluids. And customers who machine diecast aluminum, magnesium, and zinc use the company's fluids for cleaning and cutting and grinding needs. Medical industry manufacturers (such as makers of artificial hip and knee joints) use the company's line of TRIM products for turning and milling titanium and ceramic components.

   In 2015 Master Chemicaannounced TRIM, MicroSol 590XT, an advanced technology semisynthetic microemulsion coolant. It is designed around the needs of aerospace customers and has the latest chemistries to pass the most stringent aerospace specifications. It improves on sump life, tooling life, and corrosion protection from previous generation coolants.

  <p>
   In the same year, the company also launched a high performance emulsion. TRIM E925 delivers unsurpassed lubricity and flies through production of otherwise difficult machining operations even in the most demanding materials and operations used in aerospace manufacturing.
