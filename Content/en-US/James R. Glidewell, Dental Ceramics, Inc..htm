Its BDL Prosthetics division makes aesthetic temporary teeth (known as BioTemps) used for provisional restoration until final ceramic restorations are ready. It employs a mail-order business model by which dentists send in dental impressions and receive custom restorative products via the

   Glidewell Laboratories focuses on expanding and strengthening its business operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes significant investments in R&amp;D and supports a team of dentists, engineers, scientists, and certified dental technicians to advance its technologies and develop new product offerings. As an example, the Glidewell Laboratories' CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/manufacturing) services allow for the creation of predictable reconstructive products based off of digital impressions electronically sent by dentists to the lab. The company also offers CAD/CAM systems that allow dentists to design and mill ceramic restorations in their own labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Glidewell Laboratories provides technology demonstrations, training, and education at the Glidewell International Technology Center in Irvine, California. Its Glidewell Dental Lab is known for expanding the availability of clinical knowledge and dental education. The lab also provides free patient education materials to dentists to help promote the growth of their practices by encouraging patients to seek professional dental services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other offerings include online continuing education programs for dentists, as well as a variety of print and video education and promotional materials used in dental offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Glidewell Laboratories signed a license agreement with BIOMET 3i, a global frontrunner in the design and manufacture of dental implants and related restorative components. This agreement allows clinicians working with the popular Encode Impression System to prescribe cases directly to Glidewell Laboratories and receive a custom abutment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 it teamed up with
   <company id="176993">

   of Japan to bring BruxZir Solid Zirconia directly to the Japanese dental market. Shofu has exclusive rights to distribute the groundbreaking restorative dental material to Japan's dental laboratories and dentists.
  </p>
  <p>
   Launching a new product, that year Glidewell Laboratories introduced Obsidian lithium silicate ceramic, a new glass ceramic material indicated for the fabrication of monolithic restorations, including individual crowns, 3-unit anterior bridges, veneers, inlays, and onlays.
