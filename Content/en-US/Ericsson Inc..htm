   North America is the leading global market in terms of smartphone penetration and mobile data use. The proliferation of mobile devices there, as well as the growth of machine-to-machine communication used for such applications as industrial supply chain management and utility meters, have contributed to demand from telecommunications network operators and other companies for Ericsson's products. The company's CDMA-based wireless gear, in particular, has boosted its market share in the region.
