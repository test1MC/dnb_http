   Tobii DynaVox gives its customers a voice -- literally. The company provides touch and eye tracking based communication and environment control devices for persons with speech, learning, and physical disabilities. Its products, which include speech generation and educational software, are used by individuals diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), autism, cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and similar conditions. Tobii DynaVox hosts a suite of more than a dozen products as well as additional partner products. The company generates most of its sales from the US, but it is active in some 60 countries. It is a subsidiary of larger eye-tracking technology firm Tobii AG, based in Sweden.

        <p>
   The US accounts for nearly 90% of DynaVox's sales. International markets include Canada, the UK, Germany, and Australia. Sales in the US fell more than 10% in 2012 while international sales were flat.

        <p>
   The company sells its devices directly in the US, Canada, and the UK, while third-party distributors are used for other countries. Its special education software is sold through direct sales, direct mail, and the Internet. DynaVox markets primarily to speech language pathologists.

        <p>
   DynaVox reported a 10% drop in revenue in fiscal 2012 (ended June) to $97 million. The decline is due to weaker demand in both devices and software, which began in 2011 (revenue that year was down 5%), as a result of tightening of US government funding at all levels. The company also saw similar government spending patterns in key international markets.

        <p>
   DynaVox lost money in 2012 (about $18 million), primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of about $60 million.
