   In mid-2012 it obtained Meyn Holding, the parent company of Meyn Food Processing Technology. The acquisition of Meyn fortified CTB's core poultry meat processing equipment operations and gave it access to offices in Poland and the Netherlands. Months earlier, CTB made a move to expand its growing PigTek business by purchasing a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. It also purchased Martin Industries, a maker of grain handling systems, in 2012.
