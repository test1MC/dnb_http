   Nordion is on a mission to help medical professionals diagnose and treat disease. The life sciences company makes medical isotopes for applications in molecular imaging, cancer treatment radiology, and product sterilization. It markets its medical isotopes under the Nordion and TheraSphere brands through a global sales force. The company's approximately 500 customers include drugmakers, medical device firms, hospitals, and research institutions in more than 40 countries. Nordion is owned by outsourced contract sterilization firm Sterigenics International.

  <p>
   The US market accounts for nearly two-thirds of Nordion's sales. Europe accounts for about 10%, while Canada and other countries make up the rest. Outside Canada, Nordion has offices in Belgium, Hong Kong, and Japan.

  <p>
   In 2012 Nordion realigned its business under two units: Specialty Isotopes, with segments for sterilization technologies and medical isotopes, and Targeted Therapies, for building an interventional oncology business. The changes in operations were made to improve customer service by taking the distinct product life cycles in each area into account.

  <p>
   Nordion's sales increased 14% in fiscal 2011 (ends October) vs. the prior year, and the company was profitable for the first time in four years. All three of the company's business segments posted gains: Medical Isotopes (80%), Sterilization Technologies (5%), Targeted Therapies (more than 1%). The large increase in isotope sales resulted primarily from the return to service of a nuclear reactor in Ontario -- the supplier of most of Nordion's radioactive materials used to make medical isotopes -- which was down between May 2009 and August 2010. With its supply problems behind it, Nordion posted double-digit sales gain in both the US (its largest market) and Europe in fiscal 2011.

  <p>
   Nordion divested the bulk of its operations (including its contract research and scientific instrument units) in 2009 and 2010, and has since been streamlining its remaining operations around its medical isotopes business. (The company's restructuring measures were brought on by shareholder pressure and unstable financial and market conditions in 2009.)

   Nordion has also consolidated its administrative functions to a smaller headquarters location in Canada. As part of its consolidation efforts, Nordion sold its Belgian facility to
   <company id="105976">
    Best Medical Belgium
   </company>
   . The sale included three of Nordion's four Belgian lines of business, which include nondestructive testing equipment, production of an imaging agent, and radiochemical business. Nordion kept its liver cancer treatment business, TheraSphere.

  <p>
   Nordion's primary supplier of medical isotopes is
   <company id="100285">
    Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd
   </company>
   . To decrease its vulnerability to supply problems, the firm is working to procure other stable sources of medical isotopes. To that end, it formed a supply agreement with a company in Russia to supply Molybdenum-99 until 2020.
