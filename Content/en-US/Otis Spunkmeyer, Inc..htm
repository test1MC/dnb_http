   Otis Spunkmeyer's growth strategy includes expanding and securing sales in the lucrative foodservice sector, extending its reach in the chain restaurant business, increasing its presence in the retail sector and international markets, and developing new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent company ARYZTA has been making aggressive acquisitions to expand its holdings in the Americas. To this end, Otis Spunkmeyer's business has blossomed. ARYZTA added Fresh Start Bakeries (FSB), a specialty bakery products provider, for $900 million and

   (pizza and appetizers) for more than $1 billion. Expanding the Otis Spunkmeyer operation, ARYZTA in late 2010 rolled FSB's Pennant Foods and Sweet Life units into Otis Spunkmeyer to consolidate these complementary businesses. The two FSB operations produce frozen bread dough and specialty bakery products sold to restaurant chains, retail, and foodservice.

   While its parent company does not break out separate financials for Otis Spunkmeyer, ARYZTA's North America segment revenue grew some 6% in fiscal 2013 to â‚¬1.5 billion as compared to 2012. Favorable currency movements and growth in its North American businesses were primary reasons for the gains. The North America segment contributed 32% of total revenue in 2013.
