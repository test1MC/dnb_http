  <p>
   Trifast has achieved steady growth of the years, with revenues climbing 7% from 2013 to 2014. The recent growth was fueled by increased sales in UK, Europe, and the US, partially offset by decreased sales from Asia. The UK continues to benefit from a resurgence from the automotive sector as well as an overall favorable general macro-economic outlook. Sales from Holland and Sweden also benefited from the growth in automotive, whereas Hungary grew by 18% on the back of the company's electronic sales in 2014.

  <p>
   The company has achieved revenue growth through the use of acquisitions. In 2014 it obtained Viterie Italia Centrale Srl (VIC). Founded in 1964, VIC is a European market leader within the white goods industry and a specialist in the design and application of washing machine transit fastener assemblies. The deal gave Trifast a significant presence within the dominant Italian fastener manufacturing industry within Europe.
