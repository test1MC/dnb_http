   The company's 2008 deal for Siegel-Robert Automotive added a production lineup of injection-molded plastic and chrome-plated decorative parts principally sold to automotive manufacturers. (The Siegel-Robert buy included a manufacturing plant and sales office in China, as well as another sales outlet in Japan.) A year earlier, Guardian Automotive pocketed Viracon/Curvlite, a manufacturer of glass-clad laminates for exterior glazing of buildings, from
   <company id="12643">
    Apogee Enterprises
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Although chrom-plating on automobiles has had its ups and downs, many trucks have kept their chromium accents and consequently kept Guardian busy. However a hit to its workforce and bottom line has been unavoidable with a bad dip in the auto industry. Plating appliance parts, such as Hamilton Beach blender bases and microwave oven doors has helped to reduce its financial exposure.

   Guardian Automotive supplies the global automotive industry through its facilities in Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.
