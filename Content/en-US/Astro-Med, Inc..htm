   The sky's the limit for AstroNova. The company makes data recorders and ruggedized printers used on commercial airplanes. Its Test &amp; Measurement (T&amp;M) division (29% of sales) makes products that record and monitor data for customers in the aerospace, automotive, metal mill, power, and telecommunications industries. Its QuickLabel Systems (71% of sales) makes digital color label printers, bar code printers, automatic labelers, and printer consumables. Following the divestment of its former medical devices unit, Grass Technologies, in 2013, the company in 2015 changed its name to AstroNova from Astro-Med.

  <p>
   Year-over-year sales rose about 7% to $86 million in 2016 (year-end January). By segment, QuickLabel surged 12% while T&amp;M sales decreased 4%. QuickLabel did well behind strong demand for printers, especially the new Kiaro! product line, and label and tag products. T&amp;M slipped on reduced demand for aerospace printers as those customers deferred purchases.
  </p>
  <p>
   AstroNova's profit fell 3% to $4.5 million in 2016 from 2015 on higher costs, which were mainly related to stock-based compensation. The company also has expenses related to its name change and branding initiatives.

   AstroNova shareholders approved the new name in May 2016 as a signal that the company is committed to its data visualization products. It intends to develop new products internally and acquire others through strategic purchases. The company introduced the DDX100 Smartcorder, a high-speed portable data acquisition system.
