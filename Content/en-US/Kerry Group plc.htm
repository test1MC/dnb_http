   It's only natural for the Kerry Group, one of the largest food companies in Europe, to keep adding to its mix. Offering some 15,000 products, Kerry's primary business is ingredients. These include breadings, seasonings, flavorings, fruit preparations, and dairy-based ingredients, all of which it sells to food processors and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The company is also a food processor itself, and offers processed meats (Mattessons, Richmond, Wall's), frozen entrees (Ballyfree, Denny), flour (Homepride), dairy products and juices (Dawn), and bottled water (Kelly Spring). Kerry Group has operations in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, and customers in more than 140 countries.

  <p>
   North Kerry Milk Products (NKMP) was formed in 1972 by eight small dairy co-ops, the Dairy Disposal Company (Ireland's state-owned dairy processing company), and Erie Casein Company (a unit of Illinois-based Erie Foods International) to establish a casein plant in Listowel, a city in the Irish county of Kerry. Designed to help western Ireland's chronically depressed farm economy, the project provided dairymen with a new market for their milk, Erie Foods with casein (used in processed foods, plastics, and glue), and local workers with jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing greater competition after Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973, NKMP acquired the Dairy Disposal Company -- which owned 42% of NKMP -- as well as six of the founding co-ops, and went public in 1974 as Kerry Co-operative Creameries. It grew by absorbing co-ops and independent dairies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1979 and 1980 falling milk supplies, due to bad weather and a government program to wipe out bovine diseases, convinced Kerry Co-operative that it needed to reduce its reliance on milk and move into value-added fields. It began processing beef for the Irish market and acquired Denny, a maker of processed pork products. In 1983 Kerry acquired Erie Casein's 15% interest in it, along with a US customer base. Seeking capital for growth, Kerry reorganized as a corporation, Kerry plc, which took over the assets of Kerry Co-operative. In exchange, the co-op received a large stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kerry then opened a dairy processing plant in Wisconsin (1987) and moved strongly into ingredients with the 1988 purchase of Beatreme Food Ingredients from the moribund Beatrice Corporation. Beatreme gave Kerry a global presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s the company secured its multinational position with acquisitions worldwide and added a variety of consumer brands, primarily for the UK and Irish markets. Acquisitions included the Mattessons Wall's brand in the UK (chilled meats, 1994); DCA Foods Industries and Margetts Foods (ingredients, 1994); and French-based Ciprial (fruit preparations, 1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 it bought Dalgety's food ingredients division, which greatly expanded its ingredients business in Europe. The next year the company bought confectionery ingredients specialist Shade Foods (in the US) and Specialty Food Ingredients (Europe) for $80 million. In 2000 Kerry sold the North American bakery mix operations acquired in its 1994 purchase of DCA Foods to
   <company id="44318">
    Pillsbury
   </company>
   . Kerry also bought Armour Food Ingredients from
   <company id="10388">
    ConAgra Foods
   </company>
   for $35 million that year. Kerry acquired another Irish dairy group, Golden Vale, in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Kerry bought US coffee-flavoring maker
   <company id="52917">
    Stearns &amp; Lehman
   </company>
   , and French ingredients and sauce maker Aromont. Also that year Kerry's North American sector created Nutriant, a US-based division that produces nutritional ingredients for the food industry. Furthering its presence in the US, in 2003 the company acquired five US flavor and ingredients makers:
   <company id="116628">
    Crystals International
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="58688">
    Da Vinci Gourmet
   </company>
   , Guernsey Bel, Pacific Seasonings, and SunPure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Already fairly acquisitive, in 2004, Kerry spent $940 million on ten new companies. The largest purchase was Quest Food Ingredients from
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical
   </company>
   . However it also stocked its pantry with beverage manufacturers Oregon Chai (latte mixes, concentrates), Extreme Foods (smoothies, coffee drinks), and four flavor businesses --
   <company id="130367">
    Flavurence
   </company>
   , Fructamine (Italy), Laboratorios Krauss (Mexico), and Manheimer.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the 2004 purchase of Questo Food Ingredients, Kerry initiated its Bio-Science division, which joined the company's extant divisions, Ingredients, Flavor and Consumer Food.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has expanded its ingredients business through an aggressive acquisitions program worldwide, especially in developing markets in Asia and Latin America. As part of this strategy, Kerry Group purchased China's Lanli Food Industry company and upgraded its facilities. It also tookover two North American food ingredients businesses, Custom Industries and Nuvex Ingredients in 2006 for a total of $83 million. Attending to its food products back on its home turf, Kerry purchased Noon Products that same year. Noon is a maker of prepared Indian, Thai, and Mexican foods for UK supermarkets. In 2007 the company acquired the North American baking ingredients operations of the Dutch firm,
   <company id="92646">
    CSM
   </company>
   -- Illinois-based QA Products. QA makes decorations for the baking- and snack-food industries.
