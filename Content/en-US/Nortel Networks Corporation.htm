   Nortel Networks has hung up on the telecom sector. Once one of the largest makers of telecommunications equipment in North America, it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 and is in the process of liquidating its assets. The company made core network switching, wireless, and optical systems for network operators. Its wireline and enterprise network equipment included systems for digital voice and data switching, routing, and call center communications. Wireless products included cellular base stations and controllers. The company also made such long-haul fiber-optic products as multiplexers. Nortel is currently focused on selling off its remaining businesses and intellectual property and winding down all operations.

  <p>
   Nortel Networks traces its lineage to 1880, when Bell Telephone Company of Canada was established in Montreal four years after the invention of the telephone. In 1882 the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Co. was founded to produce Bell Canada's mechanical equipment. Northern Electric pooled its resources with electrical wire maker Imperial Wire &amp; Cable to form the Northern Electric Co. in 1914.
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   's manufacturing subsidiary Western Electric owned 44% of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1930s the company created an electronics division and purchased a majority interest in Amalgamated Electric (1932). In the mid-1950s, the US Justice Department forced Western Electric to sell its interest in Northern Electric, and
   <company id="54691">
    Bell Canada
   </company>
   purchased most of the shares. In 1958 the company formed Northern Electric Laboratories to push research and development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Northern Electric began supplying switching gear overseas. In 1971 the company merged its Northern Electric Laboratories with Bell Canada's R&amp;D unit to form Bell Northern Research. (Northern Electric retained 70% ownership, while Bell Canada owned the remaining 30%.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Northern Electric remained wholly owned by Bell Canada until 1973, when that company began reducing its stake. In 1976 Northern Electric changed its name to Northern Telecom and became the first equipment company to introduce a digital switch. When AT&amp;T approved use of the switch in its equipment in 1981, Northern Telecom's growth took off.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul Stern became CEO in 1989 as the company thrived on its digital switch sales. The former
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   executive focused on cutting costs in lieu of technical advancement, and customer dissatisfaction built as the company failed to develop the software in its switching systems. Directors forced Stern out and replaced him with Jean Monty as CEO in 1992, just before Northern Telecom suffered a loss of nearly $900 million for 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Monty acted quickly, calming customers, revamping the software, and selling underused divisions and factories. In 1996 the company acquired data networking maker Micom Communications. The next year Monty was succeeded by COO John Roth, who began to lead Nortel down a path to expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Northern Telecom bought Bell Canada's 30% stake in Bell Northern Research, which had been renamed Nortel Technology Limited. Also that year the company boosted its networking expertise through such acquisitions as Bay Networks. The Bay Networks deal, worth $6.7 billion, led to a loss that year and prompted the 1999 name change to Nortel Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The change was pivotal for the company, transforming it from a staid seller of simple telephone systems to a fast-moving Internet supplier. That year Nortel acquired Shasta Networks (network management products for Internet service providers). It also continued to beef up its business offerings by acquiring systems integrator Periphonics, which it would later combine with 2000 acquisition
   <company id="47027">
    Clarify
   </company>
   to offer high-margin business software and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortel increased its purchasing pace in 2000 to boost fiber optics and software holdings. The company bought optical equipment startups Qtera, CoreTek, and Xros; it also purchased communication service activation software maker Architel Systems. Later that year Nortel acquired Web switch maker
   <company id="56121">
    Alteon WebSystems
   </company>
   and Internet access equipment maker Sonoma Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   As sales of telecom gear slowed industry-wide that year Nortel made moves to focus its unwieldy operations; it outsourced some semiconductor operations, a large part of its manufacturing, and its information technology services. Bell Canada parent BCE distributed to its shareholders most of its 40% stake in Nortel in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company announced and then postponed plans to take its fiber-optic components business public. Amid an economic downturn Nortel laid off 30,000 employees and scaled back its digital subscriber line operations. Frank Carlucci (chairman since March 2000) stepped down that year. CFO Lynton Wilson took the chair and Roth stepped down as president and CEO in late 2001. Former CFO Frank Dunn was named CEO and Roth assumed the vice chairman role. Nortel decided that year to cut an additional 20,000 employees. It also sold its Clarify customer service software business (originally purchased for $2.1 billion) to
   <company id="57359">
    Amdocs
   </company>
   for $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Nortel restructured its fiber optic business, cutting jobs and selling some of its optical components assets (advanced tunable lasers, transmitters, receivers, and amplifiers) to Bookham Technology (later renamed
   <company id="100566">
    Oclaro
   </company>
   ). The next year Nortel sold its fixed wireless network access equipment product line, known as Proximity, to
   <company id="58251">
    Airspan
   </company>
   in a continued effort to focus on core businesses. Slipping wireless sales in Europe and North America caused Nortel to look increasingly to developing areas like China for new business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company outsourced all of its manufacturing operations to Singapore-based
   <company id="46895">
    Flextronics
   </company>
   in a deal valued at more than $2 billion annually. This agreement, which built upon Nortel's existing relationship with the contract electoronics manufacturer, was intended to enable the company to focus on product design, sales, and marketing efforts and resulted in the sale of facilities and the transfer of employees to Flextronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2005 the company released its 2003 financial statements, nearly a year late, following a massive accounting investigation that uncovered billions in overstated revenues for the years 1999 and 2000. Nortel fired CEO Dunn as well as the company's CFO amid the accounting scandal; director Bill Owens assumed the top spot. Owens previously held the top spot at
   <company id="48111">
    Teledesic LLC
   </company>
   and was the president of SAIC prior to that. Late in 2005
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   and Motorola veteran Mike Zafirovski succeeded Owens.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its efforts to expand operations in developing telecom markets, Nortel acquired a stake in Indian communication software firm Sasken Communication Technologies, in a 2005 deal valued at $10 million. The company also bought IT services contractor PEC Solutions in a deal valued at $448 million in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nortel in early 2006 agreed to pay nearly $2.5 billion in cash and stock to settle class-action lawsuits that alleged securities laws violations.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Zafirovski took over, the company announced plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to Toronto and sold its Brampton, Ontario, property to
   <company id="42405">
    Rogers Communications
   </company>
   in a deal valued at nearly $86 million. Nortel completed its move into Canada's financial capital in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006, Nortel expanded its end-to-end converged enterprise networks services with the purchase of
   <company id="106350">
    Tasman Networks
   </company>
   for $99.5 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to focus on newer technologies, Nortel sold its UMTS access network assets to
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   for $320 million in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company filed for bankruptcy and began the process of liquidating its operations.
