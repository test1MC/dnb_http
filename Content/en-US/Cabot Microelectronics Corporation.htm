   Cabot Microelectronics sits atop a mountain of slurry. The company is a top maker of slurries (consumables) used in chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). CMP is a wafer polishing process that enables semiconductor manufacturers to produce smaller, faster, and more complex devices. Cabot Micro's CMP slurries consist of liquids containing abrasives and chemicals that aid in the CMP process. The company is also a leading provider of polishing pads for CMP, and it makes slurries used to polish the substrates and magnetic heads of hard-disk drives.

  <p>
   Sales of various slurries (tungsten, dielectric, copper, and data storage slurries) and polishing pads account for more than 85% of Cabot Micro's revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company's Engineered Surface Finishes (ESF) business (5% of sales) develops new polishing techniques and processes that are focused on production efficiency improvements and applications in industries outside of semiconductors. Within the ESF division, Cabot Micro's QED Technologies subsidiary makes precision polishing and metrology systems used to shape and surface optical components, including lenses, mirrors, and prisms. Its automated polishing systems use magnetic fluids to polish an array of shapes and finishes. Its metrology systems are based on Subaperture Stitching Interferometer (SSI), which measures non-spherical surfaces.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cabot Micro has five manufacturing plants in Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US (in Illinois). It has regional sales, customer service, and technical support offices in Europe, Asia, and the US. About 80% of sales come from the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cabot Micro serves customers that make or provide logic IC (integrated circuit) devices, memory IC devices, or IC foundry services. Its five largest customers make up more than half of sales. Its top two customers are TSMC and Samsung, which respectively account for 18% and 15% of annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company primarily uses a direct sales force and depends on independent distributors in some regional markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sales slid 2.4% in 2015 to $414 million from $424.6 million in 2014. The company had lower sales volumes and was hit by currency exchange rates, particularly in Japan and South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, on the other hand, rose 10% to $56.5 million in 2015 from $50.7 million in 2014. The company cut some costs, including in sales and marketing, to achieve the profit gain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $98 million in 2015, compared to $67 million in 2014.

  <p>
   To improve product performance, quality, and consistency, Cabot also works to streamline processes and reduce product variation levels. Some product improvement efforts are conducted in collaboration with customers and strategic partners. In addition to R&amp;D efforts on core lines of slurries and pads for CMP processes, the ESF business develops new polishing techniques and processes for applications in industries outside of semiconductors, such as precision optics and electronic substrates. These efforts aim to reduce Cabot Micro's dependence on one product for most of its sales, which increases its vulnerability to competition.

  <p>
   In 2015 Cabot closed the acquisition of exPlanar Corp., which makes advanced CMP pad products, for about $142,300. The CMP pad products from exPlanar are complementary to Cabot's.

  <p>
   The business that became Cabot Microelectronics first came into existence as the Microelectronics Materials Division of
   <company id="10277">
    Cabot Corp.
   </company>
   , formed in 1995. Cabot Corp. spun off the division as an independent entity through an IPO in 2000. The former parent company remaineds Cabot Micro's primary supplier of fumed silica, a material which goes into making CMP slurries, under an agreement running through 2009. Cabot Corp. also supplied fumed alumina to Cabot Micro.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Cabot Microelectronics acquired the assets of Surface Finishes Co., a supplier of precision machining techniques that was established in 1949, for about $2.3 million. The company used Surface Finishes' technology as part of its engineered surface finishes initiative, meeting the technical challenges of sub-nanometer, atomic-scale manufacturing of semiconductors and other advanced components. Like Cabot Microelectronics, Surface Finishes was based in a suburb of Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cabot Micro acquired the assets of QED Technologies, a supplier of polishing and metrology systems for high-precision optics, in 2006. The company made the QED product line part of its engineered surface finishes portfolio. Cabot Micro paid $21.5 million in cash for the assets, plus it assumed about $2 million in liabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 it acquired patents and associated rights for CMP slurry technology from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   . The patents covered manufacturing process applications in copper, copper barrier, tungsten, and dielectrics, among other uses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006 President George W. Bush toured Cabot Micro's headquarters, promoting his American Competitiveness Initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company raised prices in late 2006 on its Semi-Sperse and Cab-O-Sperse product lines, used for interlayer dielectrics and general-purpose oxide polishing applications. It noted that this represented the first price increase on those products since they were introduced some 15 years earlier. The price boost was said to be necessary to maintain the level of service Cabot Micro provides to its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Taiwan-based Epoch Material Co., Ltd. in 2009 for about $66 million. Epoch specializes in the development, production, and sale of copper CMP slurries and CMP cleaning products for the semiconductor industry, as well as color filter slurries for the LCD industry. The deal is in line with Cabot's strategy of growing its core CMP business in one of its strongest geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cabot Micro continues to expand globally, particularly in Asia where it can be close to its customers. Cabot Micro completed construction of its new manufacturing and research and development facility in South Korea in 2011, allowing it to better serve its memory customers there. The company also expanded plants in Japan and Singapore that year to increase production capacity and improve customer response times.
