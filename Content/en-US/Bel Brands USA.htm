   Parent company Fromageries Bel has reported that its Boursin business continues to exhibit strong growth potential. Mini Babybel is also logging sales increases, albeit at a slower pace, following several years of extraordinary growth for the top brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, in fiscal 2013 Bel Brands reported more than $325 million in annual sales. During the reporting period, the Americas and Asia/Pacific regions generated 15% of the parent company's revenue.

   Through its parent's research, development, and production departments, the company works to improve packaging design and existing product quality and consistency. To continue to push for profits for its cheeses, Bel Brands in 2012 launched a Smooth Sensations cream cheese version of its popular Laughing Cow product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Building a new production plant in South Dakota was necessary to keep up with demand for its Mini Babybel cheeses. Bel Brands is investing some $100 million to add this 17,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing facility to its existing footprint. Situated on a 48-acre land parcel, the South Dakota plant will initially produce 22 million pounds of Mini Babybel cheese each day and ultimately 1.5 million of the cheeses daily.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bel Brands also moved to Chicago in 2011 to a 27,200-sq.-ft. space to provide the company with elbow room to grow.
