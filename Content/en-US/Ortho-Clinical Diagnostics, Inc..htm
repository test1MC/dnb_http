   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   subsidiary develops and markets diagnostic tools, including VITROS instrumentation systems that use clinical chemistry and immunoassay technologies to diagnose a range of maladies such as cancer, heart disease, and infectious diseases. It also markets laboratory automation systems under the enGen brand. In addition to making clinical diagnostics products, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics is a leading maker of instruments and reagents used by blood banks and hospitals to screen blood donations for disease and contaminants, as well as blood typing systems that guarantee patient-donor compatibility for transfusions.

   The clinical laboratory division focuses on producing in vitro diagnostic tests under the VITROS brand, which are sold to small, midsized, and large clinical and research laboratories, hospitals, and doctors' offices.

   A third, smaller Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics division makes immune globulin, a therapeutic plasma product used to treat Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), under the RhoGAM and MICRhoGAM brands. It also makes a FETALSCREEN FMH (fetal maternal hemorrhage) screening test, which helps in the detection and prevention of HDN.
