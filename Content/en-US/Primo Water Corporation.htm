   Among the amenities of today's home, a water dispenser appears near indispensable. Serving the growing trend of household purified water dispensers, Primo Water provides water dispensers, along with three- and five-gallon purified bottled water, and carbonating beverage appliances. The company's products are sold through US and Canadian retailers, such as

   . Empty bottles are exchanged at retail locations with Primo Water recycling centers (where consumers receive a discount toward buying a new Primo bottle) or refilled at a self-serve filtered drinking water display. Started in 2005, Primo expanded quickly and went public in both 2010 and 2011.

   The initial public offering netted Primo about $106.9 million. Primo used roughly $74.3 million of the proceeds coupled with $36.6 million in stock to fund its purchase of

   's Store Solutions water refill business. A secondary public offering in mid-2011 raised about $39.4 million, of which $29.4 million was used to repay short-term securities issued to stockholders, members of senior management, and other investors. The remaining proceeds were applied toward working capital and for general corporate purposes.

   Primo divides its operations into two segments: Primo Water and Primo Dispensers. Its largest with 69% of sales, the Water segment, includes water bottle exchange services and a refill business that generates sales through self-serve filtered drinking water vending displays, located at retail stores. A Dispensers segment, which generates 31% of sales, sells water dispensers designed for Primo bottled water and other dispenser-compatible bottled water.

   Based in North Carolina, Primo maintains several functions at its headquarters, including administrative, marketing, sales, technical support, and research and development. The company also has an office in Minnesota. It sells its water dispensers through major retailers mostly throughout the US, as well as in Canada.

   Primo concentrates on developing and maintaining its brand identity, which focuses on an environmentally friendly, economical, convenient, and healthy solution for purified water consumption. Its marketing efforts include prominent display of its Primo logo and distinctive four-bubble design on water bottles, sales and recycling displays, and water dispensers. It also banks on its highly visible sales and recycling center displays and relies on regular cross-marketing promotions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company offers its products and services in the US and Canada to 24,500 combined retail locations, which include Lowe's, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Meijer, Kroger, Food Lion, HEB, Sobeys, and Walgreen.

        <p>
   Since its inception, Primo has been a fast-growing company, but it has yet to make a profit. In fact, it has incurred losses since its inception with fiscal 2012 representing its deepest losses of $111 million. Conspiring against the company were the cost of sales, depreciation and amortization, goodwill and other impairment, and loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes.
  </p>
        <p>
   Primo's overall revenue in 2012 was helped by a 9% increase to $91 million from $83 million in 2011. Both segments provided revenue rises, such as a 7% sales increase in its Water segment and a 22% sales increase in its Dispensers segment.

   Primo works to expand existing retail relationships and develop new retail relationships. Its exchange and refill services were offered at a combined 16,400 of its top 10 retailers' locations. The customers have the potential for about 28,800 additional exchange or refill locations.
  </p>
        <p>
   As part of its focus on product research and development, the company began selling the first water dispenser model that includes a 12-cup drip coffee maker. It is developing a water dispenser that dispenses hot and cold still water, as well as cold carbonated water as a way to also support the addition of existing single-serve hot beverage makers.
  </p>
        <p>
   It's also partnering with other big-name appliance makers to extend its brand. In 2012 Primo and Cuisinart, a kitchen electrics and cookware giant, inked a three-year sales, distribution, and licensing agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Cuisinart markets and sells Primo's sparkling beverage appliances and related consumables in North America, and Primo supplies CO2 cylinders for Cuisinart's new proprietary line of sparkling beverage makers.
