   Going green turns on Lighting Science (LSGC). The company designs, manufactures, and markets eco-friendly, light-emitting diode (LED) technologies that conserve energy and eliminate the use of hazardous materials. It products use LED chips to integrate power sources with thermal management, optic, and control systems. The company sells optimized digital lighting (ODL) and LED replacement lamps, fixtures, and bulbs for streets, garages, stages, and retail displays. While most of its customers are in retail, commercial, industrial, and public sectors, LSGC also customizes ambiance and lighting systems for entertainment venues and nightclubs.

  <p>
   Based in Satellite Beach, Florida, the company also has sales offices in Cocoa Beach, Florida; and Melbourne, Australia.

   When it comes to selling its lighting products, LSGC employs a multi-faceted channel strategy that addresses a diverse array of market opportunities through branded and co-branded private label programs, its direct sales force, distributors, and independent sales agents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its customers include leading retailers and original equipment manufacturers such as
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   (accounting for 80% of sales) and Standard Products, which sell its products on a co-branded or private label basis.

  <p>
   LSGC has suffered more than 10 straight years of net losses. After declining in 2013, the company's revenues increased 10% to $91 million in 2014 mainly due to additional sales from
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   , its major customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   LSGC has suffered over five straight years of negative cash flow from its operations and is burdened each year by higher costs of goods sold compared to the amount of net revenue it annually receives. (LEDs are more expensive, price per lumen, on an initial capital cost basis, when compared to most conventional lighting technologies.)

  <p>
   Striving to get its balance sheet back into the red, the company has been restructuring. In late 2013 it moved the majority of its manufacturing operations to its contract manufacturers in Asia, and it reduced its workforce in Satellite Beach, Florida. In 2014 it shuttered its operations in Australia, India, and The Netherlands.
