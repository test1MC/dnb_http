   People often refer to 'tape' when speaking about digital video. But Qualstar means it when it talks about tape, especially when storing archival information on tape library systems. The company's products -- tape drives and tape library data storage systems -- house, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data in computer networks. Its other business is power supplies that convert AC voltage to DC. Qualstar's systems are compatible with a variety of operating systems and with storage management software from companies such as

    Symantec
   </company>
   . The company, which incorporates tape drives and media from
   <company id="14521">
    Quantum
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41885">
    Sony
   </company>
   into its libraries, sells mainly to manufacturers and resellers. Two customers account for a combined quarter of revenues.

   While still an important part of its business, Qualstar's Tape Library segment accounts for 46% of its revenue. In a reversal from several years ago, the Power Supplies segment brings in the lion's share, 54%. Within the Tape Library segment, product sales were 27% of total revenue with service at 19%.

  <p>
   Qualstar gets 56% of its revenue from its North American customers, followed by Asian customers with 24%, and European, 18%. The company contracts with Asian manufacturers to make its power supply products and make its storage products at its Simi Valley, California headquarters.

  <p>
   The company sells its storage products directly and through distributors and resellers. Resellers often package Qualstar products with other devices as part of a comprehensive storage subsystem.

   Qualstar continued its slide in revenue in  2014 as it fell to about $11 millioon from $12.6 million in 2013. The company brought in $18.3 million in 2011. In 2014, Tape Library sales did more than taper off, dropping 18% from 2013 because of decreased sales of Tape Library products. Power Supplies segment revenue also decreased, by 9% in its case, on fewer sales OEMs and distributors. Qualstar cut its loss in half, posting a $5.6 million loss in 2014 compared to a loss of $10.3 million in 2013, as it cut operational expenses.

  <p>
   Customers don't doubt the need for power supplies so Qualstar's job is easier on that front. It just needs to persuade customers that they need its power supplies. The company expanded its AC-DC power supply offerings by adding medically certified power supplies to its N2Power brand portfolio. It also reached a distributor agreement with TTI Europe to handle distribution in Europe as well as promote the N2 products.

   On the tape storage side, Qualstar has a bigger task in selling customers on using tape for storage as users have turned to digital storage. Although tape can compete on capacity and durability, it falls behind on the speed at which data can be retrieved. To counter perceptions about tape, Qualstar company plans to expand marketing efforts in select vertical markets and to attend more trade shows with partners. It is exploring OEM and private label opportunities to market its products. And Qualstar is considering looking for partnerships with other storage providers in order to deliver a comprehensive storage package.
