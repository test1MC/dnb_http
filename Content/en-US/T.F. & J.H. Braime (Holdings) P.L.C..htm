   In 2015, sales increased 9% on prior year to £26.5 million due to a strong performance in distribution. Net income increased 83% to £1.6 million due to increased sales and profits on the disposal of tangible fixed assets. Cash flow from operating activities was down £1.4 million to £0.4 million due to changes in trade and other payables.
