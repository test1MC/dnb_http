   Air Products and Chemicals has built a solid business out of gases and liquids. The company makes and distributes Industrial Gases and Materials Technologies. Industrial Gases' primary products are atmospheric gases, process gases, and equipment for air separation. Materials Technologies' primary products are performance materials and chemicals, such as epoxy amine curing agents, polyurethane catalysts, additives, and specialty surfactants, and electronics materials such as specialty gases, chemical mechanical planarization slurries, and specialty chemicals. In 2017 Air Products sold its Performance Materials business to Germany-based
   <company id="158909">
    Evonik
   </company>
   for $3.8 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Air Products owns 970 patents in the US and 3,900 international patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates through a handful of reporting segments: Industrial Gases - Americas, Industrial Gases - EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Industrial Gases - Asia, Industrial Gases - Global, Materials Technologies, and Corporate and other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Gases (Americas) include the results of Air Products regional industrial gas businesses, which produce and sell atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air) and process gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, syngas, and specialty gases. Industrial Gases - Americas is the largest segment, accounting for 35% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2016.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Gases - EMEA and Industrial Gases - Asia each accounted for 18% of the total net sales. The Industrial Gases Global segment (5%) includes cryogenic and gas processing equipment sales for air separation
  </p>
  <p>
   The Materials Technologies segment (21%) includes applications technology to make products that provide solutions to a broad range of global industries through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. It provides specialty gases, specialty chemicals, services, and equipment to the electronics industry primarily for the manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors as well as liquid crystal and other displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Corporate and other segment (3%) includes two on-going global businesses (LNG equipment business and helium storage and distribution).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Merchant Gases operates 295 production and distribution facilities in North and South America, more than 150 facilities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and more than 150 facilities within Asia. The production and distribution plants include about 30 integrated sites that also serve dedicated customers as well as merchant customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The electronics materials business segment has production, equipment manufacturing, and distribution operations at 24 sites in the US, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US generated 40% of Air Products' total sales in fiscal 2016; Asia, 27%; and Europe, 26%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Industrial Gases are sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Air Products distributes liquid or gaseous bulk supply by tanker or tube trailer and, for smaller customers, cylinders and dewars or small on-site cryogenic or noncryogenic generators. For large-volume customers, it builds an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer's facility or delivers products from one of its pipelines.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, Air Product's net sales decreased by almost 4% to $9.5 billion. Underlying sales increased by 2% primarily due to higher volumes in Industrial Gases - Global and Industrial Gases - Asia, partially offset by lower volumes in all other segments. Price was flat as increases in the Industrial Gases - Americas and Industrial Gases - EMEA segments were offset by lower prices in Industrial Gases - Asia. However, the company's underlying sales growth was more than offset by lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers of 3% and unfavorable currency of 3%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped by 51% (to $631.1 million) primarily due to a loss of $884.2 million from discontinued operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, Air Product's net cash provided by operating activities increased by 11% to $2.7 billion due to a change in payables and accrued liabilities.

  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2017 Air Products sold its Performance Materials business to Germany-based
   <company id="158909">
    Evonik
   </company>
   for $3.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company exited its Energy-from-Waste (EfW) business in the UK, citing difficulties in making its EfW projects commercially viable.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth the company reorganized into new business segments to reduce costs more effectively and to better manage and utilize existing assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it spun off Versum Materials, LLC, to hold its Materials Technologies business.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Air Products signed a product supply agreement with Big River Steel, to operate an air separation unit producing multiple industrial gases and a PRISM hydrogen generator for Big River Steel's new hot rolled steel facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Air Products and Suzuki Shokan teamed up to design, construction and operation of hydrogen fueling stations for use in fueling the material handling vehicle market in Japan. It also entered into an agreement with a unit of
   <company id="57154">
    Enterprise Products Partners
   </company>
   to increase hydrogen supply for refinery and petrochemical customers connected to Air Products' vast Gulf Coast Connection Pipeline system.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, in 2014 Air Products signed a long-term agreement for the production of liquid carbon dioxide with Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy to build a facility to produce 400 tons per day of liquid carbon dioxide at SIRE's established ethanol production facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company brought new plants onstream, and also reported higher LNG activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it debuted its Maxx Pak portable shielding gas blending system at FABTECH 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia. The new portable gas blending system complemented the company's line of Max shielding gases, enables welders to economically and efficiently blend gases on-site. With Air Products' new Maxx Pak system, multiple welding stations can be managed from a single blending gas system, providing welders with flexibility to move the gas supply where needed and eliminate the moving and handling of individual cylinders.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In the early 1900s Leonard Pool, the son of a boilermaker, began selling oxygen to industrial users. By the time he was 30, he was district manager for Compressed Industrial Gases. In the late 1930s Pool hired engineer Frank Pavlis to help him design a cheaper, more efficient oxygen generator. In 1940 they had the design, and Pool established Air Products in Detroit (initially sharing space with the cadavers collected by his brother, who was starting a mortuary science college). The company was based on a simple, breakthrough concept: the provision of on-site gases. Instead of delivering oxygen in cylinders, Pool proposed to build oxygen-generating facilities near large-volume gas users and then lease them, reducing distribution costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although industrialists encouraged Pool to pursue his ideas, few orders were forthcoming, and the company faced financial crisis. The outbreak of WWII got the company out of difficulty, as the US military became a major customer. During the war the company moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the available labor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The end of the war brought with it another downturn as demand dried up. By waiting at the Weirton Steel plant until a contract was signed, Pool won a contract for three on-site generators. Weirton was nearly the company's only customer. Pool relocated the company to Allentown, Pennsylvania, to be closer to the Northeast's industrial market, where he could secure more contracts with steel companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cold War and the launching of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 propelled the company's growth. Convinced that Soviet rockets were powered by liquid hydrogen, the US government asked Air Products to supply it with the volatile fuel. The company entered the overseas market that year through a joint venture with Butterley (UK), to which it licensed its cryogenic processes and equipment. The company went public in 1961 and formed a subsidiary in Belgium in 1964.
  </p>
  <p>
   Air Products diversified into chemicals when it bought Houdry Process (chemicals and chemical-plant maintenance, 1962) and Airco's chemicals and plastics operations in the 1970s. The company continued to diversify in the mid-1980s as it built large-scale plants for its environmental- and energy-systems business and added Anchor Chemical and the industrial chemicals unit of Abbott Labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 and 1996 Air Products expanded into China and other countries by winning 20 contracts with semiconductor makers. It bought Carburos Metálicos, Spain's #1 industrial gas supplier, in 1996. To focus on its core gas and chemical lines, the company shed most of its environmental- and energy-systems business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding further in Europe, Air Products bought the methylamines and derivatives unit of UK-based
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   (ICI) in 1997. The company sold its remaining interest in American Ref-Fuel (a waste-to-energy US operation).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Air Products bought Solkatronic Chemicals and opened a methylamines plant in Florida to complement its ICI purchase. To further target semiconductor makers, it formed Air Products Electronic Chemicals and allied with AlliedSignal Chemical (now part of
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Air Products and France's
   <company id="90734">
    L'Air Liquide
   </company>
   agreed to buy and break up
   <company id="90067">
    BOC Group
   </company>
   . European Union regulators initially approved the deal, but in 2000 the companies shelved the plan when other regulatory issues arose. Also in 2000 Air Products sold its polyvinyl alcohol business to Celanese for about $326 million. The company boosted its European presence in 2001 with the acquisition of
   <company id="92102">
    Messer Griesheim
   </company>
   's (Germany) respiratory home-care business and 50% of AGA's Netherlands industrial gases operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Air Products was hurt by the slowdown in manufacturing, primarily in the electronics and steel industries, which are major customers for gases. Its chemical revenues also were hurt by pressure on pricing. To improve profits, the company initiated cost cuts, including job cuts (about 10% of its employees) and divestitures such as its US packaged gas business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company broadened its health care operations in late 2002 by acquiring American Homecare Supply. It appeared briefly that Air Products wanted to devote a great deal of attention to the health care business. The company had created its
   <company id="144380">
    Air Products Healthcare
   </company>
   unit in 1999 and expanded it greatly three years later with the acquisition of American Homecare Supply. Air Products proceeded to add to the division through subsequent acquisitions; however, the US portion of the business never performed to the company's expectations, and Air Products sold the domestic operations of the health care unit in 2008 and 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also decided to divest its chemicals operations in the latter half of the decade. Those operations included the production of catalysts, surfactants, and intermediates derived from vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), all of which it sold in 2008. Air Products had sold its amines business to chemical company Taminco in 2006. The company's polymers operations, which were run through a joint venture with
   <company id="91237">
    Wacker-Chemie
   </company>
   called
   <company id="110668">
    Air Products Polymers
   </company>
   , were divested in 2008. The company sold most of its holdings in the JV to Wacker for $265 million, though two facilities that had belonged to the joint venture were sold to
   <company id="107322">
    Ashland Performance Materials
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Air Products made a small but strategic move into Eastern Europe. The company took advantage of
   <company id="91155">
    Linde
   </company>
   's selloff of some
   <company id="90067">
    BOC
   </company>
   assets after the German company bought BOC in 2006. Air Products acquired the Polish Gazy SP for just under $500 million with the hopes of moving into the Central and Eastern European markets to take advantage of the migration of manufacturing to the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company made a major bid to buy rival
   <company id="10044">
    Airgas
   </company>
   , but it was rejected. The Airgas board considered the $5.1 billion offer too low. Air Products extended its tender offer to Airgas stockholders several times, making its "best and final offer" of $70 a share in December 2010. Airgas also rejected that offer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2012 Air Products opened an advanced gas applications laboratory in Shanghai to support the increasing needs in high-growth markets in China across Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to growing organically, the company has been divesting operations to focus on its higher growth operations and to pursue strategic acquisitions. By early 2012 the company began divesting units to focus on more profitable operations. It sold its homecare business in continental Europe (which supplied oxygen and infusion treatments in Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain) to Germany's
   <company id="91155">
    Linde
   </company>
   for $750 million. The company also began evaluating its homecare assets in Argentina, Brazil, Ireland, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   With more money in its coffers from divestments, in 2012 the company acquired Germany-based ROVI Cosmetics International, which develops delivery systems for the personal care industry in Europe. The unit is now part of the company's Performance Materials division. To extend its Latin American footprint, Air Products in 2012 acquired a 67% stake in Indura S.A., an industrial gas company in Chile, for $884 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its portfolio of industrial gases offerings in North America to include liquid carbon dioxide, in 2013 Air Products acquired EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc., a privately-held Louisiana-based producer and marketer of liquid carbon dioxide.
