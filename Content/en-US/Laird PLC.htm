   Laird knows how to protect companies against interference and how to get messages through. The company makes shielding products for electronics and wireless communications products. For electronics manufacturers,
   <company id="106576">
    Laird Technologies
   </company>
   supplies products that shield against electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as conductive foam, printed circuit board grounding devices, and gaskets. It also offers antenna components and thermal reduction devices. Laird generates the majority of its sales from Asia, and its operations are divided across two primary divisions: performance materials and wireless systems.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Laird has operations in 18 countries spanning Asia, Europe, and North America; most of its manufacturing units are located in the UK and the US, but the company has expanded its operations in China to win more business there. As such, Asia accounts for nearly half of its total revenue; North America generates roughly 35% and Europe, 15%.

  <p>
   Laird divides its operations across two segment groups: performance materials (62% of total sales; shielding mechanisms for connectivity products) and wireless systems (38%; telematics, antennae products, and wireless technology).

   The company's revenues increased 5% from 2013 to 2014 and profit rose 63%. Laird reported 9% organic growth in Performance Materials, which was driven by smartphones and mobile LTE/4G investment, and organic growth in Wireless Systems, boosted by automotive/M2M applications.

  <p>
   Laird's strategy is informed by plans to keep its own manufacturing costs to a minimum while developing business through capital investment and acquisitions in specialist markets that show promise of rapid growth. Laird hopes to strike relationships with customers that call for long periods of service and accordingly develop systems and the aftermarket as a greater proportion of revenue. Product development is another component of the company's strategy as it seeks to increase the content and add value to each device in its catalog. The company is targeting the regions of China, Korea, and Germany for growth in the years ahead.

   In 2014, the company introduced the Ultra Phantom low-profile vertical antenna product line. It is the industry's smallest high-performance omnidirectional low-profile UHF antenna and it was designed for use in government, public safety, and industrial-commercial markets. The low profile design reduces height clearance problems on specialty and heavy duty vehicles with secure mounting hardware that deters antenna vandalism.

  <p>
   Scotsman William Laird traveled to Birkenhead, UK, in 1828, founded the Birkenhead Iron Works, and began making ships. The company traded as Laird Brothers until 1903, when it combined with Charles Cammell and Co. Ltd., a Sheffield-based steelmaker; the combined firm became Cammell Laird. The company became an important contributor during the UK's war years, and later expanded into trains and aircraft operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s orders for ships dried up and the company was on the verge of capsizing due to its shipbuilding losses. In 1970 the Labour government's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation sent John Gardiner, a former

    Financial Times
   </i>
   business columnist, to rescue Commell Laird. Known for his directness, Gardiner implemented strict central control, borrowed on segments that were making money, cut costs, and persuaded ship-owning customers to change the fixed-price contracts that, due to inflation, were killing Commell Laird. Eventually the shipbuilding operations were separated from the rest of the company, and The Laird Group was born.
