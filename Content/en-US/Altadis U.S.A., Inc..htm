   When the smoke clears, connoisseur puffers may find themselves holding a cigar crafted by Altadis USA. Created by the consolidation of HavaTampa Inc. and Consolidated Cigar Holdings, Altadis USA has grown to rival the world's largest cigar makers and generate a considerable share of US cigar sales. Altadis USA manufactures, markets, and sells both premium and mass-market cigars, under such well-known brand names as Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, H. Upmann, and Trinidad. It also sells little cigars under the Dutch Treats and Supre Sweets brands, as well as humidors and cigar cases. Altadis USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Britain's

   Since its January 2008 acquisition of Altadis USA's Spanish parent company,
   <company id="61627">
    Altadis, S.A
   </company>
   ., Imperial Brands has taken steps to reorganize cigar operations to align with its growth strategy. As part of the reorganization, in 2011 Altadis USA established a premium cigar division. The premium cigar division is intended to further fuel international marketing of the cigar maker's brand portfolio. Although Altadis USA has exported cigars (including the handmade Don Diego brand, to India through Godfrey Philips India), its eye is on other global opportunities.
  </p>
        <p>
   At home, despite competition in the cigar market, Altadis USA is one of the few companies with a presence in most categories of the US cigar industry. The new premium cigar division promises to strengthen sales of its premium (Romeo y Julieta and Montecristo) and natural (Dutch Masters and Backwoods) tobacco brands. Concurrently, the company has managed to counter the impact of rival product rollouts and retailer and distributor incentives, with innovations in smaller, flavored formats, such as the Phillies and Dutch Masters Vanilla.

   Six independent cigar makers banded together in 1918 to form Consolidated Cigar Holdings. One of those companies was G.H. Johnson Cigar, whose Dutch Masters brand became the company's flagship product. In 1956 Consolidated Cigar inhaled the popular Muriel cigar brand. Consolidated Cigar's success led to its acquisition by conglomerate Gulf &amp; Western in 1968. During the 1970s the company acquired the rights to such notable Cuban cigar brands as Montecristo and H. Upmann, whose owners had fled the island after Fidel Castro's takeover in 1962.

        <p>
   In 1984 MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, an investment company controlled by Ron Perelman, acquired Consolidated Cigar, but soon sold it back to company executives in 1987. After going cold turkey without a cigar company for six years, Perelman repurchased Consolidated Cigar in 1993. The timing was advantageous: For the previous three decades, cigar smoking had been on the decline, but a swing in public taste -- partly caused by photos of prominent Hollywood stars firing up a fat one -- brought cigar smoking back into fashion. Consolidated Cigar went public in 1996.

   Although Consolidated Cigar's 1997 sales were high, the market began to tighten that year as a flood of low-end cigars, derisively nicknamed "Don Nobodies," hit tobacco stands in order to cash in on the cigar market's surge in popularity. Facing burnout of the cigar fad, Consolidated Cigar was bought by Societe Nationale d'Exploitation des Tabacs et Allumettes (Seita) in 1999; Seita and Tabacalera merged to create Altadis in late 1999. Altadis USA was formed the next year from the merger of Tabacalera's HavaTampa and Consolidated Cigar.
