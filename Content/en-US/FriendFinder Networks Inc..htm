   If you're looking for friendship, try knocking on some doors below the penthouse. FriendFinder Networks (publisher of the venerable adult magazine
   <em>
    Penthouse
   </em>
   , and producer of adult video content and images) now owns and operates some 38,000 social networking websites, including AdultFriendFinder.com, Amigos.com, AsiaFriendFinder.com, Cams.com, FriendFinder.com,  BigChurch.com, and SeniorFriendFinder.com. In total, its sites are offered to about 528 million members in more than 200 countries. FriendFinder also distributes original pictorial and video content and engages in brand licensing. It emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2013, returning control to company founder Andrew Conru.

  <p>
   FriendFinder's online operations include social networking, live interactive video, and premium content websites. The company also has activities devoted to publishing, broadcasting, and licensing, mainly related to its Penthouse brand. While the firm markets its Internet holdings using the general "social networking" descriptor, it also owns paid-usage pornography and other adult content (including racy sites Bondage.com, AdultFriendFinder.com, and HotBox.com). Its general audience social networking sites include Amigos.com, SeniorFriendFinder.com, and BigChurch.com. The company's business model is based on subscription sales; subscribers pay a monthly fee to access content.

   Once a leading men's magazine,
   <em>
    Penthouse
   </em>
   has seen its circulation dwindle from 5 million copies a month at its peak in the 1980s to a circulation of a little more than 175,000. The Internet has siphoned away many readers in search of explicit material, while others have turned to alternative publications such as
   <em>
    Maxim
   </em>
   (published in the US by
   <company id="159586">
    Alpha Media Group
   </company>
   ) that feature racy, but not sexually explicit, material.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   FriendFinder has tried to expand through the launch of new products and operations. In 2012 the company launched Mobile Site for Smartphones and Tablets for its popular live interactive video website, iCams.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   It entered the online interactive gaming market in 2011 when it formed Big Ego Games. The subsidiary was launched to develop social games for mobile and online applications; its first title is a pirate adventure game called
   <em>
    Yarr!
   </em>
   , available on its own website and via
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   . On the TV front, in 2011 FriendFinder launched its PENTHOUSE 3D Channel featuring original adult programming shot in 3-D digital format. The channel adds to the company's existing TV holdings, which include adult video broadcast in HD and standard formats that is distributed via cable, satellite, Internet protocol television (IPTV), DVDs, and mobile devices.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   It began focusing on the Web when it acquired
   <company id="132359">
    Various
   </company>
   (doing business as FriendFinder) in 2007. The next year the company changed its name from Penthouse Media Group to FriendFinder Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to corner the mainstream adult magazine market, FriendFinder made an unsuccessful bid to acquire
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy Enterprises
   </company>
   for $210 million in mid-2010.

  <p>
   Brooklyn-born Robert Guccione settled in London in the early 1960s, working for the
   <i>
    London American
   </i>
   newspaper. In 1965 he started
   <i>
    Penthouse
   </i>
   , bringing the magazine to the US in 1969. The 1970s saw the company introduce its monthly pictorials of
   <i>
    Penthouse Pets
   </i>
   (1971), launch a science magazine called
   <i>
    Omni
   </i>
   (1978), and produce its first and only theatrically released film, the cult classic
   <i>
    Caligula
   </i>
   (1979). Other Guccione ventures fared less well, however. A plan to build a $200 million casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1978 failed to get off the ground, and a subsequent partnership with Ramada Inn to build a $140 million luxury club also failed to bare fruit.
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of relative success (circulation reached an all-time high in 1979 of 5 million),
   <i>
    Penthouse
   </i>
   had circulation reduction surgery in 1986 when Attorney General Edwin Meese's anti-pornography report prompted many convenience stores to stop selling the magazine, forcing General Media to expand into other media. It bought automotive magazine
   <i>
    Four Wheeler
   </i>
   that year. In 1987 Guccione backed his son, Bob Guccione, Jr., as he launched the music magazine
   <i>
    Spin
   </i>
   , but the elder Guccione closed the magazine later that year after the two had a public falling out. (The younger Guccione eventually found new financing and relaunched
   <i>
    Spin
   </i>
   ; he and his father have been estranged ever since.)
  </p>
  <p>
   General Media started health magazine
   <i>
    Longevity
   </i>
   in 1989 and bought three more automotive titles the next year. Faced with high debt and losses stemming from the continuing decline in the circulation of
   <i>
    Penthouse
   </i>
   , the company laid off nearly a quarter of its staff in 1996 and stopped producing
   <i>
    Longevity
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Omni
   </i>
   . With profits as bare as its models, the company brought in attorney and corporate finance specialist Robert Altman as president and CEO in 1998. (He was gone by the following year.) General Media sold its four automotive magazines to
   <company id="93579">
    Emap
   </company>
   , re-released
   <i>
    Caligula
   </i>
   , and launched a new men's health magazine called
   <i>
    Mind &amp; Muscle Power
   </i>
   in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm warned in 2000 that it wouldn't be able to pay back debt without further funding.
   <i>
    Mind &amp; Muscle Power
   </i>
   was closed after only 11 months on newsstands and General Media made sharp cuts in headcount. In 2002 the company was again feeling the burden of its debts as loan payments came due.
   <em>
    Penthouse
   </em>
   was dealt an embarrassing blow that year when a photo it claimed was of tennis star Anna Kournikova turned out to be a private citizen. The gaff also resulted in the magazine paying a reported $10 million to settle a lawsuit. Later that year Guccione exchanged his shares in General Media for controlling interest in a failed, but publicly traded, pulp paper business that was renamed Penthouse International.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Media's financial woes finally came to a head in 2003 after
   <em>
    Penthouse
   </em>
   missed its printing schedule because it was unable to pay printing costs. The company later filed for Chapter 11. Penthouse International owned nearly 100% of General Media when the publisher filed for bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Florida investor Marc Bell, managing director of Marc Bell Capital Partners, placed a bid to take over the magazine that year. Penthouse International opposed Bell's bid and later challenged a court ruling approving the transaction. Penthouse International eventually dropped the appeal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 General Media emerged from bankruptcy under the majority ownership of PET Capital Partners, an affiliate of Marc Bell Capital Partners. Guccione subsequently left the company, which was renamed as Penthouse Media Group. The company restructured into publishing, online, video, and licensing groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to expand its online operations and video library, Penthouse acquired the assets of Danni Ashe Inc. and Jill Kelly Productions in 2006. The company inked a $10 million licensing deal with
   <company id="55983">
    New Frontier Media
   </company>
   to launch a Penthouse-branded pay-per-view (PPV) TV service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm significantly increased its online presence through the 2007 acquisition of Various for more than $400 million. The purchase gave the company access to more than 260 million new customers who use the FriendFinder network of online meeting sites. The deal accounts for the bulk of the company's Internet segment. The following year Penthouse changed its name to FriendFinder Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed an IPO in late 2008, but postponed the plans in 2010. Guccione died of lung cancer in 2010. FriendFinder Networks eventually went through with its plans to go public in 2011.
