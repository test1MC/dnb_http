   ResMed develops, makes, and distributes medical equipment used to diagnose and treat respiratory disorders that occur during sleep, such as sleep apnea. Most of its products treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition in which a patient's air flow is periodically obstructed, causing multiple disruptions during sleep that can lead to daytime sleepiness and other conditions such as high blood pressure. Its products include air-flow generators, face masks, diagnostic products, and accessories. ResMed sells directly and through distributors worldwide to home health equipment dealers, sleep clinics, and hospitals. ResMed was founded in Australia in 1989 by Peter C. Farrell, who remains chairman.

  <p>
   The company's main products are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems that deliver pressurized air from an airflow generator through a nasal mask or pillow, keeping the upper airway open during sleep. It also makes variable positive airway pressure (VPAP) systems, which operate on the same principle but deliver different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2016 acquisition of Brightree allowed ResMed to begin providing business management software to medical equipment and home health providers.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ResMed manufactures its products primarily at its Australian facility, though it has additional production plants in China, Singapore, Malaysia, France, and the US. The company also has R&amp;D and office facilities in Australia. It leases warehousing and distribution facilities in the US (2), the UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, India, Japan, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's systems are sold in more than 100 countries. North and Latin America together account for about 60% of annual revenues, while Germany is its second-largest market (about 10%).

  <p>
   ResMed's products are sold through its own subsidiaries (mainly in the US, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region) and through independent distributors and representatives. Marketing efforts target consumers and health care professionals, sleep clinics, hospitals, and home health care systems.

  <p>
   ResMed's revenue has been trending upward in recent years, and climbed a further 10% to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016 (ended June). Growth of 17% in North America is primarily attributable to higher unit sales of devices, masks, and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. Latin America and the Rest of the World also recorded positive growth figures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was essentially flat in fiscal 2016, although this marked the first time in five years that profit failed to rise. An increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets that year was related to the recent acquisitions Brightree, Curative Medical, and Inova Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations increased by 43% to $547.9 million.

  <p>
   ResMed is benefiting from the growing awareness in the medical community and among the general population of the dangers of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Indeed, a 2013 study estimated that 26% of adults between the ages of 30 and 70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the US alone, that's about 46 million people. ResMed is focusing on reaching those with SDB in the US and abroad through the acquisition of a number of medical equipment makers, distributors, and technology service providers in Europe and elsewhere. Mostly recently, it acquired Curative Medical, a maker of non-invasive ventilation and sleep-disordered breathing devices; and Inova Labs, a Texas-based developer of oxygen therapy products. The acquisition of Curative Medical also marks a fresh attempt to crack the growing Chinese market.

  <p>
   In April 2016, ResMed acquired Georgia-based Brightree, a provider of cloud-based clinical and business management software for the post-acute care industry, for $802 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2016, ResMed acquired Inova Labs, a Texas-based maker of oxygen therapy products. The acquisition expanded the company's ability to address the global COPD epidemic. It also expands ResMed's respiratory care portfolio to include both portable and fixed oxygen concentrators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company agreed to buy Curative Medical, a private provider of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) products with a strong presence in China.

  <p>
   ResMed was founded as ResCare in 1989 after Peter Farrell led a management buyout of
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter
   </company>
   Healthcare's respiratory technology unit. ResCare initially developed the SULLIVAN nasal CPAP systems (named after inventor Colin Sullivan) in Australia. In 1991 it introduced the Bubble Mask and the APD2 portable CPAP device. Three years later ResCare began marketing its first VPAP, which applied different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation, in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company went public, changing its name to ResMed (its former name was already taken by another medical company). Over the next two years, ResMed expended a lot of oxygen in court suing rival Respironics for patent infringements; judgments in 1997 and 1998 found in favor of Respironics, but ResMed made plans to appeal. In 1998 the firm received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval to market its VPAP device as a critical-care treatment for lung diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's listing was switched from Nasdaq to the NYSE in 1999 to stabilize stock prices after court losses against Respironics; it also listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The introduction of two new products, the AutoSet CPAP unit and the Mirage face mask, boosted sales that year. In 2001 ResMed bought MAP Medizin-Technologie, a German manufacturer of sleep-disordered breathing treatment devices. The acquisition enhanced ResMed's position in Germany, the company's second-biggest market for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 ResMed bought its Dutch distributor Resprecare and snapped up Scandinavian, German, and Austrian distributors the following year.
