   STAAR Surgical does what it can to help you to see more clearly. The company makes products for minimally invasive ophthalmic surgical procedures. Its primary products include Visian-branded implantable lenses (ICLs) for correcting such refractive conditions as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism. More than 500,000 of its ICLs have been implanted to date, with more than 75,000 being Visian Toric ICLs (approved in major global markets, except the US). STAAR also makes foldable intraocular lenses (IOLs) to replace natural lenses removed in cataract surgery. Its other products include AquaFlow implantable devices used to treat glaucoma. The company sells its products in about 60 countries.

  <p>
   STAAR also manufactures the raw materials for its ICLs and IOLs, as well as its AquaFlow devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   As of early 2015, the company had 67 domestic and foreign patents and another 21 patent applications pending. Its Japanese subsidiary owned some 50 active and pending patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   STAAR's revenues are derived entirely from its opthalmic surgical products. ICLs accounted for 59% of revenue in fiscal 2015 (ended January), while IOLs accounted for 32%.

  <p>
   STAAR manufactures its products in California (in Aliso Viejo and Monrovia); in mid-2014 the company moved its manufacturing capabilities in Switzerland and Japan to its Monrovia site. STAAR still operates administrative and distribution facilities in Switzerland and Japan.

  <p>
   The company sells through direct distribution channels in North America, Spain, and Japan (where it also sells through a local distributor); it sells through independent distributors elsewhere. South Korean distributor WooJeon Medical accounted for 9% of STAAR's sales during fiscal 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products are marketed to a variety of health care providers, including hospitals, managed care providers, surgical centers, HMOs, group purchasing organizations, and government agencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 the company spent $2.8 million on advertising, up from $2.1 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The company has seen revenue growth in the past five years. Revenue increased 4% to $75 million in fiscal 2015 (ended January) as sales of other products such as preloaded injector parts rose. IOL and ICL sales remained flat for the year. Net income has fluctuated in the past few years and it took a huge dip in 2015. That year STAAR fell in the red, reporting a net loss of $8 million; expenses related to research and development, increased headcount, and new product development led to the drop. Foreign currency transactions were also unfavorable that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   STAAR also reported an operating cash outflow of $8 million due to its net loss for the year as well as an increase in cash used in inventories.
  </p>

  <p>
   STAAR has been increasingly investing in research and development of new products and components. It intends to continue R&amp;D for improvements to its ICLs which could potentially simplify the surgical procedure and increase their efficacy. Other areas to focus on include the development of preloaded injector systems for its lenses and the development of presbyopia-correcting lenses. In fiscal 2015 the company spend $12.4 million on research and development, nearly double what it spent in 2014 ($6.7 million) and 2013 ($6.4 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company regularly introduces new products from its development pipeline. In 2013 it introduced the nanoFLEX Toric Collamer-branded IOL in certain countries, for example. The following year, it received European approval for its Visian ICL Preloaded System, technology which reduces the length of the surgical procedure and enables more consistent lens delivery.
