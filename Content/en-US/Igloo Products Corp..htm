   While actual Igloo dwellers aren't among the company's top customers, Igloo Products and its Playmate brand of ice chests and beverage dispensers enjoy a sizeable market. Igloo, the nation's top brand, manufactures insulated coolers for personal and industrial use and claims that nearly three in every four US households owns an Igloo cooler. The company's more than 500 products (including personal, beverage, and full-sized coolers) are sold worldwide through 15,000-plus outlets. Founded in 1947 as a maker of metal water coolers, the company's first all-plastic ice chest was introduced in 1962. After several ownership changes since 2000, Igloo Products is owned by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.

   Igloo has grown during the decades to rank as the world's top cooler maker.

   The consumer products company relies on more than 250 retailers globally to get its products in the hands of consumers. Retailers include the likes of

   ,
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart

   Igloo has focused on product development in recent years, significantly outpacing the number of its previous product rollouts. The company has also concentrated on making its factories more efficient, and boasts efficiencies of some 30%.
  </p>
        <p>
   The manufacturer formed Igloo Outdoors and has strategically entered new categories, such as tents, shelters, and chairs. The move pits Igloo's business directly against
   <company id="112748">
    Gander Mountain
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54866">
    Recreational Equipment Inc
   </company>
   . Such additions include Igloo's 2013 launch of its Super Tough and Super Tough STX lines with sportsman colors. Its Sportsman series, which also debuted in 2013, aims to directly compete with rotational molded coolers with its lower price point.
  </p>
        <p>
   But Igloo's core business of hard- and soft-sided coolers remains at the heart of its operation. In 2014, the company launched the Quantum series of hard-side coolers. Previous product introductions include its Yukon by Igloo, new versions of the Glide (a 110-quart wheeled cooler), and a collection of soft-sided DUO coolers. The DUO line and its 2013-launched FuelPacks comprise insulated lunch or school bags and tote bags. The move caters to the popularity of personal insulated coolers that are more fashion statement than practical. And as totes and reusable bags have replaced plastic bags in grocery stores and retailers, Igloo has worked to capture this niche of the market. To meet increased demand, Igloo in 2013 introduced a new line of insulated grocery totes under the Igloo Market name that are made partially of Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (RPET) in a variety of colors and patterns.
  </p>
        <p>
   Strategic agreements have also been key to Igloo's growth. The company inked a multiyear preferred vendor deal in 2014 with  Independent Boat Builders, making Igloo the supplier of choice for all coolers, their accessories, and other related items. It also entered a brand-licensing agreement with Taiwan's First Design Global (FDG), which gives FDG the merchandising and production rights to certain Igloo trademarks, logos, and brands in the housewares category.
