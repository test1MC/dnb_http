   NHK Spring is no spring chicken; the company has been manufacturing wire and fabricated metal products for more than seven decades. It operates through four divisions: suspension spring, seating, precision spring and components, and industrial machinery and equipment. Its lineup ranges from coils to stabilizer bars, automotive seating and suspension components, and accumulators. Other products include pipe supports, automatic parking systems used as an alternative to parking structures, and security magnetic card reader units. NHK Spring targets largely automotive, and to some extent data communications and industrial markets, and nets about 45% its sales abroad.

   In the fiscal 2014 (ended March), the company's revenue increased by 12% due to a rise in all the segments resulting from increased automobile production in Japan and overseas. The majority of the growth for 2014 was fueled by its automotive seating segment, which increased by 18%, followed by the automotive suspension springs segment, which surged by 17%.

   As part of its global expansion, NHK Spring has been opening new plants and facilities in select markets. In 2013 it set up a new subsidiary in Mexico for the manufacture and sale of automotive suspension springs, which supports growing demand in the Mexican markets. It also launched its Topura Fastener de Mexico S.A. de C.V. subsidiary within the same site for the manufacture and sale of springs and bolts, which began production in April 2015.
