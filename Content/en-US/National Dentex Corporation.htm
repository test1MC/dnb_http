   When your teeth need a little prosthetic work, National Dentex (NDX) has the tools for the job. The company designs and makes dental prosthetic devices. Its products fall into three categories: restorative (crowns and bridges), reconstructive (partial and full dentures), and cosmetic (porcelain veneers and ceramic crowns). Products are sold under the brand names NTI-tss Plus, e.max, PFZ, Lava, ClearFrame, and DuraFlex and are made from impressions, models, and X-rays submitted by dentists. As part of its operations, NDX serves more than  40,000 dentists across more than 40 dental laboratories in the US and Canada. The company is a subsidiary of dental supply firm Geodigm.

  <p>
   Each NDX dental lab operates under its own name and boasts a local sales staff. Labs offer a full range of custom-made dental prosthetic appliances, such as dentures, crowns, fixed bridges, and other dental specialties in their respective regional markets. Payroll and other administrative functions are handled at the corporate level.

  <p>
   While recent economic pressures have kept the company's acquisition strategy conservative -- as consumers cut back on non-essential medical and dental spending -- NDX typically grows by acquiring local laboratories and laboratory groups. It targets dental laboratories that log more than $3 million in annual sales and those that can be fully integrated into its operations. To this end, NDX in 2014 acquired Tri-County Dental Laboratory in Washington, folding the business into its Keller Laboratories operation. It also bought Nevada-based nSequence Center for Advanced Denistry, a full-service digital and conventional dental lab that specializes in computed-tomography guided surgery and guided prosthetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company strives to compete against large prosthetic labs by providing localized and tailored services at competitive prices. NDX uses its national scale to control expenses, while continuing to adopt new production methods and technologies. It also works to improve communication methods between dentists and labs.

  <p>
   NDX was taken private in 2010 after being acquired by dental and orthodontic firm Geodigm Corporation in a deal valued at about $100 million. While Geodigm is smaller than NDX, its holding company is part of the medical technology portfolio held by private equity investors
