   Russell in 2009 moved to its parent's headquarters in Kentucky, allowing Russell to share support functions, such as sales and marketing, at Fruit of the Loom's corporate office. As part of the transition, the company reduced its employee count and renamed itself Russell Brands, replacing Russell Corporation.

   Russell, acquired in 2006 for some $600 million, has been extending its reach and competing worldwide under the Fruit of the Loom umbrella. To leverage its ranking as the world's leading maker of basketballs, Russell's Spalding unit has been looking overseas for growth. Through a master licensing deal with
   <company id="41870">
    ITOCHU Corporation
   </company>
   's Itochu Fashion System Co., Russell has been developing the Spalding brand in Japan. Spalding also has a partnership with one of China's largest sports brands, Kangwei, to design, manufacture, and market athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories there. Kangwei operates the alliance with Spalding through a subsidiary, Guangzhou Ganwei Sports Goods Co. Ltd. As part of an agreement with
   <company id="124198">

   </company>
   , Russell supplies uniforms and apparel through 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep costs low and have control over most of the manufacturing process, Russell does its own spinning, knitting, cloth finishing, cutting, sewing, and packaging. For its North American business, the apparel company conducts its spinning and cloth-making at facilities in the US. Its sewing and finishing functions are completed in plants located in Central America and the Caribbean. Russell generally sources its athletic equipment and sporting goods from third-party contractors in Asia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After struggling as a lawyer in Birmingham, Alabama, Benjamin Russell was eager to open his own business back home in Alexander City, Alabama. In 1902 Russell bought eight knitting machines and 12 sewing machines and founded the Russell Manufacturing Company as a maker of women's clothing. By the end of the first year of production, the company was making about 150 items of clothing each day, but profits were disappointing.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Russell set about expanding the company to encompass all aspects of garment making, including the production of its own yarn and dyes, sales picked up. By 1932 Russell Manufacturing was one of the few totally vertical fabric companies of its size in the world. That year the company formed an athletic division by acquiring Southern Manufacturing Company, a maker of team apparel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Benjamin died in 1941, and son Benjamin C. Russell took over. When he died suddenly in 1945 from pneumonia, his brother Thomas D. Russell was left in charge of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two domestic recessions and a lack of consumer acceptance of leisure and sportswear in the 1950s hampered Russell Manufacturing's expansion. Nevertheless, the company opened its first outlet store in 1950, and 10 years later it was the nation's largest maker of athletic clothing. It changed its name to Russell Mills in 1962 and went public the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eugene Gwaltney took over as president of the company in 1968 and began expanding its plant operations. The company changed its name again in 1973 to Russell Corporation and benefited from the decade's trend toward leisure clothing. Gwaltney became chairman in 1982. The JERZEES brand of basic T-shirts and sportswear was introduced the next year. The 1989 acquisition of Cloathbond, a UK-based apparel manufacturer (later renamed Russell Corporation UK), brought the company into the global marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Russell introduced NuBlend, a poly-cotton fabric that helped it capture 30% of the fleece screen-printing market. The following year Russell became the official supplier of uniforms for Major League Baseball clubs, and it also retained exclusive rights to sell apparel using pro baseball team logos. The company's sales topped $1 billion for the first time in 1994. Two years later sales enjoyed a boost from the Olympics in Atlanta.
  </p>
  <p>
   Russell terminated licensing agreements with the professional football, basketball, and hockey leagues in 1997. Jack Ward, former CEO of Sara Lee's Hanes unit, became CEO in 1998. Russell soon announced a major restructuring that would cut jobs over the next three years, shutter almost a third of its facilities, and move production to areas outside the US where costs are lower. (Offshore production rose from 17% to 40% in 1998, then to 70% in 1999.)
  </p>
  <p>
   To be closer to its customers and improve recruiting, Russell in 1999 moved its executive offices to Atlanta. In 2000 the company bought casual athletic wear competitor DISCUS from Tultex and created the Mossy Oak Apparel Company (camouflage hunting clothes) through the acquisition of the apparel-making operations of outdoor clothing company Haas Outdoors. Russell later picked up A&amp;C International, a designer and distributor of casual shirts (Three Rivers, Camp Creek brands), to capitalize on the continued trend toward casual business attire.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of 2001 Russell wrapped up a massive three-year restructuring in which the company had closed nearly all of its retail outlets, moved most of its manufacturing offshore, and reduced its workforce by more than 6,000. The reorganization helped to shift the company's focus from manufacturing to marketing its core brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2002 Russell acquired Moving Comfort, a leading maker of women's activewear and in early 2003 it acquired the Jagged Edge trademark from
   <company id="99767">
    Jagged Edge Mountain Gear
   </company>
   . The company's purchase of SHC's non-golf assets included the Spalding and Dudley brand names and products, as well as the Sherrin brand of Australian football equipment. Inventory and more than 60 global licensing contracts were also included.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2003, as part of Russell's brand expansion, the company acquired the Bike Athletic Company (athletic supporters, protective equipment, and performance apparel), and in July it signed an exclusive licensing partnership with ESPN ABC Sports Customer Marketing and Sales for sponsorship of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).
  </p>
  <p>
   In October of the same year, the company realigned its businesses into two separate groups -- the Athletic Group, (consisting of Russell Athletic, Moving Comfort, Spalding, Mossy Oak Apparel, Bike, and the Women's organization), and the Activewear Group, consisting of JERZEES (mass retail market) and JERZEES, Cross Creek, Bike, and Three Rivers (artwear market). The move helped restructure marketing and manufacturing operations for the brands. Construction of a new textile manufacturing facility for the Activewear Group in Choloma, Honduras, was also part of the realignment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2004 the company purchased American Athletic, Inc. (AAI) for about $13 million. Founded in 1954, AAI makes basketball, baseball, volleyball, gymnastics, and cheerleading equipment for high schools, colleges, and professional teams under the brands BPI and American Athletic. The same year Russell purchased bike maker
   <company id="10754">
    Huffy
   </company>
   's sports division, which makes basketball backboard systems and related products, for about $30 million. AAI and Huffy were folded into Russell's Spalding operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Getting a foothold in footwear, Russell acquired performance athletic footwear and apparel maker
   <company id="60704">
    Brooks Sports
   </company>
   in December 2004 for about $115 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2005 Russell eliminated the positions of president and COO from its organizational structure to create a direct line of communication and accountability from the chairman and CEO to Russell's business units.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2006 Russell was acquired by Fruit of the Loom, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, for about $600 million. As a result, Russell's stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   As manufacturers and retailers braced themselves in 2009 for another recession, Russell finally left Atlanta to move in with its parent in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and renamed itself Russell Brands, LLC.
