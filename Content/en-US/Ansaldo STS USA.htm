  <p>
   Legendary American engineer George Westinghouse founded Union Switch &amp; Signal in 1881, to consolidate the assets of companies engaged in pioneering closed track circuits and interlockings. An independent company until 1917, it then became a subsidiary of
   <company id="43798">
    Westinghouse Air Brake
   </company>
   . In 1968, American Standard (now
   <company id="40026">
    Trane Inc.
   </company>
   ) acquired Union Switch &amp; Signal. Ansaldo purchased the company in 1988 and later changed its name.
