   Cellular Dynamics is breaking new ground in medical research. The company develops and makes fully functioning human cells used for
   <em>
    in vitro
   </em>
   experiments. Its stem cells come from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are taken from blood or skin samples. (iPSCs can replicate and turn into any cell type in the human body.) Its products are used for drug discovery and screening, testing the efficacy of drug candidates, for stem cell banking, and in researching cellular therapeutics. Customers include biotech companies, research institutions, and stem cell banks. Cellular Dynamics went public in 2013; it was acquired in mid-2015 by
   <company id="41760">
    FUJIFILM
   </company>
   for some $307 million.

  <p>
   Cellular Dynamics raised $46 million in its 2013 IPO; those funds were allotted towards R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and building a lab.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is an attractive buy for FUJIFILM -- which is focusing heavily on health care as a key growth area -- as it will gain entry into the area of iPSCs; Cellular Dynamics will benefit from its new parent's expertise in material science, engineering, and management systems.
