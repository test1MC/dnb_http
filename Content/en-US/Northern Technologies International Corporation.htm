   Most of the company's sales come from ZERUST, but the company has expanded its product mix. Its new product development focus is on biodegradable polymer resins, which it sells under its Natur-Tec brand. The company is hoping to tap into a growing market emerging as a result of lower petroleum prices and increased interest in environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Natur-Tec resins are manufactured out of combination of biodegradable polymers and organic materials. Specific products include compost and trash bags, agricultural films, and various consumer goods packaging.

  <p>
   NTIC achieved unprecedented growth in 2015, posting record-setting revenues of $30 million that year. ZERUST segment net sales increased by 9% in 2015, mainly due to increased demand for its products and services from existing customers and new customers as a result of its marketing effort in the oil and gas sector.
  </p>
  <p>
   Natur-Tec segment sales also spiked by 44% in 2015, mainly due to higher finished product sales in North America and finished product sales through Natur-Tec India, as a result of market penetration and the reach of its distribution network.

  <p>
   The company is focused on growth in India on the heels of higher sales from its Natur-Tec India subsidiary in 2015. Pursuant to this, in 2016 the company plans to target and convert additional manufacturers to the use of Natur-Tec sustainable packaging products and services.
