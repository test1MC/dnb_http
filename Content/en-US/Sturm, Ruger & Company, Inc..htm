  <p>
   Ruger manufactures all of its rifles and revolvers in Newport, New Hampshire and Mayodan, North Carolina. All pistols (except for one model) are produced in Prescott, Arizona.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also makes castings and metal injection molding components for its use and to sell to other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rifles accounted for about 38% of revenue with pistols accounting for 35%, revolvers, 20%, accessories, 6%, and castings, 1%. New products (those introduced in the past two years) generated 21% of firearms sales in 2015, compared to about $89 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company was founded in 1949 by William Ruger, who designed a notable machine gun used by the military during WWII, and Alexander Sturm, who backed the production of a new Ruger design by investing $50,000. Sturm died of hepatitis in 1951 at age 28 and after a battle with Sturm's family, Ruger took control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The gun maker's growth during the 1960s and 1970s was driven by demand for single-action revolvers and .22-caliber autoloading pistols produced at its original plant in Southport, Connecticut. Ruger went public in 1969, still the only American gun company to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 the company forced its distributors to choose between it and archrival Smith &amp; Wesson; about half chose to stay with Ruger. By streamlining its distribution channels, the manufacturer made its products more difficult to find, thus increasing their prestige.
  </p>
  <p>
   Decreasing firearms sales prompted the company to expand its castings operations. Ruger bought Callaway Golf's share in their joint foundry to become its sole owner in 1997. In 1998 Ruger unveiled its first muzzleloader, the Ruger 77/50, to capitalize on the growing popularity of muzzleloading rifles. Later that year New Orleans became the first municipality to sue gun makers, including Ruger, in an effort to recover the cost of gun violence. Other local governments followed suit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company sent letters to gun distributors asking that its guns be sold at regular places of business, not trade shows. In 2001, the Louisiana Supreme Court threw out New Orleans' suit, but remained a defendant in some 37 lawsuits at the end of 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Co-founder William Ruger died in July 2002. In early 2003, after 2 years of pretrial discovery, the consolidated California cities suit against almost all firearms manufacturers (including Ruger) was dismissed.
