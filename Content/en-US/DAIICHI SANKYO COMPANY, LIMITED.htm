   Daiichi Sankyo invests in growth efforts in its core markets of Japan, the US, Europe, as well as emerging markets. Its acquisition strategy includes buying new products and drug candidates in addition to promising companies that have the potential to boost its existing portfolio. The company also partners with other pharmaceuticals to commercialize various products. For example, in 2015, it entered a co-commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca for MOVANTIK in the US.

   Daiichi Sankyo was formed when
   <company id="56038">
    Sankyo
   </company>
   purchased rival
   <company id="59671">
    Daiichi Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   for more than $7 billion in 2005. The two companies merged their operations into the newly formed Daiichi Sankyo, creating a top pharmaceutical manufacturer in Japan. Since the merger, the company has focused primarily on prescription and consumer drugs and has been exiting its chemical and animal health operations.
