  <p>
   Constellation Brands reports its business in three main segments: Beer, Wine, and Spirits. The beer segment has an exclusive license to import and sell Grupo Modelo's Corona, Modelo, and other brands while wine and spirits covers a wide range of wine types, brands, and price points.
  </p>
  <p>
   Constellation Brands generated 55% of its total revenue from Beer sales in fiscal 2016 (ended February), while Wine and Spirit sales contributed 40% and 5% to total revenue for the year, respectively.

   New York-based Constellation Brands sells its products in roughly 100 countries. It gets about 90% of its sales from the US, while most of the rest comes from Canada. The company is also a leading wine company in New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company agreed to sell its Canadian wine business, which holds the largest share of the wine market in Canada, to
   <company id="130523">
    Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan
   </company>
   for C$1.03 billion. The sale is expected to close by the end of the year.

  <p>
   Constellation Brands staffs in-house marketing, sales, and customer service teams to increase its sales. These teams deploy a variety of marketing strategies, conducting market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions, and public relations activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its advertising expenses for 2016 (ended February), 2015, and 2014 were $468.3 million, $406.1 million, and $278.5 million, respectively.

  <p>
   Constellation posted record-setting revenues of $6.6 billion in 2016 mainly due to increased Beer sales driven by volume growth within its Mexican beer portfolio. Wine and Spirits sales also increased largely due to additional branded wine sales inherited from its acquisition of Meiomi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Constellation's profits also climbed 26% from $839 million in 2015 to more than $1 billion in 2016. Its cash from operations rose by 31% from $1 billion to $1.3 billion during that same time period.

  <p>
   Constellation reiterated in 2015 that its long-term growth strategy involved: increasing its mix of premium brands (especially in the Wine and Spirits segment) through acquisitions, improving profit margins, expanding the distribution of its key brands, and creating operating efficiencies to boost profits. In 2016 the company acquired wine-maker Prisoner for approximately $285 million. The acquisition, which included a portfolio of five fast-growing, super-luxury wine brands, aligned with its strategy to build its premium brand portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired Meiomi, which primarily included the the Meiomi trademark, related inventories, and certain grape supply contracts. The acquisition complemented its existing portfolio and further strengthened its position in the US pinot noir category. In late 2015, Constellation picked up Ballast Point for $999 million. The transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, and property, and it provided it with a high-growth premium platform enabling it to compete in the fast-growing craft beer category, further strengthening its position in the high-end US beer market.

  <p>
   Marvin Sands, the son of winemaker Mordecai (Mack) Sands, exited the Navy in 1945 and entered distilling by purchasing an old sauerkraut factory in Canandaigua, New York. His business, Canandaigua Industries, struggled while making fruit wines in bulk for local bottlers in the East. Aiming at regional markets, the company began producing its own brands two years later. Marvin opened the Richards Wine Cellar in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1951 and put his father in charge of the unit. In 1954 Marvin developed his own brand of "fortified" wine -- boosted by 190-proof brandy -- and named it Richards Wild Irish Rose after his son Richard.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company slowly expanded, buying a number of small wineries in the 1960s and 1970s. It went public in 1973, changing its name to Canandaigua Wine. A year later the company expanded to the West Coast, thus gaining access to the growing varietal market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Canandaigua continued to grow through acquisitions and new product introductions in the early 1980s. In 1984, when wine coolers became popular, the company introduced Sun Country Coolers, doubling sales to $173 million by 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   The short-lived wine cooler fad made Canandaigua realize that its distribution network could handle more volume, so it began looking for additional brands. After a flurry of acquisitions in the late 80s and 90s, the company changed its name in 1997 to Canandaigua Brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Marvin Sands died in 1999. His son, Richard, who had been CEO since 1993, succeeded his father as chairman. In 2000 the firm changed its name to Constellation Brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2013, Constellation Brands completed its acquisition of
   <company id="52130">
    Grupo Modelo
   </company>
   's US beer business from
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   for approximately $5.23 billion. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC, which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the US commercial business; a state-of-the-art brewery in Nava (Piedras Negras), Mexico; and an exclusive perpetual brand license in the US to import, market, and sell Corona and the Modelo brands. The deal gave Constellation ownership of six of the top 20 imported beer brands in the US.
