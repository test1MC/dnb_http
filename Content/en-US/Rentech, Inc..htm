   Rentech owns and operates wood fiber processing and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses. It also owns the intellectual property including patents, pilot, and demonstration data, and engineering designs for a number of clean energy technologies designed to produce certified synthetic fuels and renewable power when integrated with third-party technologies. Originally a clean energy business that rented (licensed) its alternative energy technology (hence "rent-tech"), the company now gets most of its revenues from its fertilizers and wood fiber processing operations.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Rentech generated 94% of its 2013 revenues from the US.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company operates in five business segments: East Dubuque, Pasadena, Fulghum Fibre, Wood Pellets, and Energy Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   East Dubuque produces ammonia and UAN. Pasadena produces ammonium sulfate. Fulghum Fibre provides wood fiber processing services and wood yard operations, sells wood chips to the pulp, paper and packaging industry, and owns and manages forestland and sells bark to industrial consumers in South America. The Wood Pellets segment includes wood pellet projects owned by the company(the Atikokan and Wawa Projects), its stake in the Rentech/Graanul JV and wood pellet development costs. The Energy technologies segment owns technologies designed to convert low value, carbon bearing solids or gases into valuable hydrocarbons and electric power by incorporating third party technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The wood fiber processing business provides wood chipping services and the manufacture and sale of wood chips (through Fulghum Fibres), and the development of wood pellet production facilities. Rentech's nitrogen fertilizer business consists of the manufacture and sale of nitrogen fertilizer through its 60%-owned publicly-traded subsidiary, Rentech Nitrogen Partners, L.P.
  </p>

  <p>
   Rentech's revenues increased by 43% in 2013 thanks to higher sales from the Pasadena segment (due to having a full year of ownership of the Pasadena facility) and Energy Technologies segment; partially offset by decreased revenued from the East Dubuque segment, which saw lower ammonia and UAN sales volumes and sales prices. The decrease in sales prices for UAN was due largely to weather factors decreasing demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has seen growth in revenues since 2010, primarily due increased volume and the expansion of its business via acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rentech incurred a net loss of $2 million in 2013 (compared to a loss of $14 million in 2012) thanks to higher revenues and a deferred income tax benefit related to the Fulghum acquisition. This was partially offset by the increased goodwill impairment charges related to the Agrifos acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's cash flow from operating activities decreased by $58 million in 2013, due to increased Agrifos goodwill impairment charges; offset by deferred income tax benefit of $27.1 million, due primarily to the release of valuation allowance resulting from recording of deferred tax liabilities related to the Fulghum acquisition.

  <p>
   Rentech plans to grow by expanding its nitrogen and wood chipping businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to dispose of its non-core alternative energy related assets, in 2014, Rentech agreed to sell its alternative energy technologies and decommissioned Product Demonstration Unit, in Commerce City, Colorado to Sunshine Kaidi New Energy Group Co., Ltd.,.for an initial cash payment to Rentech of $15 million, and the possibility of a success payment of up to $16 million. In 2013 Rentech sold about 450 acres in Natchez, Mississippi to Adams County, Mississippi for proceeds of approximately $9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beefing up its fertilizer business, in 2014, Rentech replaced a compressor train in one of its nitric acid plants at the East Dubuque Facility, which is expected to increase nitric acid production at the facility by 30 tons per day or 11,000 tons annually and decrease electric power usage. In 2013 it boosted its ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project at this plant. The $95.8 million ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project increased the facility's ammonia production capacity by approximately 23%, or 190 tons per day, and on-site ammonia storage capacity by approximately 20,000 tons.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Rentech completed an $8 million debottlenecking project at its Pasadena Facility, and made process improvements during a 23-day turnaround of the ammonium sulfate plant at the facility. Following this, the ammonium sulfate production capacity at the facility increased by approximately 20%, from 1,750 tons per day to 2,100 tons per day.

  <p>
   In an effort to expand its business, and to enter into the wood chipping business, in 2013 Rentech laid out $64 million to acquire Georgia-based Fulghum Fibres, Inc. and two facilities for conversion to the production of wood pellets in Ontario, Canada, along with contracts for the sale and transport of more than 4 million metric tons of wood pellets over ten years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, Rentech acquired Agrifos LLC, a producer of synthetic granulated ammonium sulfate fertilizer in North America for $136 million.
