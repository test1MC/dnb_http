   Chiesi USA (formerly Cornerstone Therapeutics) wants to help clear things up for the asthmatic, the inflamed, and the heart patient. The drug company is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products to treat acute inflammation and other respiratory ailments, as well as cardiovascular conditions. Its marketed products include CUROSURF, which is used to treat premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, and asthma treatment ZYFLO. Its heart medicines include CARDENE and RETAVASE. It is also developing generic drugs through its Aristos Pharmaceuticals subsidiary. The company was acquired in full by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. in 2014.

   The company's major customers in 2011 included
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   (39% of total revenues),
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson

  <p>
   In 2011 Cornerstone Therapeutics' revenues decreased by 19% due to a drop in product sales and license and royalty agreement revenues. The decline in product sales was due to the slump in ALLERX Dose Pack net product sales caused by an adverse ruling by the FDA, which caused a decline in prescriptions. Other factors included lower net prices and lower unit volume of its HYOMAX line, and the withdrawal from the market of its propoxyphene/acetaminophen products in late 2010. License and royalty agreement revenues decreased $1.5 million, or 92%, primarily due to the one-time, upfront nonrefundable payment of $1.5 million the company received in August 2010 in accordance with its license agreement with Targacept, Inc., under which the company out-licensed certain rights with respect to its alpha-7 receptor technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornerstone Therapeutics' revenues net income decreased by 111% in 2011 due to a major decline in revenues from operations offset by a decrease in total cost and expenses.

  <p>
   During 2009, 2010, and 2011 the company pulled several of its generic products off of the market after receiving
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   notifications that the drugs were not properly approved. It withdrew several drugs containing propoxyphene, as well as some branded products which were caught in the FDA's 2009 market sweep that removed scores of products featuring older drugs in formulations that had never been through clinical trials. In 2012 Cornerstone Therapeutics was forced to pull its popular ALLERX line after it was caught up the FDA market sweep of unapproved prescription cough, cold, and allegy products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To replace the drugs it pulled, the company is busily shepherding a handful of respiratory drug candidates through preclinical development, and building up a strong sales force to promote its fully approved drugs. Cornerstone Therapeutics' sales force targets physicians who treat respiratory diseases, and hospitals with neonatal intensive care units that could stock CUROSURF. The company relies up on third parties to manufacture its marketed products and products in clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cornerstone also worked to expand its hospital offerings, especially in the area of cardiovascular care, and in 2012 it moved towards this goal through the acquisition of drug development firm Cardiokine. The purchase added a late-stage development candidate for the treatment of hyponatremia, a metabolic condition associated with hospitalized heart failure patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquired privately held specialty pharmaceutical firm EKR Therapeutics for $125 million in cash plus up to $25 million in milestone payments over three years. The purchase added cardiovascular drugs CARDENE I.V. (indicated for short-term treatment of hypertension) and RETAVASE (indicated for improving ventricular function following acute myocardial infarction) to its hospital products portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   To emphasize its focus on hospital products and respiratory and other specialty offerings, Cornerstone Therapeutics sold its anti-infectives, antibiotics FACTIVE and SPECTRACEF, to drugmakers Merus Labs and Vansen Pharma through a series of transactions in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has built up its respiratory and inflammation product lines through a series of earlier acquisitions and licensing agreements. In 2009 the company acquired worldwide rights from
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for ZYFLO, an immediate-release zileuton that has FDA approval to treat chronic asthma. ZYFLO CR, which is marketed through the firm's direct sales force, has become a major seller.

   Cornerstone Therapeutics was formed by the 2008 merger of Critical Therapeutics and privately held respiratory therapy firm Cornerstone BioPharma. It then struck a $70 million strategic agreement with Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. in 2009. The Italian firm gained a 51% share in Cornerstone, while Cornerstone received the rights to market Chiesi's CUROSURF, in the US market. The deal strengthened Cornerstone's finances, as well as broadened its product offerings and customer segments. In 2014 the parent company acquired the remaining shares of Cornerstone Therapeutics and changed the latter's name to Chiesi USA.
