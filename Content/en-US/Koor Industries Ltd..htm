   Once a socialist vision, now a model of capitalism, Koor Industries is Israel's leading holding company. Koor's core businesses include its holdings in agrochemicals (

   ), telecommunications equipment (Microwave Networks and Telrad Networks), and finance (a small stake in

   ). The company's venture capital arm has invested in telecom, semiconductor, and software companies. Koor Industries also has operations in tourism, real estate, and trade.

  <p>
   Koor Industries is an offshoot of Solel Boneh, a construction company formed in 1924 in British Palestine by the Histadrut Labour Federation. Solel Boneh founded Koor in 1944 to build factories to provide employment for Jewish refugees arriving during WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   An Arab attack quickly followed Israel's creation in 1948. Israel prevailed, but the threat of future conflicts spurred development of its defense industry. In 1952 Koor teamed with a Finnish firm to create Soltam, an Israeli artillery manufacturer. The previous year, it had diversified into telecommunications equipment with Telrad.
  </p>
  <p>
   Koor continued to expand and diversify through joint ventures, creating a steel company in 1954 and Alliance Tire &amp; Rubber in 1955 (it bought full control of Alliance in 1983). Koor and the Israeli government founded Tadiran (defense electronics, 1962), and Koor acquired chemical maker Makhteshim (1963) and food processor Hamashbir Lata (1970). The Sinai campaign (1956), Six-Day War (1967), and Yom Kippur War (1973) continued to spur Israeli defense spending. However, with Histadrut's emphasis on socialist aims, Koor never became very profitable. Successful subsidiaries were offset by money-losers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was hurt in the 1980s by a government program that cut subsidies and lowered trade barriers. Inflation damaged Koor's global competitiveness. With the help of junk bond guru Michael Milken, Koor raised $105 million in a 1986 debt issue. That year, however, Koor posted its first loss in 20 years, and losses widened in 1987. Benjamin Gaon became CEO in 1988 and began restructuring the heavily indebted company, which by then had about 130 units. He kept closing plants, but the company incurred a loss in 1988 and a record $369 million deficit in 1989. Gaon negotiated a new arrangement with creditors in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1992 Gaon's cost cutting had begun to pay off, and the company returned to profitability. Histadrut sold out in 1995, severing a link to Koor's socialist past. That year the company raised nearly $120 million in an international IPO, and Northern Telecom (now Nortel Networks) acquired 20% of Telrad (sold back to Koor in 2000).
  </p>
  <p>
   Koor continued divesting assets to focus on its core businesses. ITT Sheraton International took a 50% stake in Koor Tourism in a 1996 alliance to manage hotels in Israel, and Henkel bought 50% of Koor's detergent operations. Discontinued operations included Beep-A-Call (wireless paging, 1995), Gamda Trade (food retail, 1996), and TAMI (food industry, 1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Gaon sowed the seeds for his departure by selling a controlling stake in Koor to the Shamrock Group, a Disney family investment firm. Disagreements with Gaon over Koor's strategy led Shamrock to sell its stake in 1997 to Claridge Israel, an investment fund controlled by Canadian billionaire Charles Bronfman. Jonathan Kolber, then CEO of Claridge Israel, replaced Gaon in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kolber made plans to increase exports and focus on Koor's telecom equipment, defense electronics, and agrochemicals segments, while scaling back in construction materials. In 1998 Koor bought a stake in Israel's ECI Telecom, which merged with Tadiran Telecom in 1999. Koor also dumped several noncore assets (including cable TV, energy, and software services units), raising more than $360 million. It then sold its 50% stake in cement group Mashav.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Koor and Nortel Networks launched Nortel Networks Israel to deliver high-performance Internet products to carrier and enterprise customers. The restructuring of the Elisra Group (formerly the Elisra-Tadiran Group) was completed in 2001. The next year Koor sold a 30% stake in Elisra Electronics Systems to government-owned Israel Aircraft Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reorganized the operations of ECI Telecom in part by divesting its wireless networking equipment unit in 2002 so that ECI could focus more closely on core wireline products. In 2003 Nortel took over Koor Industries' 28% stake in Nortel Networks Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a long-term strategy, the company sold its 32% stake in military communications systems manufacturer Tadiran Communications to shareholders of Israeli international defense electronics company Elbit Systems in 2005. Elbit Systems also acquired Koor's stake in Elisra Electronic Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Claridge Israel, a unit of Canadian billionaire Charles Bronfman's investment firm, owned 30% of the group before selling its stake to DIC in mid-2006. Earlier in the year DIC had agreed to buy 35% of Koor Industries from the Bronfman family and chairman Jonathan Kolber (whose entire stake was sold at the end of 2006). IDB had already owned 10% of the company, so this purchase gave it a 45% stake in Koor.
