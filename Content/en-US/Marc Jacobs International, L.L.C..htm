   Marc Jacobs has built an empire on fashion that keeps the world waiting in awe of what the designer will show next. Marc Jacobs International is a renown design house that creates men's and women's apparel collections (under the Marc Jacobs Collection and Marc by Marc Jacobs names) and a children's line under the Little Marc label, as well as footwear, handbags, sunglasses, timepieces, and fragrances. The company operates more than 250 stores internationally and sells through high-end department and specialty retailers. It was founded by Marc Jacobs and business partner Robert Duffy (president) in the 1980s. The company is part of the stable of brands held by French luxury firm

   , which owns a 96% stake.

   Marc Jacobs has a truly global presence in more than 50 countries. It intends to continue to grow by expanding its store network. The company now has flagship stores in Hong Kong and Tokyo, along with a handful of Marc Jacobs Collection boutiques in Bahrain, Brazil, Italy, France, Hong Kong, South Korea, and the UK.

   The Marc by Marc Jacobs chain, whose stores spotlight younger and cheaper ready-to-wear apparel, has spread, too, with more than 30 new shops in such markets as Guam, Hawaii, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and Taiwan. Its fastest-growing market, however, is mainland China.

  <p>
   Marc Jacobs constantly rolls out new designs and new products. It launched a swimsuit line and a new men's fragrance in recent years. The company has benefited from demand for accessories under both its Collection and Marc by Marc Jacob lines.
