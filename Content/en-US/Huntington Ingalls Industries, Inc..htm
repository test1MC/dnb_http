   For 40 years Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) has been the sole builder of the
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   's nuclear aircraft carriers. Rivaling nuclear submarine builder
   <company id="10633">
    General Dynamics
   </company>
   , HII is the largest naval shipbuilder in the world; it also maintains, refuels, and repairs nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines. In addition, HII supplies expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants, submarines, commercial oil hull tankers, and
   <company id="150268">
    Coast Guard
   </company>
   surface ships, as well as provides aftermarket fleet support. Almost off its offerings are sold to the US government.

  <p>
   The company's principal properties are located in San Diego; Broomfield, Colorado; Avondale (New Orleans), Louisiana; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Houston; Hampton, Newport News, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Washington, DC. Some of the properties comprising its Other segment reside in Waggaman, Louisiana; Calgary, Aberdeen, Scotland; and San Juan, Trinidad; and Tobago.

  <p>
   The shipbuilder divides its work between a few divisions: Newport News (nuclear-powered submarines; 67% of net sales), Ingalls (warship production for the US Navy; 31%), and Other (2%). In addition, subsidiary
   <company id="113476">
    AMSEC
   </company>
   offers a wide variety of naval architecture and marine engineering services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its carrier
   <em>
    Gerald R. Ford
   </em>
   (CVN 78) is the first ship of its class and is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in 2016. Its last-of-the-
   <em>
    Nimitz
   </em>
   -class predecessor, the
   <em>
    USS George H.W. Bush
   </em>
   , was commissioned in early 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the US Navy, for which it has built 70% of the current surface combatant fleet, HII serves the
   <company id="123628">
    US Coast Guard
   </company>
   (7% of total sales) and navies from other countries. It also provides fleet repair, maintenance, and technology upgrade services to companies in the energy and petrochemical industries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   HII has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues climbing 1% from $6.96 billion in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $7.02 billion in 2015. Profits also surged 20% from $338 million to $404 million, another company milestone, during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was attributed to a 4% rise in Newport News sales and an 9% spike in service revenues. This was driven by higher sales volumes in energy programs and submarines coupled with additional revenue from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The surge in profits for 2015 was fueled by a decline in general and administrative expenses. HII's operating cash flow also increased from $716 million in 2014 to $828 million in 2015.

   HII is currently constructing its DDG-113
   <em>
    John Finn
   </em>
   and DDG-114
   <em>
    Ralph Johnson
   </em>
   ships, scheduled for delivery in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2013 the company was awarded a multi-year contract totaling $3.3 billion for the construction of five additional DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers as a part of a larger US Navy order for nine DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.

  <p>
   HII often uses acquisitions in order to bolster its core offerings. In mid-2015, HII acquired the engineering solutions division of The Columbia Group in a deal that enabled it to compete more strongly in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it acquired The S.M. Stoller Corp., a provider of technical, environmental, ecological, waste management, remediation, and consultation services to private sector companies and the US government. The deal positioned its Newport News segment for expanded growth within the Department of Energy, environmental management, and commercial nuclear services markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, HII purchased Houston-based UniversalPegasus International Holdings (UPI), a provider of engineering and project management services to the domestic and international energy markets.
