   Contrary to the proverb, Columbia Forest Products can see the forest for the trees. The company has become North America's biggest producer of plywood and veneer made from hardwood, such as oak, ash, birch, maple, hickory, and pine. Its plywood panels and decorative veneers are hammered into fine cabinets and furniture, commercial fixtures, architectural millwork, and other carpentry for homes and commercial buildings. The company also imports hardwood plywood from Asia, Africa, Russia, and South America. Columbia's lineup is sold through OEMs, wholesale distributors, and mass merchandisers. Founded in 1957, the employee-owned company has grown to a dozen plants located in forest regions of the US and Canada.

   As North America's largest maker of decorative hardwood plywood and veneers, Columbia Forest Products boasts about a dozen manufacturing locations across the US and Canada. From Asia, Russia, Africa, and South America, the company imports hardwood plywood.

        <p>
   Columbia's operations consist of three business units: plywood, veneer, and imports. Most of the company's North American plants specialize in manufacturing hardwood plywood, with three plants dedicated to hardwood veneer, and one plant producing hardwood logs.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its hardwood plywood plants are located in Oregon, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Arkansas, as well as Ontario and Quebec. Columbia's hardwood veneer facilities span Wisconsin, Vermont, and Maine. Its sole hardwood logs plant is in Ohio.

   Looking to better serve fabricators, Columbia division CFP Components acquired Cabinotch in late 2012. The company markets a patent-pending interlocking side panel-to-face frame joint that aims to help cabinet shops reduce costs and improve productivity. With Cabinotch in its products portfolio, Columbia and CFP offer a set of custom-sized American Hardwood parts, from the face frame through the sides, backs, bottoms, tops and shelves.

   Strategically, Columbia was ahead of the curve in 2005 when it phased out potentially toxic formaldehyde adhesives in its plywood manufacturing processes. (A law limiting the amount of formaldehyde in wood was passed in 2010.) The company's glues, called PureBond, are based on a nontoxic soy-based adhesive. Columbia partners with GreenWood Tree Farm Fund to create core veneers from hybrid poplar logs for use in Columbia's formaldehyde-free hardwood plywood. Another partnership is held with

    Weyerhaeuser
   </company>
   to offer Lyptus hardwood, another non-toxic product. Columbia continues its commitment to environmental sustainability and safety.
