   Panel discussions are welcomed by Nanosolar, which makes solar panels using high-throughput CIGS (copper, indium, gallium, and selenium) thin-film process technology. The company's design and engineering capabilities yield solar cells that can be as efficient and last as long as conventional silicon solar cells. The key part of the company's technology is that it can "print" (coat with a chemical solution) the most expensive layers of a solar cell. Founded in 2002, Nanosolar has received financial backing from the likes of

   Nanosolar's headquarters and solar cell manufacturing operations are based in San Jose, California. It also has an automated panel assembly facility located outside Berlin.

   The company debuted its Nanosolar Utility Panel in 2009. The thin-film panel was the industry's first solar electricity panel to be used in a utility-scale solar power system setting. The product can handle voltage 50% higher than previously certified systems, and its dual-tempered glass is stronger than conventional thin-film-on-glass panels.

   Nanosolar is looking to reduce its own production costs as it ramps up volume. Once it reaches full capacity at its San Jose, California, location, which produces solar cells that are sent to Germany to be made into utility-grade panels, the company expects its costs to be lower than those made with crystalline silicon cells. Nanosolar then plans to double its capacity with new plants, but will have to raise additional financing to expand. The company's goal is to have costs below $.60 a watt by the end of 2013, comparable to other thin-film solar manufacturers.

   The company has had a long list of investors, and it has raised a total of nearly $500 million in funding. Investors have grown wary of the US solar industry, however, which is competing with a new crop of low-cost Chinese solar panel makers --

   among them. Heavily subsidized by their government and with vast economies of scale, they have sent solar panel prices plunging and grabbed market share far faster than many anticipated. It is estimated that Chinese solar panel makers supply around 40% of the California market and most of the European market.

   In 2012 Nanosolar raised $70 million in new capital. It is using the money to expand its production of thin film solar cells and panels, support research and development designed to deliver more efficiency, and drive faster commercialization of its solar technology.
