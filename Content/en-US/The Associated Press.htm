   This just in: The Associated Press (AP) is reporting tonight and every night wherever news is breaking. AP is one of the world's largest news gathering organizations, with news bureaus in about 100 countries. It provides news, photos, graphics, and audiovisual services that reach people daily through print, radio, TV, and the Web. It also offers advertising management and distribution services. The not-for-profit cooperative is owned by 1,500 US daily newspaper members. A group of New York newspapers founded the AP in 1846 in order to chronicle the US-Mexican War more efficiently. Founding papers include
   <em>
    The New York Sun
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The Journal of Commerce
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The Courier and Enquirer
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The New York Herald
   </em>
   , and
   <em>

  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, the AP's total annual revenue increased by 1% to $604 million, compared to $595 million in fiscal 2013. The company's net income increased dramatically to $140 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $3.26 million in fiscal 2013, mainly due to increased gross revenue and interest income.

   In recent years the AP has shifted its focus away from providing content to newspapers and towards serving online media sources; some of the company's biggest customers now include media outlets such as
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="139296">
    MSN
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo!
   </company>
   . It has also focused on developing AP Direct, its live video news agency service. It sells its back catalog of video through AP Video Archives.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cope with the decline in print readership, the news co-op is continuing to invest in digital initiatives. It is currently undergoing a multimillion-dollar upgrade of its newsgathering infrastructure to increase its video coverage of global events. It is also pushing to increase its high definition footage to broadcast and digital markets, and ensure that its video and images integrate seamlessly with new digital workflows to drive value for customers.

  <p>
   The Associated Press traces its roots to 1846, when
   <em>
    New York Sun
   </em>
   publisher Moses Yale Beach agreed to share news arriving by telegraph about the Mexican-American War with four other New York newspapers. The cooperative news gathering effort was later established as the AP, which began selling wire reports to other papers and started creating regional associations. Adapting to changing technologies and public interests, AP began covering sports, financial, and public interest stories in the 1920s and was selling news reports to radio stations in the 1940s. Advancements during WWII included using transatlantic cable and radio-teletype circuits to deliver news and photos.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1960s AP and
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   introduced services to improve business and financial reporting. AP improved photo delivery, reception, and storage in the 1970s with the advent of Laserphoto and the Electronic Darkroom. It began transmitting news by satellite and offering color photographs to newspapers in the 1980s. In 1985 Louis Boccardi took over the job as president and CEO of AP.
  </p>
  <p>
   AP adjusted to the media-heavy culture of the 1990s by launching the APTV international news video service and the All News Radio network in 1994. It then moved onto the Internet with The WIRE in 1996 and began offering online access to its Photo Archive in 1997. It bought Worldwide Television News in 1998, combining it with APTV to form
   <company id=" 139499">
    AP Television News Limited
   </company>
   (APTN). The following year it purchased the radio news contracts of
   <company id="47948">
    UPI
   </company>
   after the rival organization announced it was getting out of broadcast news.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 AP created an Internet division, AP Digital, to focus on marketing news to online providers. The cooperative continued its Internet focus the following year, launching AP Online en Espa√±ol (news for Spanish-language websites) and AP Entertainment Online (multimedia entertainment news for websites). Also that year AP bought the Newspaper Industry Communication Center from the
   <company id="125316">
    Newspaper Association of America
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company launched an expanded editorial partnership with Dow Jones Newswires, increasing the amount of financial news distributed on AP wires. Later that year it acquired Capitolwire, a provider of state government news. Boccardi stepped down as CEO in 2003, handing the reins to former
   <em>
    USA TODAY
   </em>
   publisher Tom Curley.
  </p>
  <p>
   AP relocated in 2004 from Rockefeller Plaza (its home for 65 years) to a new headquarters on the west side of Manhattan that features a 105,000-sq.-ft. newsroom and serves as a central hub of digital news streams.
  </p>
  <p>
   The organization moved to strengthen its sports information coverage in 2005, merging its AP MegaSports operation with
   <company id="41816">
    News Corporation
   </company>
   's STATS, Inc. to form
   <company id="105772">
    STATS, LLC
   </company>
   , a 50-50 joint venture that provides sports-related information, content, and statistical analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year AP launched The Online Video Network (OVN) service to provide news video to AP member and customer websites. The co-op responded to the harsh economy by cutting costs in 2008 with consolidation of  its print, broadcast, and digital sales and marketing units. It continued its cost-cutting efforts in 2009 when it cut some 90 jobs, instituted a hiring freeze, and bought out about 100 employees.
