   Latchways is here to help you come to grips with your fear of heights. The company makes, sells, and installs a variety of industrial safety products designed to protect people from falling while working on buildings, bridges, offshore platforms, and telecommunications towers.

The company's safety services subsidiary installs the company's products in the UK. Latchways' products have been employed worldwide at such sites as the Pentagon, the Manchester Stadium, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

  <p>
   Latchways experienced declines for 2014, with revenues dropping 9% due to lower performance of its Wingrip business and declines from wind energy projects in the European markets. This was offset by a 60% surge in North America sales resulting from a major growth in its self retracting lifeline (SRL) and personal rescue device (PRD) product ranges.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company's net income declined by 32% due to decreased revenues, along with higher administrative expenses and higher salary costs associated with sales and development in addition to foreign exchange losses. In addition, Latchways' operating cash flow increased nearly 10% during 2014. (Note: Growth rates or declines may differ after conversion to the US dollar.)

  <p>
   The company's strategy is focused on expanding through organic growth along with the acquisitions of companies. Focused on growth in the North American markets, it completed a new production facility in Devizes, UK, and established a new US operation to support its customer base there. The company also invests in its technical and sales network to prepare for future growth.
