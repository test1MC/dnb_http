   Licensing agreements have helped Monogram Food Solutions build a firm foundation for its business. Aside from its deal with Bass Pro Shops and Jeff Foxworthy, the company enjoys licensing partnerships with

   and

   Beginning in 2010, the company began manufacturing and selling meat snacks for the energy drink maker, DNA Beverages Corporation, under the DNA brand. Geared toward a younger consumer, the DNA beef products gives Monogram a larger demographic for its products.

  <p>
   Since its founding, the company has quickly built itself up by buying established meat product manufacturers and processing plants. In 2009 it acquired three companies, including beef jerky maker Wild Bill's Foods and Al Pete's Meats (and the Pete's Pride brand name). It also acquired the Hannah's, Bull's, O'Brien's, and Dakota meat snack brands from meat processing company

   In late 2012 Monogram Food Solutions purchased Hinsdale Farms of Bristol, Indiana. As one of the nation's largest makers of corn dogs, Hinsdale also has a hand in serving retail private label customers and co-packing for other manufacturers. The deal added a fourth manufacturing plant for processing meat. As part of the acquisition, Monogram Food Solutions is working to integrate the Hinsdale business into its manufacturing and sales systems.
