   STERIS has hygiene hysteria. The firm makes sterilization systems for health care, pharmaceutical, research, and industrial markets. In addition to its sanitizing lotions and soaps, health care professionals use the firm's steam and chemical sterilization systems to sterilize surgical and diagnostic devices. STERIS also makes disinfection systems and infection prevention consumables. The company sells such surgical support products as exam lights, surgical tables, and scrub sinks. STERIS sells its equipment and consumables in more than 60 countries. In North America, its Isomedix unit offers contract sterilization for more than a dozen health care, industrial, and consumer products makers. STERIS acquired UK-based

   for about $2 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   Products sold in the US market account for three-fourths of STERIS' sales. The company has contract sterilization, manufacturing, and warehouse locations throughout the US, as well as in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, France, Finland, and the UK.

   The company's US offerings are marketed to hospitals and surgery centers through STERIS' direct sales force. International sales are conducted through direct sales offices in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Spain, the UAE, and the UK, as well as through representative distributors in other countries. The company's life sciences segment markets sterilization products to customers in the pharmaceutical and research industries.

  <p>
   STERIS is continually working to develop new and improved products to enhance its offerings, including new chemical agents, disinfection and sterilization systems, and surgical equipment. It also looks to grow through partnership and acquisition opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after announcing a restructuring plan in 2014 that included closing its Mentor, Ohio, facility that made a discontinued product, STERIS bought Integrated Medical Systems (IMS), a surgical instrument repair, sterilization, and maintenance firm for an undisclosed amount.

  <p>
   In 2015 STERIS became the latest US company to make a purchase aimed, at least partially, at reducing its tax burden. It acquired UK-based
   <company id="120324">
    Synergy Health
   </company>
   , an outsourced medical instrument sterilization company, for nearly $2 billion. The move allowed STERIS to avoid US corporate taxes. As a part of the transaction, the company moved its headquarters to England and changed from STERIS Corporation to STERIS plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, STERIS sold UK Linen Management Services, acquired as part of the Synergy Health deal, to STAR Mayan for $66.5 million.

  <p>
   Microbiologist Raymond Kralovic and mechanical engineer Edward Schneider founded the company in 1985 as Innovative Medical Technologies. Veteran health care consultant Bill Sanford liked the company's low-temperature sterilization system so much he joined the firm as CEO in 1987. That year the company changed its name to STERIS; in 1988 it introduced its STERIS SYSTEM 1 tabletop sterilization unit. The company went public in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 STERIS teamed up with Indianapolis-based ECOMED in a joint venture to develop a system that grinds up and decontaminates hypodermic needles and other disposable medical equipment. The venture bore fruit in 1995 when it introduced the EcoCycle 10. In 1994 the company bought St. Louis-based Medical &amp; Environmental Designs for its proprietary technology that collects and disposes of blood and other fluid infectious wastes. STERIS debuted its SafeCycle 40 fluid waste management system in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   STERIS went shopping in the late 1990s, acquiring ECOMED, AMSCO (six times STERIS' size), and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Calgon Vestal Laboratories in 1996. STERIS bought Isomedix in 1997, shortly before the FDA approved that company's petition to use gamma radiation to kill bacteria in meat. A one-time charge to cover AMSCO merger expenses led to a loss that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 STERIS bought Hausted (patient-handling systems) and a sterilization facility in Arizona. The next year the company sought a foothold in Europe with an attempted acquisition of UK-based sterilizer company Isotron, but let its offer lapse because of lukewarm shareholder response and a languishing stock price. In 2000 STERIS formed an alliance with and bought a minority interest in SterilTek, a provider of sterilization management for health care facilities. It also launched buySTERIS, an online store selling its skin care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   STERIS reorganized in 2003 into three business segments: healthcare, life sciences, and STERIS Isomedix Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   It made a number of acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, including FH Surgical (surgical tables), the Cosmed Group (contract sterilization), Albert Browne Limited (chemical indicators), Hamo (washing and decontaminations systems), and the sterilization container business of Sterion Incorporated. The acquisitions expanded STERIS' offerings and geographic reach, particularly in Europe.
