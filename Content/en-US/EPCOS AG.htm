   EPCOS has an epic romance with passive electronics. The company is a leading producer of passive electronic components used in telecommunications, automotive, and industrial electronics. The company makes more than 40,000 products -- including capacitors, ferrites, ceramic components, and surface acoustic wave (SAW) components -- for a wide variety of devices such as cellular phones, computers, digital still cameras, refrigerators, air bags, braking systems, and turbines. Europe accounts for nearly two-thirds of sales. Electronic components maker

  <p>
   More a marriage of convenience than necessity, in 1989 electronic titans Siemens and Matsushita created a German joint venture, Siemens Matsushita Components, to make passive components for electronic products. Klaus Ziegler, the president and CEO of Siemens Passive Components and Electron Tubes Group, was named president and CEO of the joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Siemens Matsushita Components established a joint venture with Asian Electronics to produce multi-purpose capacitors in India. The company also acquired Recotech, a Hungarian manufacturer of passive components.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Siemens Matsushita Components expanded its Singapore plant, which manufactured surface acoustic wave (SAW) components used in televisions, video recorders, mobile phones, and other electronics. The company also began building a tantalum-chip capacitor manufacturing facility in Portugal. Later that year Siemens Matsushita Components acquired Hong Kong-based Vogt Electronics, a manufacturer of inductor components used in lamps and electronic ballasts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 parent company Siemens began a restructuring that involved selling some units and spinning off its semiconductor and passive component operations as public companies. In 1999 Siemens Matsushita Components purchased the ferrite-producing unit of Pramet Sumperk. Later that year the company (renamed EPCOS, for Electronic Parts and Components) went public. (Siemens and Matsushita each retained a 12.5% stake in the company.)
  </p>
  <p>
   EPCOS continued to increase its production capacity in 2000, expanding both its SAW component manufacturing plant in Singapore and its tantalum capacitor production in Europe. In 2001 president and CEO Klaus Ziegler was named chairman; COO Gerhard Pegam was appointed president and CEO. The company established a Japanese subsidiary that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   EPCOS Taiwan was set up in 2002, widening the company's Asian sales and support network.

    Robert Bosch
   </company>
   signed a five-year supply agreement with EPCOS in early 2004. The pact, valued at more than €200 million, called for EPCOS to ship piezo actuators to Bosch for diesel engine fuel injection systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siemens sold its remaining stake in EPCOS in March 2006, while Matsushita (later renamed
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   ) cashed out entirely in October of that year. The German giant sold its share in EPCOS for €90 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 EPCOS sold its tantalum capacitor business unit to

    KEMET

   , one of the world's largest makers of capacitors, for €86.5 million. The deal included a manufacturing operation in Portugal.

   EPCOS acquired the radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems (RF-MEMS) product line of
