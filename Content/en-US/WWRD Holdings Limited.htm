  <p>
   Waterford Wedgwood traces its roots back to two companies more than 200 years old. Josiah Wedgwood, an 18th-century English artisan, got his start as a potter bridging the gap between wooden bowls for the common people and fine porcelain for the rich. He developed a method of making ordinary clay look like porcelain and later developed fine ceramic ware incorporating neoclassical figures applied in a white cameo relief on a colored background -- which became the signature product of Josiah Wedgwood and Sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wedgwood operated as a family business for the next 176 years and may have indirectly contributed to Darwin's theory of evolution. Charles Darwin married into the Wedgwood clan and thus gained the financial security to pursue his scientific research on a full-time basis. Wedgwood did not have a non-family director on its board until 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   Around the same time that Wedgwood was gaining recognition in England, Quakers George and William Penrose founded a crystal glassmaking business in 1783 in the Irish port city of Waterford. The two companies shared a reputation for quality and for exquisite craftsmanship. However, they both experienced the vagaries of fashion and financial difficulties.
  </p>
  <p>
   Waterford went bankrupt in 1851 and remained inactive until its revival, aided by WWII refugees. With this new base of skilled artisans from Central Europe, it started operations again in 1947. The company quickly re-established the Waterford reputation. Profits rose steadily in the 1970s and early 1980s, with the US emerging as Waterford's primary market. In addition to consumer products, Waterford glassware has been used for the Boston Marathon Trophy and to hold the late President Reagan's jelly beans.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 Waterford borrowed heavily to acquire Wedgwood for $360 million, a move designed to allow both companies to cut costs by sharing marketing operations and by streamlining production. Waterford Wedgwood was still struggling in 1990 when Tony O'Reilly (the Irish-born then-chairman of US-based

   ) and
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   bought a 30% stake worth $125 million. That year the company launched its first new brand of crystal in 200 years, Marquis by Waterford. The line was a success, and by 1993 Waterford Wedgwood had returned to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Stuart &amp; Sons, the leading UK maker of premium crystal, in 1995 and introduced a best-seller, its Cornucopia fine bone china pattern. In 1996 Waterford Wedgwood also launched new licensed gift lines -- pens and linens -- and formed a strategic alliance with German luxury ceramics maker Rosenthal, in which it owned a 26% stake. In 1997, in a departure from tradition, the company introduced a line of china under the Waterford name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Waterford Wedgwood increased its stake in Rosenthal to nearly 85%, making it the world's #1 producer of fine porcelain, and cut 1,500 jobs to reduce costs. In 1999 the company purchased US cookware-maker All-Clad for $110 million. Also in 1999 the company bought a 15% stake in ceramics maker Royal Doulton. Expanding its European presence, the company acquired German ceramics brand Hutschenreuther in August 2000 (and integrated operations into the Rosenthal business in 2003). In 2002 Waterford Wedgwood bought another 15% of Rosenthal, increasing its stake to nearly 90%, and also acquired Ashling Corporation, a maker of luxury linens. The same year Waterford Wedgwood laid off nearly 15% of its workforce amid a worldwide economic downturn and diminished interest in luxury goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Waterford Wedgwood acquired the Spring premium cookware business (Switzerland) and Cashs, a catalog and mail-order business (Ireland). Also that year the company cut more than 1,000 jobs by closing two British factories and moving production to China. In addition, Waterford Wedgwood upped its stake in Royal Doulton to nearly 22%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004 the company announced it asked 1,400 employees at its two Irish crystal-cutting plants to take pay cuts and work fewer hours to offset sluggish sales. It also sold its US premium cookware maker, All-Clad, to
   <company id="90840">
    SEB
   </company>
   to reduce debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's shares tumbled in value in the first quarter of 2005 when CFO Paul D'Alton resigned after less than a year of duty. A few weeks later, the company was buoyed by the announcement of Waterford Wedgwood's restructuring plan, which included closure of its Waterford Crystal plant in Dungarvan, Ireland, and its Rosenthal division in Germany. In total approximately 1,800 jobs were lost in the process. Later in the year Waterford Wedgwood was delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange because it was trading at such a low price and level for an extended period of time.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Peter Cameron, who'd taken on the role in 2005, stepped down from his position in 2008 to pursue other business interests. Director David Sculley was named as interim CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Waterford Wedgwood entered administration in January 2009. Following the filing the company's shares were suspended from the Irish stock exchange and the firm's directors tendered their resignations. In March KPS Capital Partners acquired certain assets of Waterford Wedgewood along with the Royal Doulton assets in the UK, the US, and Canada; the purchase of intellectual property in Ireland; and the purchase of the shares of certain Waterford Wedgwood subsidiaries, including in Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. The purchase price was not disclosed.
