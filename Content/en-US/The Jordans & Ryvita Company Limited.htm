Its cereals include just-add-milk flaked products and muesli, along with hot cereals such as oat porridge. Jordans &amp; Ryvita's products are available for purchase through leading UK grocers including

   While competition heats up in the UK market for cereal and cereal bars, the company's business conducted internationally continues to flex its muscle by performing well.

   To ensure it keeps its operations cost-effective, Jordans &amp; Ryvita transferred production activities from its Stockport facility to Poole.

   In 2015 the company introduced a lighter granola product.
