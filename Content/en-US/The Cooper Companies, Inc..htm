   The Cooper Companies specializes in eye care and lady care. The global company makes specialty medical devices in two niche markets: vision care and gynecology. Its
   <company id="138627">
    CooperVision
   </company>
   subsidiary makes specialty contact lenses, including toric lenses for astigmatism, multifocal lenses for presbyopia, and cosmetic lenses. The company also offers spherical lenses for more common vision problems such as nearsightedness and farsightedness. Subsidiary CooperSurgical specializes in women's health care; its wide range of products includes bone densitometers (for diagnosing osteoporosis), contraceptive devices, surgery instruments, and fetal monitors. Cooper's products are sold in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   The Cooper Companies operates through two business units: CooperVision, the larger of the two (around 80% of annual sales), is one of the largest contact lens manufacturers in the world; meanwhile, CooperSurgical provides diagnostic and therapeutic products used by obstetricians and gynecologists.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spherical lenses account for more than half of CooperVision's net sales, while toric lenses accounts for about 30%. The unit also sells contact lenses using its PC Technology, which attracts water and keeps lenses hydrated.
  </p>
  <p>
   CooperSurgical has been a consolidator in the fragmented women's medical device market, acquiring more than 30 niche companies since its inception in 1990. Trends that it is taking advantage of include the increase in laparoscopic procedures, and a shifting of procedures done in doctor's offices rather than in hospital settings. Products used in office and surgical procedures account for about two-thirds of the unit's net sales; fertility products account for the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
   California-based Cooper rings up nearly half of its sales in the US, and about 30% in Europe. The company has manufacturing and distribution facilities for optical products in the US (New York and Puerto Rico), the UK, Australia, and Japan. Its medical device and surgical instrument products are manufactured and distributed from facilities in Germany and the US (California, Connecticut, and Texas).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cooper markets its products through its own sales representatives in North America and through a mix of direct sales and distributors elsewhere. It markets its products in professional journals and via e-commerce, telemarketing, and social media.

  <p>
   Cooper has enjoyed rising net revenue over the past five years. In fiscal 2015 (ended October), revenue increased 5% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher sales of contact lenses. However, CooperSurgical saw declines in sales of medical equipment and fertility products, the latter of which was largely due to the negative impact of the weakening of foreign currencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which had been on the rise, declined in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, it dropped 25% to $203.5 million on higher expenses related to the 2014 acquisition of European manufacturer Sauflon's and the 2015 acquisition of genetics laboratory Reprogenetics. An increase in inventory and the decline in profits led to a 14% drop in operating cash flow, which fell to $391 million.

  <p>
   CooperVision is working to expand internationally by increasing operations in various high-growth geographic markets. It is building a plant in Costa Rica. The lens maker is attempting to expand its market share by launching new products. Its R&amp;D team is working on several new products using its PC moisturizing technology. It is also developing new products using silicone hydrogel, a more breathable lens material that is healthier and more comfortable for the eye, including single-use (throwaway), toric, and multifocal lenses. The company is also expanding through acquisitions. For example, it acquired Sauflon, a European manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses, in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   CooperSurgical is also growing by acquiring complementary technologies, products, and businesses. Additionally, it seeks to launch products utilizing advanced technologies.

  <p>
   CooperSurgical paid some $44 million in late 2014 for EndoSee Corporation, developer of an office-based disposable hysterectomy system. The following year, the unit acquired Reprogenetics, a genetics laboratory specializing in preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis used in the in-vitro fertilization process. It also bought UK-based Research Instruments, which makes in-vitro fertilization medical devices and systems, for some $51 million. In 2016 CooperSurgical acquired the commercial assets of genetic testing firm Recombine for some $85 million; Recombine specializes in carrier screening, which can predict genetic disorders in offspring.
  </p>
  <p>
   CooperVision bought European firm Sauflon, which makes and distributes soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions, for $1.1 billion in 2014. Among other items, that purchase added Sauflon's clariti 1day brand of single-use lenses.

  <p>
   Cooper Labs (medical devices, founded in 1958 and dissolved 1985) created CooperVision as a subsidiary in 1980. CooperVision diversified into diagnostic equipment and drugs; by 1987 (when it was renamed The Cooper Companies), debt had increased sixfold and creditors came knocking.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two scandal-tainted families (the Sturmans and the Singers -- fraud/organized crime and Medicaid fraud, respectively) then bought their way onto the board. Proxy fights, cronyism, nepotism, indictments, and lawsuits ensued. Meanwhile, cash-strapped Cooper sold most of its international and part of its US contact lens business, as well as its ophthalmic surgical products and medical diagnostics businesses. Co-chairman Gary Singer took a leave of absence after being indicted in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cooper bought Hospital Group of America and its hospitals that year. Singer resigned shortly before being convicted on 21 counts, including racketeering, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering in 1994. Pharmaceutical industry veteran Thomas Bender joined the board that year and was named CEO in 1995. He was elected chairman in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cooper rebuilt its contact business and turned to the women's health field in the early 1990s. In 1996 it bought a line of disposable gynecological products and worked to boost lens-making capacity. The next year it bought a line of colored contact lenses, a minimally invasive gynecological surgical and disposable products company, and a UK lens maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 The Cooper Companies discontinued its Hospital Group of America operations. It sold the group's hospitals, treatment centers, and clinics to
   <company id="15028">
    Universal Health Services
   </company>
   in 1999. In 2000 the company made three acquisitions, including two makers of gynecological instruments. In 2002 The Cooper Companies bought Biocompatibles Eye Care, one of the world's largest contact lens manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's acquisitions in 2003 included Avalon Medical Corporation (distributor of female sterilization system) and Prism Enterprises (manufacturer of medical devices for the women's health care markets). The Cooper Companies bought gynecology products manufacturer Milex Products in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   It nearly doubled its revenue with the 2005 acquisition of leading contact lens maker
   <company id="53814">
    Ocular Sciences
   </company>
   . The purchase strengthened its presence in the spheric (non-specialty) lens market; it also opened up new geographic markets, particularly Germany and Japan. It also purchased NeoSurg Technologies and Inlet Medical in 2005, both of which made devices used in laparoscopic surgeries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 it purchased Lone Star Medical Products, adding a line of gynecological surgical products. The following year it added medical instrument maker Wallach Surgical Devices.
