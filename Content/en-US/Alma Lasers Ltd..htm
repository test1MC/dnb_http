  <p>
   In 2013 the private company agreed to be acquired by a group made up of Chindex Medical (a joint venture between Chindex International and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical group), another subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun, and the Pramerica-Fosun China Opportunity Fund. The purchase has a total value of $240 million.

  <p>
   Alma Lasers generates about half of its revenue outside of the US. Because its systems do not usually require analgesics and other pre-treatments, the company promotes its products as a way to help physicians reduce time and costs in their practice.

  <p>
   The company filed to go public in late 2007 but withdrew its IPO the following year, citing unfavorable market conditions. The company had planned to use the IPO proceeds for potential acquisitions and product development investments.
