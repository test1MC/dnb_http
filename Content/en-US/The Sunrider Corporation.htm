   While based in the US, the company is focused on geographic expansion.
  </p>

   It has worked to get its products in Asia. To avoid regulations on direct-selling in China, Sunrider first entered that country by establishing a franchise system with thousands of stores. Following the success of its stores in China, the company has set out to repeat it with its Authorized Business Owner (ABO) franchise division in other Asian countries. It has focused on Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, Israel, Turkey, and Taiwan in recent years.

   In 2013 the company opened a wellness center in Torrance, California. SunLiving Health &amp; Wellness offers holistic treatments for pain, overall wellness, and injury-recovery. Additional treatments also include weight-loss programs, pain management, acupuncture, prolotherapy, and Sunrider herbal supplements.
  </p>
        <p>
   To further penetrate China, Sunrider in 2013 partnered with nearly 10 Shinsegae Department Stores to sells its products there. Shinsegae is a department store franchise that's based in Seoul, South Korea.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company entered the consumer foods sector in 2009 when it opened the Kunshan Manufacturing Facility at a cost of $80 million in China. Built to house Sunrider Food, the plant produces instant noodles and a variety of canned foods.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sunrider has diversified further by acquiring and operating several hotels in China. In Beijing, the company operates the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel and the Sunworld Hotel. It also owns the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel in Taipei. Both of its Beijing hotels are "Olympic" hotels, which means they are pre-booked by government officials.
