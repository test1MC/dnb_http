   Its more than 25,000 products make Leviton Manufacturing a leviathan of electrical and electronic components, but it's certainly no dinosaur. In addition to components such as switches, plugs, and connectors for home and commercial uses, the family owned business has added data center connectivity and energy-efficient lighting systems, lighting controls, and voice and data equipment. Its Wiring Device division makes everything from basic switches to receptacles, including the designer Decora and Acenti collections. Products are sold in North America to distributors, manufacturers, and retail outlets, such as

  <p>
   Leviton has identified data center infrastructure and lighting energy management as key areas for growth. It steadily broadens its product line, customer base, and operations through organic growth and acquisitions of complementary companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014, the company established its first base of operations in Johannesburg, South Africa. The facility provides commercial lighting products to customers throughout one of the world's most rapidly expanding markets in South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   A few months later in 2014, Leviton opened its first manufacturing facility in Bloomingdale, Illinois. The new factory produces a vast array of highly customized pre-terminated copper and fiber optics systems that were previously made at the company's facility in St. Charles, Illinois.

  <p>
   In 2014 Leviton acquired BitWise Controls, designer and manufacturer of control and monitoring products for residential and commercial facilities. The acquisition will bring BitWise Controls' product line including iPhone/iTouch/iPad and Android app-based GUIs into the Leviton portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company also snapped up ClickOn Technology, a South African manufacturer of automation technology for residential and commercial applications. The acquisition enhanced the company's remote control system capabilities. In 2013 Leviton acquired JCC Advanced Lighting, a leader in LED lighting products. That deal increased Leviton's geographical footprint within the UK.

  <p>
   Levinton started out making tip mantles for gaslights in 1906. Since 1929 the company's acquisitions have opened new routes to electric, insulated wire, and lighting control markets.
