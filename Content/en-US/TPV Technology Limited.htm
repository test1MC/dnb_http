   TPV's revenue is split between TVs, 45%, and monitors, 44%. The other 11% comes from the company production of spare parts, phones, tablets, and all-in-one computers.

   TPV's revenue has been in the range of $11 billion for several years, although it's slid lower recently. In 2015 company's revenue dropped 5% to $11 billion. The unit that makes spare parts and phones shed some $550 million in 2015 from 2014 and the monitor unit shucked about $360 million. The TV segment managed just a 1% gain in revenue.

  <p>
   The company posted a net loss of about $31 million for 2015, compared to a $5.4 million loss in 2014. Cash flow rose to $151 million in 2015 from $107 million in the prior year.

   As a maker of computer monitors, TPV has to deal with the worldwide decline in PC sales. The company's previous move into public monitors and professional monitors helped mitigate some of the PC-related decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   TPV reduced the number of products it makes, dropping low-selling items. The move helped reduce costs. The company also shut down surplus manufacturing capacity, which included closing a plant in Brazil.
