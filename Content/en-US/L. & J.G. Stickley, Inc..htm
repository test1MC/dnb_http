   L. &amp; J.G. Stickley is famous for its original line of furniture created in the early 1900s -- the Mission Oak Collection -- the company still produces the Mission style, as well as other distinct lines of furniture and area rugs, including the Colonial Williamsburg Collection, 21st Century, Metropolitan, Edinburgh, Nichols &amp; Stone, and Stickley Fine Upholstery collections. The company's portfolio of stores includes about 15 retail showrooms located in more than half a dozen US states. It sells furniture through stores it operates under the Stickley Audi and Stickley Furniture banner names, as well as through independent retailers across North America.

   In recent years, Stickley has focused on boosting its retail presence in North Carolina by adding retail showrooms in the greater Charlotte area. It's also expanding in New York in 2013, further investing $3.8 million in the town of Manlius (located east of Syracuse). The move represents the company's seventh expansion since 1988.

   The company's furniture is sold through a nationwide network of independent retailers and design showrooms, as well as through company-owned Stickley Audi stores, which carry other brands. Its furniture is also sold through its Stickley Furniture stores, which carry only the company's lines.

  <p>
   In 2008 the company, which has used acquisitions to round out its product offerings through the years, purchased Nichols &amp; Stone, America's oldest furniture manufacturer. It bought the designs and intellectual property and makes the pieces at its existing factories.

  <p>
   Founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Leopold Stickley and his brother, John George, L. &amp; J.G. Stickley was bought by Alfred and Aminy Audi during the 1970s. Alfred Audi, who grew up sleeping in a Stickley bed, sold the company's furniture at his father's New York store from 1960 until he bought the manufacturer in 1974. Alfred Audi died in 2007 and his wife Aminy took over as CEO.
