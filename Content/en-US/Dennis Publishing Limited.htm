   Cars, fitness, and geekery: Dennis Publishing's suite of magazine titles offer a glimpse into the modern male psyche. The company publishes around 35 print and online magazines, including Auto Express, Computer Shopper, Men's Fitness, Viz, and Den of Geek. Its portfolio targets six audiences: motoring enthusiasts, IT decision makers, affluent men and women, early adopters, and style-seeking young men. The company has offices in the UK and the US. Dennis Publishing was founded by Felix Dennis, and its early success came from Kung-Fu Monthly, which rode the wave of hype around martial artist Bruce Lee in the mid-1970s. It has been owned by the Heart of England Forest Charity, set up by Dennis, since his death in 2014.

  <p>
   Dennis Publishing's two primary revenue streams are magazine sales, and online and print advertising. The company does not use paywalls for its online-only publications, such as Den of Geek, Alphr.com, and Coach.com. It also sells cars through buyacar.co.uk.

  <p>
   Revenue from the UK accounts for around 85% of the total and Europe and Other account for over 5% each.

   In fiscal 2015 (ended December), revenue climbed 16% to £88.9 million due to the first full-year contribution from buyacar.co.uk, acquired in 2014, and new launches including The Week Junior, Coach magazine, Alphr.com, and Minecraft World magazine. Growth came entirely from the UK, up from £63.5 million to £77.2 million, while Europe and Other both fell.

  <p>
   Net income was down 25% to £2.5 million: the company outperformed expectations for the year and was thus in a position to make an additional donation of £2.0 million to the Heart of England Forest Charity.

   As with every company working in media, Dennis Publishing is grappling with an increasingly fragmented and challenging market and the problem of

   and
   <company id="148344">

   </company>
   hoovering up online advertising spend. The company's approach is to diversify its portfolio: in 2015, this meant one acquisition (buyacar.co.uk), and four new launches (The Week Junior, Coach magazine, Alphr.com, and Minecraft World). The buyacar.co.uk acquisition marks Dennis Publishing's first foray into e-commerce -- it sells around 200 cars a month.

   Dennis Publishing acquired buyacar.co.uk in 2014. The company offers services to the car industry as well as consumers.
