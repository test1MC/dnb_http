   Thank goodness for zinc's abundance; the element has enabled Arlington Industry's dominance in manufacturing individual zinc die-cast line items. Arlington manufactures and distributes a slew of metallic and non-metallic fittings and connectors. Its lineup includes bushings, cable connectors, concrete pipe sleeves, conduit bodies, gaskets, and screw couplings used in the electrical and construction markets. The company operates a sole plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Since 2003 the privately-held manufacturing company has introduced more than 400 new products.

  <p>
   Arlington products are sold throughout the US and Canada through stocking sales representatives, who support the distributors' inventory.

   Arlington attributes its ability to ride the economic downturn to product development. Such developments focus on labor-saving devices, offering competitive prices for electrical contractors. The company reports that more than 50% of its revenues are from its new patent-pending offerings, enabling it to resist pricing pressures as well as motivate sales representatives with better commissions. Moreover, Arlington has begun catering to audio/visual applications with a line of TV boxes and scoops, and low-voltage mounting brackets.

   In 2013, the company received additional payments of $1 million from Bridgeport Fittings in supplemental damages for sales of Whipper-Snap products from 2010 through 2012. Bridgeport was previously ordered to pay Arlington $3.62 million after a court ruling that 30 types of Bridgeport's Whipper-Snap products infringed Arlington's patent covering its SNAP-TITE products.

   Arlington was established in 1949 as a regional supplier of zinc fittings to the electrical industry. It was acquired by its present owners in 1956.
