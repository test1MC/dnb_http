  <p>
   The company has achieved explosive growth the last two years, mostly due to a surge in Aerospace sales and additional revenue from acquisitions. Revenues grew 5% to peak at a record-setting $692 million in 2015. Profits also jumped 19% to reach $67 million in 2015, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by an 11% spike in Aerospace sales and a 15% rise in sales from North America. This growth was driven by a spike in electrical power and motion sales, particularly in-seat power products. Its lighting and safety product line increased due to growth passenger service unit sales. Systems certification sales also received a boost from acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Astronics' unprecedented profit total for 2015 was due to the higher net sales coupled with a decrease in interest expenses due to decreased debt levels. The company's operating cash flow has trended upwards until 2015, when it decreased by 21%.

  <p>
   The company continues to invest in new technologies and aircraft programs for each of its markets even while the aerospace industry as a whole is experiencing a slowdown along with the economy in general. In particular, Astronics is developing an electrical power distribution system for the Learjet 85 that shows promise of becoming a standard component of business jets. Its products and technologies are also used in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Airbus A380 XWB, and the Boeing 787, to name a few.
