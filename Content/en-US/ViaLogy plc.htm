   Premaitha Health (formerly ViaLogy) Premaitha is a molecular diagnostic company based in the UK that has developed the IONA test, an in vitro diagnostic non-invasive pre-natal screening test for fetal chromosomal abnormalities such as Down's syndrome. The IONA test is based on the analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal bloodstream, an approach that has been used since 2011 by several pre-natal screening companies, primarily in the US. ViaLogy plc was acquired by Premaitha Health Limited, (and became a molecular diagnostic firm) in a reverse merger transaction in 2014.

   Through a technology developed at

   , called Quantum Resonance Interferometry (QRI), ViaLogy could identify oil and gas sweet spots. The method was a departure from traditional means in that it both uses existing noise and introduces synthetic noise to aid analysis. The company started tapping into the oil and gas industry in 2008 with its QuantumRD product. It had initially concentrated on smaller US companies, mostly in Texas, but with early successes ViaLogy began looking to gain larger, global clients.
