   Daktronics always knows the score. The company is a leading manufacturer of electronic displays, audio systems, and timing products. Its products include scoreboards, game timers, shot clocks, and animation displays for sports facilities; billboards and price displays for businesses; and displays used by transportation agencies. Other applications include airport information, securities trading, and outdoor advertising. Daktronics products are used in major sports arenas, including venues such as the Olympic Games. About 62% of the company's business is made up of live events and commercial clients. While most sales come from the US, Daktronics has seven offices worldwide.

  <p>
   Daktronics organizes its business into five segments based on customer type and geography: Live Events (36% of sales), Commercial (32% of sales), Schools and Theaters (12% of sales), Transportation (9% of sales), and International (17% of sales). Commercial customers come from a range of industries including auto dealers, casinos, churches, petroleum, pharmacies, restaurants, retail, shopping centers, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its manufacturing operations take place mainly in two South Dakota locations and another in Minnesota, but the company also has a location in Shanghai that makes architectural lighting products. Each location concentrates more or less on products for one of the company's five segments; which helps it respond to the unique needs of customers in each segment more efficiently.

   Daktronics uses a direct sales force in the US and Canada for most of its larger-setting products, such as for professional and school sports facilities, convention centers, and transportation. Resellers typically handle only the lower-priced products that are easier to install, and generally cover small enterprise customers.

  <p>
   The company mainly focuses its efforts in product design, with teams dedicated to additional LED module platforms for both through-hole and surface-mount device products, as well as continued enhancements of its control system software. The company invests in and will continue to expand quality control for product designs, reliability testing, and manufacturing controls. It also relies on nurturing an initially small sales and service presence in other countries, made up of a network of standard and home offices, to grow internationally.

  <p>
   Daktronics was founded in a garage in 1968 by engineering professors Aelred Kurtenbach and Duane Sander (who later became dean of engineering at
   <company id="123140">
    South Dakota State University
   </company>
   ). The company name came from combining "Dakota" with "electronics." Two years later the company delivered its first product, a voting display system for the Utah legislature. Scoreboards were added to the product line in 1971; commercial displays, in 1973. It introduced computerized controllers in the late 1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, marked the first time the company provided scoreboards to the Olympic games. During the 1980s Daktronics began installing displays in major-league sports stadiums. In 1988 it bought auto-racing timing equipment maker Chondek. Daktronics continued to advance sign technology during the 1990s, acquiring technology for light-emitting diode (LED) displays. It went public in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company supplied five displays and 24 digital clocks to Times Square locations in 1995. Daktronics also provided scoreboards to the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. That year the blue LED, a tiny bulb used with green and red LEDs to produce color on large TV-like screens, was introduced. This allowed the company to add video to its scoreboards. In 1998 Daktronics installed systems in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and sports venues in Cleveland, Seattle, and Phoenix.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's displays were featured at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In 2001 Daktronics bought 80% of Servtrotech (a Canadian electronic display system maker) and Sportslink, Ltd. (a large screen video rental display company). James Morgan became CEO in 2001; Kurtenbach remained chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company won a contract to provide digital advertising and information displays at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. The following year Daktronics expanded its product line and geographic reach with the acquisition of UK-based European Timing Systems (scoreboards and timing systems for cricket, aquatics, and rugby), which was renamed Daktronics UK. Also in 2004 the company acquired the assets of Dodge Electronics, doing business as Dodge Systems, a supplier of audio systems for sports facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Daktronics acquired the assets of Hoffend &amp; Sons for about $4 million. Hoffend was a manufacturer of hoist systems for sports and theatrical venues, and functioned as a supplier to Daktronics. The business became the Vortek division of Daktronics Hoist. The Louisiana Superdome, damaged by Hurricane Katrina, underwent renovation in 2006. The work included new scoreboards and displays from Daktronics, valued at nearly $6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Daktronics expanded its manufacturing facilities in 2006, adding 110,000 sq. ft. of space to its main manufacturing facility in Brookings, South Dakota, and leasing a vacant plant in Sioux Falls with 120,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing space.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company acquired an existing plant in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, from
   <company id="10514">
    Emerson Electric
   </company>
   . Daktronics used the facility to manufacture its Galaxy line of electronic message displays. Moving Galaxy production to Minnesota freed up manufacturing space at the company's plant in Brookings.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, the company began construction of a facility in Brookings for office and warehouse space, a $19 million project. Daktronics occupied its new headquarters and factory in 2007.
