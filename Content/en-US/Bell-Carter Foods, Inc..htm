   If olives ring your bell, tune into Bell-Carter Foods. As the largest table olive producer in the US, the California company manufactures and markets canned and jarred black and green olives and olive spreads. Bell-Carter's products, which are sold under the Lindsay and Bell's labels, also include capers, cocktail onions, and pimientos.

   The company, which boasts a 63% share of the black olive market in the US, enlists the help of California growers to keep its business thriving.

   Bell-Carter is investing in its primary product, olives with a campaign to make over its image. While it wants to retain its image of tradition, tapping its long history of olive-making, it's pushing to become a snacks provider with hopes of having its products sit on the store shelf alongside chips, nuts, popcorn, and other savory items. One move the company has already made is to sell its olives in snack cans with pull-top lids.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two new product lines under the Lindsay brand -- Lindsay Naturals and Lindsay Recloseables -- focus on specific and previously unaddressed consumer needs.

  <p>
   Bell-Carter is owned by the fourth generation of the families that founded the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1912 by Arthur and Henry Bell and was operated by the third and fourth generations of Bell descendants until Ken Wienholz, chief executive, arrived in 2007 as COO.
