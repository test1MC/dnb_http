   Tenneco ensures vehicles are riding steady without exhausting a lot of smoke. The auto parts maker designs and distributes ride-control equipment (including shock absorbers, struts, and suspensions) under the Monroe brand, and emissions-control systems (catalytic converters, exhaust pipes, and mufflers) under the Walker brand. It also makes Clevite elastomer products (bushings, mounts, and springs) for vibration control in cars and heavy trucks. It supplies both OEMs and aftermarket wholesalers and retailers.

   . Tenneco operates on six continents and is growing its presence in key Asia/Pacific markets.

  <p>
   Tenneco divides its operations across six segments. These are structured geographically and are managed along its two major product lines of emission control and ride control. These segments are: North America Clean Air, North America Ride Performance, Europe South and India Clean Air, Europe South and India Ride Performance, Asia Pacific Clean Air, and Asia Pacific Ride Performance. Emission control accounted for about 70% of the company's revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   As stricter environmental standards are enacted, Tenneco finds itself well positioned as a supplier of emission control systems. The company has developed diesel particulate filters (DPFs) for passenger cars and medium-duty trucks both in Europe and North America. The filters, when used with converters, can reduce emissions of particulates by as much as 90%, and nitrogen oxide by up to 95%. Tenneco also produces selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another trend in the automotive industry that is building Tenneco's business is OEMs endeavoring to simplify their assembly process, thus reducing costs and development times. To achieve this, the OEMs are outsourcing more of the design and manufacturing of vehicle parts, as well as fully-integrated systems that support emission control, anti-lock braking, roll-control, and powertrains. This trend has given rise to Tier 1 systems integrators in addition to Tier 1 suppliers -- Tenneco fits the bill for both roles. To boost its position even further, the company offers just-in-time (JIT) systems for its emission control operations, and has built JIT facilities close to a customer's plant for quick delivery of product components.

  <p>
   In addition to key alliances and joint ventures, Tenneco operates 90 manufacturing facilities on six continents throughout the world. Most recently, the company has opened manufacturing facilities in India, China, and Thailand. North America represented almost 34% of its total sales in 2015; Europe and South America (plus India) collectively accounted for 23%; and the Asia/Pacific region accounted for the remainder.

  <p>
   Tenneco has separate sales and marketing efforts underway for its OE and aftermarket businesses. For OE sales, the company's sales and marketing team is an integrated group of professionals, including engineers and program managers, who are organized by customer and product type (ride control and emission control).  In 2015, the company served more than 70 different OEMs and commercial truck and off-highway engine manufacturers worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   For aftermarket sales, however, the sale force covers multiple product lines and sells aftermarket products through four primary channels of distribution: The traditional three-step distribution system of full-line warehouse distributors, jobbers, and installers; the two-step distribution system of full-line warehouse distributors that carry only specified automotive product groups and installers; direct sales to retailers; and direct sales to installer chains. The company also serves locomotive, agricultural, construction and commercial truck and off-highway markets.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After posting net sales of a record-setting $8.4 billion in 2014, Tenneco's saw its net sales decrease 3% to $8.2 billion in 2015. Its profits increased by 9% to $247 million and its operating cash flow surged by 52% to $517 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2015 was fueled by decreased sales from its ride performance and clean air division product lines. Ride performance revenue decreased in North America due to lower light vehicle and commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle volumes, partially offset by higher aftermarket sales. In the Asia Pacific region, higher volumes, mostly due to higher light vehicle production volumes in China, were partially offset by lower volumes in Australia.

  <p>
   The company focuses on growth through increasing production volumes, launching new technology, and geographic expansion, both organically and via strategic acquisitions and alliances. Tenneco is also eying adjacent markets to expand its portfolio of products and systems. Not limiting itself to passenger cars or medium-size trucks, the company is positioning its emissions and ride control systems for heavy-duty trucks, buses, and agricultural and construction equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tenneco supplies clean air and ride performance products to more than 340 platforms globally. In 2015, it launched 144 programs with 70 customers. To support new vehicle launches and customer growth, the company opened new manufacturing facilities in the US, Poland, and India and significantly expanded its operations in Mexico.

  <p>
   In 2014 Tenneco acquired exclusive rights to the digital valve technology (previously licensed from Sturman) used in Tenneco's DRiV suspension products. DRiV is a suspension system designed by Tenneco featuring electronically controlled dampers with hydraulic valves for use in automotive, light and heavy-duty trucks, off-road equipment, locomotives, and other vehicle damping applications.

  <p>
   Tennessee Gas and Transmission began in 1943 as a division of the Chicago Corporation, headed by Gardiner Symonds and authorized to build a pipeline from West Virginia to the Gulf of Mexico. With the US facing WWII fuel shortages, the group finished the project in 11 months.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII, Tennessee Gas went public with Symonds as president. It merged its oil and gas exploration interests into Tennessee Production Company (1954), which with Bay Petroleum (bought 1955) became Tenneco Oil in 1961. Symonds acquired complementary firms and entered the chemical industry by buying 50% of Petro-Tex Chemical in 1955.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tenneco Oil moved its headquarters to Houston in 1963 to better ship natural gas from the Texas Gulf Coast. Symonds bought Packaging Corporation of America, a maker of shipping containers, pulp, and paperboard products, in 1965. A year later the company, which had become a conglomerate, adopted the Tenneco name.
