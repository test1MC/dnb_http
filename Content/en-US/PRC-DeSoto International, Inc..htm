   PRC-DeSoto has benefited from post-recession overall industrial growth in the US (in particular in the aerospace industry) due in part to declining natural gas costs.

   In 2013 it expanded its aerospace business operations in Japan with the relocation of its application support center to a site in Miyoshi that supports increased production capacity, adds warehouse space and affords new service capabilities. The new site in Miyoshi Kurozasa Industrial Park has expanded capacity for custom packaging of premixed frozen sealant with this larger plant to support increased commercial and regional aerospace demand.
