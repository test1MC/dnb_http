   With Pasteur in its name, you might rightly guess that Sanofi Pasteur MSD Limited has something to do with vaccinations. The company makes and markets a range of vaccines for adults and children in the UK, as well as for those traveling abroad; it is the largest producer of vaccines in the UK. It makes more than 20 vaccines including those for influenza, polio, hepatitis A and B, rabies (discovered by namesake Louis Pasteur), yellow fever, and tetanus. The company also markets Gardasil, a vaccine against types of human papillomavirus (HPV) known to cause cervical cancer. It is part of the European Sanofi Pasteur MSD organization, which is a joint venture between the vaccine divisions of drugmakers

   and

   In addition to manufacturing and marketing its existing vaccines, the Sanofi Pasteur MSD organization conducts vaccination research on behalf of its parent companies. It has a number of programs in various R&amp;D stages, including a new pediatric combination vaccine with six components (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, flu, and hepatitis B). Other development projects include potential vaccines for AIDS, meningitis, dengue fever, and pandemic flu.

   The company invests 12% of its sales in R&amp;D.

  <p>
   The global Sanofi Pasteur MSD organization, which is based in France and distributes products to health care clients in some 20 European countries, was formed by Sanofi's vaccines division (
   <company id="161206">
    Sanofi Pasteur
   </company>
   ) and Merck's vaccines business in 1994 to jointly produce and market vaccines for the European community. Each of its parents own a 50% stake in the firm. Both Sanofi and Merck market vaccine products independently in other regions of the world.
