   To grow, EMP has invested in a number of facility expansions, manufacturing advancements, including robotics automation, and business acquisitions, to support its evolving customer base. Its mini-Hybrid Thermal conversion kits are gaining a following in civil sectors. Among the first, three Michigan cities have used federal stimulus money to retro-fit some of their diesel buses with the conversion kits. The kits, considerably less expensive than replacing buses with electric hybrids, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce emissions and noise to levels comparable to green models.
