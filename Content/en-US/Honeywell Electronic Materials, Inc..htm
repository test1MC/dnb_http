   Honeywell Electronic Materials (HEM), a unit of
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell International
   </company>
   , develops and manufactures chemicals and specialty materials used in the production of semiconductors, flat-panel displays, and printable electronics, as well as in photovoltaic (PV) applications. Its offerings include dielectric and metal thin films, interconnect and optoelectronic materials, and processing chemicals (such as etchants, acids, and solvents) used at various points in the chip manufacturing cycle. HEM is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies segment, one of the industrial conglomerate's smaller operating groups.

  <p>
   HEM's strategy is built around advanced research investments, global partnerships, and close collaboration with its customers. In 2014 it introduced new copper manganese (CuMn) sputtering targets used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The new targets last twice as long, which means manufacturers don't need to buy as many and don't have to waste production time changing out the targets and cleaning the chambers. Also that year it introduced a new low alpha plating anode (designed to reduce alpha particle emissions) for semiconductor packaging.
