   Onyx Pharmaceuticals' cancer drug is a real gem. Working with health care behemoth
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer

   , the biotechnology company developed Nexavar, an

    FDA

   -approved treatment for advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer. The partners are jointly promoting the drug in the US, while Bayer handles marketing duties in the European Union and elsewhere. Onyx and Bayer are also testing the drug as a possible treatment for other kinds of cancer, both alone and in combination with other therapies. The company also sells Kyprolis for multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) and has additional drug licensing and research operations. In 2013 Onyx agreed to be acquired by

  <p>
   The company accepted a $10.4 billion cash buyout offer from Amgen in August 2013. Earlier that year, it had rejected as too low a June 2013 buyout offer of $8.7 billion from Amgen, and began soliciting bids from other potential suitors.

  <p>
   Onxy has its principal operations in the US. To begin to build a global presence, the company established a European headquarters in Switzerland in 2010.

  <p>
   Onyx's success has largely been dependent on the performance of Nexavar, both in the market and in further clinical trials. Sales of Nexavar account for about 80% of revenues. As such, the company is working to expand Nexavar indications for conditions including thyroid and breast cancers; Bayer is also promoting the drug's sales in emerging markets. Onyx and Bayer began co-promoting another cancer drug, Stivarga (regorafenib) for colorectal cancer, in the US market during 2012 following the drug's approval by the FDA; the two companies developed the drug through a collaborative effort.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, Onyx is also looking to bring additional drugs to market to reduce its reliance on Nexavar royalty payments from Bayer. In 2012 it gained FDA approval of its lead proprietary cancer candidate, Kyprolis (carfilzomib).

  <p>
   Onyx and Bayer both market Nexavar through their respective direct sales forces in the US market. Bayer has full rights to market Nexavar in Europe and other international markets, and it acquired full rights to the drug in the Japanese market when the two companies amended their collaboration agreement in 2011. Onyx built up its commercial infrastructure in 2011 and 2012 to prepare for the regulatory approval and launch of Kyprolis.

  <p>
   Annual revenue fell 19% in 2012 to $362 million in 2012 due to lower contract revenues, which was offset by new earnings from the Kyprolis launch and new royalty income on Stivarga. Revenues for Onyx showed growth in the years prior to 2012, including a 38% increase in 2011 to some $447 million on increased sales of Nexavar and new contract revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Onxy's profits have fluctuated over the last five years. For instance, net income fell into the red in 2012 on increased operating revenues (including R&amp;D and marketing expenses related to the approval and launch of Kyprolis) following annual net income growth in 2011.

  <p>
   Onyx's R&amp;D programs are conducted independently and through collaborations, and the firm regularly looks to acquire, license, or collaborate on new therapeutic drug candidates. The firm has potential therapies for other types of cancer malignancies and tumors in development stages, as well as research programs for anti-inflammatory and immune system targets.

  <p>
   Onyx's carflizomib candidate was added to the Onyx pipeline in 2009 through the acquisition of private biotech firm Proteolix for $275 million, plus another $535 million in potential milestone payments.
