   GF Health Products helps patients gain ground. A leading maker of wheelchairs, the company (also known as Graham-Field) also manufactures and distributes medical and surgical supplies, diagnostics, rehabilitative and respiratory equipment, home safety products, pressure management equipment, specialized furnishings, and lifts and other mobility aids. Brands include Lumex, Grafco, Basic American, Lumiscope, Labtron, Hausted, John Bunn, and Everest &amp; Jennings; it also distributes products from other manufacturers. GF's clients fall into four main categories: primary care, home care, long-term care (nursing homes), and acute care (hospitals).

  <p>
   The company's offerings are distributed globally in more than 80 countries. GF has about half a dozen distribution centers across the US located in Doraville, Georgia; Edison, New Jersey; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Los Angeles, California; and St. Louis, Missouri. Its manufacturing locations include plants in Doraville, Georgia; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; and Warwick, Rhode Island. It also has manufacturing operations in the US and overseas, some of which are conducted through partnerships with third-party suppliers.

  <p>
   The company's 4,000 products are marketed by its direct sales staff (including field sales and inside sales teams) in the US. It distributes its products (as well as third-party offerings) through its own domestic distribution facilities.

  <p>
   GF expands its offerings by developing new products, as well as by moving existing products into new markets. New lines introduced in 2012 include several Lumex-branded items: Patriot LX home care beds, Set n' Go rolling seats (rollators), and support cushions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also occasionally grows through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2012 the company formed a strategic alliance with Fastrack Healthcare Systems to integrate the GF product catalog and price list into Fastrack's e-commerce and inventory management modules; the move will help customers improve ordering and inventory processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company initiated a "Made in the USA" program to move some of its international manufacturing operations back to the US to allow for more product customization. Efforts to increase domestic production include the licensing of a line of therapeutic pressure management support surfaces from Simmons in 2012; the company's Georgia manufacturing plant began production of the surfaces shortly after. The licensing deal also expanded GF's offerings for institutional health care providers.

  <p>
   The company furthered its "Made in the USA" initiative through two acquisitions in 2012 and 2013. It purchased Pressure Management Group (PMG) in Jacksonville, Florida, to add pressure reduction support products in 2012, and in 2013 GF acquired Hausted Patient Handling Systems, a maker of stretchers, chairs, and other patient transport equipment. The PMG and Hausted manufacturing processes and equipment were relocated to two existing GF plants.

  <p>
   GF Health Products was formed in 2003 to purchase the assets of the former Graham-Field entity, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999. The GF Health Products buyout was backed by Graham-Field's officers and bondholders.
