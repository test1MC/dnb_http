   In 2013
   <company id="11139">
    PPG Industries
   </company>
   merged its commodity chemicals business with Georgia Gulf in a $2.1 billion deal and the company became Axiall.
  </p>
  <p>
   Georgia Gulf bought the company in 2006 for $1.5 billion. Burdened with debt and facing the construction industry's downturn, Georgia Gulf was forced to cut costs and sell some Royal assets. It has closed several Royal Group plants since the acquisition and streamlined operations. In 2007, the company exited the window coverings extrusion business. The following year, it sold Royal Outdoor to Fenclo for $12 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the Georgia Gulf acquisition, Royal Group had a tumultuous decade that included investigations by US regulators and the Canadian Mounties. In 2008 former Royal executives, including the company's founder Vittorio De Zen, were charged in Canada with fraud. De Zen is fighting allegations that he and others defrauded the company for some $29 million.
