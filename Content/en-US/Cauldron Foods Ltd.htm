   company makes a chilled and frozen meat-free lineup of food products under the Cauldron brand name.

   <company id="40427">
    Sainsbury's
   </company>
   and
   <company id="90426">
    Tesco
   </company>
   , throughout the UK. Its suppliers have long term agreements with growers in Canada, China, and Europe, sourced from strict sustainable areas where beans must be grown in ways that are organically, ecologically, and ethically wholesome.

   Bolstered by funding for marketing activities and a  broader distribution, Cauldron looks to benefit under a revamped business strategy that educates consumers about the line's contribution to a healthy lifestyle. To this end, the brand is targeted for even wider distribution coupled with an investment in new product launches and promotional efforts. Competition from other meat-free offerings, however, is high; Cauldron shares the category with the Linda McCartney Foods, made under license by

    Hain

   , and
   <company id="108191">
    Amy's Kitchen

   , among several.

   Exponent is looking to drive a turnaround in Cauldron and Quorn products as consumer interest in meat-free products heats up. Following a slump in 2010, sales of Cauldron products jumped more than 10% in 2011,
