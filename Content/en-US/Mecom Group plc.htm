   Mecom Group aims to corner the market on regional newspapers in Northern and Eastern Europe. The company claims about 1 million subscribers for its 20 paid titles, which are published in the Netherlands and Denmark. It operates through Wegener and LMG in the Netherlands (where titles include
   <em>
    De Gelderlander
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Limburgs Dagblad
   </em>
   daily newspapers) and Berliingske Media in Denmark (where titles include
   <em>
    Berlingske
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    BT
   </em>
   national daily newspapers). In addition, Mecom publishes nearly 200 free weekly newspapers and websites. Altogether the titles attract some 10 million readers.

  <p>
   Mecom generates nearly 60% of its sales in the Netherlands, where it publishes eight daily newspapers; in Demark, the company publishes three national dailies and seven regional dailies.

   Mecom saw sales fall more than 10% in 2013 (to â‚¬808 million) as advertising dropped more than 20% and circulation revenue declined by 4%. Along with most publishers, the company has been struggling with a poor advertising environment, which it expects to continue through 2014.

  <p>
   The company has been streamlining operations in recent years. In 2013 it disposed of a range of assets, including an automotive classified website in the Netherlands and multiple free-sheet titles in Denmark; Mecom also divested non-controlling stakes in several other publications and operations. Also that year it sold the last of its Polish operations (where it had done business for years).

   At the same time, the company is expanding its digital offerings by publishing special digital-only content, encouraging print subscribers to register for online editions, implementing a pay-for-access model to news websites for non-subscribers, and introducing mobile apps.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mecom is also focused on cost-cutting measures amid continued macro-economic woes. It closed the Enschede print plant in 2013, reduced operations at the Heerlen print plant, and ceased publication of the weekly
   <em>
    WeekendGazet,
   </em>
   among other actions.

  <p>
   The company was founded in 2000 by David Montgomery, a former CEO of
   <company id="93625">
    Mirror Group
   </company>
   . A journalist in Ireland and England before becoming a media mogul, he earned a reputation for cost cutting at many of the newspapers Mecom bought out.
