   Since your face is a veritable canvas, Shiseido wants to be the paint. As the largest cosmetics manufacturer in Japan, Shiseido makes and markets makeup and skin care products for men and women. It also manufactures toiletries, sun care items, fragrances, professional salon hair care products, and pharmaceuticals. Its 20-plus brands include namesake Shiseido, Elixir Superieur, Maquillage, and Integrate; they're sold in department stores, as well as chain, general merchandise and drugstores. Other interests include specialty fragrance, and hair and skin care salons. In addition, it owns a French cuisine restaurant in Tokyo called L'osier, and The Shiseido Parlour western-style restaurant chain.

  <p>
   Arinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist for the Japanese navy, established Japan's first modern drugstore, Shiseido Pharmacy, in 1872. Attracted by the store's Western-style products and format, the customers were the nobility and the rich. Shiseido manufactured Japan's first toothpaste in 1888 and introduced its first cosmetics product (Eudermine, a skin lotion) in 1897. Fukuhara opened the country's first soda fountain in 1902, later adding ice cream, a rarity in Japan at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arinobu's third son, Shinzo, created Shiseido's first extensive makeup lines, introducing flesh-toned face powder in 1906, hair tonic in 1915, shaded face powder in 1917 (in hues from white to purple), and a fragrance line and cold cream in 1918. Under Shinzo's influence, cosmetics replaced drugs as Shiseido's mainstay.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shiseido began franchise operations in 1923 and business boomed. The firm went public that year; in 1927 Shinzo became Shiseido's first president. In 1937 the company began issuing its Hanatsubaki ("Camellia") magazine (a cultural magazine featuring fashion, travel, arts, and literary commentaries), which is still issued on a monthy basis. During WWII the company couldn't make cosmetics, only medicines, and many of Shiseido's factories were destroyed. This led to near-bankruptcy in 1945, but Shiseido rebounded the next year, thanks to nail enamel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1951 it introduced its de Luxe high-end cosmetics line, and by 1956 it had become the #1 Japanese cosmetics firm. With moves into Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Hawaii in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Shiseido began overseas operations. It steadily expanded its international business by setting up subsidiaries across the world, including one in New York City in 1965, and in Italy in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Shiseido failed at marketing its products in the US, and at home its market share was slipping. Seen as being out of touch with the young, it was also hampered by strict product development laws that caused delays in getting products to market. In the mid-1980s it developed a successful US marketing strategy that included selling exclusive product lines in high-end department stores such as Macy's; it also made several acquisitions, including Zotos (hair products, US, 1988).

   The firm's first prescription-only drug, an ophthalmological treatment used in certain types of cataract surgery and cornea transplants, was launched in 1993. In 1996 it announced a biological compound that retards skin aging by preventing oxidization. The company bought the Helene Curtis salon hair care business in the US and Canada from Unilever that year. In 1997 Shiseido bought Helene Curtis Japan salon hair operations and a New Jersey factory, which more than doubled its North American production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1997 Akira Gemma (a Shiseido veteran of nearly four decades) became CEO, and the company expanded to Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Vietnam. It bought the professional salon products business of the US's Lamaur Corporation in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shiseido opened a New York City flagship store in 1998 and began selling cosmetics in Russia in 1999. It also began selling soap, shampoo, and baby powder in 1999 under the wildly popular Hello Kitty name, licensed from Japanese media firm Sanrio. Late that year Shiseido introduced Clé de Peau Beauté to international markets as its top-of-the-line beauty brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to expand its foreign brands portfolio, in June 2000 Shiseido bought the Sea Breeze line of facial products from Bristol-Myers Squibb; it also acquired 75% of French cosmetics firm and aromatherapy specialists Laboratoires Decléor. In June 2001 Morio Ikeda took over for Gemma as president and CEO; Gemma was named chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Shiseido, together with Limited Brands (later renamed
   <company id="11471">
    L Brands
   </company>
   ), introduced a new retail beauty company called aura science. One of 10 outlets planned to open in major US cities, the first aura science store was opened in Columbus, Ohio, that April. In the fall of 2003, the introduction of two new fragrances under the brand name FCUK (French Connection United Kingdom) by Shiseido's Zirh International subsidiary was met with vocal protest from some consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shiseido reorganized its operations in China in 2004. Worldwide, the company has reorganized its business into five divisions: Global Cosmetics, Regional Cosmetics, Professional, Toiletries, and Diversified. As Shinzo Maeda replaced Ikeda as chief executive in mid-2005, he made plans to continue Shiseido's makeover begun by Ikeda in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shiseido Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., a joint venture, was formed in early 2005 through a partnership with Warisan TC Holdings Berhad. Since 1977 a division of Warisan, Tung Pao Sdn. Bhd., has distributed Shiseido brands in Malaysia.
