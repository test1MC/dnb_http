   Lantronix tracks its operations in a couple of ways. In one, it looks at legacy products, which are those released before mid-2012, and new product, which were released more recently. Legacy products carry the load for the company, generating 84% of revenue with the rest coming from new products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lantronix also measures it products designed for the Internet of Things and those for enterprise functions. Enterprise products produced 51% of revenue while IoT products generated the remainder.

        <p>
   Lantronix sells its products worldwide in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and the Asia-Pacific region. The Americas is its largest market, accounting for about 54% of sales, followed by EMEA, 30%, and Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, both 8%.

        <p>
   Customers who use Lantronix's products are in building and industrial automation, energy, IT and data centers, medical, security, transportation, and the public sector. The company's top five customers are all distributors and make up more than half of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lantronix has kicked off a global push to build awareness of the Lantronix brand by securing sales and marketing partnerships with market-leading resellers, such as New York's DataVision Computer Video.

        <p>
   Lantronix's revenue slid 3.6% to $42.9 million in 2015 from 2014. Sales of both IoT and Enterprise products fell. Both segments were hurt by declines in the sales of the legacy products in their portfolios. As a group legacy sales dropped 10% in 2015 while revenue from the company's new products rose 48%.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reported a loss of $1.8 million in 2015, which was deeper than its 2014 loss of just less than $1 million. Besides less robust sales, the company increased spending on research and development in 2015.
  </p>
        <p>
   Lantronix sent cash out at the tune of $1.6 million in 2015, close to the 2014 outflow of $1.5 million.

        <p>
   Lantronix wants to use its networking expertise to become a supplier to the Internet of Things. Estimates call for billion of devices will be hooked to the IoT in the next few years and Lantronix seeks to control a number of them. It also works to differentiate its products through proprietary technologies such as SmartRoam, which provides dynamic access point selection.

        <p>
   In 2015, the company signed an agreement with the Avnet Electronics Marketing Americas business region of
