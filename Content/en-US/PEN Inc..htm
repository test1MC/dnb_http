   Applied Nanotech Holdings hopes to make it big by thinking small. The company conducts research on carbon nanotubes -- molecular-sized cylindrical structures that could be used in making electronic displays and other products. Applied Nanotech derives most of its revenues from contracts with agencies of the US government or by doing research on a contract basis with other entities. The company is developing nanomaterials for use in epoxies, glass fibers, and nylons. Other applications of carbon nanotube technology are in conductive inks (used in communications instrumentation, flexible electronics, printed circuit boards, and radio-frequency identification tags), sensors, and thermal management.

   The company's Electronic Billboard Technology (EBT) subsidiary sold its intellectual property to Novus Communications Technologies in 2006 and received royalties from Novus Partners, a unit of Novus Communications. As part of the consideration, EBT received a 25% equity stake in Novus Displays, a new entity formed by Novus Communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The EBT subsidiary was originally established to make outdoor display products, but then changed its focus to making indoor displays before shifting to licensing its patented E-Window technology to manufacturers. EBT hadn't produced any revenue for the company since 2002, however.

   In 1998 the company acquired 62 patents and pending patents on carbon film-based film emission technology held by the defunct Microelectronics &amp; Computer Technology Corp. (MCC). It is required to pay a royalty of 2% on sales of products related to these patents, but can offset these royalties with certain expenses. The company has yet to pay any royalties on MCC-derived products.
