   Aquinox wants nothing more than to raise money by reducing inflammation. The pharmaceutical company is developing treatments for inflammation and cancer occurring in parts of the body with a high concentration of mucus membranes, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts. Its lead candidate, AQX-1125, is in separate trials as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bladder pain syndrome, which are both caused by inflammation. While the company doesn't discuss other candidates in its pipeline, it is planning to target other mucosal inflammation conditions including those affecting the sinuses, kidneys, esophagus, and bowel. Aquinox was formed in 2003 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company intends to use most of the $46 million it raised in its IPO to fund continued clinical trials for its AQX-1125 along with developing a manufacturing process. It will also use a small portion for development of other candidates.

  <p>
   Aquinox has no approved product so it has no revenue. Spending, mostly on R&amp;D, has left the company with an accumulated deficit of $66 million, which it expects to continue adding to for the foreseeable future.

  <p>
   Going forward the company plans to expand the indications for AQX-1125 by targeting large, under-served markets for inflammation treatments. For its next generation candidates, Aquinox will actively seek partnerships for development and commercialization.
