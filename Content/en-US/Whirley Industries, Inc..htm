   Whirley Industries (doing business as Whirley-DrinkWorks!) is the company behind those collectible cups and mugs filling kitchen cabinets. The firm designs and manufactures promotional drinkware for theme parks, sports venues, convenience stores, and other businesses. The company's Toppers line casts colorful animals and licensed characters atop the lids of plastic cups. In addition to its cups and straws, Whirley Industries creates specialty lunchboxes and popcorn buckets for children, and insulated coffee containers and barware for adults. The company also produces self-serve slush stands that can be installed at festivals, water parks, and zoos.
