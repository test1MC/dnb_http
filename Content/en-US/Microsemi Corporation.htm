   Microsemi is on a power trip. The company makes power management semiconductors that regulate and condition electricity to make it more usable by electrical and electronic systems. Its products include discrete components, such as diodes and rectifiers, along with integrated circuits, such as amplifiers and voltage regulators. Microsemi also makes devices for pacemakers, GPS products, LCD TVs, and wireless networks. The company's high-reliability semiconductors go into jet engines, missile systems, oilfield equipment, and satellites. Top customers have included big names like
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing

   ,
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>

    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10903">

  <p>
   Microsemi's operations are aligned across four main end markets. Products in the communications market account for 36% of its total sales and include broadband power amplifier and monolithic microwave integrated circuits used in wi-max and wireless LAN devices and monitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Defense and security products account for 27% of total sales and feature mixed-signal analog integrated circuits and a wide array of modules and products used for radar and communications, homeland security, threat detection, and power conversion systems for military platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace products account for 21% of sales and are used for aircraft, jets, satellites, and cockpit electronics. The last segment, industrial, accounts for the remaining 20% of sales and sells power modules, diodes, and high-voltage assemblies used in industrial equipment, semiconductor capital equipment, and solar power technology.

  <p>
   Microsemi has operations in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Oregon. Internationally it has a presence in China, Ireland, the UK, and the Philippines as well as Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand. US customers generate 49% of its sales, followed by Asia, 32%, and Europe, 15%.

  <p>
   Microsemi's sales jumped 9% higher to $1.25 billion in 2015 from 2014, lifted by increases in all product lines and geographies. The communications business added $407 million in revenue (an 11% increase) with higher sales of broadband gateway applications and voice circuits, as well as contributions from the acquisitions of Vitesse in 2015 and Symmetricom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 266% in 2015 to $84.6 million on higher revenue and a 50% reduction in restructuring and severance costs from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Microsemi generated some $270 million cash flow from operations in 2015, up from $206.7 million in 2014.

  <p>
   While maintaining its traditional strongholds in businesses such as military and aerospace equipment, Microsemi is targeting niche commercial markets for growth. Some of the markets identified by the company include the digital media, GPS navigation, medical, and wireless communications industries. The company is looking to develop more high-margin products for emerging industries, such as alternative energy, to reinforce growth in its core markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   As another part of its growth strategy, Microsemi makes acquisitions that add to or expand its product lines.

  <p>
   In 2016, Microsemi completed its acquisition of
   <company id="14609">
    PMC-Sierra
   </company>
   , a maker of chips for networking applications, for $2.5 billion in cash. Microsemi had dueled with
   <company id="11694">
    Skyworks
   </company>
   to determine which would buy PMC-Sierra. Microsemi ended up outbidding Skyworks by about $500 million. The deal will provide Microsemi with a wider and deeper product portfolio without cannibalizing its current lineup.
  </p>
  <p>
   Microsemi in 2015 bought
   <company id="11034">
    Vitesse
   </company>
   , a maker of networking infrastructure devices and components. The deal is intended to shore up Microsemi's offering for the Internet of Things market.

  <p>
   Microsemiconductor Corporation started in 1960 as a maker of power conditioning equipment. Early acquisitions included two lines of semiconductors from Globe Union. Philip Frey joined the company as CEO and president in 1971. It went public in 1981 and changed its name to Microsemi in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the mid-1980s and early 1990s, military business accounted for up to 75% of sales. By means of acquisitions Microsemi consolidated its clout as a military contractor and diversified its customer base. In 1992 it bought a semiconductor manufacturing division of Unitrode -- a purchase that also increased its presence in Europe and Asia. Other acquisitions included units from
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   (1995), SGS-Thomson (now
   <company id="42481">
    STMicroelectronics
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   (1996), PPC Products (1997), and
   <company id="16012">
    BKC Semiconductors
   </company>
   and Semicon (1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   Microsemi sold its low-growth contract circuit board assembly operations in 1998. It formed a development pact with
   <company id="100720">
    Advanced Power Technology
   </company>
   (APT) that year to expand in the medical market. In 1999 Microsemi acquired
   <company id="14718">
    SymmetriCom
   </company>
   's Linfinity Microelectronics subsidiary (power management products for consumer electronics) and Narda Microwave's semiconductor operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 former Linfinity president James Peterson replaced Frey as CEO (Frey remained chairman until 2002). The following year saw Microsemi acquire Compensated Devices and New England Semiconductor, both makers of electronic components primarily for aerospace customers.
