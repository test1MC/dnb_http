   To better serve its aviation and defense clientele, the company established a subsidiary in 2012 dedicated to the market. Known as ARINC Aerospace, it specializes in the modification, modernization, upgrade, and maintenance of aircraft for military, government, and commercial customers. As part of the restructuring, in late 2012 ARINC divested its Defense Systems Engineering and Support division to

    Booz Allen Hamilton
   </company>
   in a deal worth $154 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARINC continues to pursue growth opportunities overseas. Aviator Airport Alliance sites in Norway started using ARINC AviNet Enterprise Hub messaging service in 2015. With ARINC eHub, Aviator sends and receives critical aviation operational messages -- such as passenger and cargo data -- for its airline customers in Norway.
