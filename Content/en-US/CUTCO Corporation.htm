   CUTCO cuts up in the kitchen and on the battlefield. Founded in 1949, the company's CUTCO Cutlery subsidiary makes more than 100 kitchen cutlery items, such as butcher knives, paring knives, flatware, and other kitchen utensils. Its cutlery is sold in North America through CUTCO retail stores and home demonstrations by subsidiary
   <company id="121737">
    Vector Marketing
   </company>
   . CUTCO International markets the company's products outside North America. In addition, its KA-BAR Knives unit makes fighting and utility knives for the US military, along with hunting, fishing, and pocket knives that are sold by retailers worldwide. The company's Schilling Forge business provides precision forgings of medical instruments, hand tools, and cutlery.

  <p>
   The company's primary cutlery subsidiary represents the largest manufacturer and marketer of high-quality kitchen cutlery and accessories in the US and Canada. Outside North America, CUTCO serves customers through its CUTCO International unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   CUTCO boasts a small but growing retail stores network, operating shops in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Lansing (Michigan), and Erie (Pennsylvania). It maintains more than 700 employees at its Vector Marketing headquarters in Olean, New York, who focus on manufacturing and administration.

  <p>
   The company primarily sells its CUTCO-branded products through home demonstrations, many of which are conducted by college students. CUTCO generates about 65% of revenues through home demonstrations of kitchen knives during June, July, and August.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product prices vary greatly -- from almost $50 for a paring knife to about $160 for a cleaver, while kitchen-knife sets can reach some $1,000. The selling point of CUTCO's high-priced knives (all of which are made in the US) is that its cutlery will be the last that customers will need to buy, thanks to the Forever Guarantee. The guarantee allows free sharpening of all CUTCO knives, no receipt required; even cutlery that was given as a gift or handed down by family members qualify under the guarantee. Noncutlery products, such as cookware and flatware, also qualify for the Forever Guarantee, as they can be replaced because of regular use.
  </p>
  <p>
   Retail stores have also become an important channel for CUTCO. These brick-and-mortar locations allow the company to display its product line and reconnect with existing customers. Adding a store in Indianapolis in 2011, the company aims to grow its brick-and-mortar network to about 150 locations nationwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it logs strong growth in North America, CUTCO has pulled back on its plans to expand internationally. It experienced failed attempts to develop its business in Australia, Costa Rica, Germany, and the UK, with mild successes in Canada and South Korea.

  <p>
   CUTCO sells its products directly to customers through home demonstrations. It also boasts a small stores network for retail sales. Its primary sales message that draws customers to its products is its Forever Guarantee, which not only offers free sharpening and no receipt required, but is transferable from owner to owner.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the past 15 years, CUTCO boasts that it has grown its product line substantially through brand recognition and brand preference without the use of formal mass marketing. It believes that with an investment of as little as $2 million, the company could increase word-of-mouth brand recognition and boost revenues by up to $20 million.
