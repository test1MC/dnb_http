   Extra! Extra! Read all about it -- then you can stuff it inside your walls. U.S. GreenFiber makes cellulose building insulation from 85% recycled content including newsprint and other paper products, much of which is collected at community recycling centers. The company operates a dozen manufacturing plants; its products are sold to the US and Canadian construction industries (both residential and commercial) as well as the do-it-yourself market. Founded in 2000 and active in the US and Canada, GreenFiber iis owned by private equity firm Tenex Capital Management.

  <p>
   To compete in the insulation market, which is dominated by fiberglass products, GreenFiber emphasizes the environmentally friendly nature of cellulose. It also gets communities involved in the recycling process. It partners with schools, churches, and local businesses to collect recyled paper and, in turn, contributes funds to community programs. Since 2000, GreenFiber has collected 3 million tons of paper that would have otherwise gone to landfills.

   GreenFiber products are available at major home centers and building supply stores and lumberyards in North America. A sales team also sells GreenFiber products to residential and commercial contractors, in addition to manufactured housing companies such as

  <p>
   Eric Oganesoff founded GreenStone Industries in 1993. He had been president of a cellulose insulation company since 1989 and struck out on his own, after higher-ups vetoed his consolidation plan. He raised money and bought cellulose insulation companies Parco (Nebraska) and United Fibers (Arizona) in exchange for partial ownership of GreenStone and management roles.
  </p>
  <p>
   GreenStone went public in 1994 and used the more than $9 million raised to consolidate small established companies. The next year acquisitions included companies in Virginia, Georgia, and Indiana. The company also increased its vertical integration by picking up a California curbside recycler, Pacific Rim Recycling. In addition to entering the recycling business, GreenStone's strategies for dealing with the rising cost of raw materials included price increases, using less-expensive fibers, and establishing long-term, fixed-price contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   By consolidating similar companies in the fragmented industry, the company reaped benefits from synergies in production, administration, purchasing, distribution, and marketing. Its acquisitions have also allowed GreenStone to build a regionally targeted national marketing network.
  </p>
  <p>
   GreenStone had eight manufacturing facilities when it was acquired by

   </company>
   in 1997. The following year it launched its Cocoon system, a total insulating package for contractors that includes application equipment, training, and certification programs. In 2000 Louisiana-Pacific combined its GreenStone operations with the U.S. Fiber operations of
   <company id="54239">
    Casella Waste Systems
   </company>
   to form the 50/50 joint venture U.S. GreenFiber.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the merger, the company continued to grow. It became a major supplier of alternative building supplies in the manufactured housing industry.
