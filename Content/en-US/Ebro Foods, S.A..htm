   Ebro Foods is kind of a comfort-food hero. The company (formerly Ebro Puleva) is one of the world's largest rice producers and it's the second largest manufacturer of pasta. It is also one of Spain's biggest food businesses. Ebro Foods sells about 60 brand food products in more than two dozen countries. Europe and the US are its core markets, followed by an increasing presence in Asia and Africa. Principal rice name brands are Brillante, Cigala, Nomen, and La Fallera. Its pasta business, led by

    New World Pasta
   </company>
   in North America, includes the Panzani and Birkel labels. Ebro Foods also invests in biotechnology through
   <company id="123039">
    Biosearch
   </company>
   . In addition, the company owns rice-growing subsidiaries in Egypt, India, and Thailand. In early 2017 the company plans to combine its rice and pasta businesses.

   In 2016 Ebro Foods announced it was merging three business units: Riviana Foods, American Rice, and New World Pasta Company. Effective in early 2017, the newly formed business unit will operate under the Riviana Foods banner and will combine Ebro Foods' rice and pasta businesses. The reorganization is expected to cut costs and facilitate future growth by streamlining operations, particularly the company's distribution networks.

   Continuing its international growth strategy in 2004, Ebro announced a 51% ownership of the newly created S&amp;B Herba, a UK rice company (the result of a merger between Ebro's subsidiary, Joseph Heap &amp; Sons, and Stevens &amp; Brotherton). Later that year Ebro acquired the Risella brand from Finnish company, Raisio, and almost 89% of US rice company
   <company id="41433">
    Riviana
   </company>
   . In 2005 it added Panzani, France's largest pasta, sauce, and semolina company. That year it also bought the Tarantella brand in the UK.

   Having acquired the Central American juice and biscuit operations of Riviana as part of the 2004 deal, Ebro sold them in 2006 for $205 million to a consortium made up of Colombia's Grupo Nacional de Chocolates SA and Costa Rica's Florida Ice &amp; Farm Co.

  <p>
   The company became one of the world's largest pasta makers with its 2006 acquisition of US noodle maker
   <company id="59059">
    New World Pasta
   </company>
   . The $362 million acquisition added New World's Ronzoni and American Beauty brands to Ebro's Riviana and Panzani brands, making the company a leading player in pasta production.

   From wheat to rice, it's "all the grain to me": In 2006 Ebro acquired

   Evolving, the company began exploring the possibility of either selling or spinning off its sugar business (Azucarera Ebro) in 2008. The restructuring of its operations due to EU reforms of the sugar sector had led to falling volumes at Azucarera. Some of Europe's largest sugar producers, including

   , and British Sugar, expressed interest in acquiring Azucarera. In 2009
   <company id="90033">
    Associated British Foods
   </company>
   , which owns British Sugar, won out and purchased Azucarera in a deal worth €385 million ($510 million). The sale of its sugar business allowed Ebro Foods to focus on its branded food operations.
