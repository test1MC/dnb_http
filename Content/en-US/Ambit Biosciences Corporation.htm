   Ambit Biosciences is using the scope of its expertise to find cures for hard-to-cure cancers. A biotechnology firm, Ambit discovers and develops drug therapies&#160;designed to&#160;treat aggressive or relapsed cancers. Its lead candidate, quizartinib, is a orally administered kinase inhibitor developed to treat cases of acute myeloid leukemia, a rare blood cancer. (Kinase is an enzyme involved in cell division other cellular functions.) The company is developing the therapy through a partnership with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   . Ambit&#160;also has candidates in development to treat other forms of cancer, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Ambit filed to go public in early 2013.

        <p>
   The company intends to use a portion of the proceeds its raises in its IPO (up to $57.5 million)&#160;to further develop, and eventually commercialize, its lead candidate, quizartinib.&#160;Ambit would also use the proceeds to develop other earlier-stage candidates, including its autoimmune and inflammatory disease&#160;treatments. The remaining IPO-related funds would be used for general corporate purposes. Ambit had initially filed an IPO in 2010 but withdrew it a year later.

   Like many biotech companies, Ambit does not earn revenue from products and has not been profitable since its inception. Although&#160;the company &#160;generates some revenue through collaboration agreements with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas
   </company>
   and other pharmaceutical companies,&#160;significant research and development costs and other ongoing&#160;expenses exceed its income. In lieu of the commercialization of its products, Ambit&#160;will&#160;continue to sustain itself by generating income from collaboration agreements and by attracting investors.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Aside from continued development of quizartinib, the company's growth strategy includes entering into strategic partnerships with biotech and other companies, with which it would share research and development costs and accelerate the commercialization process of candidates. The company and its key strategic partner, Astellas, currently share development and other costs associated with quizartinib. They agree to share profits if the therapy is sold commercially; as of 2013, the companies had not yet sought regulatory approval&#160;for quizartinib in the US.
