  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ADM Alliance makes regular acquisitions to boost its capacity and expand its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company extended its reach in Puerto Rico by buying a pair of feed manufacturers -- NutriMix Feed Company and Granossa Corporation -- that gave ADM Alliance a feed mill with port access, extensive storage, and strengthened its foothold in the Caribbean.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 ADM acquired English River Pellets (ERP), a grain elevator and animal feed manufacturing business in Iowa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subsequently, ADM Alliance entered the liquid animal feed business with the purchase of Colorado-based Cattleman's Choice Loomix, a producer of liquid animal feed supplements and ruminants, and in mid-2012 Nebraska-based Liquid Feed Commodities, another maker of liquid feed animal supplements. Both acquisitions are anticipated to increase ADM's share of the Midwest cow/calf industry by providing competitively better service at a lower price.

  <p>
   The company grew from a merger in 2002 of MoorMan's (acquired in 1997 by its parent company) with several independent animal feed businesses: Consolidated Nutrition, Supersweet, Master Mix, and Tindle Feeds.
