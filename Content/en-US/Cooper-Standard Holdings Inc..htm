   CSA is concentrating on fuel efficiency, supplying an increasing number of small cars, hybrids, and alternative powertrains that enjoy growing demand. Another focus for the company is using its global presence, which includes operations in 20 countries, to meet the burgeoning global footprint of OEMs, which have traditionally represented 82% of CSA sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better support its customers' growing global integration, CSA has been complementing its facilities in Western Europe with plants in Central and Eastern Europe. For its global operations as a whole the company has been creating a leaner manufacturing base by cutting waste, reducing costs, and boosting productivity.

  <p>
   The company has seen strong growth over the last five years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $3.34 billion in 2015. Profits also skyrocketed by more than 160% to reach $112 million in 2015 as its operating cash flow jumped by 58% for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by a surge in sales from the Asia Pacific due to additional revenue from a previous acquisition and improved sales volumes. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchanges. In addition, North America sales increased primarily due to an improvement in sales volume and product mix.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is focusing on developing four core product lines: Sealing Systems, Fuel and Brake Delivery Systems, Fluid Transfer Systems (including hose, transmission oil cooling and air conditioning lines), and Anti-Vibration Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking more opportunities in such emerging markets as China, India, Mexico, and South America, where light vehicles sales are growing, CSA has developed a joint venture strategy that has enabled the company to enter new markets with less exposure to risk and reduced capital investment. Its JV partners have included
   <company id="57065">
    Shanghai Automotive Industry
   </company>
   , Guyoung Technology, Hubei Jingda Precision Steel Pipe, Nishikawa Rubber, Toyoda Gosei, and Zhejiang Saiyang Seal Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   With about 20 design, engineering, and administration centers worldwide, the company also counts product development as another important strategy for growth. The company's research and development staff is focused on developing greener technology by creating more products made of lighter weight and recyclable materials, among other initiatives. CSA is also seeking growth in the commercial vehicle, off-highway, marine, and power sports markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout 2015 and 2016, CSA opened four new facilities across the important automotive market of China.
