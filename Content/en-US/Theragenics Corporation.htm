   Theragenics is waiting for you in the operating room. The company manufactures and distributes surgical products and radioactive implants known as brachytherapy seeds. Theragenics' surgical products unit makes specialty needles and vascular access products, including guidewires. Its wound closure products are used in both veterinary and human surgeries. Its TheraSeed and I-Seed products are tiny rice-sized implants used to fight early-stage prostate cancer. The devices release radiation within the tumor that kills cancerous cells with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Theragenics markets its products directly to hospitals and through distribution agreements throughout the US.

  <p>
   The company has grown its surgical products division through a number of acquisitions over the past several years; the unit now accounts for more than 70% of Theragenics' annual sales. Other lines in the surgical products business include micro-introducer kits, Elite HV introducer kits, radial access kits, and biopsy and pain management needles.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Theragenics' brachytherapy products account for less than 30% of the company's revenues, they are among the industry leaders. A key component of the company's TheraSeed is the radioactive isotope palladium-103. Theragenics is one of the world's largest producers of palladium-103. I-Seed is its iodine-125-based prostate cancer treatment device. Sales of brachytherapy products have softened in recent years as new therapies have been introduced. Concurrently, Medicare began reimbursing for the seeds at a lower rate while reimbursing more generously for IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy), which has prompted doctors and hospitals to switch treatment plans away from the seeds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues includes license fees for its TheraSphere brachytherapy device used to treat liver cancer and another delivery system that is used to treat breast cancer. Income from these license fees jumped 45% in 2011, which helped to offset slower growth in the sales of its other brachytherapy products.

   While Theragenics sells its brachytherapy products directly to hospitals, it also maintains several non-exclusive agreements with medical products distributors. The largest of these agreements is held with

   and accounts for 10% of the company's sales. Core Oncology had been a distributor of TheraSeed, but fell behind in payments. To secure what otherwise would have turned into losses, Theragenics bought up Core's brachytherapy customer base in early 2012. The new customers are likely to increase its sales of iodine-125 products.

   Like all medical device makers, Theragenics is hunkering down in anticipation of coming changes in health care legislation that could significantly increase the amount of taxes it would pay. To brace itself, the company is looking to trim operating costs through consolidation and reduction of redundancies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company received an acquisition proposal worth some $70 million from Juniper Investment Company. Theragenics stated that it would review the proposal, as well as other potential strategic alternatives.
