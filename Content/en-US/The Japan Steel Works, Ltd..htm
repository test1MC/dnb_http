   At The Japan Steel Works (JSW), steel is only the tip of the iceberg. JSW's industrial and plastics machinery division manufactures general machinery such as deck cranes, magnesium alloy injection molding machines, and film and sheet machinery. The company makes steel castings and forgings, steel plates, pressure vessels, and steel structures. It also manages and sells real estate. JSW's customers range from shipbuilders and manufacturers to companies in the chemicals, petrochemicals, and utility industries. The company gets approximately all of its sales from Japan.

   The company operates three manufacturing plants in Japan: Hiroshima, Muroran, and Yokohama. The Muroran plant (its original factory) includes a 14,000-ton hydraulic press and a 100-ton electro-slag remelting furnace. The plant's products include cast and forged steel products, environmental preservation systems and equipment, steel sheet and pipes, towers, and industrial machinery.
