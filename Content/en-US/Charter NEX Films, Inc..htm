   NEX Performance Films acquired Charter Films in January 2013 for an undisclosed amount. Both serve converters, who use films to produce flexible packaging for a variety of markets. NEX Performance Films brings expertise in monolayer, coextruded, and barrier films for flexible packaging, while Charter Films specializes in blown film extrusion for the agriculture, automotive, consumer goods, and food and beverage markets. Combined, the company plans to invest in additional extrusion capacity to meet growing demand from converters.

   Along these lines, in 2013 purchased two new Windmoeller &amp; Hoelscher 3-layer blown film lines to install in its Milton, Wisconsin, facility. The addition boosted the company's total lines up to 30.
