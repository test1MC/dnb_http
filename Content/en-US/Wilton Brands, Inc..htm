  <p>
   Wilton Brands works to be a leader in products needed for baking, cake decorating, and for making candy and cookies. It also provides the tools to help creative types make decor and other accessories for weddings, parties, and baby showers. Through its Wilton School of Cake Decorating and Confectionery Art, the company positions itself as an expert in these crafts, each year educating some 1,400 students who attend classes from 88 countries and all 50 US states.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company benefited from the downturn in the economy as more consumers turned to the company's crafts and other do-it-yourself endeavors as a way to save money and to search for their inner Martha Stewart until financial markets rebounded. To this end, sales of kitchen housewares have risen in the US.

  <p>
   To add depth to its brands portfolio and extend its reach globally, Wilton Brands in 2013 acquired Simplicity Creative Group. Buying the sewing and needle crafts company fuels the company's growth in desired international markets, as Simplicity Creative Group boasts offices in both New York and Tennessee and has a presence in the US, China, the UK, India, and Australia.
