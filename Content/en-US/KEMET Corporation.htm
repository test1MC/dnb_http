   KEMET is one of the world's largest makers of tantalum and multilayer ceramic capacitors -- devices that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and that are used in virtually all electronic devices. KEMET makes about 35 billion capacitors a year; its focus is on surface-mount capacitors, including specialized units for aerospace, automotive, communications systems, computers, and military equipment. The company also makes solid aluminum capacitors for high-frequency applications. More than 70% of its sales come from outside the US.

  <p>
   KEMET makes about three quarters of its revenue from its solid capacitors group, which produces tantalum, aluminum, polymer, and ceramic capacitors, with the rest coming from film and electrolytic, which produces film, paper, and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors.

  <p>
   Based in South Carolina, KEMET operates 21 production facilities in Mexico, China, Italy, the U.K., Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Indonesia, Germany, Bulgaria and Macedonia. It has two specialty electronics companies -- FELCO in Illinois and Dectron in Sweden.

  <p>
   KEMET sells its vast array of products (it has nearly 250,000 distinct part configurations) primarily to manufacturers, such as

    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>

   Since revenue peaked at more than $1 billion  in 2011, KEMET's revenue has declined year-to-year. It ended 2015 (ended March), with $823 million in revenue, a 1.24% drop from 2014. Sales in its biggest segment, solid capacitors, were down 1%. Foreign exchange rates and fewer sales of lower margin products cut tantalum product sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   KEMET trimmed its loss for the second straight year, reporting a $14 million loss in 2015, compared to a loss of $68 million in 2014. In 2015, proceeds from the sale of its machinery division and lower operating costs contributed to reduce the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported positive cash flow of $24.4 million in 2015, compared to outflow of $6.7 million in 2014.

  <p>
   KEMET is making changes through a program it calls the One KEMET campaign. The company has implemented standard practices and procedures throughout its businesses by working through programs such as Oracle 11iEBS and Lean and Six Sigma initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its campaign to sharpen its corporate focus, KEMET sold its machinery division in 2014 to Manz AG. KEMET had acquired the business as part of its purchase of Arcotronics Italia in 2007. The deal will help KEMET focus on designing, producing, and distributing electronic components as well as strategic initiatives such as its joint venture with NEC TOKIN, in which KEMET has 34% economic interest and 51% voting interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among KEMET's new products in the past year are tantalum capacitors for the automotive industry, which buys an increasing amount of electronic components. The new line of tantalum capacitors help automotive electronics handle the demands placed on systems such as driver assistance, energy recovery, and infotainment.

   KEMET bought IntelliData Inc., a developer of digital technologies for discovery, decision support, and the sales and marketing of electronic components. The company has been a KEMET vendor since 2000.

  <p>
   KEMET was founded in 1919 to facilitate
   <company id="11540">
    Union Carbide
   </company>
   's acquisition of Cooper Research, developer of a promising high-temperature alloy. The company's name melded the first syllables of "chemical" and "metallurgy." KEMET originally made vacuum tube components using the Cooper alloy. About 80% of the vacuum tubes used by the Allies in WWII employed KEMET components.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1950s, as the transistor began to replace the vacuum tube, KEMET refocused on capacitors. In the decades that followed, KEMET became a top capacitor supplier, first of solid tantalum components and later of multilayer ceramic designs. Over the years it boosted production capacity by building and expanding a series of plants in the US and Mexico.
