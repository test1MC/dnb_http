   Bobcat compact loaders have been drafted into service to defend lives. In conjunction with Bobcat,

   developed a kit to transform the company's compact or skid-steer loaders (in as little as 15 minutes) into remote-controlled robots that can dig up roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The kits include cameras and microphones that transfer sound and images to the remote operator.

   In 1958 farmer Eddie Velo asked blacksmith-inventor brothers Louis and Cyril Keller to make a compact loader light enough to be lifted to the second floor of his barn. The brothers partnered with North Dakota-based Melroe Manufacturing Company (which later became Bobcat) that same year, and the skid-steer loader was created.
