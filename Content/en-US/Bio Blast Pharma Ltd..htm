   Bio Blast Pharma is a development stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the licensing, development, and commercialization of drugs for rare and ultra-rare genetic and metabolic diseases. It is developing potential treatments for six diseases that are in various stages of clinical trials. Its list of product candidates includes Cabaletta, an intravenous (IV) solution of Trehalose (a protein stabilizer) used for the treatment of OPMD (also known as Kennedy's disease) and other muscle diseases. Another product candidate is its mitochondrial protein replacement platform (mPRT), which combats Friedreich's Ataxia and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD).

  <p>
   Bio Blast launched an IPO in the summer of 2014, raising $33 million. It is using the proceeds primarily to fund its clinical trials in addition to personnel-related costs, preclinical research, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.

  <p>
   Bio Blast has developed and in-licensed potential treatments for six diseases. One treatment is in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial and another one is in Phase 2 clinical studies. (An additional two is expected to be in mid to late stage clinical studies by late 2014 or early 2015.)

  <p>
   Since its inception in 2012, Bio Blast has not generated revenue from the sale of any product. It doesn't expect to generate significant revenue until it obtains marketing approval of its product candidates and commercializes them.

  <p>
   Bio Blast's strategy is to finish its trials as it grows its relationships to in-license promising product candidates while also commercializing its multiple product candidates on a global level.
