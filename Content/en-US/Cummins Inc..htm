   The company's 49 to 5,100 horsepower engines are made under the Cummins brand name. The Components segment manufactures products that are complementary to commercial diesel applications; more than 8,300 filtration products are offered, some branded as Fleetguard. Other products within this segment include turbo technologies for air handling in engines and exhaust after-treatment technology, as well as new, used, and remanufactured fuel systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Power Systems' standby power products (alternators, transfer switches, and controls) serve commercial and consumer needs, as well as those of the military. Brands include Onan (generator sets) and Stamford (alternators). Cummins' Distribution segment comprises a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributors that serve 190 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   It serves customers in 190 countries through a network of more than 600 company owned and independent distributor locations and 7,200 dealer locations. The US generates about 52% of its total sales. Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico,  and the UK collectively account for nearly 24%.

  <p>
   After revenues peaked at a record-setting $19.2 billion in 2014, Cummins saw its revenues dip slightly by 1% to $19.11 billion in 2015. The slight drop was the result of a 5% decline in each of its Engine and Power Systems segments during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engine segment was affected by fewer industrial engine sales in all markets. This was driven by lower global demand in the construction markets, primarily in North America, Europe, and China and reduced demand in global commercial marine markets. Power Systems sales decreased due to lower demand for alternator and power systems products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits also fell 15% from $1.7 billion in 2014 to $1.4 billion in 2015. This was fueled by the impairment of light-duty diesel assets and the cost of workforce reductions. In addition to decreases in both revenues and profits, Cummins posted a 9% decline in operating cash flow from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   The company's fortunes are shaped in large part by the cyclical booms and busts of the on-highway, construction, and industrial markets. Its customers are particularly sensitive to the general economic climate, interest rates, and access to credit, as well as regulatory issues (environmental and emissions standards) and political shifts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to mitigate a slump in demand in any one market or region, Cummins is continuing to transform itself from a company concentrated in North America to one whose business is seizing up opportunities in developing countries. Following the US, China, Brazil, Russia, and India are Cummins' largest markets. Despite the potential for tapping these markets,

  <p>
   Adhering to this strategy, in 2015 the company opened a new global logistics hub in Singapore, one of the company's eight master distribution centers for parts and filters globally. The Singapore Global Logistics Hub serves markets including the US, Europe, China, and India as well as customers across the Northeast and Southeast Asia regions.

   To increase its market penetration, the company also relies on joint ventures that allow it to reduce capital spending, streamline its supply chain management, and boost its technology development. Some of the partnering companies include

  <p>
   Chauffeur Clessie Cummins believed that Rudolph Diesel's cumbersome and smoky engine could be improved for use in transportation. Borrowing money and work space from his employer -- Columbus, Indiana, banker W. G. Irwin -- Cummins founded Cummins Engine in 1919. Irwin invested more than $2.5 million, and in the mid-1920s Cummins produced a mobile diesel engine. Truck manufacturers were reluctant to switch from gas to diesel, so Cummins used publicity stunts (such as racing in the Indianapolis 500) to advertise his engine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was profitable by 1937, the year Irwin's grandnephew, Irwin Miller, took over. During WWII the Cummins engine was used in cargo trucks. Sales jumped from $20 million in 1946 to more than $100 million by 1956. That year Cummins started its first overseas plant in Scotland, and bought Atlas Crankshafts in 1958. By 1967 it had 50% of the diesel-engine market.
