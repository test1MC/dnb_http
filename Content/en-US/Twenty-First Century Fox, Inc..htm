   Twenty-First Century Fox operates its business through the following segments: Cable Network Programming; Television; Filmed Entertainment; Direct Broadcast Satellite Television; and Other.

  </p>
        <p>
   Television, consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the US and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the US (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with the FOX Broadcasting Company ('FOX') and 10 are affiliated with Master Distribution Service, Inc. ('MyNetworkTV') and one is an independent station.
  </p>
        <p>
   Filmed Entertainment consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition to its cable and broadcasting network properties, Twenty-First Century Fox also provides content to millions of subscribers through its pay-television services in Europe and Asia, including
   <company id="139332">
    Sky Deutschland
   </company>
   , Sky Italia, and through equity interests in
   <company id="42747">
    Sky plc
   </company>
   and Tata Sky.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's Cable Network Programming segment accounted for about 55% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, while the Filmed Entertainment and Television segments accounted for 31% and 19% respectively.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Headquartered in New York City, the company operates principally in the US, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The US and Canada accounted for more than 70% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, while Europe accounted for about 12%.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company spends billions on advertising and marketing promotions every year. Its advertising expenses were $2.4 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company reported revenue of $27.32 billion for fiscal 2016. That was a decrease of $1.66 billion (or 6%) compared to its revenue during the prior fiscal year. The primary cause of the drop in revenue was the sale of the company's Direct Broadcast Satellite businesses in November 2014.
  </p>
        <p>
   Twenty-First Century Fox reported a net income of $2.75 billion in fiscal 2016. That was a decrease of $5.55 billion (or 67%) compared to fiscal 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in net income was decreased sales combined with increased expenses.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company ended fiscal 2016 with $3.04 billion in cash flow from operations, which was a decrease of $569 million (or 16%) compared to fiscal 2015.

        <p>
   In late 2016, Rupert Murdoch announced Twenty-First Century Fox had made an £11.7 billion bid for the remaining approximately 60% share of Sky plc that it didn't already own. The nature of the deal and the large market share the combined company would occupy makes it likely the deal will face a number of regulatory hurdles.
  </p>
        <p>
   In January 2016, Twenty-First Century Fox and Osterhout Design Group (ODG) entered into a prelminary agreement for 21st Century Fox to acquire a minority stake in ODG, a leading augmented and virtual reality and smartglasses designer and manufacturer.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2015 Twenty-First Century Fox spent about $725 million to acquire the media assets of the
   <company id="41278">
    National Geographic Society
   </company>
   . Also during 2015, the company acquired the entirety of the broadcast business of MAA Television Network Limited (MAA TV), an entity in India that broadcasts and operates Telugu language entertainment channels, for approximately $346 million.

        <p>
   In 1952 Rupert Murdoch inherited two Adelaide, Australia, newspapers from his father. After launching the Australian, the country's first national daily, in 1964, Murdoch moved into the UK market. He bought tabloid News of the World, a London Sunday paper, in 1968, and London's Sun the next year. In 1973 Murdoch hit the US, buying the San Antonio Express-News and founding the Star tabloid. He followed this up in 1976 by buying the New York Post. Murdoch formed News Corporation in Australia in 1979.
  </p>
        <p>
   Moving upmarket in 1981, Murdoch bought the London Times and 40% of Collins Publishers, a London book publisher. After buying the Chicago Sun-Times in 1983 (sold 1986), Murdoch bought 13 US travel, hotel, and aviation trade magazines from Ziff-Davis, as well as film studio
   <company id="109142">
    Twentieth Century Fox
   </company>
   in 1985. In 1986 Murdoch bought six Metromedia stations and launched
   <company id="103359">
    FOX Broadcasting
   </company>
   , the first new US TV network since 1948.
  </p>
        <p>
   Print was not forgotten, however, and in the late 1980s News Corp. picked up US book publisher Harper &amp; Row as well as Triangle Publications (TV Guide and other magazines). It also bought textbook publisher Scott, Foresman and the rest of Collins Publishers. (Harper &amp; Row was later merged with Collins to form
   <company id="43658">
    HarperCollins
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Murdoch launched the
   <company id="112317">
    FOX News Channel
   </company>
   , an all-news cable channel. The next year News Corp.'s FOX Kids joint venture bought Pat Robertson's
   <company id="15628">
    International Family Entertainment
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the company bought the
   <company id="46715">
    Los Angeles Dodgers
   </company>
   and stakes in the new Los Angeles-area Staples Center sports arena. (It sold its stake in the Staples Center in 2004.) Also that year News Corp. spun off part of
   <company id="58035">
    Fox Entertainment
   </company>
   in one of America's largest IPOs, raising $2.7 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year News Corp. sold TV Guide to Tele-Communications Inc.'s United Video Satellite Group (now
   <company id="47041">
    Gemstar-TV Guide International
   </company>
   ) for $800 million in cash and a 21% stake. The company also bought the 50% of FOX/Liberty Networks (now
   <company id="105894">
    FOX Sports Net
   </company>
   ) it didn't own and transferred ownership to Fox Entertainment. The deal gave John Malone's
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   holding company an 8% stake (later 19%) in News Corp.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 News Corp. purchased a 10% stake of wireless ISP OmniSky. The following year Sky acquired nearly 25% of Kirch PayTV, the German pay-TV operation of
   <company id="48060">
    KirchGruppe
   </company>
   . Murdoch placed all of the company's satellite holdings into a new entity, Sky Global Networks. (News Corp. folded Sky Global back into its operations in 2002 when it failed in its initial bid to buy DIRECTV.) Also that year News Corp. bought a stake in China's state-owned telecom operator Netcom.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001, along with partner Haim Saban, News Corp. sold the Fox Family Channel to
   <company id="11603">
    Disney
   </company>
   for about $5.2 billion. That year the FCC approved the company's $4.8 billion purchase of TV station group
   <company id="10332">
    Chris-Craft.
   </company>
   The deal gave News Corp. an additional 10 TV stations.
  </p>
        <p>
   News Corp. in 2003 finally realized its dream of owning a chunk of DIRECTV when it bought 34% of Hughes Electronics, the satellite television company's parent, from
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   . News Corp. transferred its interest in Hughes (which changed its name to
   <company id="42070">
    The DIRECTV Group
   </company>
   ) to its Fox Entertainment subsidiary. The following year, in an effort to make its stock more attractive to US investors, News Corp. shifted its incorporation from Australia to the US. It also purchased the rest of Fox Entertainment that it didn't already own for $6.2 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 News Corp. made its push into online and digital entertainment. Anchoring the new operations, it acquired
   <company id="148345">
    MySpace.com
   </company>
   operator Intermix Media for about $580 million. (Other assets owned by Intermix were later sold to
   <company id="100775">
    Demand Media
   </company>
   .)  The deal was an about-face for a company that eschewed the World Wide Web during the dotcom boom of the 1990s.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company made another splash in the television industry when it launched
   <company id="153583">
    MyNetworkTV
   </company>
   in 2006. The startup network was established in response to rivals WB and UPN merging to form
   <company id="153120">
    The CW Television Network
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   The following year News Corp. expanded its holdings significantly when it acquired newspaper giant
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   , along with its flagship paper
   <em>
    The Wall Street Journal
   </em>
   , for $5.6 billion. A newspaper man at heart, Murdoch doggedly pursued Dow Jones and its controlling Bancroft family through a lengthy -- and at times contested -- negotiation process primarily to get his hands on the flagship title.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2008 the company exchanged its 40% stake in
   <company id="42070">
    DIRECTV
   </company>
   along with some regional sports networks and $625 million in cash for
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   's 19% stake in News Corp.
  </p>
        <p>
   Looking to still expand its interests in television broadcasting, in 2011 News Corp acquired UK TV production company
   <company id="161282">
    Shine Group
   </company>
   in a stock swap deal valued at $670 million. Shine, which was founded and is managed by Elisabeth Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert, has operations in 10 territories. The deal gave News Corp. a stronger presence in the increasingly crucial international TV production market.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the company finally decided that its Myspace investment failed to pay off, as growth in online ad revenue significantly slowed and the social network site decisively lost the battle to attract users against the reigning social media champion,
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   . As a result, News Corp. sold Myspace to digital advertising network provider
   <company id="162392">
    Specific Media
   </company>
   for a paltry $35 million. (It also obtained a minority equity stake in Specific Media.)
  </p>
        <p>
   Also during this time News Corp. was faced with troubles at its News International UK newspaper unit when it became embroiled in scandal. In the summer of 2011, its  News of the World was accused of hiring private investigators to hack into citizens' and public officials' voice mails. The paper was eventually shut down after 168 years of publication. In addition, several senior executives resigned, and the company dropped plans to acquire the remaining 61% of Sky that it didn't already own for about £7.8 billion ($12.5 billion).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 News Corp. split itself into two companies. Entertainment assets like Fox News formed a new company called Twenty-First Century Fox, while publishing units including
   <company id="116127">
    The Wall Street Journal
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="162722">
    The New York Post
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="43658">
    HarperCollins
   </company>
   formed a company called News Corporation.
