   Innovia Films may not show you the most dramatic or action-packed films of the year, but its films are probably a lot more practical than Hollywood's offerings. The company manufactures BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) and cellulose films, which are used as specialty packaging for food and luxury products, for giant graphic displays like those on the sides of buses, and in adhesive tapes and labels. Brands include Cellophane, Propafilm, Rayoface, Rayofoil, Rayoform, Rayoweb, and NatureFlex. Innovia was established in 2004 and has offices located in Belgium, Brazil, Australia, the UK, and the US.

   Innovia has developed a polymer substrate for use on currency and other security documents to combat counterfeiting. The company is also developing biodegradable and compostable films in response to global consumer demand for renewable and sustainable packaging. In 2013 the company introduced Innovia's UltraFoil facestock films, a product used for labeling products that have cold foil decoration requirements.
