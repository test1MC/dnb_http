   William Blake could "see a world in a grain of sand," and Luminex can reveal hundreds of secrets in a drop of fluid. Its xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) technology allows simultaneous analysis of up to 500 bioassays, or tests, from a single drop of fluid. xMAP consists of instruments, software, and disposable microspheres (microscopic polystyrene beads on which tests are performed). Luminex also uses MultiCode real-time polymerase chain reaction and xTAG technology. Luminex's systems are used by clinical and research laboratories and are distributed through strategic partnerships with other life sciences firms. Luminex also develops testing assays and disposable testing supplies for the clinical diagnostics market.

  <p>
   The company's xMAP technology is being used in various segments of the life sciences industry including drug discovery and development, clinical diagnostics, genetic analysis, bio-defense, food safety, and biomedical research. The MultiCode assay chemistry provides real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex PCR-based applications.

   The company's technology is available commercially around the world; it is used by major pharmaceutical, diagnostic, biotechnology, and life science companies. Luminex's largest customers include
   <company id="14203">
    Laboratory Corporation of America
   </company>
   (21% of revenue in 2014),
   <company id="11473">
    Thermo Fisher Scientific
   </company>
   (17% of revenue), and
   <company id="11765">
    Bio-Rad Laboratories
   </company>
   (7%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses, including trade show and convention activities, were some $2.3 million in 2014, down from $2.6 million in in 2013 and $2.4 million in 2012.

  <p>
   Revenue has grown over the past five years. It rose 6% to $227 million in 2014 on an increase in assay revenue and royalty earnings. Net income, which had fallen for two years, spiked 450% to $39 million that year as operating expenses declined.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also rose, increasing 83% to $49 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The technology-based firm has implemented a strategy to transform itself into a market-driven, customer-focused company. To achieve this goal, Luminex is focusing on key markets including life sciences research, molecular infectious disease, genetic disease, pharmacogenetic testing, bio-defense testing, and immunodiagnostics. In addition, it aims to develop next-generation systems to bring efficient, portable testing solutions to market, as well as market-leading assays in the human molecular diagnostic testing market. It is also working to develop strategic partnerships in its key markets and to pursue acquisitions that could hasten its goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luminex is largely focused on the final development of its ARIES system; it hopes to improve the simplicity and ease of use of its multiplex products through the development of a new version of its multiplex PCR technology. In the area of molecular diagnostics, the company is working to grow both its cleared Cytochrome P450 assays and the pharmacognetic lab-developed test portfolios of its clinical customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FDA cleared three new targets to the company's xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) in 2014; it also cleared xTAG GPP for use with specimens in Cary-Blair medium, a common transport medium for the collection and preservation of microbiological specimens. The following year, Luminex received Health Canada Class 3 Device License approval for its xTAG CYP2D6 Kit v. 3 comprehensive genotyping assay.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2014, Luminex's 46 partners who have commercialized xMAP-based assay products accounted for two-thirds of total revenue, while all of its strategic partners represented some 70% of revenue.

   Luminex closed its manufacturing facility in Brisbane, Australia, in 2014.

   In 2016 Luminex bought molecular microbiology and diagnostics firm
   <company id="131243">
    Nanosphere
   </company>
   in a $58 million transaction. The purchase adds Nanosphere's Verigene technology, which complements Luminex's existing infectious disease portfolio.

  <p>
   Luminex takes its name from the special laser beams that each microsphere passes through during the bioassay screening process. The lasers excite dyes inside and on the surface of the microspheres, and the resulting fluorescence is measured in real time and analyzed by the system's software.
