   Newark (doing business as Newark Recycled Paperboard Solutions) is proof that one man's trash is another's cash. The company collects secondary fibers and produces 100% recycled paperboard and paperboard products. Its Recovery and Recycling segment collects and recovers the recycled raw materials, while Paperboard Mills produces more than 500 million tons of recycled paper annually. Newark Converted Products offers tubes and cores suppliers, a provider of roll finishing materials and has the volume and variety of laminated products, cover board and industrial packaging. Newark serves the paper and packaging, printing, recycling, and construction industries. In 2015 Newark was acquired by

  <p>
   In 2014, Newark converted its Franklin, Ohio manufacturing facility to produce tubes and cores as well as laminated products.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year it also merged Newark Custom Paperboard and Newark Paperboard Products as a new business division, Newark Converted Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Newark became Newark Recycled Paperboard Solutions. The company rebranded itself to better reflect its major operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2012 Newark sold its European operations to PHI Industrial Acquisitions, a Spanish private equity fund. The sale included all of Newark's operations in Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The company planned to pursue new products and markets within the US as a result of the transaction.
