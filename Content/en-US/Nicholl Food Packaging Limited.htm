   No fooling, Advanta (formerly Nicholl Food Packaging) loves to foil its customers. Advanta manufactures aluminum foil containers primarily for bakery wholesalers, catering distributors, cash-and-carry outlets, and the food-processing industry. Products include foil containers (compartmental, patty pans and cups, medium rounds, oblongs and ovals), aluminum lids (foil board laminate, microwavable boards, heat seal film, and transparent domes), smoothwalls (dessert range and rectangular and round), and trivets. The company also manufactures hand-closing and dispensing machinery. Advanta is owned by UK-based Bawtry Investments.
