   The company is part of its parent's US division, which contributed 52% of its total sales in 2015. The military accounts for 35% of the group's revenue. In 2015, 58% of its military revenue came from US customers, with 26% from Europe, and 16% from the rest of the world.

  <p>
   The US defense budget is very important to Meggitt and its overall success. DoD funding has been at the mercy of cutbacks ordered by the Obama administration, which has turned its head away from more traditional combat weaponry, and toward programs and products that increase the military's speed, flexibility, and precision. Budget priorities favor electronic sensor and cyber warfare technology that supports ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) missions, and C3I (command, control, communication, and intelligence) requirements.

  <p>
   Good news for Meggitt-USA is that the vast majority of its OE programs will continue to be funded. With aircraft representing 70% of its sales -- driven by Joint Strike Fighters, F16s, F18s, Typhoons, C130s, Apaches, and Black Hawks -- the company believes that this area will increase due to the sale of aftermarket parts, which represents 40% of its military revenue. Meggitt-USA has positioned itself for retrofit programs, which will mitigate for a slowdown in OE programs. Some of these aftermarket products include blast-proof fuel tanks, thermal management of electronics, and composite-made aerostructures.
