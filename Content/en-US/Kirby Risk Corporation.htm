   Kirby Risk sees nothing risky about helping harness a little electrical energy. The company, named after one of its co-founders, supplies electrical products (process automation products, drives and motors, lighting, fuses, wire, and cable) and services to the Midwestern US. The company operates through four business units comprising Electrical Supply, Service Center, Mechanical Solutions and Service, and Precision Machining. The Electrical Supply distribution unit handles more than 20,000 products from some 500 manufacturers, including

   The company's Electrical Supply division stocks lighting and power instruments, while the Kirby Risk Service Center makes custom wiring harnesses, control panels, sub-assemblies, and kits for industrial customers. Mechanical Solutions and Service is the repair end of the business, it also sells motors, power transmissions, and generators.

   Kirby Risk Precision Machining offers precision machining using CNC (computer numerical control) technology. ARCO manufactures roto-phase converters, which are rotary-type generators (different from static phase converters), as well as power factor correction capacitors.
