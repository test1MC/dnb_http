   You won't find "research models" from Envigo RMS on any fashion runways -- that's just the industry term for rodents and other animals bred for scientific research. The company is focused on animal breeding and research services. It provides rodents and large animals, testing services, Teklad-brand animal diets and bedding to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities, and government agencies. The firm also provides researchers with analytical chemistry, toxicology, and agrochemical testing services. In 2015 Huntingdon Life Sciences merged with Harlan Laboratories to create Envigo. Envigo now operates through two business units: Contract Research Services (CRS) and Research Models and Services (RMS).

The company also expands its product offerings by forming marketing partnerships with other research companies.
