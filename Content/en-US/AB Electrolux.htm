   AB Electrolux knows how to run a household. The firm, a top maker of household appliances worldwide, operates through three main segments: Major Appliances, which is divided into four geographic regions; and Small Appliances and Professional Products, which operate globally. Electrolux cranks out washing machines, stoves, refrigerators, and freezers under the AEG, Electrolux, Eureka, Frigidaire, and Zanussi names. It's also the #1 maker globally of vacuum cleaners. Electrolux makes foodservice and laundry equipment under the Electrolux and Zanussi labels for the mass market.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Major Appliances is the largest sector at 87% of revenue, and makes large domestic appliances like fridges, freezers, stoves, washing machines, air-conditioners and microwaves. Small Appliances products includes vacuum cleaners, in which Electrolux has a 10% market share and is the only global player. Professional Products makes equipment for the food-service industry and professional-grade laundry equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of kitchen equipment account for 65% of the company's sales. Laundry appliances account for 18%. Electrolux's eight strategic brands are AEG, Electrolux, Eureka, Frigidaire, Electrolux Grand Cuisine, Molteni, Westinghouse and Zanussi. Electrolux sells some 60 million products worldwide a year, and nearly half were sold under its namesake brand.

  <p>
   Electrolux boasts a global reach, as its products are sold in more than 150 markets. Its largest markets are North America and Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Major Appliances is divided into four geographic regions. North America pulls in 35% of total revenue; EMEA (Europe, Africa and the Middle East) 30%; Latin America 15%; and the Asia-Pacific region 7%.

  <p>
   The appliance marketplace is based on consumers replacing old or faulty appliances and very high product penetration - almost everyone needs a fridge, freezer and vacuum cleaner. Almost 70% of sales are carried out through the four major retailers in the US -

   and

   . Contract sales are also an important sales channel, and benefit from house-building.

  <p>
   Sales at Electrolux grew strongly in 2015 - revenue was up 10% to SEK123 billion on prior year. Sales growth was mostly down to positive exchange rate effects, but was also attributable to a strengthening in demand in North America, particularly relating to sales in Major Appliances. Macroeconomic weakness in two major developing countries - Brazil and Russia - dragged sales in Latin America and Eastern Europe down respectively; Latin America fell to 15% of global sales as a result.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped a hefty 30% on 2014 to SEK1.6 billion, which factors in the costs incurred in the terminated agreement to buy GE Appliances, owned by General Electric, for a proposed $3.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities grew to SEK8.2 billion, a SEK445 million increase, due to a rise in trade receivables.

  <p>
   Electrolux's strategy is twofold. First, it aims to achieve organic growth in established markets through product innovation (2015's product lines include the AEG ProCombi Plus, the first steam oven with an in-built camera, and MyPRO washing machines). And second, it aims to expand into developing markets, often via acquisitions. On the latter, Electrolux acquired Shanghai Veetsan Commercial Machinery, a large manufacturer of professional dishwashers in China, in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developing its online offering is also a key part of Electrolux's strategy and could lower the cost of sales. The company has seen online sales increase in recent years.

   Electrolux acquired Shanghai Veetsan Commercial Machinery, a manufacturer of professional-grade dishwashers, in 2015 as part of its drive to expand into the Asia-Pacific market, as well as accelerate growth in its Professional Products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company acquired Australian-based BeefEater, an international barbecue business, for AUD14 million. BeefEater's range of compact barbecues is hoped to complement Electrolux's existing range of large, free-standing barbecues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's agreement to buy GE's appliance business was terminated in late 2015 due to opposition from US regulators.

  <p>
   Swedish salesman Axel Wenner-Gren saw an American-made vacuum cleaner in a Vienna, Austria, store window in 1910 and envisioned selling the cleaners door-to-door, a technique he had learned in the US. Two years later he worked with fledgling Swedish vacuum cleaner makers AB Lux and Elektromekaniska to improve their existing designs. The two companies merged to form AB Electrolux in 1919. When the board of the new company balked at Wenner-Gren's suggestion to mass-produce vacuum cleaners, he guaranteed Electrolux's sales through his own sales company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1920s the company used the "Every home -- an Electrolux home" slogan as Wenner-Gren drove his sales force on and launched new sales companies in Europe and North and South America. He scored a publicity coup by securing the blessing of Pope Pius XI to vacuum the Vatican, gratis, for a year. By the end of the 1920s, Electrolux had purchased most of Wenner-Gren's sales companies (excluding Electrolux US) and had gambled on refrigerator technology and won. By buying vacuum cleaner maker Volta (Sweden, 1934), it gained retail distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the loss of Eastern European subsidiaries during WWII, the company did well until the 1960s, when it backed an unpopular refrigeration technology. Swedish electrical equipment giant ASEA, controlled by Marcus Wallenberg, bought a large stake in Electrolux in 1964, and in 1967 he installed Hans Werthén as chairman. Werthén slashed overhead and sold the company's minority stake in Electrolux US to Consolidated Foods. (The US Electrolux business was taken private in 1987.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 1970 Electrolux has bought more than 300 companies (many of them troubled appliance makers), updated their plants, and gained global component manufacturing efficiencies. Acquisitions included National Union Electric (Eureka vacuum cleaners, US, 1974), Tappan (appliances, US, 1979), Zanussi (appliances, industrial products; Italy; 1984),
   <company id="43834">
    White Consolidated Industries
   </company>
   (appliances, industrial products; US; 1986), and Lehel (refrigerators, Hungary, 1991). By 1996 the company had acquired a 41% interest in Refrigeração Paraná, Brazil's #2 manufacturer of appliances. (Electrolux owned it all by 1998.)
  </p>
  <p>
   To better focus on its "white goods" (washers, refrigerators, etc.), in 1996 Electrolux began selling noncore businesses. In 1997, under new CEO Michael "Mike the Knife" Treschow, the company launched a restructuring plan involving the closing of about 25 plants and the elimination of more than 12,000 jobs, mostly in Europe. The plan worked: Electrolux's profits more than quadrupled in 1998. Also that year the company launched a joint venture in India with Voltas Limited, forming that country's largest refrigerator manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electrolux acquired the European operations of chainsaw maker
   <company id="55145">
    McCulloch
   </company>
   in 1999. To strengthen its Asian presence, Electrolux teamed up with Toshiba for future collaboration on household appliances. Also that year the company said it would sell its vending machine unit and professional refrigeration business. That year AB Electrolux agreed to buy the major appliance business of Email Ltd., Australia's top household appliance maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2002 it finalized the sale of its leisure appliance operations -- mostly refrigerators for recreational vehicles -- to private equity firm EQT Northern Europe. In April 2002 Electrolux CEO Michael Treschow resigned (but remained as a director) and was replaced by board member Hans Sträberg. The firm acquired Diamant Boart International, a world-leading manufacturer and distributor of diamond tools and related equipment, in June 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a restructuring effort to combat the effects of diminishing consumer demand and higher material costs, Electrolux cut nearly 5,000 jobs (about 6% of its workforce) during 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electrolux relaunched its flagship brand of vacuum cleaners in North America during 2004, having bought the rights from long-unaffiliated vacuum maker Electrolux LLC (now
   <company id="56495">
    Aerus
   </company>
   ). Also that year former CEO Michael Treschow reappeared in a leadership position, assuming the role of chairman. Treschow left the company again in 2007. Hans Straberg, who had joined Electrolux in 1983, was appointed CEO of the business in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm exited its outdoor segment, which consisted of chainsaws and lawn and garden equipment (Husqvarna, Jonsered brands) and diamond tools (Dimas, Diamant Boart names) through a spinoff in 2006.
