  <p>
   Fuji Heavy Industries has entered into an alliance with
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   to strengthen the companies' competitiveness through shared technology, R&amp;D, and product supply. Toyota doubled its stake in Subaru to over 16%, which improves the capital on hand for Subaru. In return, Toyota takes advantage of some of Subaru's engineering, as well as its US manufacturing facilities in Indiana, where Toyota Camrys are built. The company also has an agreement with
   <company id="56355">
    Daihatsu Motor
   </company>
   to provide Subaru with sub-compact vehicles (mini cars).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company credits a number of decisions for its recent success. Subaru gave up competing with premium European automobiles like
   <company id="137886">
    Volvo
   </company>
   and
   <company id="91128">
    Audi
   </company>
   and instead launched more practical, outdoor models like the Outback wagon, repositioning itself as a value brand by pricing its cars more affordably. It also restyled its models with more interior space, which is important to US drivers, who tend to require more leg room. Additionally, Subaru is seeing increasing customer loyalty to its brand thanks to marketing efforts, and it is a top safety pick among highway safety experts.
