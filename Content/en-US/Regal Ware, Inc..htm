  <p>
   Rolled out in December 2008, Regal Ware's Marcus line of cookware is named for Marcus Samuelsson, a premier chef who has worked in restaurants in the US in New York and Chicago and overseas in Stockholm, Sweden. The stainless steel cookware is made at Regal Ware's West Bend, Wisconsin, manufacturing facility. Having produced its products overseas in previous years, Regal Ware has been shifting gears to maintain a "Made in the USA" focus, as it has found that outsourced manufacturers meeting its expectations abroad has become increasingly difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been making cookware since 1911. It was formally founded in 1919.
