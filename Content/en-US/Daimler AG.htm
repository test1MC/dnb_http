    Mercedes-Benz

   , includes luxury brands Mercedes and Maybach, as well as compact, hybrid, and electric models, including its

   brand. Other major auto brands include Freightliner, Western Star, BharatBenz,
   <company id="139908">
    Fuso

   , Setra, and Thomas Built Buses, while financial services brands include Mercedes-Benz Bank, Mercedes-Benz Financial, moovel, and car2go. Its

   After posting four straight years of revenue growth, Daimler saw its revenues dip 3% from $162 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2014. Profits also declined 10% from $9 billion to roughly $8.5 billion over that same time period due to higher interest tax rates and increased expenses.

  <p>
   The company's blueprint for growth involves the strengthening of its core business within the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. It is also focused on enhancing its green technologies and vehicular safety operations. It will invest approximately €11 billion in property, plant, and equipment throughout 2015 and 2016, as well as more than €13 billion in research and development projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   With its continued focus on the Chinese markets, the company in 2013 opened a new production plant for four-cylinder engines in China, along with its biggest training center in the world in 2014. Daimler also plans to launch a new research and development center in Beijing.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the Brazilian markets, the company will begin manufacturing its C‑Class and the GLA brands for the local market in Brazil in 2016. The company will also establish its local bus manufacturing operations in India in 2015.

  <p>
   <company id="41231">
    Daimler-Benz
   </company>
   was formed by the merger of two German motor companies -- Daimler and Benz -- in 1926. Daimler-Benz bought Auto Union (Audi) in 1958 (sold to
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   in 1966). The company's Mercedes cars gained international fame and sales expanded worldwide in the 1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Daimler-Benz diversified in the 1980s, buying aerospace, heavy truck (Freightliner), and consumer and industrial electrical companies. Although diversification continued, sales slowed. Losses at its aerospace unit forced Daimler-Benz into the red in 1995. Also that year the company and ABB Asea Brown Boveri (now
   <company id="40615">
    ABB
   </company>
   ) formed joint venture Adtranz, the #1 train maker in the world, and Jürgen Schrempp became chairman of the management board (CEO).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler and introduced a subcompact car, the smart, in Europe. The newly formed DaimlerChrysler rolled both companies' financial services units into DaimlerChrysler Interservices (DEBIS) in 1999.
