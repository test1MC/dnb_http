   The more film deposits Intevac's equipment makes, the more bank deposits the company can make. It's Equipment division makes machines -- called sputtering systems -- that deposit alloy films onto hard-disk drives. The films magnetize the drives, enabling them to record information. The Equipment division also makes disk lubrication systems used in disk drive manufacturing, and processing equipment used to manufacture solar cells. Intevac's Photonics division develops electro-optical devices used in night vision and materials identification applications. Top customers include

   Intevac posted a 15% revenue gain to $75 million in 2016 (ended January) compared to $65.5 million in 2015. A rocket-like 57% increase in thin film equipment revenue accounted for the revenue rise with photonics products and R&amp;D reporting lower revenue in 2016. Intevac credited the thin film equipment increase to new equipment such as the MATRIX PVD (physical vapor deposition) system and the VERTEX coating system for display cover panels (DCPs).

  <p>
   The jump in revenue didn't mean a profit for Intevac, but it cut its loss by two thirds. The company's net loss was $9 million in 2016 compared to a $27 loss in 2015.
