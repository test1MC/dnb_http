   There's no shame in being artificial at Cumberland Packing; sugar substitutes equal real cash. The company makes Sweet'N Low, the pink-packaged, saccharin-based sugar substitute. It also makes NatraTaste (an aspartame sugar substitute), Nu-Salt (a sodium-free salt substitute), and Sweet One (an acesulfame potassium sweetener). Cumberland's other brand includes Sugar In The Raw (turbinado sugar). In addition to the ubiquitous presence of Sweet'N Low on restaurant tables, Cumberland's products are sold to food retailers and food manufacturers worldwide. Along with Butter Buds, Inc., which makes butter-flavored granules, Cumberland Packing is part of Cumberland Worldwide Holdings, Inc., effective 2013.

   In recent years, Cumberland Packing has expanded its In the Raw line with Monk Fruit In The Raw and Agave In The Raw products. It makes a zero-calorie sweetener from vine-ripened monk fruit, also called Luo Han Guo, that tastes like sugar, as well as an organic sweetener from the core of the Mexican agave plant.

   The company keeps an eye on avenues for growth in the lucrative sugars market. Cumberland Packing stepped up on the stevia bandwagon along with
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   . Cargill was the first to come to market with its Truvia brand of stevia sweetener, developed in conjunction with
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   , which uses it in some of its soft drinks. Cumberland Packing partnered with others, as well, and added a stevia-based natural plant-based no-calorie sweetener to its product line (prudently waiting until the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   ruled it safe) and introduced Stevia In The Raw.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beginning in mid-2013,
   <company id="10811">
    J.M. Smucker Company
   </company>
   began marketing and distributing Cumberland's branded tabletop sweeteners to foodservice customers nationwide and to retail and foodservice customers in Canada through a multiyear licensing and distribution agreement. J.M. Smucker is giving Sweet'N Low, NatraTaste, Sugar In The Raw, and Cumberland's other In the Raw brands a boost.

   Benjamin Eisenstadt (grandfather of Jeff) started the company as a tea-bag factory in the 1940s. Benjamin and his son, Marvin, invented Sweet'N Low (which was assigned the
   <company id="150386">
    US's one-millionth patent
   </company>
   ) in 1957.
