   Hydro Aluminum North America conducts aluminum production for its parent company, Norsk Hydro, throughout North America. The company divides its business into two units: Aluminum Products and Aluminum Metal. The former handles the company's extrusion operations (now part of the Sapa AS joint venture), while the Aluminum Metal division produces aluminum billet. Its primary operations include aluminum extruded products, precision tubing, and products for the automotive industry. Norwegian metals giant

    Norsk Hydro
   </company>
   is among the world's top five aluminum producers, and North America makes up a significant part of that business. The US is Norsk Hydro's largest market outside Europe.

  <p>
   Norsk Hydro's Aluminum Product unit operates 10 facilities in the US and Mexico, making it the largest aluminum drawn tubing producer in North America. Four dedicated aluminum manufacturing facilities and more than 500,000 sq. ft. of fabrication space provide precision components and finished assemblies and sub-assemblies. Sapa AS has about two dozen plants in the US, mostly, and Canada.

  <p>
   The company's Aluminum Metals segment has North America's largest aluminum remelt network. Its six casthouses provide aluminum metals and custom aluminum alloys. Hydro has invested $100 million in upgraded casthouses and technology to boost its annual aluminum remelt capacity to more than 400,000 tons.

  <p>
   In 2013 parent Norsk Hydro combined its aluminum extrusion operations with those of Sapa as Sapa AS, a 50/50 joint venture owned by
   <company id="107086">
    Orkla
   </company>
   and Norsk Hydro. Sapa AS is global leader in aluminum extrusion products with operations in more than 40 countries, including in North America. The combined operations of Sapa AS consist of Profiles, Building Systems and Extruded and Welded tubes of former Sapa, and all of Norsk Hydro's Extruded Products business. The transaction created a stronger foothold in North America for both countries.

  <p>
   Due to low demand in the market, Hydro closed its aluminum tubing plant in Adrian, Michigan in 2010. The plant, which operated continuously for 70 years, had employed up to 120 people when its decommissioning was announced in 2009. The plant's production was transferred to Hydro's other aluminum tubing sites in Florida and Mexico.
