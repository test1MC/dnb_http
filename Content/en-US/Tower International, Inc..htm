  <p>
   Tower's revenues decreased by 5% from $2.07 billion in 2014 to $1.96 billion in 2015. The company in 2015 was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro within the international segment, and the strengthening of the US dollar against the Brazilian Real in the Americas segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits absolutely skyrocketed from $22 million in 2014 to a record-shattering $194 million in 2015. The historic growth was fueled by the benefit from income taxes reflecting a net $131 million deferred tax benefit recorded in the US and Italy.

  <p>
   The company has worked on making manufacturing and purchasing costs leaner and production reporting and analysis tighter. Tower's cost-cutting measures were set in motion by a combination of rising steel prices, production cuts among key customers, and high costs associated with program launches.

  <p>
   Tower Automotive resulted when Samuel Tower realized he was a bad farmer. The Greenville, Michigan, native decided to buy a small machine shop in 1874. He renamed it the Tower Brothers Machine Company and found steady business from farmers who brought in metal tools to be repaired. Samuel's son, Ray, joined the company and helped bring in business from the local logging industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1900 the company was designing sawmill equipment, trimmers, and edgers. Ray began a foundry that turned out everything from manhole covers to soda fountain equipment and card tables. The company became R. J. Tower Iron Works before Ray decided to form a small truck business. Samuel Tower died in 1927. By that time, Ray's son, Francis, had joined the company. With the Depression on the horizon, Francis began supplying metal legs to local refrigerator plants. This business grew to include other refrigerator parts, electric ranges, and air conditioners. The seasonal refrigerator market forced Francis to look to the auto industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII, Francis' son, Ray, took over. By 1955 the company had grown to 60 employees. In 1972 the company changed names again to become R. J. Tower Corporation. After four generations of Tower leadership, none of Ray's six children wanted the job when he stepped down in 1983. He sold the company to three former employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Tower Automotive was formed to buy the R. J. Tower Corporation. Dugald Campbell was brought in as president and CEO. The company began an aggressive campaign of expansion and growth. It greeted 1994 with 400 employees and sales of $83 million. By midyear it had acquired Edgewood Tool and Manufacturing and Kalamazoo Stamping and Die (structural stamping and assembly), giving it capabilities for making such items as hood and deck lid hinges. Tower Automotive went public that year and recorded sales of $222 million. By year's end it employed 1,600 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed to go public in March 2010, and, upon closing the IPO, changed its name to Tower International.
