   The company in mid-2013 announced it will spend about $3 million to expand its facility in Rapson, Michigan. The project includes a new fertilizer plant, dry bean receiving facility, and more space for grain storage. Star of the West Milling has grown steadily without any devastating blows to its bottom line during the economic slump. Also, instead of setting aside cash for a rainy day or paying off debt, Star of the West Milling in 2011 invested more than $8 million in new equipment and building additions in an effort to boost production and improve sales. The new machinery cleans and separates wheat and uses optical sorting to identify and remove imperfect kernels. Star of the West Milling, in turn, hopes to expand its capabilities further to include whole wheat production to cater to customer requests.

   Star of the West Milling was founded by the Hubinger family in 1870; its name was taken from a side-wheel merchant steamer of the same name that secretly transported soldiers and supplies to Fort Sumpter, site of the first battle of the Civil War.
