   Allegro MicroSystems' chips don't need touch to make contact. The company is one of the world's top makers of Hall-effect sensors, which reduce mechanical wear by using magnets to produce contactless sensors. Automakers use these specialized components -- named after an electromagnetic phenomenon called "the Hall effect" -- in braking, steering, suspension, and other systems. Allegro also makes power integrated circuits (ICs) used in printers and portable electronics, along with driver, controller, and power interface ICs used in a variety of applications. The company is a subsidiary of
