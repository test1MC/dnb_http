   Albany International's products look good on paper and on papermaking machines. The company makes paper machine clothing (PMC, custom-made fabrics and belts that move paper stock through each phase of production). It markets these products to paper mills worldwide through a direct sales staff and also provides woven/non-woven fabrics for paper/tannery/textile industries and building products. Its other business segment, Engineered Composites (AEC), makes engineered composite parts for the aerospace industry and high-tech applications. Over the years the company has been selling off former units and operations to focus on its PMC and AEC segments.

  <p>
   Albany operates almost 20 plants located in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Italy, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Sweden, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   Albany operates through two segments. Paper Machine Clothing (PMC; 85% of net sales) supplies customized and consumable fabrics, while Engineered Composites (EC; 15%) provides highly engineered and advanced composite structures for the aerospace and defense industries.

  <p>
   Albany's revenues decreased 5% from 2014 to 2015 mainly due to a 7% drop in Machine Clothing sales as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Despite the revenue loss, Albany's net income surged 38% from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease in technical, product engineering, and research expenses in addition to diminished pension settlement expenses.

  <p>
   The company recognizes PMC as its core business (about 85% of total revenues in 2015) and believes that it holds an almost 30% global market share in this industry. However, it also recognizes industry dynamics such as the subsequent trend of papermaking customers to consolidate operations and the popularity of digital media being fueled by trends in advertising and digital transmission and storage. This segment is also challenged by advanced technology able to create paper machine clothing that is more durable and lasts longer so customers don't need to order PMC pieces as often.
  </p>
  <p>
   Recognizing these limitations for PMC, Albany International has developed AEC into its second core business by focusing on creating products with aerospace and defense applications that are based on the company's proprietary technology. For example, AEC makes braces for

   's 787 main landing gear and composite fan blade components for the LEAP-X engine. To support this segment, the company has begun construction of a plant for AEC operations that is scheduled to start production in 2014.

   Albany in 2016 agreed to acquire
   <company id="10709">
    Harris Corporation
   </company>
   's composite aero-structures division for $210 million. The division is a leading supplier of advanced composite products primarily for airframe applications and has significant positions on three major growth platforms: Lockheed's Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), Boeing's 787, and Sikorsky's CH-53K. Albany believes the deal will create a major force in aerospace composites and will be able to realize significant new long-term growth opportunities.

  <p>
   Albany International was started by three businessmen in 1895 as the Albany Felt Co. in New York's state capital. Though Albany International moved its headquarters to New Hampshire, it is keeping Albany in its name.
