   Kingfield Electronics has expanded into a one-stop-shop manufacturer by offering high-volume PCB production through a partner in Asia. It has also added product sourcing to its supply chain services, using vendors located in the UK, US, Asia/Pacific, and Eastern European regions. This allows the company to provide services that range from engineering and design through finished product shipping directly to customer and aftermarket repair and spares supply.
