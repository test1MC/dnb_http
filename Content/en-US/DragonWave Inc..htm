   Sales of DragonWave's hardware and software products account for 95% of its revenue with services bringing in the rest.

   DragonWave sells directly to customers and indirectly through distributors and partners. It's biggest channel partner has been Nokia, which accounted for more than half of sales in 2014. The company make about 30% of sales directly to Tier 1 service providers. Those customers include WireIE, Xplornet, and Northeast Wireless Networks.

  <p>
   DragonWave's financial performance has blown hot and cold and in 2014 it did both. Revenue jumped 75% to $157 million in 2015 (ended February) from $90 million in 2014. The company posted a net loss of $21.5 million in 2015, but that was an improvement from the $24 million net loss reported in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales were boosted in 2015 by growth in the Nokia channel, a big sale to a high-ranking carrier in India (which DragonWave didn't identify), and higher sales in North America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. The higher sales helped the company get closer to break even as did a gain in foreign exchange. DragonWave reported negative cash flow of $32 million in 2015 compared to negative cash flow of $24 million the year before.

  <p>
   DragonWave has moved to expand its international sales especially in emerging markets. In 2014, it reached a deal to supply equipment to a major carrier in India. The company moved its deal-making to Saudi Arabia in 2015 and will provide the carrier with equipment to increase its data and enterprise services.

  <p>
   DragonWave could see a change in its business with its largest customer, Nokia, with Nokia's acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. And it could be a change for the better. DragonWave bought Nokia's microwave business in 2012 and supplied equipment to Nokia. While the addition of Alcatel-Lucent shores up Nokia in some areas, microwave equipment is not one of them. As a result, DragonWave could be in a position to benefit from the deal.
