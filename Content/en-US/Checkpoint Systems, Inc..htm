   Checkpoint Systems wants to keep shoplifters in check. The company makes electronic article surveillance systems (EAS), radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and electronic security devices (using electromagnetic technology), such as intrusion alarms, digital video recorders, and electronic access control systems used by retailers that have included

   ,
   <company id="11338">
    Sears

   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11601">
    Walgreen
   </company>
   . Its EAS units employ paper-thin disposable circuit tags attached to merchandise that are disarmed at checkout; if not disarmed, the tags trigger electronic sensors when the customer tries to leave. The company in mid-2016 was acquired by

    CCL Industries
   </company>
   for $532 million.

  <p>
   Checkpoint operates through three business segments. Its largest segment, Merchandice Availability Solutions generated 65% of the company's 2015 annual revenues. It is responsible for EAS, Alpha (high theft protection) products. Disposable EAS tags are usually as small as a postage stamp and are concealed in labels or packaging. In addition to the disposable tags, Checkpoint makes reusable security tags including plastic and fluid ink tags.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second largest business segment is Checkpoint's Apparel Labeling Solutions (ALS) division; this unit represents 28% of company revenues. It integrates Checkpoint's EAS-RF technology into security labels and apparel tags, and offers loss prevention and supply chain management products and services to its clients through almost 20 service bureaus in over 15 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Checkpoint's third segment is the Retail Merchandising Solutions unit. Representing 7% of revenues, this unit manages the sales of the company's retail merchandising systems (RMS) and hand-held labeling systems (HLS) used primarily for apparel branding and identification in the European and Asian markets.

  <p>
   Checkpoint has experienced several straight years of diminishing revenues. Sales fell 11% from $662 in 2014 to $587 million in 2015 due to decreases across all its three segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merchandise Availability Solutions sales decreased in 2015 due to negative impact of $37 million in foreign currency translations. The segment also experienced decreases in Alpha (attributed to weaker sales in the US market), EAS Systems (due to large roll-outs in the US and Europe), and EAS Consumables (due to a decline in EAS label revenues in the US).
  </p>
  <p>
   After posting positive net income during 2014, Checkpoint posted a net loss of $26 million in 2015 mainly due to the lower revenue coupled with a spike in legal fees.

   Checkpoint monitors theft trends around the globe when making its business decisions. Items most stolen include cosmetics, DVDs and CDs, small consumer electronics, alcohol, women's clothing, and perfume. Checkpoint's own study revealed the increase in theft was greatest in India and lowest in Taiwan. Given the stats, Checkpoint Systems expects significant growth in the Indian market and is targeting that area, among others, to grow its sales.
