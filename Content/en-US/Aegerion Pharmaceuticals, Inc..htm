   Bad cholesterol, beware! Aegerion Pharmaceuticals is hot on your trail. The biopharmaceutical company develops cholesterol-lowering drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disease, specifically targeting elevated LDL (low-density lipoprotein, also known as "bad" cholesterol) levels. Aegerion's first approved drug is Juxtapid (lomitapide, branded Lojuxta in Europe), a protein inhibitor that blocks cholesterol production in the liver and intestine. The firm is working on getting Juxtapid approved in Japan and for children and teens. Aegerion also markets Myalept, a treatment for leptin deficiency. In November 2016, Aegerion was acquired by Canada's QLT (which then renamed itself
   <company id="89520">
    Novelion Therapeutics
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   QLT acquired Aegerion to expand its pipeline and to gain the firm's existing commercial products. After the merger, the combined firm is primarily led by Aegerion's existing management team.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Juxtapid began selling throughout North America and in Brazil to patients given special pre-approval access in early 2013 and in the UK and Germany in mid-2013 under the brand name Lojuxta. Aegerion is ramping up its operations in other parts of Europe.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company uses its own sales team to market Juxtapid in the US. It outsources the manufacturing. Outside the US it uses third-parties for sales and marketing.
  </p>

  <p>
   Aegerion reported revenue for the first time in 2013 as it began selling Juxtapid and Lojuxta. But since sales and marketing costs increased as the drugs rolled out, the company's net loss and cash flow were about the same as the previous year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Going forward Aegerion will keep doing what it's doing - promoting Juxtapid in the US; working toward getting insurance companies to approve reimbursements for it in the UK, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil; conducting clinical trials in Japan and in the US for pediatric approval; and gaining approval in other foreign markets. The company is also trying to limit the number of patients who quit the drug due to its side effects, which include a risk of liver toxicity, by offering patient support programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Juxtapid sales have suffered from the introduction of competitive therapies Repatha and Praluent. As such, Aegerion cut 25% of its workforce in early 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following that cost-cutting move, the company agreed to be acquired by Canadian firm QLT. The combined company was renamed Novelion Therapeutics. To lower its cost base, Aegerion then announced plans to cut another 13% of its workforce, as well as withdrawing Lojuxta from the European market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also promoting its orphan drug Myalept, which it acquired from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   in late 2014. Myalept is the first US-approved product for the treatment of generalized lipodystrophy.

   Originally developed by
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   in the 1990s, lead candidate lomitapide was dropped due to its potential side effects. Bristol-Myers turned over rights to the drug to
   <company id="40498">
    The University of Pennsylvania
   </company>
   , which eventually licensed it to Aegerion. The
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   has also voiced concerns over potential side effects, but has allowed the company to continue with key clinical trials for rare lipid disorders, while at the same time requesting additional data on the company's candidates.
