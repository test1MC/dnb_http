   Jupiter Aluminum has aspirations to be a big planet in the solar system of private US aluminum producers. The company manufactures aluminum coil that is primarily used to make building and construction products such as drip edge, gutters and downspouts, screen frames, trim and soffits, and vents and louvers. The company's coil products also are used by manufacturers of cookware, irrigation equipment, license plates, and sign blanks. Jupiter Aluminum provides both mill-finish and painted coils. The company makes its products from recycled aluminum, purchasing scrap such as aluminum wire and cable, painted aluminum, and used beverage cans before processing the scrap into its end products.

   To expand its product line and move into new markets in 2013 the company began refurbishing and upgrading the newly acquired former RG Steel LLC, Wheeling Corrugating plant in Beech Bottom, West Virgina. The upgrade will allow Jupiter Aluminum to paint wider materials (using a 48-inch coil coating line) and apply two coats of paint, something it was not able to do at its existing Midwest plants. It will also be able to better serve customers in East Coast and Mid-Atlantic states.
