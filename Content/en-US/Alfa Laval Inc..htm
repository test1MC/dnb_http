   Alfa Laval's primary purpose is to build its parent's aftermarket business in North America, the largest aftermarket opportunity (next to Western Europe) due to its mature installed equipment base. The US subsidiary has fueled its growth by developing a portfolio of products and services, such as equipment repairs, maintenance, replacement components, upgrades, and modernization. The company uses acquisitions to add related products and open up sales channels, as well as to expand the company's presence in the North American market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Alfa Laval acquired the US-based company Air Cooled Exchangers, LLC (ACE), a maker of custom-engineered air-cooled heat exchangers that are used to cool air, natural gas, oil and water in the natural gas market as well as other energy-related end markets. The acquisition brought a new range of products to the company's heat transfer portfolio at a time when demand for air-cooled heat exchangers is increasing, especially in the natural gas industry.

   Alfa Laval in 2012 also snapped up Gamajet Cleaning Systems, a provider of tank cleaning machines and self-contained and portable cleaning systems catering to the North American industrial and sanitary markets. Apart from expanding the company's product portfolio, the acquisition extended its reach to the industrial market. In the same year, Alfa Laval swallowed up Ashbrook Simon-Hartley, a provider of belt filter presses based in Houston. Ashbrook also has offices in the UK, Chile, and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides acquisitions, Alfa Laval is expanding its presence in the US through major contracts. The company landed its largest deal ever in late 2010. The SEK 250 million (about $37 million) order for decanter centrifuges was made by a Chicago wastewater plant -- the largest sewage treatment plant in the world. Deliveries will continue through 2013.

  <p>
   Alfa Laval Inc. was formed in 2000 to bring all of the Swedish parent's US activities under one organizational roof. However, the business took root in the US as a sales company, DeLaval Separator Co., in 1886. In 1890 American Philip Sharples inked an agreement with Gustav DeLaval (the inventor of the centrifugal cream separator and the mechanical milking machine) allowing Sharples to use the Swedish technology to manufacture cream separators in the US. Sharples' factory was operational until 1990.
