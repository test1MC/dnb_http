   Red Gold uses a vegetable-patch-colored pallet to produce the perfect mix of red and gold in its tomato sauces. It makes its own brand and private-label canned and bottled tomato products, including ketchup, tomato juice, diced and crushed tomatoes, salsa, and pasta sauces, under the Red Gold, Redpack, Sacramento, and Tuttorosso labels. It operates manufacturing sites in Indiana where it makes products for retail, foodservice, and private-label distribution. Products are available nationwide and in more than 15 countries. In its third-generation of family ownership, Red Gold was founded in 1942 by Grover Hutcherson. The Reicharts now own and operate Red Gold and employ more than a dozen family members.

   Red Gold maintains a diverse revenue stream by also serving the foodservice industry as a private-label. The company is the nation's largest family-owned producer of private brand tomato products and the largest producer of private brand ketchup. Its foodservice brands include Vine Ripe, Teresa, Glorietta, and Il Migliore, in addition to Redpack, Red Gold, and Sacramento.

   This segment of Red Gold's business also offers tomato ketchup, tomato juice, sliced stewed tomatoes in juice, and pizza sauce with basil, among other products. To cater to foodservice companies, Red Gold in 2013 rolled out a new upscale 20-ounce plastic ketchup bottle as an alternative to its classic yellow-and-red label design.
