   The Sherlock Holmes of chip makers, EG Systems uses its high-tech magnifying glass to examine suspect production quality. The company's lineup aims to discover flaws and thereby improve the efficiency and output of its customers' wafer fabrication facilities. EG Systems' automated probers check semiconductor wafers for defects before the wafers are separated and packaged as individual chips. The company also supplies test handling systems for quality assurance during the final stages of chip production, as well as software to improve chip production yields. Formerly Electroglas, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009 and exited later that year.

   Electroglas was established in 1960 as Specialty Products. As Specialty Products, it fashioned the pre-silicon-chip glass beads used to connect circuits. The semiconductor industry exploded, thanks to the US military and the American space program, and the company changed its name to Electroglas and its focus to wafer-probing technology. Its EG 900 prober was introduced in 1964.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Signal (acquired by
   <company id="11307">
    SPX
   </company>
   in 1998) moved to boost its presence in the semiconductor equipment market in 1980 by acquiring Electroglas, with plans to run it as a division. Under CEO Neil Bonke, the wafer prober business was spun off from General Signal, and taken public in 1993. In a market fueled by complex microprocessors and changes in wafer size, sales grew.
  </p>
  <p>
   Curtis Wozniak, former president of chip maker
   <company id="15245">
    Xilinx
   </company>
   , succeeded Bonke as CEO in 1996. The next year the company bought yield management software developer Knights Technology and wafer inspection system specialist Techné Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales fell by a third in 1998 as the industry plummeted. Undaunted, the company spent 30% of revenues to keep pace with the industry's migration to larger (300mm) wafers, and new technologies such as smart cards. Sales rebounded in 1999 with a major order from Israeli chip foundry

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Electroglas relocated to San Jose, California. The following year it expanded one facility in Taiwan and opened another. Also in 2001, its software offerings were reorganized into a division called EGsoft. The new division marketed integrated yield management products designed to help chip makers improve plant productivity. That year, chip makers cut production during a harsh slump, and the company's sales fell by more than 60%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wozniak stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2003. He was succeeded in both roles by former

    Integrated Measurement Systems
   </company>
   chief Keith Barnes. Also in 2003 the company sold some software product lines (and de-emphasized EGsoft), and shed its business in optical inspection equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company exited its headquarters facility in San Jose to chip maker

    Integrated Device Technology
   </company>
   (IDT). In 2005 the company leased a new headquarters building, also in San Jose.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Keith Barnes left in 2006 to become president and CEO of

   executive and board member of Electroglas, was named chairman and CEO. In 2009 Rohrs stepped aside as CEO, but remained executive chairman. COO Warren Kocmond was promoted to CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 Electroglas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its assets were purchased out of bankruptcy by a group of private investors, which had formed EG Systems, LLC, to buy the company's wafer probe business. With the purchase, Electroglas changed its name to EG Systems. It also changed leadership when Raj Kaul took the helm from Kocmond that year.
