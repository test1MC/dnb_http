   R.G. Barry would be perfectly happy if women and men would scuff around everywhere in their slippers. As the world's leading maker and marketer of comfort footwear and slippers, the company specializes in manufacturing soft slippers and casual footwear for men, women, and children. They're sold under such brands as Angel Treads, Dearfoams, EZfeet, My College Footwear, Terrasoles, Soluna, and Snug Treds, as well as licensed names, which account for most of its revenue. R.G. Barry sells its footwear through department stores nationwide. The company was acquired in mid-2015 by private-equity firms Mill Road Capital and Blackstone.
