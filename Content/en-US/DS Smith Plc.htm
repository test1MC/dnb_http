   This is one Smith that doesn't want to remain anonymous. DS Smith is one of the top paper and corrugated packaging products producers in the UK. The company's lineup includes conventional cardboard packaging used to ship fresh produce, prepared foods, and other consumer goods; decorative packaging for point-of-sale displays; and heavy-duty corrugated boxes used to transport heavy or fragile products. Subsidiaries DS Smith Packaging, DS Smith Kaysersberg, and DS Smith Paper drive operations from more than 70 plants across Europe. Subsidiary DS Smith Plastics makes plastic products required for liquid packaging and dispensing, and other applications.

  <p>
   Capitalizing on the wartime demand for cigarettes, David Solomon Smith and his cousin began manufacturing cigarette cartons in London in 1940. (Smith was chairman of his company until 1991.) The enterprise went public in 1960, but little changed until 1983, when Richard Brewster and others bought a 29% stake. Brewster became CEO and began acquiring other paper and packaging makers. After some small deals, including Western Board Mills (1984) and Abbitrin (1985), David S. Smith picked up St. Regis in 1986 and Kemsley Mill in 1988. By the time Brewster left the company in 1991, it was the UK's leading papermaker.
  </p>

   Peter Williams became the new CEO and continued down the acquisition trail. Notable purchases include French packaging company Kaysersberg in 1992 and Spicers, an office-products wholesaler, in 1993. In 1996 David S. Smith added Biber Paper Converting and its subsidiary, John Dickinson Stationery (sold in 2005).
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite rosy mid-decade predictions for the future of the paper industry, by 1997 profits had begun a downward slide, thanks to the pound's strength and industry overcapacity. After three straight years of declining profits, David S. Smith said in 1999 that it was willing to consider being acquired. However, an increase in sales and successful restructuring efforts significantly improved the company's position in 2000.

   With increased profits, David S. Smith resumed its expansion activities. In 2000 the company acquired Packaging Systems LLC, also known as Rapak, a leading supplier of bag-in-box liquid packaging, based in Chicago. The next year it added a Spicers division in Germany to increase its European office product sales. David S. Smith also formed alliances with

   on packaging and
   <company id="109565">

   on wholesale office products in the US, and wants to spend $142 million on acquisitions to strengthen its position in the paper and packaging markets. In September 2001 the company changed its name to DS Smith plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired the New Thames Mill and the adjacent Grovehurst Energy from

    M-real Corp.
   </company>
   and subsequently converted the mill to manufacture lightweight CCM. In 2010 DS Smith sold its corrugated packaging operations in Turkey for around Â£4.8 million (about $7.6 million).
