   Bay State Milling expands its product line organically, as well as through acquisitions. In 2012 it launched half a dozen new products, including three multigrain blend varieties, pizza crust and pizza flour mixes, and flours that combine the health benefits of whole wheat with a milder flavor.

  <p>
   In mid-2010 Bay State Milling took full ownership of Rocky Mountain Milling, based in Platteville, Colorado. The deal made Bay State Milling one of the nation's largest millers of organic flour and a top name in the fast-growing organic ingredients market. Bay State had been part owner and manager of the Colorado miller since 1999.

   In 2012 it purchased T.J. Harkins, a supplier grains, seeds, and spices to the baking industry. The deal expanded Bay State's offerings, including its line of organic products.
