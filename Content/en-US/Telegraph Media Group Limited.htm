   One of Fleet Street's finest, Telegraph Media Group (TMG) "
   <em>
    was, is, and will be"
   </em>
   there to bring you the news. TMG is a leading newspaper publisher in the UK with its highly reputable flagship papers
   <em>
    The Daily Telegraph
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Sunday Telegraph
   </em>
   . The broadsheet daily boasts a circulation of about 480,000, while its news and information website serves more than 100 million unique visitors from across the globe each month. Telegraph Media also publishes
   <em>
    The Telegraph Magazine
   </em>
   along with special interest title
   <em>

    Note: Growth rates may differ after conversion to US Dollars. Telegraph Media Group reported a 53-week financial year for 2015, versus 52 weeks in 2014.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, Telegraph Media Group turned in a doughty performance by defying industry-wide declining revenues and posting revenue of £320 million, a £2 million increase on 2014. Profit was also up 6% to £39.0 million.

  <p>
   As with all traditional newspaper companies, Telegraph Media Group is struggling to navigate the choppy waters of the move from paper to online, as well as working out what to do about competition from large-scale digital platforms like
   <company id="148344">
    Facebook
   </company>
   and
   <company id="160756">
    Twitter
   </company>
   . It has introduced a quasi-subscription model for its website, where users get a small allocation of free articles each week, after which they have to buy a subscription to keep reading.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an age of uncontrolled, social media-driven "fake news", TMG's reputation for journalistic integrity is becoming an increasingly valuable asset. TMG hopes to leverage its good reputation to open up new revenue streams, including new approaches to partnerships and advertising.
