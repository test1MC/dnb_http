   Trinseo believes that there's a great future in plastics. Trinseo (formerly Styron) develops customized polymers and plastics for the automotive, packaging, consumer goods, and construction industries. Major products include styrene-butadiene latex and synthetic rubber, and styrenics (polystyrene) and engineered polymers, its primary plastics offerings. With 34 manufacturing plants in 14 countries, Trinseo generates 60% of its revenues from Europe. On the product side, plastics make up the majority of sales. The company, which is controlled by
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   , went public in 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company used the $190 million in net proceeds from the offering to pay down debt, and pays fees and expenses associated with this offering and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Following the 2014 IPO,
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital

   retained 79% of the company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Trinseo has production facilities included 34 manufacturing plants at 26 sites across 14 countries, including China and Indonesia. It also operates 11 research and development facilities globally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Europe accounted for 60% of total net sales in 2015; Asia-Pacific, 22%,  and the US, 14%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Trinseo operates four reporting businesses under two segments. Its Emulsion Polymers segment includes Latex and Synthetic Rubber. Its Plastics business unit includes the Styrenics and Engineered Polymers business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Performance Materials division includes Synthetic Rubber, Latex, and Performance Plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Basic Plastics &amp; Feedstocks division includes styrenic polymers, polycarbonate, or PC, and styrene monomer. It also includes two 50%-owned joint ventures, Americas Styrenics, and Sumika Styron Polycarbonate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Basic Plastics &amp; Feedstocks segment accounted for 45% of Trinseo's net sales in 2015; Latex, 24%; Performance Plastics, 19%; and Synthetic Rubber, 12%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company products are used by end-markets such as automotive, consumer electronics, appliances, lighting, electrical, carpet, paper and board, building and construction, and tires.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinseo's promotional and advertising expenses were $3.5 million, $2.9 million, and $3 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   The company's net sales have trending downward since 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Trinseo's net sales decreased by $1.1 billion due to lower selling prices (reflecting the pass through of lower butadiene costs to its customers in Latex and Synthetic Rubber) and lower styrene monomer costs in Latex and Basic Plastics &amp; Feedstocks.  The decrease was also due to an unfavorable currency impact across all of its segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company incurred a net income of $133.6 million in 2015 compared to a $67.3 million loss in the previous year. The primary reason was due to decreased cost of sales partially offset by decreased sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cost of sales declined thanks to lower prices for raw materials (primarily butadiene and styrene monomer) while an additional decrease was due to a favorable currency impact across its segments, as the US dollar strengthened against the euro.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinseo's net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 201%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Its strategy includes taking advantage of industry innovations, investing in R&amp;D, making strategic acquisitions, and expanding its operations in growing markets in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Trinseo previously announced expansions at its synthetic rubber plant in Germany and at its latex plant in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company closed its Allyn's Point latex manufacturing facility in Gales Ferry, Connecticut as part of a restructuring plan aimed at improving Latex segment results (which had fallen due to continuing declines in the coated paper industry in North America).
