   The view at Birds Eye Foods is on vegetables and a healthy bottom line. The company's namesake packaged frozen vegetables, whether boxed and bagged, are the #1 brand in the US frozen vegetable industry -- a more than $2 billion market in terms of retail sales. The company is also the #2 producer of frozen complete bagged meals that provide a protein, starch, and vegetable. Birds Eye also makes such staples as bottled salad dressings and canned pie fillings and chili. It supplies US retail food retailers, as well as foodservice and industrial food customers. Birds Eye operates as a division of diversified foods producer

   Pinnacle Foods acquired Birds Eye in late 2009, following Birds Eye's IPO filing in October that year. Birds Eye, which has long pursued growth through target marketing and ongoing innovation, intended to use the proceeds to accelerate those strategies, as well as to pay down debt. The company expected to raise about $350 million. However, Blackstone offered $1.3 billion, paving the way for Pinnacle Foods to become a leader in both the frozen and shelf-stable food segments.

   Under Pinnacle Foods' umbrella, Birds Eye's operating results are combined with single-serve frozen dinners and entrées (Hungry-Man, Swanson), frozen seafood (Van de Kamp's, Mrs. Paul's), frozen breakfast (Aunt Jemima), bagels (Lender's), and frozen pizza (Celeste). The Birds Eye Frozen division generates more than 40% of Pinnacle Foods' sales and operating earnings.

   Birds Eye continues to add to its convenience lineup. It has had success with the Steamfresh and Voila! products, which can be prepared  in their packaging in the microwave oven. Honing in on the changing demographics of US consumers, the company offers a variation called Steamfresh Meals for Two, and, for those watching their waistline, Steamfresh Lightly Sauced. It currently holds nearly 27% of the US frozen vegetable market and more than 17% of the frozen complete bagged meals market.

   The Birds Eye products are named after company founder Clarence Birdseye. In the early 20th century, Birdseye witnessed native fishermen freezing fish in the arctic air of Labrador in Canada. He noticed how quickly the fish became frozen and retained their flavor and texture. The experience spurred him to invent the quick freezing of food in the 1920s, first offering products for sale in 1930.

   The company was formerly known as Agrilink but changed its name in 2002 in order to reflect the company's success with its Birds Eye brands.

        <p>
   In a move to concentrate on its frozen vegetables, in 2003 the company sold its applesauce business to
   <company id="108624">
    Knouse Foods
   </company>
   and its popcorn business to
   <company id="58663">
    Gilster-Mary Lee
   </company>
   . Also that year, the company sold its Veg·All canned vegetable unit to Arkansas-based
   <company id="109613">
    Allens
   </company>
   . Birds Eye exited the canned vegetable business entirely in 2004 with the sale of its Freshlike operations, again to Allens. (The sale did not impact frozen products carrying the Freshlike brand name.) Moving into the West Coast market, in 2004 the company acquired California &amp; Washington Company (C&amp;W), a frozen vegetable and fruit company based in San Francisco.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sold its Mexican operations in 2005. The next year, its announced the elimination of its non-branded vegetable business, citing low profit margins. The company also closed three New York factories and one each in California, Georgia, and Wisconsin. In 2006 it sold its private-label frozen vegetable business to Allens. In addition to store brands, the deal included the Chill Ripe and Garden Classics brands. The sale was part of the company's strategy to concentrate on its profitable Birds Eye brand.
