   Whether it's reporting on the news or just talking about it, this network does both all day long. Cable News Network (CNN) operates one of the top 24-hour news channels, reaching more than 100 million US homes. In addition to its flagship channel, the company offers HLN (formerly CNN Headline News), and it has an international division that keeps worldwide viewers informed. CNN has about 45 news bureaus around the world, including roughly 15 in the US. Away from the television, CNN operates the top-ranked CNN.com news website, and it offers syndicated news services. Founded in 1980 by cable broadcasting pioneer Ted Turner, CNN operates as part of

   division.

   Outside of the US, CNN is seen in nearly 200 other countries.

   A pioneer and once dominant force in shaping the 24-hour news cycle, CNN has suffered a slow but steady decline as viewers migrate to other sources. The network trails far behind 24-hour news leader

    FOX News

   (owned by

   ).

   The cut-throat battle for TV ratings is just a small part of the challenge for CNN as the network finds itself competing against an increasing array of media outlets, including news aggregation websites.

  <p>
   Like other channels within Turner's portfolio of cable networks, CNN generates revenue primarily through advertising and carriage fees paid by cable system operators.

   The company continues to expand its online operations with video and audio features, as well as media designed for portable devices such as MP3 players and mobile phones. CNN's HLN network has been shifting its focus beyond entertainment news and trial coverage towards politics. However, covering live events and breaking global news remain CNN's bread and butter.

   CNN has had an unexpected ratings success in Anthony Bourdain's
   <em>
    Parts Unknown
   </em>
   series.
