   American Railcar Industries (ARI) doesn't make the little engine that could, but it does make the cars that the engine pulls. A North American manufacturer of railcars and railcar components, the company also provides maintenance and fleet management services to freight shippers, railcar leasing companies, and railroads. Its two Arkansas manufacturing facilities make several types of railcars including covered hoppers for grains, cement, and other dry bulk and tank cars for liquid and gas commodities. The company also serves non-rail industries with industrial products such as steel and aluminum casting, machining, stamping, welding, and fabrication.

  <p>
   Headquartered at Saint Charles, Missouri, ARI has eight manufacturing plants that fabricate and assemble raw materials including two Arkansas-based railcar manufacturing plants; seven railcar repair plants; and 13 mobile repair and mini-shop locations throughout the US (primarily concentrated in Texas and Missouri) and Canada (Ontario).

  <p>
   ARI divides its operations across three segments: manufacturing (80% of total sales), railcar services, (12%), and railcar leasing (8%).

  <p>
   The company sells and markets its products and services through marketing personnel and sales representatives directly to its customers in North America. It serves primarily leasing companies, industrial companies, and clients that use railcars for freight transport, or shippers, and Class I railroads. Its top 10 customers accounted for 75% of its total revenues in 2015.

  <p>
   After suffering through the decline in demand for new railcars due to the economic downturn, ARI has enjoyed exceptional growth over the last few years. Revenues peaked at a record-setting $889 million in 2015 mainly due to increased sales across all segments, especially manufacturing. Profits also peaked at $133 million in 2015, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Manufacturing sales climbed by 17% due to higher Hopper railcar shipments for direct sale as a result of demand shifts towards more specialty hopper railcar types. Railcar leasing revenue also surged by 79% due to an increase in the number of railcars on lease. In addition, railcar services revenues for 2015 increased by 7%.

  <p>
   The company is focused on investing capital and evaluating opportunities to further expand its manufacturing flexibility and repair capacity. It completed three repair expansion projects in 2015 and one in early 2016 to tank railcar manufacturing facilities. In 2014, ARI expanded its railcar repair capabilities with a new repair facility in Brookhaven, Mississippi.
