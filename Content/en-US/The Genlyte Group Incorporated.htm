  <p>
   The company's strategy includes strengthening its leadership position through continued innovation in high-quality, efficient and connected LED systems, building on its strengths in lamps by delivering innovative products (such as the Hue personal wireless lighting system that can be controlled by a smart phone or tablet). At the same time it is looking to address the higher costs of LEDs; developing new channels to market; improving innovation in professional lighting systems and services; and strengthening its capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also plans to further strengthen its position in the digital market through added investment in LED while growing market share and profits in conventional lamps.

   As Professional Luminaires North America continues to decrease its interest in products intended for smaller, do-it-yourself jobs, the company has concentrated on products used in large commercial and industrial projects as well as more energy efficient products. To that end, the business unit has been focusing on smart technology like occupancy-sensing switches and dimmers that adjust the sensor's operation to the occupant's living patterns. It also participated in a
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   contest to develop a more efficient light bulb. Professional Luminaires North America won the competition with an LED bulb that delivers an 83% energy savings. If all 60-watt incandescent bulbs in the US were replaced with it, the savings would total nearly $4 billion annually. The company won $10 million for its efforts.

  <p>
   The Genlyte Group began as part of Bairnco (founded in 1967), a maker of diversified industrial products. Genlyte was formed in 1984 when Bairnco consolidated 11 lighting companies. The operation acquired Diamond F Corp. and Timely Lighting in 1985 and Sarama Lighting the next year. Genlyte was spun off from Bairnco in 1987. After stumbling through a recession in 1990 and losing its CEO (David Mormot) to rival GE in 1991, the company's fortunes revived. The next year Genlyte acquired decorative lighting maker Forecast Lighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Larry Powers was named CEO in 1994. In 1997 Genlyte launched Lytening, a down-light housing unit that made it easier for contractors to install recessed lighting fixtures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1998 and 2004 the company had primarily operated through
   <company id="58288">
    Genlyte Thomas Group LLC
   </company>
   , its joint venture with
   <company id="11476">
    Thomas Industries
   </company>
   , but in 2004 Genlyte bought out Thomas Industries' 32% stake in the venture to assume full ownership. Genlyte moved its headquarters from New Jersey to Kentucky as part of the deal. To further streamline, in 1999 the company combined its Day-Brite, Capri, and Omega divisions and closed its Hopkinsville, Kentucky, plant. Genlyte Thomas also bought Canadian lighting system maker Ledalite Architectural Products to strengthen its presence in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Genlyte Thomas acquired the US Chloride Safety Systems and LightGuard Emergency Lighting brands from the UK's Chloride Group, as well as California-based Translite Systems, a maker of low voltage cable and track lighting systems. That year the company's sales topped $1 billion. In 2001 Genlyte Thomas' Lightolier division inked a pact with Steelcase to develop workplace lighting. In late 2002 Genlyte and Genlyte Thomas moved their headquarters to a new facility, which also housed Thomas Lighting, Thomas National Accounts, and Genlyte/Lightolier Sales. In the same year the company acquired Vari-Lite's automated entertainment light manufacturing and sales divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Group brands include VARI-LITE, Widelite, Strand Lighting, Shakespeare Composite Structures, and Lightolier, to name a few. In 2003 Genlyte Group added the light pole assets of Shakespeare Industrial Group, a subsidiary of K2, Inc., for an undisclosed price.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2006 Genlyte acquired
   <company id="118814">
    JJI Lighting Group
   </company>
   for approximately $118 million. JJI, which operates as an independent division, gives the company access into the German and Swedish lighting markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent company Philips Electronics acquired Genlyte Group for about $2.7 million in 2008. Royal Philips is now North America's largest maker of lighting products, surpassing

    General Electric
   </company>
   . Genlyte's manufacturing operations were relocated from Kentucky to Massachusetts.
