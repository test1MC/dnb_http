   Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (AGTC) has its eye fixed on developing gene therapies for acquired and inherited retinal diseases. Its current lead product candidates are treatments for X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), achromatopsia (ACHM), and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). All three retinal diseases can cause blindness, and the XLRS and ACHM product candidates are currently moving beyond the Phase 1/2 stages. AGTC is also developing a product candidate for treatment of the inherited orphan lung disease Alpha-1 antitryspin (AAT) deficiency for which it has conducted preclinical proof-of-concept studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

   ACTC has operations in Florida and Massachusetts.

   AGTC made very little revenue until fiscal 2016 (ended June), when revenue rose nearly 2,000% to $47.4 million. The company has yet to make any product revenue, and although grant revenue and sponsored research revenue dropped or disappeared in 2016, the company made $46.8 million from a collaboration with
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   . This led to a drastic drop in net losses, which had been growing for the past few years. In fiscal 2016, though, its net loss rose from the previous year's $24.3 million to only $1.4 million.

  <p>
   AGTC's lead candidates target inherited orphan eye diseases caused by gene mutations; diseases in its crosshairs currently lack effective medical treatments. If its candidates are brought to market, it hopes to leverage its success toward other gene therapy treatments including eye diseases which afflict a wider population and diseases of the ear.

  <p>
   In mid-2015, the company entered into a collaboration agreement with
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen
   </company>
   . Together the commercial partners plan to develop, secure approval for, and commercialize gene therapy products as described above.
