   What moves you? For Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA), it's a rhetorical question. The subsidiary of German automaker
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler AG
   </company>
   is North America's #1 heavy-duty truck maker for long hauls. In addition to the familiar Freightliner brand, DTNA makes commercial vehicles under the
   <company id="47845">
    Western Star
   </company>
   nameplate, and manufactures school buses under the
   <company id="139198">
    Thomas Built
   </company>
   brand. Operations include
   <company id="128833">
    Freightliner Custom Chassis
   </company>
   , which makes chassis for motor homes, delivery vans, and buses, and
   <company id="16479">
    Detroit Diesel
   </company>
   , a builder of medium- and heavy-duty diesel engines and components. DTNA offers customers access to capital as well as roadway conveniences, too, through partnerships.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's production and distribution footprint extends across the US, Canada, and Mexico. It did close several US plants during the global recession and shift some production to Mexico. DTNA also operates eight distribution centers throughout North America. The company exports to more than 35 countries outside of the NAFTA region, include Australia, South Africa, and Central and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   DTNA operates approximately 1,200 locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico (including
   <company id="16479">
    Detroit Diesel
   </company>
   distributors, Petro Truck Centers, and
   <company id="44947">
    TravelCenters of America
   </company>
   ServicePoint facilities).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates nine manufacturing facilities, six Detroit Diesel remanufacturing centers, nine parts distribution centers and five business office locations.

  <p>
   Parent company
   <company id="58357">
    Daimler AG
   </company>
   earned 23% of its total 2014 revenues from the Daimler Trucks segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 DTNA sold 161,000 units, an increase of 19% over the previous year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   DTNA began selling the new Western Star 5700XE in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it launched Pinnacle Truck Parts, an e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between customers and DTNA's parts and service network.
  </p>
  <p>
   DTNA's Alliance Truck Part unit expanded its clutch line in 2014 to include four medium-duty clutches as well as seven updated EZ-Assist clutches for the heavy-duty market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing through partnerships, in 2014, the company partnered with JOST International to use its JSK36 lightweight fifth wheel as the standard fifth wheel for all Freightliner truck models. That year it also teamed up with Seattle-based Zonar Systems to provide factory-installed telematics features for Thomas Built Buses' Saf-T-Liner C2 models as standard equipment.

  <p>
   After struggling with layoffs and plant closures, the company began hiring again in mid-2011 when it announced plans to create up to 1,600 new jobs in the US and Mexico. Part of the positive news is good reception of its more environmentally friendly offerings. Fuel efficient vehicles, reduced-emission engines, and even hybrid and alternative fuel models are now part of all product lines. DTNA began using lean truck manufacturing processes and environmental controls in many of its plants, including recycling 90% of all materials and waste treatment, in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   DTNA taces its origins in the US to the late 1930s. In 2008 Freightliner LLC became Daimler Trucks North America LLC, better reflecting its role in Daimler's global operations.
