   Tembec is the little mill that could -- and did. Rescued by workers from a shuttered mill in 1973, the forest products company today maintains significant operations in the US, Canada, and France. Through about 30 manufacturing facilities it produces pulp, paper, paperboard, lumber, and chemicals from the by-products of its pulping process; these products are marketed worldwide. Tembec's pulp unit, the company's largest group, accounts for more than half of sales. Its wood products unit sells SPF (spruce-pine-fir) lumber and hardwood flooring products primarily in North America. Tembec also manages forest land in four Canadian provinces. Outside of North America, it has sales offices in Asia.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Montreal, Tembec has operations in Canada, France, the European Union, China, and the US. The US accounts for around 40% of the company's total sales, while Canada generates nearly 20%. Other major markets include Europe and China.

  <p>
   Tembec has experienced fluctuating revenues and profits over the years. Revenues were down by almost 10% from 2012 to 2013 due to revenues drops across all its segments due to lower demand for its products and services. The company has also suffered net losses for the last three years.

  <p>
   Tembec has been fighting events that have put the company at risk for several years, including internal factors (occupational safety and health performance and debt and liquidity issues) and external ones (a weak product market, a long-running softwood lumber trade dispute between Canada and the US, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates). The company resorted to cutting jobs, as well as selling or shutting down certain underperforming mills both in North America and France. The company in 2012 sold its British Columbia Southern Interior wood products assets to

     Canfor Corporation
    </company>
   </company>
   for roughly $60 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2013, Tembec sold land in East Kootenay, British Columbia, for $19 million. Tembec's company-wide objective is to gain up to $75 million in land sales by December 2014.
