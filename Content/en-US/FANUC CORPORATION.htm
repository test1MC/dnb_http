   In FANUC's robot segment, the US and Europe are major markets, followed by China. US-based subsidiary
   <company id="113598">
    FANUC Robotics America
   </company>
   is a supplier of industrial robots for automation applications, with more than 200,000 FANUC robots installed worldwide. Although the automotive and machine tool industries are major customer groups, FANUC's robots are increasingly serving the aerospace, alternative energy, consumer goods, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Robotics and automation capabilities are thought to be key tools in manufacturing competitiveness.

   FANUC's Genkotsu line consists of robotic models that perform functions ranging from assembling precision parts for electric machinery to handling car body and other heavy object transferring. In terms of development, FANUC is expanding the intelligent functions of its robots to improve their speed and productivity. Its R&amp;D efforts led to the launch of the Learning Robot, which "learns" the vibration at the time of operation with an acceleration sensor and suppresses the vibration in order to achieve higher speed operations.

   Meanwhile, in its robomachine segment, sales of ROBODRILL, a small high-precision machining center that performs milling, boring, drilling, and tapping, is one of FANUC's more popular products.

  <p>
   Demand for the company's CNC products under its FA segment remains high in China, as well as Taiwan and Korea. FANUC continually adds various functions and upgrades to its global standard CNCs for high-speed and high-precision machining. Laser sales under its FA segment are also picking up, especially in the domestic market, as it develops better functionality and reliability in laser oscillators that are designed to improve cutting quality and reduce electricity consumption.
