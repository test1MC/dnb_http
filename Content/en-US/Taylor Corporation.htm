   The company acquired Venture Encoding in 2012. Venture provides customer communications services -- including loan servicing, borrower communications and marketing solutions -- in compliance-driven markets such as financial services. Taylor is using the deal to expand its Corporate Graphics Direct Marketing Solutions, an affiliate based in Minnesota; it is merging the two businesses to form a new company called Venture Solutions.
