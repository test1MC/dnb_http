   Anacor is hardcore about curing skin conditions. The company is developing boron-based drug compounds for use as topical treatments of bacterial, fungal, and inflammatory conditions. Its lead candidates aim to treat onychomycosis (a kind of toenail fungus), psoriasis, and hospital-acquired bacterial infections. Anacor has focused on topical treatments for the time being because they are relatively easy to develop and market, but it believes its boron chemistry can produce drugs in therapeutic fields such as viral and parasitic infections and rare infectious diseases. The company went public in 2010; it was then acquired by
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   for $5.2 billion in 2016.

  <p>
   In addition to its lead candidates, Anacor has other candidates it's developing itself and three others it has out-licensed. Pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly has one for animal health, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (an international, non-profit R&amp;D organization) has licensed one for sleeping sickness, and global pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline is developing one to treat tuberculosis.

   The company formerly had a development agreement with Medicis Pharmaceutical for an acne treatment. But the two have been fighting about an alleged breach of contract for several years.

  <p>
   Anancor, as a clinical stage company, receives minimal revenue based on its development agreements. The company, which doesn't expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future, is operating with an accumulated deficit of $215 million.

  <p>
   The company's strategy for changing its financial condition includes continued R&amp;D and trials to commercialize its products. Once that's done, it plans to hire a sales force to target dermatologists, podiatrists, and other specialists in the US while collaborating with third parties for international sales.

   In 2016 Anacor was acquired by Pfizer, which hopes to capitalize on the growing market for steroid-free eczema treatments.
