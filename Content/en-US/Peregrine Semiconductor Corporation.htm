   Peregrine Semiconductor's chips are made to take flight. The fabless company designs radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) used in the wireless infrastructure, broadband, mobile wireless device, aerospace, and test and measurement markets. Its UltraCMOS technology combines standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with a synthetic sapphire substrate that provides enhanced power and performance over silicon substrates. Other products include attenuators, mixers, and synthesizers. Peregrine Semiconductor generates more than 70% of sales from customers in Japan. It was acquired by

    Murata Manufacturing
   </company>
   in late 2014.

   , Namiki Precision Jewel Co., and
   <company id="158802">
    Rubicon Technology
   </company>
   to supply its sapphire substrates, a key raw material, while LAPIS Semiconductor of Japan,
   <company id="136156">
    MagnaChip Semiconductor
   </company>
   of South Korea, and Silanna Semiconductor of Australia make its products. Peregrine does some of its own final testing. Peregrine holds more than 180 filed and pending patents and has shipped more than 2.5 billion UltraCMOS units.
