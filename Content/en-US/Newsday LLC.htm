   Like most other newspapers around the country,
   <em>
    Newsday
   </em>
   has struggled to manage the decline in the print industry caused by readers and advertisers migrating to other forms of media. The paper has done its share of cost cutting through layoffs and other reductions, but
   <em>
    Newsday
   </em>
   also started charging a subscription for access to its website in 2009. (Print subscribers and Cablevision TV subscribers continue to get free access.)
