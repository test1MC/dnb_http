   Weatherford International can weather the natural and economic storms that affect the oil and gas market. The company, which is domiciled in Switzerland but operationally based in Houston, supplies a wide range of equipment and services used in the oil and gas drilling industry, and operates in 100 countries. Weatherford provides well installation and completion systems, equipment rental, and fishing services (removing debris from wells). It provides pipeline services and oil recovery and hydraulic lift and electric submersible pumps to the oil and gas industry. The company also offers contract land drilling services.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Operating in a volatile market, Weatherford has strengthened its broad base of product offerings through acquisitions and geographic expansion. Its subsidiaries include Scotland-based Petroline Wellsystems (provider of completion products), Canada-based Alpine Oil Services (under-balanced drilling equipment), and UK company Orwell (oil field services). The company has also created UK-based WellServ, a full-services well intervention unit.

  <p>
   Bouncing back from the global recession, which saw low commodity prices and decreased demand for oil and gas activities in 2009, the company posted a major jump in revenues and income in 2010. The financial improvement was driven primarily by higher prices and much stronger oil and gas exploration and production activities in the North American market.

  <p>
   The company has been following a long-term strategy of divestment to decrease its debt levels and monetize the company's non-core businesses. In 2014, the company sold its engineered chemistry and integrity drilling fluids businesses to an affiliate of
   <company id="10921">
    Lubrizol
   </company>
   (a Berkshire-Hathaway company) for $750 million. The move brought the company's total divestiture proceeds to $1.7 billion in 2014, which brought its debt down below its targeted levels and substantially lowered the risk of the company in a season of falling oil prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Weatherford sold its oil and gas development and production business to raise cash to invest in its core oil field services businesses. To that end, the company in 2008 acquired US-based International Logging, a provider of surface logging, formation evaluation, and drilling related services. It also bought the oilfield services unit of
   <company id="122955">
    TNK-BP
   </company>
   for about $500 million in stock in 2009, giving it access to former Soviet markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking the most favorable financial business location  (in terms of taxes) for its registered office, in 2009 Weatherford shifted its domicile from Bermuda to Switzerland.

  <p>
   Energy Ventures was founded in 1972 as an offshore oil and gas explorer and producer. In 1981 it became a 50-50 partner with Northwest Energy in an oil field located in Hockley County, Texas. By 1982 Northwest had increased its ownership in Energy Ventures to about 25%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Majority stockholder Appalachian attempted a takeover in 1984, but later agreed to drop the takeover in exchange for the liquidation of Energy Ventures. A slump in oil and gas prices in 1985 derailed the plan.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the late 1980s Energy Ventures was vertically integrating by buying oil field product makers such as Grant Oil Country Tubular (1990) and Prideco (1995). Grant and Prideco were combined in 1995, solidifying the company's position as a leading supplier of drill pipe and tubulars. In 1997 the company built a manufacturing facility in Canada and changed its name to EVI.
  </p>
  <p>
   EVI doubled its size in 1998 by merging with oil field services firm Weatherford Enterra, which had been formed by the 1995 combination of Houston-based firms Weatherford International and Enterra. The newly combined company adopted the Weatherford International name shortly thereafter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Weatherford acquired
   <company id="10333">
    Christiana Companies
   </company>
   , whose 33% interest in Total Logistic Control introduced Weatherford to the warehousing and trucking business. Also, Weatherford bought Scotland-based Petroline Wellsystems, which makes oil and gas well completion products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year the company spun off its drill pipe and casings maker, Grant Prideco. Also in 2000 the company continued its geographic expansion with the purchase of Gas Services International (compression systems serving Asia and the Middle East), Oakwell Compressor Packages of the Netherlands, and Alpine Oil Services of Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001, after buying out GE Capital's 36% interest in its natural gas compression joint venture, Weatherford exchanged the subsidiary for a 48% stake in Universal Compression Holdings. That year the company's acquisitions included US-based CAC, a maker of control systems for the oil and gas industry, and Scottish oil field services company Orwell, which widened its presence in the North Sea, Asia/Pacific, and Middle East regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To reduce its US tax obligations, Weatherford reincorporated in Bermuda in 2002. Later that year it formed a pipeline and specialty service group within its Drilling and Intervention Services division to offer pipe cleaning, testing, and inspection services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Weatherford completed the formation of WellServ, a full services well intervention group, through its Drilling &amp; Intervention Services division. Also that year the company completed its acquisition of Eclipse Packer, a Louisiana-based provider of coiled tubing and gravel packer systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Weatherford acquired two divisions of Canada's
   <company id="52716">
    Precision Drilling
   </company>
   for $2.3 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weatherford reorganized its operations in an effort to provide seamless services to its customers. The company sold its compression fabrication business to
   <company id="100605">
    Universal Compression Holdings
   </company>
   (now called
   <company id="89525">
    Exterran
   </company>
   ) in 2004.
