   BASF is the world's largest chemical company, ahead of
   <company id="10471">
    Dow
   </company>
   and
   <company id="105170">
    DuPont
   </company>
   , and serves upwards of 300,000 customers worldwide, from major global players to small businesses. It has more than 330 production sites and operates through five business segments: Chemicals (solvents, plasticizers and electronic chemicals), Performance Products (including dispersions and pigments, vitamins and food additives, and products for the paper and oil and gas industries), Oil and Gas (exploration and production), Functional Materials and Solutions (catalysts, industrial coatings, battery materials), and Agricultural Solutions (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   No one segment dominates BASF's sales mix, but Functional Materials is the largest at around a quarter of total sales. Performance Products, Chemicals and Oil &amp; Gas comprise around 20% each, with Agricultural Solutions and Other making up the remainder.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BASF has enormous global reach: it has companies in more than 80 countries worldwide, and supplies products to business partners in nearly every corner of the globe. Europe makes up just over half of total revenue, with North America and the Asia-Pacific region at around 20% each.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates more than 340 production sites across the globe, including six
   <em>
    Verbund
   </em>
   sites - highly efficient production plants key to BASF's resource-efficiency philosophy - which re-use outputs (heat, chemical by-products) to achieve lower energy consumption and higher chemical yields. There are two in Europe (Ludwigshafen, Germany and Antwerp, Belgium), two in the US (Geismar and Freeport), and two in Asia (Nanjing, China, and Kuantan, Malaysia - site in Nanjing is currently being expanded).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BASF sells to companies ranging from global enterprises to small businesses, and half of business units are geared to specific industries. In the chemicals business, marketing is partly carried out by e-commerce.

  </p>
  <p>
   BASF is highly exposed to the ongoing global economic turbulence, particularly given its dealings in oil and other commodities, and 2015 proved a tough year for the company; forecasts for 2016 predict similarly gloomy outlook.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total sales hit a five-year low in 2015 of €70 billion, a 5% decline on prior year. The Chemicals division bore a big chunk of the losses, falling 14% to €14.6 billion amid an increase in customer caution caused by the oil price slump. The significant drop in the price of raw materials was also a factor, pushing retail prices down. A similar fall in the Oil &amp; Gas segment was the result of the asset-swap with
   <company id="52477">
    Gazprom
   </company>
   - contributions from the natural gas trading and storage business ended as of Q4 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Positive currency effects helped grow revenue in Functional Materials and Performance Products, by 5% and 1% to €18.5 billion and €15.6 billion respectively. Higher sales prices helped Agricultural Solutions to revenue 7% higher than 2014 at €5.8 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell from €5.1 billion to €4.0 billion in 2015, a 23% fall - this was the company's poorest performance since the start of the decade. Positively, a reduction in inventories in 2015, among other factors, led to an increase in cash flow from operations, which hit a new high of €9.4 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   BASF uses what it calls Verbund strategy throughout its facilities to reduce emissions and increase efficiency - plants are both customers and suppliers of each other. While the company still gets more than half its sales from Europe, it continues to expand overseas, particularly in Asia. It has long seen the potential in Asia, and has put the region as a focus for growth and R&amp;D, and to this end an agricultural research centre was opened in Pune, India in May 2015. For its GM products, BASF focuses on markets in the Americas and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Difficult trading conditions have necessitated an adaptation period. In Q4 2015 BASF divested its gas trading and storage business to Russian gas giant Gazprom. The division, which contributed €10 billion to sales in the first three quarters of 2015, was victim of the historic slump in oil prices seen in the year. Parts of BASF's pharmaceutical ingredients and services business were sold to Switzerland's Siegfried Holdings AG, and BASF's white expandable polystyrene business in North and South America was sold to Alpek, a Mexican company.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also undertaking cost-cutting measures, including scaling-back capital expenditure and the sale of its pharmaceutical ingredients business; the sale of its industrial coatings business is being prepared, and will likely be sold to Akzo Nobel for around €470 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product and production innovation remains a cornerstone of long-term strategy, and 2015 saw numerous promising developments in each operating segment. To name just three, BASF improved the production process for Isononanol, a plasticizer precursor product; its Acronal® EDGE 4750 paint product acts as both a primer and top-coat at once; and in the Plant Science space it launched Cultivance®, a two-in-one GM soybean and corresponding herbicide. The company has about 3,000 projects in its research pipeline.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2017, BASF bought Switzerland-based Rolic AG, a specialist in light management for advanced LCD/OLED displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired
   <company id="16955">
    Albemarle
   </company>
   's global surface treatment business, Chemetall, for about $3.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, BASF acquired a number of businesses, spending about €227 million. In a busy February, it acquired Taiwan Sheen Soon Co., Ltd, a manufacturer of precursors for adhesives; Seashell Technology LLC was acquired for its silver nanowires technology; and BASF acquired a 66% share in TODA KOGYO CORP for its cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, patents and production capabilities in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in the year, it acquired the marketing and selling rights for the polyurethane business from Polioles, based in Mexico, and concluded the acquisition of technologies and patents for the production of high-molecular-weight polyisobutene from Lanxess Aktiengesellschaft.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Originally named Badische Anilin &amp; Soda-Fabrik, BASF AG was founded in Mannheim, Germany, by jeweler Frederick Englehorn in 1861. Unable to find enough land for expansion in Mannheim, BASF moved to nearby Ludwigshafen in 1865. The company was a pioneer in coal tar dyes, and it developed a synthetic indigo in 1897. Its synthetic dyes rapidly replaced more expensive organic dyes.
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF scientist Fritz Haber synthesized ammonia in 1909, giving BASF access to the market for nitrogenous fertilizer (1913). Haber received a Nobel Prize in 1918 but was later charged with war crimes for his work with poison gases. Managed by Carl Bosch, another Nobel Prize winner, BASF joined the I.G. Farben cartel with Bayer, Hoechst, and others in 1925 to create a German chemical colossus. Within the cartel BASF developed polystyrene, PVC, and magnetic tape. Part of the Nazi war machine, I.G. Farben made synthetic rubber and used labor from the Auschwitz concentration camp during WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war I.G. Farben was dismantled. BASF regained its independence in 1952 and rebuilt its war-ravaged factories. Strong postwar domestic demand for basic chemicals aided its recovery, and in 1958 BASF launched a US joint venture with Dow Chemical. (BASF bought out Dow's half in 1978.) The company moved into petrochemicals and became a leading manufacturer of plastic and synthetic fiber.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US the company purchased Wyandotte Chemicals (1969), Chemetron (1979), and Inmont (1985), among others. To expand its natural gas business in Europe, in 1991 the company signed deals with Russia's Gazprom and France's Elf Aquitaine. BASF bought Mobil's polystyrene-resin business and gained almost 10% of the US market.
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF bought Imperial Chemical's polypropylene business in 1994 and became Europe's second-largest producer of the plastic. The next year the company paid $1.4 billion for the pharmaceutical arm of UK retailer Boots.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 BASF formed a joint venture with PetroFina (now
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   ); in 2001 the venture opened the world's largest liquid steam cracker, in Port Arthur, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF made seven major acquisitions in 1998, including the complexing business of Ciba Specialty Chemicals. It also made six divestitures, which included its European buildings-paints operations, sold to Nobel N.V.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the US fined the company $225 million for its part in a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel (in 2001 the European Commission fined it another $260 million, bringing the total expected cost of fines, out-of-court settlements, and legal expenses to about $800 million). BASF also faced a class-action suit as a result of the scheme. That year the company moved into oil and gas exploration in Russia through a partnership agreement with Russia's Gazprom. BASF also merged its textile operations into Bayer and Hoechst's DyStar joint venture, forming a $1 billion company that is a world-leading dye maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF completed its acquisition of
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
   </company>
   ' industrial coatings business in 2000 and bought the Cyanamid division (herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides) of American Home Products (now Wyeth). That year BASF expanded its superabsorbents business by paying $656 million for US-based Amcol International's Chemdal International unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rather than attempt to compete in the rapidly consolidating pharmaceutical industry, in 2001 BASF sold its midsized Knoll Pharmaceutical unit to
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for about $6.9 billion. It also announced that it was closing 10 plants and cutting about 4,000 jobs (4% of its workforce).
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF sold its fibers unit in 2003 to focus on core chemical operations, which it added to throughout the next few years. For example, it bought a portion of
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   's agchem businesses for $1.3 billion when European antitrust regulators mandated the Bayer divestment following its acquisition of
   <company id="104861">
    Aventis CropScience
   </company>
   . BASF also acquired
   <company id="104856">
    Honeywell Specialty Materials
   </company>
   ' engineering plastics business in exchange for its fibers division. BASF's acquisition later that year of MSA's Callery Chemical Division strengthened BASF's line of inorganics, which it planned to focus on providing to the pharmaceutical industry. Other acquisitions included
   <company id="112592">
    Ticona
   </company>
   's nylon 66 business and
   <company id="104874">
    Sunoco
   </company>
   's plasticizers unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year also brought chairman Jürgen Hambrecht's announcement that the company would push forward with a restructuring of its North American business. The focus of the plan was to save more than $250 million over the next three years. Included among the steps were job cuts of approximately 1,000 and the relocation of its North American headquarters (though remaining in New Jersey) in late 2004. (The move to smaller facilities was enabled by the sale of Knoll Pharmaceuticals in 2001, which reduced operations at the home base.)
  </p>
  <p>
   BASF sold Basell, its petrochemical JV with
   <company id="50019">
    Shell
   </company>
   , in 2005. The two companies had announced in 2004 that they planned to exit the polyolefins business with the sale of Basell. The deal was finalized late the next year. Investment group Access Industries came in with the winning bid of about $5.7 billion. That company's name was changed to
   <company id="106018">
    LyondellBasell
   </company>
   after its 2007 acquisition of
   <company id="10924">
    Lyondell Chemical Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened two Verbund sites in Asia -- one in Nanjing, China, and the other in Kuantan, Malaysia. The Chinese site delivered its first product in early 2005 and began operating fully in the middle of that year. It's the centerpiece and primary operation of
   <company id="139145">
    BASF-YPC
   </company>
   , a joint venture with
   <company id="150221">
    Sinopec
   </company>
   that was formed in 2000. BASF's goal is to achieve 70% of its sales in the region from local production by 2015; that figure hovered at about 60% in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also legally changed its name from BASF Aktiengesellschaft to BASF SE in 2008. The move made formal BASF's transition to a European company, as opposed to one organized in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 BASF spent about $4 billion to acquire Swiss chemicals giant
   <company id="53105">
    Ciba
   </company>
   . Following a review phase of Ciba's operations and their fit within the structure of BASF, the company began integrating Ciba into its performance products segment; this entailed the sale or closure of almost half of Ciba's 55 manufacturing facilities and the loss of about 3,700 of its employees. As part of that strategy, BASF SE sold the Regulatory and Safety Testing businesses of Ciba's Expert Services unit to London-based Intertek Group in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010, BASF acquired specialty chemicals company
   <company id="104313">
    Cognis GmbH
   </company>
   in a $3.8 billion deal. Cognis gave BASF a boost in entering several high-margin business lines, such as personal care and cosmetics.
