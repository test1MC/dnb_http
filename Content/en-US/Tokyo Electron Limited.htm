   Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) is the one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor production equipment. TEL's chip-making systems include chemical vapor deposition, thermal processing, etching, cleaning, and probing equipment. The company also makes equipment for making flat-panel displays (FPD) and photovoltaics (PV), and distributes other companies' chip-making equipment, computer systems, networking products, and software in Japan. Subsidiary Tokyo Electron Device distributes chips, boards, and software made by companies including

   ,
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft

   , and
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   . The proposed acquisition of Tokyo Electron by
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   was dropped in April 2015 on antitrust concerns.

  <p>
   TEL's semiconductor equipment rakes in 78% of the company's revenue with electronic components and computer networking equipment accounting for 17%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in Japan, U.S, Europe, and Asia. TEL does research and development in Japan, Taiwan, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan accounts for 26% of TEL's revenue, followed by Taiwan, 22%, the US, 17%, China, 12%, and South Korea, 12%.

  <p>
   A recovery in the sale of semiconductor production equipment drove revenue 23% higher in 2014. The upturn reflected a better overall business environment, the company said. Sales in Japan jumped 35%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, however, tumbled to a loss on impairment charges, higher costs in sales and marketing and R&amp;D. The increased R&amp;D expenses were related to four overseas subsidiaries NEC acquired in 2013. Impairment costs included a big write off of photovoltaic investment.

  <p>
   The acquisition of TEL by Applied Materials would have created a blockbuster maker of chipmaking equipment. Anti-trust authorities thought it would be too much of a blockbuster and the companies dropped the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   On its own TEL has introduced new products including a new model sputtering system that fills a step in the chipmaking process. TEL also opened a stem cell research center in the UK to develop smart cell processing technologies.

   Frustrated by the unreliable semiconductor production equipment their employer, Nissho Trading Co. (Anow
   <company id="52015">
    Sojitz
   </company>
   ), was importing from the US, Tokuo Kubo and Toshio Kodada quit their jobs at Nissho in 1963 and founded Tokyo Electron Laboratories (TEL).
   <company id="51300">

   </company>
   provided some initial backing.
  </p>
  <p>
   At first about half of the company's sales came from importing US semiconductor equipment. The other half came from exporting Japanese electronics, such as car radios. In 1968 TEL and US-based diffusion furnace maker Thermco Systems (later acquired by Allegheny International) formed TEL-Thermco Engineering Co. TEL followed with other joint ventures, paying royalties to manufacture other companies' products in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's US unit, TEL America (now
   <company id="118697">
    Tokyo Electron America
   </company>
   ), was established in 1972. In 1978 Tokyo Electron Laboratories was renamed Tokyo Electron Limited (also TEL).
  </p>
  <p>
   TEL went public in 1980. In 1981 the company formed a joint venture with
   <company id="10627">
    GenRad
   </company>
   (later acquired by
   <company id="11456">
    Teradyne
   </company>
   ) to make test systems in the US. In 1988 TEL acquired Thermco's stake in their joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began a major international expansion in 1993, setting up shop in South Korea. In the following years it expanded into Germany, Italy, the UK, and Taiwan. In 1996 TEL managing director Tetsuro Higashi was named president. (He later became chairman and CEO.)
