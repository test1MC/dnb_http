   If you're hungry for power, this company can help. Schneider Electric is a leading global manufacturer of equipment for electrical power distribution and for industrial control and automation. The company helps power generators distribute electricity; designs automation systems for the automobile and water treatment industries; builds electric networks and utility management systems for energy, water treatment, oil and gas, and marine applications; and manages electric power in residential, industrial, and commercial buildings. It sells its products to the construction, electric power, industrial, and infrastructure markets.
In 2017 Schneider agreed to sell its agricultural information business Telvent to TBG&#160;AG, a Swiss firm, for around $900 million.</p>

        <p>
   Schneider's revenues jumped 7% and its profits increased 45% from 2013 to 2014 due to increased sales from its Buildings and Partner and Industry segments. These segments experienced solid OEM demand growth from all regions, especially Western Europe. (Note: the company's 2013 annual statement was restated due to discontinued operations.)

        <p>
   Schneider has been enhancing its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In mid-2015, the company announced it was combining its software operations with British engineering IT firm Aveva in a reverse takeover. The deal will see Aveva acquire Schneider's software division on a debt-free cash-free basis, and Schneider will then pay Aveva £550 million for new Aveva shares, which will result in it owning 54% of the enlarged company. Aveva provides design software for the industrial plant, power, and shipping industries.

        <p>
   Schneider Electric's predecessor was founded in 1782 to make industrial equipment. After the upheavals of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, the company came under the control of brothers Adolphe and Eugene Schneider in 1836. Within two years they had built the first French locomotive (the country's first rail line opened in 1832).
  </p>
        <p>
   Schneider became one of France's most important heavy industry companies, branching into a variety of machinery and steel operations. However, the country's industrial development continued to trail that of Britain and Germany due to recurrent political strife, including the revolution of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian War. France also possessed fewer coal and iron deposits.
  </p>
        <p>
   During WWI Schneider was a key part of France's war effort. It entered the electrical contracting business in 1929 and fought off nationalization attempts in the mid-1930s. The blitzkrieg of 1939 brought much of France under Nazi occupation, and the Schneider factories that were not destroyed were commandeered by the Germans.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company rebuilt after the war, aided by the French government. It was restructured as a holding company, and its operating units were split into three subsidiaries: civil and electrical engineering, industrial manufacturing, and construction. Charles Schneider, the last family member to lead the company, died in 1950.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1963 Schneider concluded an alliance with the Empain Group of Belgium, and by 1969, three years after Schneider went public, the two companies merged to become Empain-Schneider. It was a period when the company made numerous noncore acquisitions, entering such fields as ski equipment, fashion, publishing, and travel.
  </p>
        <p>
   Schneider began reorganizing in 1980. The effort entered its final phase in 1993 with a major recapitalization that saw the merger of its former parent company, Société Parisienne d'Entreprises et de Participations, with Schneider SA and the issue of new stock to existing stockholders.
