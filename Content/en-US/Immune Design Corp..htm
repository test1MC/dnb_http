   Immune Design wants to use nature's own design to build immunity. The development stage pharmaceutical company is creating products to boost the human immune system's ability to fight cancer using naturally produced cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Its combo approach includes a mechanism to induce the production of tumor-specific CTLs along with something to increase CTLs and activate other immunity functions. It has three lead candidates to address a variety of tumors. Immune Design also licenses its glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) to MedImmune for vaccine development, sells GLA formulations, and performs contract research for third parties. Immune Design was formed in 2008 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Immune Design raised $60 million in its public offering. It's using the proceeds to fund clinical development for its existing candidates as well as R&amp;D for future candidates.

  <p>
   The company's LV305 creates CTLs that target five different solid tumor types, G305 expands CTLs and other immune cells to attack the same tumors as LV305, CMB305 combines LV305 and G305 for those five tumors, and G100 is an antigen to fight Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare skin cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Immune Design uses third-party manufacturers for its product candidates and plans to continue that practice after

   approval.

  <p>
   The company reported about $1.6 million in revenue for 2013, down 46% from nearly $3 million due to lower GLA sales and licensing revenue. Immune Design's loss from operations rose by about 28%, from $10.9 million to $15 million, as costs continued to rise. The company has only brought in $9.4 million in revenue since its inception in 2008 and reported a total accumulated deficit of about $65 million as of March, 2014.

  <p>
   Of course, to be profitable Immune Design needs to complete the approvals process for its candidates. Its stated strategy includes developing products for a broad patient population, rapidly moving products through the clinical development process, monetize non-oncology products, and establish a strong infrastructure to support its commercialization efforts.
