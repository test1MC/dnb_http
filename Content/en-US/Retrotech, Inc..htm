  <p>
   More competition has appeared as European and Asian suppliers are joining the AS/RS scene. Retrotech considers it a competitive advantage that it is not a manufacturer, but a supplier of automated systems. Since customers are not bound to the company's proprietary machinery or software; rather, Retrotech can objectively recommend the appropriate equipment for the customer's needs. Additionally, the company does not have to worry about the high overhead of operating a manufacturing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Retrotech is focusing on expanding its footprint in automation products and services. In 2014 it broke ground on a $5.5 million construction of a large technical facility in Henrietta, New York. The larger location will allow the company to further expand its workforce and accommodate the increasing needs of its customers.
