  <p>
   Founded in 1980, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) was one of the first companies involved in Taiwan's high-tech renaissance. The company, which originally designed and produced its own integrated circuits (ICs), was a spinoff of Taiwan's government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Robert Tsao, a founder of the company, became its president in 1981; he served as chairman from 1991 to 2006.
