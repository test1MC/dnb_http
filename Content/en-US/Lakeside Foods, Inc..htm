   To make its products even more convenient for its customers, Lakeside has introduced a stand-up steamable pouch, which was featured in industry publication
   <em>
    Packing World
   </em>
   for its improved merchandizing capabilities for retailers over typical lay-down pillow-style bags.

  <p>
   Lakeside Foods, Wisconsin's first commercial canning company, traces its roots back to 1883, when founder Albert Landreth began canning peas in the kitchen of a small hotel overlooking Lake Michigan. Landreth built his first canning plant in 1887, directly off of the hotel.
