   'Bad' cholesterol is public enemy #1 at Esperion Therapeutics. A biopharmaceutical company, Esperion researches and develops therapies that reduce elevated LDL-C levels in patients' blood. Its primary candidate, ETC-1002, has been under development since 2008 and is in clinical stage development. If the candidate is approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   , the company plans to market its drug to patients who are unable to physically tolerate widely used cholesterol drugs like statins. Esperion Therapeutics was formed in 2008 after former parent
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   spun the company's predecessor off. Esperion went public in 2013.

        <p>
   The company successfully raised the $70 million that it sought in its 2013 initial public offering. It used a significant portion of the proceeds to fund the continued clinical development of its primary ETC-1002 candidate. The candidate has been under development since 2008 and serves as the most recent version of a line of similar candidates. The original therapy was discovered by Roger Newton, CEO and founder of the company's predecessor, also known as Esperion. The predecessor was acquired by Pfizer in 2004 but was subsequently sold to a group of private investors in 2008.

   ETC-1002 is a first-in-class orally delivered small molecule designed to lower LDL-cholesterol levels while avoiding the side effects associated with currently available therapies. It is being developed primarily for patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of statin intolerance. Esperion holds the exclusive worldwide rights to the drug.
  </p>
        <p>
   Another candidate, ESP41091, is being explored in pre-clinical studies for the treatment of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors including Type 2 diabetes and obesity.

   Like many biopharmaceutical companies focusing on drug research and development, Esperion Therapeutics operates at a loss and has yet to generate any revenue other than grant income. In 2014 its net loss rose 39% to $36 million due to higher R&amp;D expenses related to the development of ETC-1002 and higher general and administrative costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 77% to $32 million in 2014.

        <p>
   Esperion has used proceeds raised in its IPO to fund the continued clinical development of its primary drug candidate, ETC-1002. It intends to seek regulatory approval to market and sell its cholesterol drug in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015, the FDA removed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) clinical hold on ETC-1002, allowing Esperion to conduct clinical trials exceeding six months in length.
