   Prepositionally inclined About wants to be your online guru. The company's flagship About.com hosts a network of topic-specific websites grouped into content channels such as arts, hobbies, and sports on more than 78,000 topics. About.com features nearly 3 million articles created by some 900 human guides, or "topical advisors" -- which About describes as the "heart and soul" of its business. The free site generates revenue from advertisers trying to reach the 75 million monthly visitors. The firm also operates consumer product review site ConsumerSearch.com and diet site CalorieCount.com; along with About.com they make up the About Group.

  <p>
   Scott Kurnit, a former executive at MCI, News Corporation Internet Ventures, and online service provider Prodigy, founded General Internet Inc. in 1996 with William Day, also a former Prodigy executive. The two men wanted to develop a search engine that would rely on human editors rather than technology, and therefore appeal to users eager to tap into the Internet but frustrated by the technological shortcomings of Internet navigation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 1997 General Internet launched The Mining Co., which offered about 160 special-interest websites. The company had lined up more than a dozen advertisers, including AT&amp;T, Nabisco, IBM, and the US Army. Later that year the company sealed distribution deals with the Microsoft Network, BellSouth.net, and MindSpring, among others, to drive traffic to its sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Internet operated some 500 websites by early 1998. That year the company joined CBS SportsLine to create a co-branded area focusing on recreational sports. It also created a Marketplace section, which allowed marketing partners such as BMG Music Service and Internet auction giant eBay to sell products through its site. The move added e-commerce to the company's revenue mix. In addition, the company launched 100 topic-specific VideoStores, which offer featured video picks and reviews by its guides. Later that year General Internet changed its name to MiningCo.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 MiningCo.com claimed more than 650 GuideSites and nearly 6 million unique visitors, making it one of the top 25 most visited websites. MiningCo.com went public in 1999 and changed its name to About.com.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year magazine publisher
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   acquired About in a deal valued at about $700 million. PRIMEDIA made the purchase just as the Internet bubble was starting to unravel, hoping that About's guide sites would help drive audiences to its targeted magazine titles and associated websites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder and chairman Scott Kurnit resigned that year. Peter C. Horan was elected About's president and CEO in late 2003. The company implemented a site redesign in 2004 to allow advertisers to more effectively target About users.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, however, PRIMEDIA sold the company to
   <company id="12184">
    The New York Times Company
   </company>
   for $410 million. Horan left the company shortly afterwards and former
   <company id="99811">
    New York Times Digital
   </company>
   executive Scott Meyer took over as CEO of About.
  </p>
  <p>
   The New York Times acquired website CalorieCount.com in 2006 as part of an effort to expand About's content. Continuing this strategy, the following year it purchased ConsumerSearch.com, an online publisher of consumer product reviews, and UCompareHealthCare.com, a provider of Web-based interactive tools that enable users to measure the quality of certain healthcare services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meyer resigned as CEO early in 2008. Months later the company named Cella Irvine as his replacement. Also in 2008, as part of an effort to beef up content, the About Group launched its China site (abang.com) in order to tap a market that consists of hundreds of millions of Internet users.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company sold UCompareHealthCare.com. It also appointed New York Times Co. executive Martin Nisenholtz to replace Irvine as CEO. The following year IAC/InterActive acquired the business from The New York Times for $300 million.
