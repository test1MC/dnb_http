   Graham Corporation knows how to take the heat and not crack under pressure. The company, through its two subsidiaries, manufactures mainly heat-transfer equipment, including helical coil heat exchangers, plate and frame heat exchangers, and vacuums, such as pumps and compressors, and steam jet ejector vacuum systems. The lineup is used in myriad industrial and energy applications, from petroleum refining to chemical and petrochemical processing, power generation, propulsion systems for nuclear-powered defense vessels, and, even, food and soap making. The company sells its products directly and through independent sales representatives worldwide. More than 35% of Graham's sales are generated outside of the US.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 (March year end), the company's revenues increased by 32%, due to a 35% increase in US sales driven by new capacity investment by the chemical industry) offset by a 27% drop in sales outside of the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, Graham's net income increased by 45% due to higher revenues and interest income; offset by an increase in operating expenses (largely related to a restructuring charge tied to severance costs associated with a voluntary early retirement program, along with a rise in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, the company's operating cash flows decreased by 59%  due to a major cash outflow in customer deposits; offset by higher net income, along with increase in cash inflows of accounts payable, accrued compensation, and accrued expenses.

  <p>
   Graham continues to expand its global presence, particularly in developing regions in Asia where the surge in refining and chemical processing is appreciable. Its Chinese subsidiary, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology (Suzhou), supports regional sales, engineering services, and subcontracted fabrication in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also focused on organic growth opportunities and follow acquisitions which expand product lines, introduce new complementary product lines and to expand global sales presence and further broaden its reach into domestic and international nuclear industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In reaction to the slowdown in the energy markets, in 2015 the company implemented a cost reduction program that included a voluntary early retirement program as well as additional headcount reductions. The restructuring is aimed at reduced global headcount by 10%, which is expected to lower expenses by about $3 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016.

  <p>
   A rise in revenues in 2011 was tied to both the improving business climate and the acquisition of Energy Steel &amp; Supply Co. (Energy Steel). Graham's earnings, which had taken roughly a 60% nose dive in 2010, declined modestly, eroded, in part, by costs associated with its Energy Steel acquisition in late 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy Steel provides custom fabrication and specialty machining of products used in nuclear power plants, primarily in the US. The $18 million deal diversifies Graham's offerings to the energy industry, as well as reduces its dependence on the oil and petrochemical market. It also positions Graham to score a share of the

  </p>
  <p>
   Graham Corporation was founded in 1983 as the successor company to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc. The legacy business, incorporated in 1936, took its name from its founder, Harold Graham.
