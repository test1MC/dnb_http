   Carl Zeiss Meditec wants to clear things up in the eyes of its customers. The company manufactures ophthalmic diagnostic and therapeutic products, including examination and surgical microscopes, diagnostic systems, laser surgery equipment, and intraocular lenses. It sells directly to ophthalmology clinics and private practices and takes advantage of the worldwide distribution network of its controlling parent

  <p>
   Carl Zeiss Meditec operates through three strategic business units: Ophthalmic Systems (38% of sales in fiscal 2015), Surgical Ophthalmology (34% of sales), and Microsurgery (28% of sales). The Ophthalmic Systems unit specializes in equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases including glaucoma, refraction, and retinal diseases. Surgical Ophthalmology focuses on cataract and retinal surgery walkthroughs to diagnose and treat diseases. Microsurgery provides tools for minimally invasive treatments in surgery and oncology.

  <p>
   Revenue, which has been on the rise for the past five years, increased 14% to €1 billion in fiscal 2015 (ended September). While all three segments saw growth, a strong performance in the Surgical Ophthalmology unit primarily drove the higher sales. That unit is benefiting from growing demand for intraocular lenses and multi-focal and toric premium lenses for cataract surgery, as well as surgical microscopes.
  </p>
  <p>
   After a period of increasing profits, net income has slipped for the past two years. It fell 17% to €62.2 million in fiscal 2015 on higher cost of sales and general administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations declined 10% to €56.7 million due to changes in receivables and liabilities.

  <p>
   Carl Zeiss Meditec's driving force for growth hinges on innovation -- it has research facilities in India and China -- and creating cutting-edge technologies for customers. in addition to seeking new products and systems, it also seeks to improve its existing offerings. For example, in mid-2015 the company added the capability to visualize retinal blood vessels in 3-D to its Optical Coherence Tomography system.
