   Yildiz Holding of Turkey shelled out $850 million for the high-end chocolate maker. Godiva became part of Yildiz-owned
   <company id="150042">
    Ülker
   </company>
   , the largest food company in Turkey, with foodstuffs that include cookies, dairy products, and chocolate and other confectionery. Ülker, which ranks 31st on Istanbul's main ISE National 100 share index, asserts it controls about 50% of Turkey's confectionery market. While well-known in the Middle East, Ülker has ascended to the world stage as a player alongside the likes of

   <company id="40297">

   As part of a new organization but staying true to its roots, Godiva is looking to China's growing taste for luxury and labels as a lucrative market for its chocolate shops. It's achieving this by expanding beyond its presence in Shanghai to Beijing and Guangzhou. It's also expanding in the Middle East, Russia, and Turkey by opening some 50 new stores each year to reach sales of $1 billion by the end 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to tapping new markets, the company is transitioning its business from being focused on formal gifting to moving toward having more accessible products for self-consumption. Its vision statement is "To own the ultimate chocolate experience that inspires passion for our brand around the world."
  </p>
  <p>
   Godiva continues to roll out new products and is concentrating on expanding its line of truffles. The chocolatier now makes individual chocolate bars, chocolate-covered fruits and nuts, and packaged chocolate biscuits. It also extended the reach of its liqueur line, made in conjunction with
   <company id="55181">
    Diageo
   </company>
   , by adding a caramel and milk chocolate product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specifically for the grocery market, Godiva sells a namesake coffee that comes in several varieties. They're sold through national retail food chains, including

    Giant
   </company>
   . Available only through the Bakery Shop section on Godiva's website, the company sells chocolate brownies, cupcakes, and layered cakes. In 2014 it began to supplement its grocery store strategy by opening up chocolate shops inside
