   Home Products International (HPI) helps folks get organized. The company makes an array of plastic storage containers, including carts, crates, bins, totes, and tubs (some with more than 60 gallons of stowing space). It also produces and markets closet organizers, clothing hampers, ironing boards, shower caddies, hangers, and hooks. HPI markets its products under the HOMZ brand and sells them in North and South America through retailers, such as

   Focusing on revenue growth, HPI offers a wide range of simply-designed and easy-to-use storage containers and home organization products. By peddling its goods through major chain stores and online retailers, HPI is able to reach a sizable portion of consumers in the US, Canada, Mexico, and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep its cost structure under control, HPI outsources some of its manufacturing, such as plastics molding. The company had long maintained its production base in the US, but reorganized its operations after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2007; it was during this time that Third Avenue Management became HPI's majority shareholder.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, HPI has invested some $10 million to expand and modernize its Chicago and El Paso, Texas, plastics manufacturing facilities. Both are responsible for producing storage and organizational containers and carts, as well as plastic hangers.
