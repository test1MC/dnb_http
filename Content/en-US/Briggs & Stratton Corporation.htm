  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton designs, manufactures, markets, and services its products in more than 100 countries on six continents. The US accounts for 69% of its total sales.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company conducts its operations in two segments: engines and power products. Its engines are primarily used by the lawn and garden equipment industry, which accounted for 61% of the segment's fiscal 2015 (June year end) engine sales. The remaining engine sales were from products with industrial, construction, agricultural, or other consumer applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   More than a quarter of its engine sales were derived from international markets, primarily customers in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The principal product lines in its power products segment (39% of sales) includes portable and standby generators, pressure washers, snow throwers, and other lawn and garden powered equipment.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company sells its products through multiple channels of retail distribution: consumer home centers, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, and independent dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton's engines are sold by its global sales force through direct calls to customers. The company's marketing staff and engineers in the US provide support and technical assistance to its sales force. Briggs &amp; Stratton owns its main international distributors, while its US distributors are independently owned and operated.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 Briggs &amp; Stratton's net revenues increased by 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products segment net sales rose due to the results of the Allmand and Billy Goat acquisitions, higher commercial lawn and garden equipment sales, increased sales in Australia on an improved lawn and garden season and higher pressure washer sales. Partially offsetting the increase was the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, reduced sales of generators due to fewer major power outages, and the company's decision to narrow the assortment of lower-priced Snapper consumer lawn and garden equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engines segment net sales decreased due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and an unfavorable mix of engines sold, partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of global engines. Sales skewed towards small engines due to elevated levels of large engines in the channel entering this lawn and garden season.
  </p>
  <p>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton's net income increased by 61% in fiscal 2015 due to higher net sales; the absence of goodwill impairment and trade name impairment;  and decrease in engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses as the result of retirement plan changes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, cash from operating activities increased by 17%.

   The company is to seeking to grow the profitability of its engine business; Invest and grow in higher margin and margin expanding areas; and expand geographically.
  </p>
  <p>
   It plans to continue to pursue acquisitions and seek opportunities to grow its commercial engines and related products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton is also working to reduce its underperforming assets. In 2014 it announced it will no longer sell lawn and garden equipment products at national mass retailers in the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Briggs &amp; Stratton acquired US-based Billy Goat Industries, (aerators, sod cutters, overseeders, power rakes, brush cutters, walk behind blowers, lawn vacuums, and debris loaders) for $26 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company bought US-based Allmand Bros (a leading designer and manufacturer of high quality towable light towers, industrial heaters, and solar LED arrowboards) for $62 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   These acquisitions help Briggs &amp; Stratton to further the strategic initiative of focusing on attractive higher margin, commercial products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1909 inventor Stephen Foster Briggs and grain merchant Harold Stratton gathered $25,000 and founded Briggs &amp; Stratton to produce a six-cylinder, two-cycle engine that Briggs had developed while in college. However, the engine proved too expensive for mass production. A brief foray into the auto assembly business also failed as the company skirted bankruptcy. But in 1910 Briggs received a patent for a single-spark gas engine igniter. It wasn't a runaway success, but the company had found its niche making automotive electrical components. By 1920 Briggs &amp; Stratton was the largest US producer of specialty lights, ignitions, regulators, and starting switches. These specialties accounted for two-thirds of the firm's total business through the mid-1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired the A. O. Smith Motor Wheel (a gasoline-driven wheel designed to be attached to bicycles) and the Flyer (a two-passenger vehicle similar to a buckboard) in 1919. Neither product was successful and both were soon sold, but the company gained crucial knowledge and experience. In 1923 Briggs &amp; Stratton introduced a stationary version of the Motor Wheel designed to power washing machines, garden tractors, and lawn mowers. The company continued to diversify, moving into the auto lock business in 1924. Its die-cast cylinder lock outsold competitors' brass models, and by the end of the decade, Briggs &amp; Stratton had the lion's share of the market. The company formed BASCO to make auto body hardware. Briggs &amp; Stratton bought Evinrude Outboard Motor Company in 1928, but sold the business within a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   As with many other industrial manufacturers, Briggs &amp; Stratton benefited from the onset of WWII: The war triggered an insatiable need for the company's products. Its wartime contributions included airplane ignition switches, artillery ammunition, and engines for generators, pumps, compressors, fans, repair shops, emergency hospitals, and mobile kitchens.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war Briggs &amp; Stratton focused on small engines for lawn and garden equipment, and soon it dominated the market. In 1953 the company introduced an aluminum die-cast engine that was lighter than competing models and could withstand greater operating temperatures and pressures. Baby boomers' parents fueled sales, and the small market attracted little competition; Briggs &amp; Stratton thrived making air-cooled engines and automobile components, such as locks and switches.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of the 1970s, sales had risen to about $590 million and, as the low-cost producer in the industry, the company was without a rival. During the early 1980s, however, Japanese companies (including
   <company id="41867">
    Honda
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="52359">
    Kawasaki
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41859">
    Suzuki
   </company>
   ) entered the market after motorcycle sales crested. As a result of the strong dollar, these competitors were able to provide engines to equipment makers at less expense than could Briggs &amp; Stratton; the company suffered a decline in the late 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company experienced a resurgence during the early 1990s. Frederick Stratton Jr., grandson of the co-founder, took over as president in 1992, and Briggs &amp; Stratton benefited from a dollar that was weak relative to the yen. It spun off its car-and-truck lock business as
   <company id="52939">
    STRATTEC
   </company>
   in 1995. Over the next few years the company began selling its noncore operations, including foundry businesses in 1997 and 1998 and its long-life engine (for residential heat pumps) and computer software operations, also in 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Briggs &amp; Stratton and
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton
   </company>
   began to jointly develop and market power-generator devices. In 2001 Stratton Jr. stepped down as president (he remained chairman until 2003) and COO John Shiely became president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Briggs &amp; Stratton acquired rival generator maker Generac Portable Products in a deal worth about $270 million. Generac changed its name to Briggs &amp; Stratton Power Products Group in 2002, and the subsidiary continued to sell pressure washers, portable generators, switches, and other products under the Generac Portable Products brand name. Shiely succeeded Stratton as chairman in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Briggs &amp; Stratton acquired outdoor power equipment manufacturer
   <company id="126764">
    Simplicity Manufacturing
   </company>
   for about $227 million in 2004. Briggs &amp; Stratton acquired the assets of Murray Inc. in 2005. Murray was once one of Briggs &amp; Stratton's biggest customers; however, in 2004 the OEM filed for bankruptcy. Murray operations ceased that year, but Briggs &amp; Stratton continued to make Murray-branded products. The Simplicity and Murray deals significantly boosted the company's top line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold the assets of Briggs &amp; Stratton Canada in 2004 to Power Source Canada Ltd. (PSC), a company set up for the transaction. PSC took over distribution of Briggs &amp; Stratton products in the Great White North.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company kicked off a new advertising and marketing program with the theme of "The Power Within." TV commercials shown during the
   <company id="106802">
    NCAA
   </company>
   basketball championships in March and on cable channels during the rest of the year featured Briggs &amp; Stratton engines in a variety of settings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Briggs &amp; Stratton decided to close its engine manufacturing plant in Rolla, Missouri, and to transfer production to facilities in China and elsewhere in the US. Later that year the company elected to shutter its factory in Port Washington, Wisconsin, a facility that was picked up in the 2004 acquisition of Simplicity Manufacturing. Production at Port Washington, where outdoor power equipment was made, was transferred to other facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it acquired Australia's Victa Lawncare, a manufacturer of lawn and garden power equipment. Victa operates as a subsidiary of Briggs &amp; Stratton Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Briggs &amp; Stratton sold its dormant manufacturing facility in Jefferson, Wisconsin, and a land parcel adjacent to its Ostrava, Czech Republic plant. In the fourth quarter of 2013, it completed the sale of the Ostrava, Czech Republic facility altogether. In addition to these moves, Briggs &amp; Stratton announced it will no longer sell lawn and garden equipment products at national mass retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand in a key international market, in 2012 the company purchased Companhia Caetano Branco, of Brazil for approximately $60 million. Branco is a leading brand in the Brazilian light power equipment market with a broad range of outdoor power equipment.
