   Akebia Therapeuitics is fighting anemia through the use of HIF biology. The company uses hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) biology, a chief regulator of the production of red blood cells in the body, to treat anemia. It is working to develop and commercialize these small molecules that treat anemia, and its lead product candidate, AKB-6548, is being developed as a once-daily oral therapy currently in Phase 2 testing. Akebia Therapeuitics expects to begin Phase 3 trials in 2015 and plans on submitting an application to move its drug onto the market by 2018.

   Akebia Therapeuitics filed to go public in early 2014 and raised around $100 million (it expected to raise around $68 million to $78 million). It is using about $50 million of the proceeds to continue clinical development of AKB-6548 in patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including the preparation for and initiation of the Phase 3 trials. Around $10 million will be used to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of AKB-6548 in idiopathic anemia of aging, while $5 million will go towards the advancing of the company's preclinical candidate, AKB-6899, through Phase 1 development in oncology.
