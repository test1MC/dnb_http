   The sound of breaking glass is music to Libbey's ears. It signals potential sales for the company, which is a leading maker and seller of glassware, tableware, and flatware to the foodservice industry and to retailers (

   ) in the US and Canada. Libbey's products are made in five countries, including the US, Mexico, and China, and are sold in more than 100 others. Its brands include Libbey, Crisa, and Royal Leerdam, among others. Subsidiary World Tableware imports metal flatware, serveware, and ceramic dinnerware for resale. Libbey owns Crisa, the largest Mexican glass tableware maker. Libbey's roots reach back to 1888, when The W.L. Libbey &amp; Son Company was founded.

  <p>
   North America (including Mexico) accounts for about three-quarters of Libbey's sales. Foreign markets include Europe and a growing presence in Asia. Libbey owns and operates three glass tableware manufacturing plants in North America (Toledo, Ohio; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Monterrey, Mexico), a pair in Europe (the Netherlands and Portugal), and a glass tableware production facility in Langfang, China. Warehouse/distribution-only locations include Laredo, Texas, and West Chicago, Illinois.

   Libbey is a multichannel marketer, selling to the foodservice, retail, and business-to-business channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a professional sales staff that calls on customers and distributors and also retains services of manufacturing representative organizations to assist in selling its products in select countries. The company has marketing staff at its headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, as well as in Mexico, Portugal, the Netherlands, and China. Libbey's marketing group is focused on product development, pricing, distribution, advertising, merchandising, and sales promotion in their regions.

  <p>
   In 2011 Libbey reorganized to take a more global view of its business. As a result, it consolidated its geographic regions and moved to two operating segments: Glass Operations (about 90% of sales), and Other Operations. Glass Operations include Libbey's worldwide sales of manufactured and sourced glass tableware and other glass products from both its domestic and international subsidiaries. Other Operations includes global sales of sourced ceramic dinnerware, metal tableware, and hollowware and serveware. In 2011 the firm sold its Traex plastic production line to the Vollrath Co.

  <p>
   Libbey logged a net sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 mainly due to a sales boost in China after changing its go-to-market strategy in the domestic Chinese market. Additionally, net sales in the Glass Operations segment increased 1% primarily due to increases in net sales within the China, US, and Canadian sales regions partially offset by sales declines in the European, Mexico, and the International sales regions. Net sales to both the US and Canadian retail customers rose, thanks to a more favorable product mix. Libbey's European sales region was hurt by decreased shipments attributable to the uncertain European economic conditions. In the Other operations segment, net sales to World Tableware customers and Syracuse China customers increased due to increased shipments.

   During the same reporting period, net income dropped 71%. Libbey attributes the noteworthy dip to the increase in loss on redemption of debt in 2012 compared with the prior year.

  <p>
   Libbey is a top provider of tableware in North America and has been zeroing in on international markets for continued expansion. While focused on organic growth, the company's business strategy also emphasizes strategic partnerships and acquisitions that complement its existing product lines. In recent years it has put acquisitions on hold and focused on reducing its cost structure and debt load, right-sizing its operational capacity, and generating cash in order to endure tough economic conditions worldwide.

  <p>
   The company shuttered its Syracuse China ceramic dinnerware factory in Syracuse, New York, in 2009 to cut costs as it struggled to adjust to the dramatic slowdown in the US in the food service and retail channels. The closure put about 275 employees out of work and ended 138 years of manufacturing at the plant. Libbey continues to sell dinnerware bearing the Syracuse China brand name, but the products are imported from factories in other countries.
