   Innoviva (formerly Theravance) figures there's no sense in re-inventing the wheel. The biotech takes aim at already proven biological targets, taking advantage of existing research to create next-generation treatments. The firm is focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule medicines across a number of therapeutic areas including respiratory disease, bacterial infections, and central nervous system pain. Its VIBATIV product (an injectable antibiotic approved to treat skin infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia) was successfully developed and commercialized with partner
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas
   </company>
   . It also develops chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) products with
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   (GSK).
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   VIBATIV is approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of certain difficult-to-treat infections. Other products include TD-4208, which is being investigated for the treatment of COPD; and Axelopran (TD-1211), a potential treatment for opioid-induced constipation. Earlier-stage assets are being tested for the treatment of diseases of the lung and gastrointestinal tract and infectious diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Collaboration partner GSK has launched RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA in a number of markets including the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, and Germany. GSK is also responsible for the commercialization of ANORO ELLIPTA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Theravance Biopharma, a subsidiary established in 2014, handles the company's R&amp;D development operations. The unit was created when then-named Theravance split its R&amp;D operations from its late-stage partnered respiratory assets.

  <p>
   The company's revenues grew by a whopping 454% to $135.8 million in 2012 thanks to the recognition of deferred income from its collaboration with Astellas for VIBATIV, which achieved commercialization in early 2012 (the agreement has since been dissolved). Revenues dropped back down in 2013 but rose 86% to $8.4 million in 2014 on royalties from the sale of RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA and ANORO ELLIPTA (launched that year).
  </p>
  <p>
   Innoviva has reported net losses every year since its inception. In 2014 its net loss decreased 1% to $168 million due to a decline in losses from discontinued operations. At the end of 2015, its accumulated deficit totaled approximately $1.7 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 1% to $130 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Innoviva actively seeks partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies to allow for faster development and marketing of its pipeline candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through an exclusive alliance with minority shareholder GSK, Innoviva is developing a next-generation version of GSK's asthma medication Advair, and other products. The company's collaboration with GSK is focused on its Advair-replacement candidate, RELVAR/BREO ELLIPTA, to treat asthma and COPD, that was launched in the US, Japan, and Europe. The companies have additional collaborative respiratory treatments (MABA and LAMA) under development. GSK also has the option to exclusively license other Innoviva pipeline products in areas including gastrointestinal ailments and pain. In mid-2014, the partners submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for an asthma treatment in patients aged 12 years and older.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other projects in the pipeline include treatments for gastrointestinal motility disorders such as chronic constipation. It also has candidates in the works to treat infection, chronic pain, and Alzheimer's disease. The company plans to continue to add new therapeutic candidates and enhance its R&amp;D capabilities. It also hopes to find development partners for all of its programs, especially as they get closer to commercialization stages, where teaming up with a larger company with an established sales and marketing organization would be beneficial.
