   When it comes to making lasers, Applied Optoelectronics stays on the beam. The company designs and makes fiber-optic networking components that go into communications equipment used by cable-TV providers, broadband network providers, and Internet data centers to allow for faster network connections. Applied Optoelectronics makes laser chips, components, subassemblies, and modules using its proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) fabrication process. Customers include

   Applied Optoelectronics serves three end-markets: data center, cable television, or CATV, and fiber-to-the-home, or FTTH.
  </p>
  <p>
   Data centers are the company biggest, 49% of sales, and fastest growing, a 232% increase in 2014, market. CATV is the company's most established market and accounts for 36% of revenue in 2014. Another big increase came in the market for FTTH products. It grew 211% in 2014 to account for 11% of the company's sales.

  <p>
   The company uses its vertically integrated manufacturing process at its three manufacturing plants in China, Taiwan, and the US. Its Texas plant handles research and development and manufactures laser chips, sub-assemblies, and components. In Taiwan it makes transceivers and optical components, such as butterfly lasers, which incorporate the US-made laser chips, sub-assemblies, and components. In China, the company takes advantage of lower labor costs and makes the more labor-intensive components and optical equipment systems, such as cable-TV transmitters and cable-TV outdoor equipment.

  <p>
   Applied Optoelectronics sells its products to cable-television OEMs; Cisco is its largest customer, accounting for a third of sales. Data center operators snapped up the company's 10 gigabits-per-second and 40 gigabits-per-second transceivers to keep connections humming. While it primarily uses a direct sales force, the company also uses third-party sales representatives and distributors such as Biogenomics Corp. About 80% of sales come from customers located outside the US.

  <p>
   The need to speed in data centers drove revenue 66% for Applied Optoelectronics in 2014 to reach $130.5 million from $78.2 million in 2013. The FTTH revenue increase was driven by demand for the company's wavelength multiplexing devices-passive optical network devices (which split one incoming signal into multiple signals).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company generated so much revenue than some of it spilled to the bottom line, despite increased spending on research and development and sales and marketing, to create a profit. Applied Optoelectronics posted net income of $4.28 million in 2014 compared to a net loss of $1.4 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also increased in 2014 to $7.24 million in 2014 from negative cash flow of $65. million in 2013.

  <p>
   Applied Optoelectronics finds itself in a good place, selling critical components to a fast-growing industry that demands more speed and capabilities for data center, cable, and fiber-to-the-home applications. The company doubled its research and development spending to about $16 million in 2014 from 2013. The get its technology from research to customers, Applied Electronics has increased capacity and performance at its factories in Sugar Land, Texas and Taiwan. The new Taiwan facility more than doubles the size of its previous plant.
