   You might say this company prizes the independence of the press. Independent News &amp; Media (INM) is one of Ireland's leading media companies and publisher of that country's top newspaper, the
   <em>
    Irish Independent
   </em>
   . The daily national paper boasts a readership of more than 550,000, while the weekend edition
   <em>
    Sunday Independent
   </em>
   claims a circulation of more than 280,000. Outside Ireland, the company has more than 200 papers in the UK and India. It also owns about 40% of
   <company id="119284">
    APN News &amp; Media
   </company>
   , a leading newspaper company serving Australia and New Zealand and publisher of
   <em>
    The New Zealand Herald
   </em>
   . INM sold its flagship UK titles,
   <em>
    The Independent
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Independent on Sunday
   </em>
   , to Alexander Lebedev.

   As a boy, Irish rail magnate William Martin Murphy had spent his spare time in the offices of a Dublin newspaper, so when he became interested in politics it seemed only natural that he should invest in newspapers of his own. Spending some of the fortune he had earned by building a modern tram system in Dublin, he bought into several newspapers between 1891 and 1900 -- none of which turned a profit. Tired of losing money, Murphy then revamped his
   <i>
    Daily Independent and Nation
   </i>
   along the lines of the successful
   <i>
    Daily Mail
   </i>
   in England, selling it as a half-penny morning paper. The new
   <i>
    Irish Independent,
   </i>
   launched in 1904, gained an audience quickly and became profitable within four years. By 1911 its circulation had grown so large that it required the deployment of a previously unheard-of three Ford vans for its distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   A staunch nationalist, Murphy didn't shrink from using the newspaper as a platform from which to promote his views. Although known as a relatively benevolent employer himself, striking tram workers in Dublin aroused his ire in 1913. Murphy locked them out, wielding the influence of the newspaper to put pressure on them to return to work. They finally did, after 22 weeks. By 1917 he had begun to write editorials in favor of Irish home rule, eventually becoming such an influential voice that he was invited to meet with British officials deliberating on the future of Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murphy died in 1919. Remaining under the control of the Murphy family, the newspaper business continued to grow slowly through WWII and beyond, later adding evening and Sunday papers to its stable of titles. In the 1960s it began expanding into regional papers in Ireland. In 1973 H.J. Heinz president Anthony O'Reilly bought part of the Murphy family's holdings and became the largest shareholder in what was by then called Independent Newspapers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company did not begin growing in earnest, however, until 1988, when it took advantage of O'Reilly's son Cameron's Australian citizenship to buy into APN News &amp; Media, thus circumventing rules on foreign ownership of media outlets. A relatively small regional newspaper publisher, APN quickly diversified under the O'Reillys' leadership, branching out into radio and outdoor advertising. The next year Independent News moved into television, winning signal licenses for its subsidiary Princes Holdings. In 1992 it sold 50% of Princes Holdings to TCI (now
   <company id="51395">
    Liberty Media
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Independent News acquired South Africa's Argus Newspaper Group (now Independent Newspapers Holdings) and a 12% stake in Portugal's Jornalgeste (now Lusomundo Media). In 1995 it took a 28% stake in Wilson &amp; Horton, New Zealand's largest newspaper publisher. Independent News scored a major acquisition in 1998 when the company bought London's
   <i>
    The Independent.
   </i>
   The next year the company took a stake in mobile phone information portal iTouch and later changed its name to Independent News &amp; Media (INM) to reflect its broader focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   O'Reilly became executive chairman of INM in 2000 and left his position at Heinz; he was knighted late that year. The next year the company agreed to sell its Wilson &amp; Horton for $410 million to Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), gaining a 40% in the combined operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2004 sold its UK regional newspapers to
   <company id="134654">
    Archant
   </company>
   and its stake in struggling Irish cable TV unit Princes Holdings to what is now
   <company id="44026">
    Liberty Media International
   </company>
   . The following year INM sold its 37% stake in wireless Web portal
   <company id="101356">
    iTouch
   </company>
   to Japan's For-side. In 2009 O'Reilly retired from the company and handed the reigns to his son, Gavin.
