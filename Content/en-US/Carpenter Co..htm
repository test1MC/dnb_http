   It's a cushy job for Carpenter Company, making polyurethane foam and chemicals and polyester fiber used as cushioning by the automotive, bedding, floor covering, packaging, and furniture industries. The company started out making foam rubber; it now also manufactures air filter media, expanded polystyrene building materials, accoustical non-wovens, and a tire fill product that can be used as a replacement for air in off-road construction vehicles. Carpenter also sells consumer products -- which include craft fiber products, furniture cushioning foam, mattress pads, and pillows -- through retailers.
