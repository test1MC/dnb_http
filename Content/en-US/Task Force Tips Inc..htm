   Task Force Tips was founded by Clyde McMillan as Fire Task Force Innovations in the basement of the McMillan family's home in Hobart, Indiana, in 1971. McMillan sketched his design for the first automatic nozzle on the back of a napkin in 1968; that napkin is now framed and on exhibit at the firehouse museum.
