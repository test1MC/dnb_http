   SurModics doesn't want to scratch the surface of the medical device market -- it just wants to coat it with its own special agent. The company's medical device unit makes special coatings that make the devices easier to use, less traumatic to the body, and even useful in delivering drugs to patients. For example, it is developing drug-coated balloons designed to treat peripheral artery disease, which causes narrowing of the arteries. SurModics' in vitro diagnostics (IVD) unit handles diagnostic test and research kits and products. Three scientists formed the company in 1979.

  <p>
   SurModics makes about half of its money from licensing and royalty deals, under which medical device makers and drug companies use its technologies in their products. Within licensing and royalties, the company divides its business between medical devices and IVD, with medical devices taking the lion's share -- about three-fourths of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product sales accounts for about 40% of the company's revenue, while R&amp;D and other activities bring in the rest.

   SurModics has operations in Minnesota (2) and in Ireland.

   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for some 80% of total revenue.

  <p>
   Revenue for SurModics has been rising for the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended September), revenue rose 15% to $71.4 million, largely on higher product sales. Royalties, license fees, and R&amp;D revenue also rose that year. Both the medical device and IVD segments saw double-digit growth, due to increasing demand for the company's products and services, as well as limited product price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been more volatile, peaking at $15.2 million in fiscal 2013 but dropping 16% to $10 million in fiscal 2016. That decline was due to higher operating costs, including product costs, R&amp;D expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

  <p>
   SurModics looks to grow by enlisting more licensing customers (it makes about half of its revenue from royalties and fees) and by expanding its product line. It is also working to move beyond being a provider of coating technologies to offering whole-product systems to its medical device customers, particularly in the vascular market. During fiscal 2016 (ended September), the company began a first in-human early study of its SurVeil drug-coated balloon. Early the following fiscal year, SurModics completed the expansion of an R&amp;D and manufacturing facility to further support its growth.

  <p>
   In 2015, SurModics acquired Irish firm Creagh Medical, which makes balloon catheters for angioplasties, for $32 million. That purchase fit in with its focus on expanding beyond its traditional medical device coating technologies. The following year, SurModics bought development firm Normedix, which focuses on minimally invasive catheter technologies, for $14 million.
