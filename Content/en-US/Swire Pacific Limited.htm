   John Swire began a Liverpool trading company in 1816. By the time he died in 1847,
   <company id="103814">
    John Swire &amp; Sons
   </company>
   derived much of its revenues from the US cotton trade. One of Swire's sons, John Samuel Swire, refocused the company on Chinese tea and textiles during the US Civil War. Unhappy with his representatives in Asia, Swire went to Shanghai and in 1866 partnered with customer Richard Butterfield. Butterfield &amp; Swire (B&amp;S) took
   <i>
    Taikoo
   </i>
   ("great and ancient") as a Chinese name. Butterfield soon left, but his name lived on with the company until 1974.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1868 B&amp;S had offices in New York and Yokohama, Japan; it added a Hong Kong office two years later. The firm created China Navigation Company in 1872 to transport goods on the Yangtze River; the shipping line served all the major Pacific Rim ports by the late 1880s. Hong Kong-based Taikoo Sugar Refinery began operations in 1884.
  </p>
  <p>
   The third John Swire took over B&amp;S in 1898 and built the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong. The company's Chinese operations were eventually devastated by the Japanese attack on China in 1937, WWII, and the Communist takeover in 1949. However, the company rebuilt in Hong Kong, and in 1948 it bought control of Cathay Pacific, a Hong Kong airline with six DC-3s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, the Swire family expanded the airline and established airport and aircraft service companies. Swire Pacific, the holding company for most of the family's Hong Kong interests, went public in 1959. It won the Coca-Cola bottling franchise for Hong Kong in 1965. The fifth generation of Swires, John and Adrian, took command of parent company John Swire &amp; Sons in 1968 (Adrian became chairman in 1987). The Taikoo Dockyard merged its business with Hongkong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard in 1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1984 agreement to return Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997 plunged the colony into uncertainty. Capital flight and free-falling real estate values gave Swire an opportunity to pick up properties at bargain prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific had become a major Pacific carrier. In 1987 Swire sold about 12% of the airline to
   <company id="57084">
    CITIC
   </company>
   , China's state-owned overseas investment company. (CITIC later increased its share.) Three years later Swire bought 35% of Hong Kong's
   <company id="130806">
    Dragonair
   </company>
   , also partly owned by CITIC, and gave it Cathay Pacific's Shanghai and Beijing routes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1990s Swire's financial results and property values fluctuated along with confidence about the consequences of China's takeover. In 1997 Swire expanded its Chinese operations, acquiring the rights to distribute
   <company id="137886">
    Volvo
   </company>
   cars in China and Hong Kong. As Asian financial markets collapsed, Swire sold its insurance-underwriting businesses to focus on core operations. Adrian Swire stepped down that year, relinquishing the John Swire &amp; Sons chairmanship to a nonfamily member, Edward Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its dwindling undeveloped property base a Swire-led consortium bought a reclaimed waterfront site on Hong Kong Island in 1998. Reflecting a rebounding economy, in 1999 the company sold more than 274,000 sq. ft. of Hong Kong office space to
   <company id="11482">
    Time Warner
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42386">
    Cable &amp; Wireless HKT
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Swire sold health care and medical products trading unit Swire Loxley to CITIC Pacific, and in 2001 sold its 49% stake in
   <company id="40715">
    Carlsberg Brewery
   </company>
   Hong Kong Ltd., in order to focus on its growing regional soft drinks operations. The company sold its 49% stake in Schneider Swire Ltd. to joint venture partner
   <company id="42920">
    Schneider Electric Industries
   </company>
   in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swire sold Chinese carrier Dragonair in 2006 to Cathay Pacific, still retaining an interest in the airline through its stake in Cathay Pacific. Two years later, it spun off its stake in SITA's waste management business to
   <company id="136050">
    SUEZ Environment
   </company>
   for $243 million and Shekou Container Terminals for $129 million.
