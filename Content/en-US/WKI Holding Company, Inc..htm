   WKI is a multichannel marketer, selling its cookware and tableware through mass merchants, department stores, specialty retailers, and retail food stores, as well as through the World Kitchen websites. It maintains a brick-and-mortar presence by marketing its wares through its own factory stores, which operate in outlet centers under the banners CorningWare, Corelle, and Revere. These factory stores operate throughout North America and overseas.

   WKI has seen growing demand for its cooking products in recent years. As a side effect of the economic downturn worldwide, consumers have been opting to prepare more of their meals at home. World Kitchen's cutlery products (including graters, peelers, and zesters) have been in especially high demand, and there is growing interest in its kitchenware made from sustainably sourced woods and other renewable materials. Encouraged by the eat-at-home trend, World Kitchen has been expanding its storage product portfolio.

  <p>
   In 2014 WKI entered a strategic partnership to aid in new product development. It formed an alliance with former owner and specialty glass and ceramics company
   <company id="10409">
    Corning
   </company>
   to develop glass and ceramic products that offer versatility, durability, and functionality. The agreement involves exploring new technology options for housewares.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired Snapware, a California-based maker of kitchenware and home storage products under the Snapware, Snap 'N Stack, Smart Store, and GlassLock brands. Its products are sold by mass merchandisers and in supermarkets. Snapware had been logging double-digit sales and profit growth, and it boasts expertise in plastic molding and a short product development cycle. (Snapware is the first of World Kitchen's subsidiaries to make primarily plastic products.)
