  <p>
   EchoStar's revenue dropped 9% to $3.14 billion in 2015, compared to $3.4 billion in 2014. Much of the blame was cast on the EchoStar Technologies segment. Its revenue fell 21% because of a decrease in equipment revenue from DISH Network and in in service revenue.

  <p>
   Net income was flat from 2014 to 2015 at about $153.3 million

  <p>

   EchoStar sees the still-growing demand for broadband services as a rich source of growth opportunities. Besides looking for additional customers for its STBs, the company's strategy includes capitalizing on the proliferation of advanced technologies in its boxes that could spark replacement cycles. EchoStar also has dormant satellite and fiber capacity that it hopes will tempt more customers, such as vendors of pay-TV, satellite-based broadband service, corporate communications, and government services. Bundling services and reaching new markets are high on its list of priorities. Customers outside the US are also particularly attractive. EchoStar considers the more modest cable and telecom infrastructures in many global markets to be particularly suited for satellite-delivered services that could be deployed more quickly.

   The company has reached agreements to extend its technologies into new uses and geographies. It provide services to telecommunications companies in Brazil and Ireland. In the Middle East, Hughes Networks Systems' technology will monitor conditions at oil wellheads across hundreds of miles in the desert in a pact with a large petroleum company.

  <p>
   In 2015 EchoStar reached satellite services agreements with Telesat to provide fixed broadband service into South America using the Ka-band capacity on a satellite. They expect the satellite to be launched in 2018 to deliver consumer satellite broadband services into South America as well as create a platform to potentially allow for further development of our business in South America.

  <p>
   EchoStar was acquisition free in 2014 and 2015. In late 2013 it acquired Solaris Mobile, a company based in Ireland and licensed by the European Union, to provide mobile satellite services and complementary ground component services covering the entire European Union. The deal allowed EchoStar to commercialize the license through its satellite and terrestrial technology capabilities and fortified its reach in Europe.
