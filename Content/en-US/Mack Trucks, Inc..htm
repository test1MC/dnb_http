   As the auto market recovers, Mack and sister truckmaker

   are trying to capitalize on their more extensively-tested, highly fuel-efficient,

   -certified products that comply with new emissions standards introduced in North America in 2010. Throughout 2013 the company launched two new models powered by natural gas: Mack Pinnacle and Mack Granite.

   Mack has also introduced the mDRIVE automated manual transmission, which was developed to work with Mack's MP engine to deliver better fuel economy, drivability, and safety. In fact, Mack has experienced rapid growth with its mDRIVE transmission, which in 2014 represented nearly 50% of highway vehicle sales of its parent company -- only four years after its introduction.
