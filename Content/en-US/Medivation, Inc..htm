   Medivation motivates medicine makers. The company acquires, develops, and sells (or partners with companies working on) biopharmaceuticals. Medivation initiates drug development programs, seeking out candidates that address unmet medical needs and have the potential to rapidly enter clinical development and marketing stages. The firm typically develops its drug candidates through early-stage clinical trials, and then determines whether to conduct further studies or to seek a partner or buyer to continue later-stage trials. Medivation's lead product, the blockbuster Xtandi, treats certain forms of prostate cancer; the drug was developed in partnership with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas
   </company>
   .
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   bought Medivation for $14 billion in 2016.

  <p>
   With an eye on Xtandi and Medivation's oncology pipeline, Pfizer beat out a number of rumored contenders to buy the company in mid-2016. Xtandi has already generated some $2 billion in annual sales, and that figure has the potential to double as further indications are approved.

  <p>
   Medivation gained FDA approval for its small molecule Xtandi (enzalutamide) candidate for the treatment of post-chemotherapy cases of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in 2012; in 2014, the FDA approved its usage for mCRPC patients who have not received chemotherapy. Under terms of the company's collaboration with Astellas, the drug is marketed in the US by both firms. Xtandi has also been granted approval in Europe, Japan, and other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also developing enzalutamide to treat breast cancer; other development candidates seek to treat additional forms of cancer and neurological ailments. Its pipeline includes phase II STRIVE and TERRAIN and phase III PROSPER EMBARK, AFFIRM, and PREVAIL. Intellectual property rights are held by the company's Medivation Technologies, Medivation Prostate Therapeutics, and Medivation Neurology units, while the Medivation Services unit conducts research and development programs.

   Medivation generates most of its revenues from collaborations. In 2014 revenue jumped 160% to $710 million on higher US net sales of Xtandi, as well as upfront and royalty payments from partner Astellas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company became profitable for the first time since its inception in 2014. Higher revenue led to net income of $276 million. Cash flow from operations also rose that year: The company reported an inflow of $240 million, versus an outflow in 2013.

  <p>
   The company funds its research and development operations through the sale of its stock, offered both privately and publicly, and from up-front, development milestone, and cost-sharing payments from collaborators. Medivation is always looking to acquire additional development candidates to expand and diversify its pipeline. The company's goal is to build a portfolio of four to six product candidates that could be in clinical development within 18 months after being acquired, and to pursue commercialization through the most cost-effective means (including direct sales or partnerships). It also uses third-party manufacturers to keep operating expenses down.

   In late 2014, the company licensed exclusive global rights to pidilizumab from CureTech. Pidilizumab is a monoclonal antibody developed by CureTech for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. It expects to initiate phase III trials on pidilizumab as a treatment for blood-related cancers.

   bid some $9.3 billion to acquire Medivation in 2016. Medivation rejected the proposal but then began talks with other possible buyers interested in the blockbuster Xtandi. The company ultimately agreed to be acquired by Pfizer.

   In 2010 and 2011 Medivation partnered with
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   to develop what was then its lead drug candidate, dimebon. During those years Pfizer's collaboration payments accounted for 60% of the company's revenues. Dimebon reached late-stage clinical trials for treating Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, but after the company reported poor results in several of the late-stage trials, Pfizer ended the collaboration in early 2012 and discontinued further development of the drug for all indications. The partnership had held potential value of up to $725 million for Medivation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's collaboration with Astellas began in 2009, with Medivation and Astellas sharing the development costs of putting XTANDI through late-stage trials.
