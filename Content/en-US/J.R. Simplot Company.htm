   pioneer Ray Kroc in the mid-1960s and his company's french fry sales have sizzled ever since. Simplot remains the major french fry supplier for McDonald's and supplies

   and
   <company id="11621">
    Wendy's
   </company>
   , as well. Altogether, Simplot produces 1,000 food products, such as fruits and vegetables under the names RoastWorks and Simplot Classic. It owns and operates more than 82,500 acres on some 40 farms located primarily in Idaho and Washington. The company produces 3.5 billion pounds of frozen french fries and formed potatoes annually, making it one of the world's largest processors of frozen potatoes.

  <p>
   A global company, Idaho-based Simplot operates primarily in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and China. The company's Simplot Grower Solutions unit boasts more than 85 locations across the Western US.

  <p>
   Known by consumers for its frozen-food processing business, Simplot is also involved in seed production, farming, fertilizer manufacturing, phosphate mining, ranching, cattle production, and distribution. Its integrated portfolio consists of four business groups -- AgriBusiness, Food Group, Land &amp; Livestock, and Simplot Australia -- that span some 14 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simplot grows more than 15 different crops, including hay, potatoes, corn, wheat, sweet corn, and barley. Rather than selling what it grows, it processes potatoes, sweet corn, and other vegetables at the company's own food processing plants. Simplot's feedlots use the company's corn, hay, and grain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates its largest farms in Idaho and Washington under the Grand View Farms-Idaho and Grand View Farms-Pasco names, respectively. As part of its business, Simplot manages more than a dozen ranches in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Its ranches rank among the largest nationwide. Simplot also is the only company in the top 10 nationwide for both cow-calf production and feedlot capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simplot buys its equipment and parts used for food plants, fertilizer manufacturing facilities, and offices primarily from North American companies. It purchases potatoes and other crops directly from farmers and relies on commodity markets for its sulfur, ammonia, nitrogen, and derivatives for its fertilizer business. Each year Simplot converts 7 million tons of rock into phosphate plant nutrients and other products.

   Simplot provides several customers, such as ubiquitous McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King, with its potato products. The company markets its products in more than 40 countries worldwide.

   Simplot has expanded its potato empire in recent years through acquisitions and agreements. The company extended its reach in Kansas and Colorado by purchasing Crop Service Center and Dorman Brothers agricultural supply companies in 2012. Adding these companies to its Simplot Grower Solutions network, part of the AgriBusiness unit, strengthens its commitment to crop nutrients and protection, seed, specialty products, and agricultural technology. Entering the Australasian ready-meals market, Simplot Australia boasts a licensing agreement with
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé Australia
   </company>
   . As part of the partnership, Simplot manufactures the Lean Cuisine and Maggi frozen food products; at the same time, it acquired the Papa Giuseppi frozen pizza brand from Nestlé. The company signaled a change in its ready-meals strategy two years later, when it sold the Papa Giuseppi brand and its private-label frozen pizza business and related assets to Germany's
   <company id="129018">
    Dr. Oetker
   </company>
   . As part of the deal, Simplot Australia continued to provide supply chain, manufacturing, merchandising, and other support services to Dr. Oetker.

  <p>
   J.R. Simplot was born in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1909. His family moved to the frontier town of Declo, Idaho, about a year later. Frustrated with school and an overbearing father, Simplot dropped out at age 14 and moved to a local hotel, where he made money by paying cash for teachers' wage scrip, at 50 cents on the dollar. Simplot then got a bank loan using the scrip as collateral and moved into farming, first by raising hogs and then by growing potatoes. He met Lindsay Maggart, a leading farmer in the area, who taught him the value of planting certified potato seed, rather than potatoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simplot purchased an electric potato sorter in 1928 and eventually dominated the local market by sorting for neighboring farms. By 1940 his company, J.R. Simplot, operated 33 potato warehouses in Oregon and Idaho. The company moved into food processing in the 1940s, first by producing dried onions and other vegetables for Chicago-based Sokol &amp; Co. and later by producing dehydrated potatoes. Between 1942 and 1945 J.R. Simplot produced more than 50 million pounds of dehydrated potatoes for the US military. During the war the company also expanded into fertilizer production, cattle feeding, and lumber. It moved to Boise, Idaho, in 1947.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s J.R. Simplot researchers developed a method for freezing french fries. In the mid-1960s Simplot persuaded
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   founder, Ray Kroc, to go with his frozen fries, a handshake deal that practically guaranteed Simplot's success in the potato processing industry. By the end of the 1960s, Simplot was the largest landowner, cattleman, potato grower, and employer in the state of Idaho. He also had established fertilizer plants, mining operations, and other businesses in 36 states, as well as in Canada and a handful of other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the oil crisis of the 1970s, J.R. Simplot began producing ethanol from potatoes. However, Simplot's empire-building was not without its rough edges. In 1977 he pleaded no contest to federal charges that he failed to report his income, and the next year he was forced to settle charges that he manipulated Maine potato futures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered the frozen fruit and vegetable business in 1983. Other ventures included using wastewater from potato processing for irrigation and using cattle manure to fuel methane gas plants. Simplot set up a Chinese joint venture in the 1990s to provide processed potatoes to McDonald's and other customers in East Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought the giant ZX cattle ranch near Paisley, Oregon, in 1994. Simplot retired from the board of directors that year to become chairman emeritus; Stephen Beebe was named president and CEO. The 1995 acquisition of the food operations of Pacific Dunlop (now
   <company id="42395">
    Ansell
   </company>
   ) led to the creation of Simplot Australia, one of the largest food processors in Australia. Its 1997 stock swap with I. &amp; J. Foods Australia enlarged the subsidiary's frozen food menu.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold its Simplot Dairy Products cheese business to France's Besnier Group, and it teamed with Dutch potato processor Farm Frites to enter new markets. In 2000 it launched agricultural website planetAg, bought the turf grass seed assets of AgriBioTech, and added the US potato operations of
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   to its pantry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm said it would build an $80 million potato-processing plant in Manitoba in 2001. Also that year the company said it would not increase the value of its contracts with growers struggling amid low prices in a glutted market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Simplot sold its Australian pudding maker Big Sister to the Fowlers Vacola Group and its Agrisource grain company to a private buyer. That same year Beebe retired and Lawrence Hlobik, president of the company's agribusiness unit, was named CEO. The company closed its only meat-processing plant in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   After being out of the dehydrated potato business for more than 30 years, Simplot acquired the dehydrated potato granule business of
   <company id="43903">
    Nestlé USA
   </company>
   in 2004; in addition, it reached an agreement with
   <company id="110374">
    Idaho Fresh-Pak
   </company>
   to distribute that company's dehydrated potatoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company began offering zero-gram trans-fat french fries, called Infinity Fries, for the foodservice market. J. R. Simplot and his wife, Esther, donated their former hilltop home in Boise to the State of Idaho in 2005; the structure became the governor's mansion for the state, which previously didn't have an official residence for the governor's family. Also that year, Simplot stopped producing fertilizer-grade ammonium nitrate; the material can be used to produce devastating explosions, as in the 1995 terrorist attack on the federal building in Oklahoma City.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company acquired Washington State-based H&amp;R Ag, an agricultural retailer that supplies crop nutrition and protection products to farmers. With operations in Washington and Oregon, H&amp;R fits into the Simplot strategy to expand into new key products, services, and areas in the northwestern US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder Jack Simplot died in 2008 at the age of 99. Officially retired from the company in 1994, he was one of the wealthiest people in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2011 Simplot sold the Papa Giuseppi frozen pizza brand (acquired from Nestlé in 2009) and its private-label frozen pizza business and related assets to Germany's
