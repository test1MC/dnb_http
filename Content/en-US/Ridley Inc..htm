   In 2012 Ridley merged its Canadian commercial feed business, Feed-Rite, with
   <company id="40011">
    Ag Processing
   </company>
   subsidiary Masterfeeds to form the second-largest feed provider in Canada, Masterfeeds LP. The new entity operates 22 manufacturing plants across the Quebec, Ontario, and Prairie provinces. Ridley and Ag Processing each own relative shares in Masterfeeds LP.

   The company's block operations division acquired privately held Kansas company Stockade Brands in late 2012. The maker of blocks, loose minerals, and dried molasses products serves the livestock and equine markets. The deal gives Ridley a deeper products menu and access to new marketing channels in the region.
