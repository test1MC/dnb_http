   Who knew you could find religion by spending $300 on a pair of jeans? True Religion Apparel designs and markets upscale denimwear, including jeans, skirts, jackets, and tops, sold under the True Religion Brand Jeans in major cities on six continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. It also markets swimwear, eyewear, footwear, and fragrances. Founded in 2002, True Religion sells its pricey products via upscale retailers, such as

   ,

    Neiman Marcus

   ,

    Saks Fifth Avenue
   </company>
   , and some 700 high-end US boutiques. It also operates about 120 US stores and 30 overseas under the True Religion banner, and sells apparel online. TowerBrook Capital Partners acquired the company in 2013.

        <p>
   In fall 2012 True Religion Apparel's board of directors formed a special committee to consider strategic alternatives, including a possible sale, for the company after receiving interest from potential buyers. Indeed, the company in July 2013 was acquired by New York- and London-based investment management firm TowerBrook Capital Partners for about $835 million.

        <p>
   The company's US Consumer Direct segment accounts for 60% of total sales. US Wholesale contributes more than 20%, while the International business makes up the rest. True Religion's apparel is made from fabrics from Italy, Japan, Turkey, and the US. Men's apparel contributes more than half of total sales. Women's apparel, currently a relatively weak performing category for the company, accounts for nearly 45%.

        <p>
   Among increased competition from both high- and lower-priced rivals, True Religion's advertising expenses totaled $11.7 million in 2012, vs. $7.9 million and $8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

        <p>
   While True Religion's sales continue to climb (up 11% in 2012 vs. 2011), the profit picture is far less rosy. Indeed, net income grew by just 2% in 2012 vs. the prior year, and the company's net profit margin has shrunk from the high-double-digit range in the the late 2000s, to less than 10% in 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   Retail sales got a boost from the addition of new stores and increases in same-store sales driven by increased sales of men's merchandise, partially offset by sales decreases in the women's denim category.

        <p>
   Competition from other high-end jeans makers and cheaper alternatives has shrunk True Religion's net profit margin and share price. Also, the apparel maker has undergone a number of fashion missteps that have customers questioning whether its apparel is worth the high price. (True Religion's jeans, which account for about 45% of sales, are priced from $172 to $398 per pair.) To grow sales, the company expects to open more than a dozen retail stores in 2013. (Since 2008 the fast-growing chain has added about 110 stores in the US.) It also plans to address the weakness in sales of women's merchandise.
  </p>
        <p>
   Amid a strategic review of its business, the founder, chairman, and CEO of the company, Jeff Lubell, in March 2013 stepped down. (He will serve as a creative consultant to True Religion for a period of two years.)
