  <p>
   Through its research and development center, American Trim is developing manufacturing technologies in the areas of electromagnetic forming, physical vapor deposition, and digital printing and surface modification -- all of which improve the forming, finishing, and coating for metal and composite substrates. To this end, it has partnered with

    The Ohio State University
   </company>
   , Rhodes State College, and Ohio Northern University, as well as Edison Materials Technology Center.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Trim is focused on scaling its research efforts for high-tech manufacturing as part of the company's multiyear commitment to pursue an agile manufacturing strategy. The completion of the Finish Development Center creates opportunities for the company to expand into additional markets in the alternative energy, appliance, and automotive industries. American Trim introduced a new product line of economy range hoods in 2102.

   In 2013, the company cut a dozen positions as it moved a planned decorated products line from its Baxter Street factory to Lebanon, Kentucky. The Baxter Street facility remains in operation but focuses on development instead of production.

  <p>
   American Trim also fortifies its operations through acquisitions. In late 2012 it purchased Angell-Demmel North America, a provider of metal, automotive trim parts owning a design facility in Dayton, Ohio, and a manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Kentucky. The deal gave the company the ability to provide OEMs with a supply of high quality aluminum trim products.

  <p>
   The company was forged out of a joint venture between Superior Metal and Alcoa (later renamed
   <company id="10068">
    Arconic
   </company>
   ) in 1996 that made consoles for Whirlpool washers.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Trim was originally founded as a tool and die shop in 1948 by the Hawk family.
