   Samsung Total Petrochemicals sticks to the basics. The company manufactures building block chemicals that go into the making of a host of other chemicals needed to make the stuff we can use. It starts with a naphtha cracker, yielding propylene and ethylene, which are the raw materials in the production of all manner of polymers. Samsung Total divides its operations in three: polymer production (polyethylene, polypropylene, high- and low-density polyethylene), olefins (selling the ethylene and propylene the company doesn't use itself, as well as aromatics used to make the materials that go into synthetic fibers), and aromatics petrochemicals like solvents and liquefied petroleum gases (propane, butane, etc.).

  <p>
   Samsung Total has a major petrochemical complex in Daesan, in Korea's South Chungcheong province. It has Korean sales offices in Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju and Daejeon. Elsewhere in Asia, it has sales offices in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong), and in Japan (Tokyo and Nagoya).

  <p>
   The company's large petrochemical complex consists of 13 plants and three production units, Olefins, Poly olefins, and Aromatics. Naphtha is cracked at the naphtha cracking center to produce olefins (ethylene and propylene), which in turn are used as the feedstock for polymer (poly olefins) production, including high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, polypropylene, and composite polypropylene.
  </p>
  <p>
   The aromatics plant processes aromatics products (paraxylene and benzene) as the feedstock for base materials used in the production of synthetic fabrics and petrochemicals (Styrene and PTA). This third unit also produces oil products (jet oil, kerosene and solvents).

   Samsung Total's products are used in automobiles; electronic/electric materials; basic core materials for IT; and green businesses.

   Pushing green technology, in 2014 Samsung Total successfully completed the commercial development of an eco-friendly catalyst. The new phthalate free catalyst can be use in a  broad range of plastic products such as automobiles, medical uses, and food containers.

  <p>
   The company was formed in 2003 when the
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL Group
   </company>
   invested nearly $800 million in the former Samsung General Chemicals (SGC), a part of the
   <company id="41463">
    Samsung Group
   </company>
   . Now a joint venture, SGC changed its name to Samsung Atofina. In 2004 when TOTAL broke up its chemical operations -- previously called
   <company id="90709">
    ATOFINA
   </company>
   , now two separate companies called
   <company id="136198">
    Arkema
   </company>
   and
   <company id="110697">
    Total Petrochemicals
   </company>
   -- the JV again changed its name to the current Samsung Total Petrochemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Samsung Total has developed its Chinese business significantly and had such early success that the parent companies are looking to expand the JV's manufacturing capacity.
