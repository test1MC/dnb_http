   Valeo hopes to live up to its name, which in Latin means, "I am doing well." The company is one of Europe's largest car parts suppliers, making components for most global car makers. Valeo operates four business groups: Comfort and Driving Assistance Systems (interior controls, security systems); Powertrain Systems (engine and electrical systems, transmissions); Thermal Systems (climate control, compressors, engine cooling); and Visibility Systems (lighting systems, wiper systems). Valeo Service distributes products to the automotive aftermarket. Valeo has about 136 production sites in 29 countries. Its Chairman and CEO is Jacques Aschenbroich.

   Thermal Systems, Valeo's largest segment at 28% of total sales, makes heat-management systems including climate control and powertrain thermal systems such as air-conditioning loops, cabin filters, battery thermal management, and air intakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Visibility Systems, which also makes 28% of sales, makes lights (headlights, side lights, brake lights, reverse lights, indicators), and wiper systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Powertrain Systems makes parts such as clutches, superchargers, and stop-start systems. It accounts for some 26% of total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Comfort and Driving Assistance Systems segment makes dashboard displays, sensors, cameras, and parking assistance, among others. It represents some 18% of sales.

   In fiscal 2015, sales grew 7% to €14.5 billion, with the strongest growth recorded in original equipment sales. Growth in Europe, China, Asia (excl. China), and North America was partially offset by an 18% fall in South America; in each region, however, equipment sales outpaced automotive production. The strongest growth was found in Europe, which recorded an 11% like-for-like sales increase.

  <p>
   Profit rose 30% to €774 million, while cash flow from operating activities climbed 32% to €1.7 billion.

  <p>
   Valeo has been driving sales through a push to diversify its customer portfolio, re-examine its product positioning, and re-evaluate its geographic strategy. Its R&amp;D expenditure, which has been increasing in recent years, is focused on technologies relating to emission reduction and driving assist. Transportation accounts for around 25% of total global CO2 emissions, and as such the industry as a whole is seeking greater energy efficiency, opening up new opportunities.

  <p>
   Englishman Herbert Frood, drawing on a recollection of a carriage driver who jammed his shoe between the brake and wheel to hasten the carriage's arrest, introduced an asbestos brake shoe for automobiles around 1910. The new product was an immediate hit, and Frood sold the right to import (and later manufacture) his "Ferodo" linings to French businessman Eugene Buisson, who founded Société Anonyme Française du Ferodo in 1923. Over the years the company added clutches, clutch linings, and other parts to its product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1962 Ferodo acquired Sofica, an automotive heating systems company. It then diversified into cooling systems and expanded into Italy, Spain, Asia, and South America as the company followed its customers' international growth. Ferodo acquired several companies during the 1970s, and its line of automotive parts soon included lighting systems, electronics, and transmissions. In 1980 the company changed its name to Valeo. Around the same time the company began diversifying into non-automotive businesses, including construction, steel, and industrial equipment. Valeo lost money from 1984-86.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlo De Benedetti's Cerus gained a 19% stake (later increased to about 27%) in Valeo in 1986. The next year Benedetti tapped Noël Goutard (lured from Thomson) to replace CEO André Buisson. Goutard's first order of business was unloading Valeo's non-automotive interests. He also reduced costs by cutting the workforce by 25% and by slashing the number of its suppliers in half. Although Goutard cut the payroll, he didn't do so at the expense of research and development; in a three-year span in the early 1990s, he hired nearly 2,000 engineers. The company routinely spent 6% of sales on R&amp;D.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Goutard began a program of aggressive international growth. Undaunted by European recession in the early 1990s -- when the European car market suffered its worst contraction in 50 years -- Valeo had 80 plants and research centers in 17 countries by 1994. Its US operations figured heavily in the growth spurt; in five years Valeo's US sales grew from $50 million to $500 million. Other investments included the acquisition of German auto electronics company Borg Instruments (1994) and the formation of five joint ventures in China by the end of 1995. Cerus, which had blocked any moves to raise capital that would dilute its interest in the company, sold its stake in Valeo in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valeo spent about $1.7 billion in 1998 for ITT Automotive's electrical systems unit. The next year Goutard announced that he would retire at the end of 2000 after showing his successor, André Navarri, the ropes. Navarri, who previously headed
   <company id="57238">
    ALSTOM
   </company>
   's $5 billion-a-year transport division, succeeded him in 2000. However, Navarri was forced out in 2001 by major shareholder CGIP after disagreements concerning the company's strategy. CFO Thierry Morin replaced Navarri as chairman of the management board and Goutard was reinstated to head Valeo's newly formed supervisory board.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Valeo announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs -- about 12% of its workforce -- and to invest heavily in Latin America and Eastern Europe. The same year it bought a 20% stake in Japanese car-lighting maker Ichikoh Industries from
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan
   </company>
   . The company also bought the automotive business of
   <company id="91841">
    Labinal
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 the company announced that it would cut about 1,000 jobs in the US in response to a slowdown in the North American auto market. Not long afterward it was reported that Valeo was in talks regarding the sale of its electric motors business to Hong Kong-based
   <company id="58682">
    Johnson Electric
   </company>
   . Also in 2001, Valeo sold Filtrauto S.A. (automotive oil, fuel, and air filters) to Italian filter company
   <company id="91699">
    SOGEFI
   </company>
   . Then, in response to the depressed global automotive market, Valeo announced 12 European plant closures, including sites in France, Germany, and Spain. Later in 2001 Valeo sold Valeo Transmission Limited, UK to three of the company's managers in an MBO. As 2001 neared its close, US subsidiary Valeo Electrical Systems, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; it emerged from Chapter 11 in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Valeo bought the engine electronics business of
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   for about $437 million. The division made engine management systems and components and operated two plants in France. Also that year Valeo formed a joint venture with Iranian auto parts maker Armco.
  </p>
  <p>
   After deciding its motors and actuators business was not complementary to its focus on comfort enhancement, driving assistance, and powertrain efficiency, Valeo sold the business to
   <company id="58640">
    Nidec
   </company>
   of Japan for €165 million in 2006. Two years later, the company sold its Shanghai-based automotive motor manufacturing subsidiary to Nidec.
