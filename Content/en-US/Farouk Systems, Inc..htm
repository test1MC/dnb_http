   Forget about bad hair days; Farouk Systems can iron things out with its own version of CHI energy. The company makes and markets personal care products, including BioSilk hair care and spa items, in addition to CHI styling products and implements (hair dryers, straightening and curling irons, clippers, and hairstyling irons) for men and women. It also makes CHI men's and women's fragrances, as well as CHI nail polish. The company caters to both consumers and professionals and operates the Farouk Systems CHI Academy in Houston for training hair professionals. The company, founded by Palestinian immigrant Farouk Shami (chairman) in 1986, is owned and operated by professional hairdressers.

  <p>
   Farouk Systems boasts a history of firsts in the hair care industry. In 1986 it launched the industry's first ammonia-free hair lightener and color system, SunGlitz, which today is sold under the CHI name. With its CHI iron, the company became the first company to manufacture a hair tool that incorporates ceramic, ionic, and far infrared technologies.
