   "Power to the people," a popular slogan often shouted in the 1960s, also works for the folks at C&amp;D Technologies. The company makes reserve power systems and batteries, which can be found inside corporate data centers, factories, network operations centers, and nuclear power plants. Typical customers are companies in the cable, electric utility, and telecommunications industries. Reserve power systems monitor electrical power usage and provide a source of backup power in the case of power failures and interruptions. C&amp;D Technologies is owned by Angel Holdings LLC, an affiliate of investment firm

The company later branched out into building batteries for "horseless carriages." During WWII, C&amp;D diversified into industrial batteries and later addressed industrial power systems, working in concert with
