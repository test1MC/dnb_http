   Lactalis McLelland makes premium cheeses with a distinctly Scottish flavor, including its Seriously Strong cheddar brand, one of the top-selling cheeses in the UK. The company's other brands include the award-winning Orkney Cheddar, made on the Orkney Isles, and Galloway, touted as Scotland's family favorite cheddar. McLelland is also one of the UK's largest importers of such European cheeses as President brie. The lines are represented on the supermarket shelves of

   The 2004 takeover by
   <company id="54346">
    Lactalis
   </company>
   , estimated at Â£150 million ($222.6 million), enabled the dairy group to expand its range of products in the UK marketplace as McLelland made headway in raising international awareness for its Seriously Strong brand. Lactalis has continued to invest in McLelland's facilities, but more so in its specialty brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the trend toward more convenient and snack-ready foods, McLelland has rolled out a line of Seriously Spreadable products. The new offerings marked a departure from the mainstream block cheddar and followed the launch of a spreadable French cheese under the President Rondele brand coupled with the cheese aisle's first spreadable goat cheese. In addition, the company has collaborated with
   <company id="134870">
    Dean's
   </company>
   , a maker of shortbread, biscuits, and other premium-baked products, to launch a variety of Cheese Oat Nibbles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nonetheless, McLelland has struggled amid price-cutting promotions in the mass market and new product development by rival brands like Cathedral City owned by
   <company id="58580">
    Dairy Crest
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   McLelland was founded in 1850.
