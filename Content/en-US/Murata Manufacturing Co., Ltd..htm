   When it comes to passives, Murata makes more at a time than almost anybody. Murata Manufacturing is one of the world's largest makers of passive electronic components, primarily capacitors. The components, many of which are made of the ceramic materials that have been a Murata specialty since its founding, are used in many sorts of electronic devices, such as computers, mobile phones, automotive navigation and air bag systems, and medical equipment. With a presence in
   <company id="111078">
    North America
   </company>
   , the company also makes a wide variety of other components, including filters, antennas, resonators, power supplies, and sensors. Customers in China, Japan, and the rest of Asia account for about 85% of sales.

   Akira Murata founded Murata Manufacturing Co. in 1944 to produce traditional ceramic tableware. However, the company quickly moved into high-performance ceramics for electronics, and expanded with new plants in Japan. (Its expansion of production capacity within Japan has remained consistent; since the 1960s Murata has opened at least three new domestic factories per decade.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1963, the year it went public, Murata also opened an office in New York. The company created MurataBourns, a joint venture with
   <company id="114134">
    Bourns
   </company>
   , in 1966 to make industrial potentiometers, devices that control the amount of current that flows through a circuit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murata kept expanding overseas in the 1970s, with new operations in Singapore (1972), the US (1973), Hong Kong (1973), Germany (1975), and Taiwan (1978).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1981 the company bought the Canadian subsidiary of Erie Technological Products (electromagnetic filters) following a year-long regulatory battle. That year Murata shuttered its MurataBourns joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Murata continued to expand in the 1980s, with marketing, trading, and production offices in South Korea (1980), the UK (1982 and 1989), Brazil (1985 and 1986), Thailand (1988), Germany (1988), and the Netherlands (1989).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Yasutaka Murata, who had joined the company in 1973, succeeded his father, Akira, as president. Akira became chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   More Asian offices opened during the 1990s in Malaysia (1990 and 1993) and the Philippines (1998). Murata began a major push into China in the mid-1990s, setting up operations in Beijing and Wuxi (1994), Shanghai (1995), and Suzhou (2001). Osamu Murata replaced his father as chairman in 1995. (Osamu retired as chairman in 2001; the post remained vacant until 2007.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits surged in fiscal 2000 as a booming electronics market led to high demand for capacitors and other components; the next year, though, Murata warned of a sharp downturn in profits amid a steep slump in the worldwide electronics industry. The company took a big hit in the following years as the global chip industry went through its worst down period on record.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004
   <company id="111078">
    Murata Electronics North America
   </company>
   closed its plant in State College, Pennsylvania. Some functions were relocated to the US subsidiary's plant in Smyrna, Georgia. Later that year Murata Europe Management closed its capacitor taping operation in Plymouth, UK, shifting production to Japan and Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Murata established a collaborative relationship with Nagano Japan Radio for switching power supplies, agreeing to manufacture each other's products. The company also created a joint venture with Superwave Corporation, called MTC Solutions, to make multi-task communication modules for wireless authentication systems. In 2005 Wuxi Murata Electronics began construction on its third plant to make chip monolithic ceramic capacitors in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Akira Murata died in 2006 at the age of 84. He had served as the company's honorary chairman since 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired SyChip, a US developer of radio-frequency (RF) semiconductors for digital music players, Global Positioning System (GPS) products, and PDAs, for about $137 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yasutaka Murata, the first son of Akira Murata, became chairman of the company his father founded in 2007. That year Murata also acquired the Power Electronics division of
   <company id="11819">
    C&amp;D Technologies
   </company>
   for $85 million in cash. The division makes power supplies and converters.
