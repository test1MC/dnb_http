   Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) has masterminded its way into mixing alumina and aluminum. Chinalco is the only Chinese maker of alumina, which is refined from bauxite and is the key material in producing aluminum. In 2014, the company produced about 12 million tons of alumina products (including alumina, alumina hydrate, and alumina chemicals), which makes it the largest alumina producer in China and the second-largest maker of alumina in the world. Chinalco also produced more than 3.4 million tons of primary aluminum and 800,000 tons of fabricated aluminum products in 2014. The company is also looking to develop rare earth metals as well as copper and other nonferrous metals.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Chinalco owns 10 branches, 1 research institute, and 12 subsidiaries. The company operates its business through five business segments: alumina segment, primary aluminum segment, trading segment, energy segment, and corporate and other operating segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The alumina segment consists of the mining and purchasing of bauxite and other raw materials, the refining of bauxite into alumina, and the sale of alumina. The primary aluminum segment is engaged in the procurement of alumina and other raw materials, supplemental materials and electricity power, and the smelting of alumina to produce primary aluminum.
  </p>
  <p>
   The energy segment, which consists of the research and development, production and operation of Chinalco's energy products, mainly includes coal mining (its coal is sold to internal and external customers), electricity generation by thermal power, wind power and solar power (sold to regional power grid corporations), and new energy-related equipment manufacturing business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The trading segment is engaged in the trading of alumina, primary aluminum, aluminum fabrication products, other nonferrous metal products, coal products and raw materials and supplemental materials to internal manufacturing plants and external customers in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chinalco's corporate and other operating segments includes the management of corporate, research, and developmental activities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 the company's net revenues decreased by 16%. The sales of trading segment declined by 19.9% due to a decrease in volumes of major aluminum products sold through its trading segment. The sales of the primary aluminum segment declined due to lower sales volume and a drop in average selling price of primary aluminum products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chinalco posted a net loss of RMB17.05 billion in 2014 (compared to net income of RMB0.75 billion in fiscal 2013), due to lower net revenues and an increase in impairment loss on property, plant and equipment (primarily due to provisions of substantial impairment for certain property, plant and equipment resulting from general market factors, such as the continuous decrease of aluminum prices and poor market conditions in the photovoltaic and silicon industries that Chinalco participates in).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company's cash inflows increased by 67% due to changes in working capital as a result of changes in trade and notes receivables and other current assets.

  <p>
   Chinalco's strategy is simple: it wants to be the world's largest aluminum producer, and works to grow both organically and through acquisitions. It seeks to vertically integrate its operations, locking up sources of raw materials and growing its trading segment, as well. Its production accounts for just about half of all alumina products consumed in China. Chinalco has made several moves to expand internationally and get in on the general global consolidation trend in the minerals sector. However, some its attempts to grow globally have turned into expensive misadventures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to continuing to expand the existing business lines, the company alsoexpands into new industries which the company believes have synergies with Chinalco's existing operations.

  <p>
   Chinalco agreed to set up a joint venture in 2011 with Guangxi Nonferrous Metals Group to develop rare earths in Guangxi province. Chinalco will control the venture, which is part of its strategy to become a worldwide leader in rare earth resources over the next decade. It formed a second rare earth joint venture that year with Grirem Advanced Materials, this one located in Nanning, as an extention of its Chinalco Rare Earth operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also entered into a JV with UAE-based Gulf International Investment Group Holdings to develop a $1.6 billion aluminum smelter in Malaysia.

   , Alcoa and Chinalco acquired 12% of Rio Tinto for $14 billion in early 2008. Early the next year Chinalco stepped in with an offer to assist Rio Tinto out of a portion of its debt, which was considerable. The complicated arrangement, had it gone through, would have given Rio Tinto $19.5 billion through investments in aluminum, copper, and iron ore joint ventures as well as through convertible bonds. Chinalco's stake in Rio Tinto would have been raised to 19% and the Chinese company would have had the right to name two members to Rio Tinto's Board. The transaction, however -- never popular with domestic investors -- fell through by mid-2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the fallout from that episode, Rio Tinto formed to a joint venture in 2010 with Chinalco to establish and operate an iron ore project in Guinea in West Africa. Through a subsidiary, Chinalco will pay $1.35 billion to acquire 47% of Rio Tinto's Simandou project. In 2011 the two companies formed another joint venture, this time to explore China for copper, coal and potash.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Chinalco became the controlling shareholder of the Yunnan Copper Industry Group, parent company of the Yunnan Copper Company. Chinalco now holds a 51% stake in the company, after the Yunnan provincial government granted Chinalco an additional 2% equity stake at no cost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chinalco was founded in 2001.
