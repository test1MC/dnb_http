   No new online chat lingo, IMI is short for Imperial Metal Industries. Of its three business segments, the largest is Precision Engineering, which engineers Norgren-brand motion and fluid controls for use in trucks and even in drug-dosing valves. Critical Engineering -- through its
   <company id="131458">
    CCI
   </company>
   , Truflo Rona, and Orton brands -- makes custom-engineered valves for the power generation and pulp/paper industries, among others, while Hydronic Engineering designs TA Hydronics-branded valves for commercial/residential HVAC. IMI operates mostly in Europe and North America.

  <p>
   IMI operates three divisions: Critical Engineering, Precision Engineering and Hydronic Engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Critical Engineering provides flow control and measurement systems for liquids, steam and gas through brands such as Bopp &amp; Reuther and Fluid Kinetics. The segment brings in around 40% of revenue and its main markets are Oil &amp; Gas, Fossil Power, Nuclear Power, Petrochemical, Iron &amp; Steel, Desalination and Process Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Precision Engineering, which also brings in around 40% of revenue, offers customized and off-the-shelf fluid and motion control systems through brands including Norgren and Maxseal. Products include actuators, air preparation devices, vacuum devices, valves, pressure switches and fittings, and its main served industries are Commercial Vehicle, Energy, Food and Beverage, Industrial Automation, Life Sciences and Rail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hydronic Engineering, which represents under 20% of revenue, deals in cooling or heating systems in which heat is transported by circulating water, through brands such as Flow Design, Heimeier and Pneumatex. Its products' primary uses are in commercial and residential buildings.

  <p>
   IMI's operations are geographically diverse, covering five continents. The US is its largest market, responsible for over 21% of revenue.

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, revenue fell 8% on prior year -- the third consecutive year of falling sales -- to £1.5 billion, as the low global oil price in the period impacted on revenue in Critical Engineering. Precision Engineering was also hit by lower market demand in North America and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell from £669 million in 2014 to £127.6 million in 2014. This sharp fall was a result of lower revenue and decreased profits from discontinued operations after tax. Cash from operating activities rose 107% to £242.9 million due to additional pension scheme funding in the UK and overseas.

  <p>
   The company is struggling to arrest declines in revenue and profitability. It has undertaken cost-cutting initiatives such as closing small and low-growth facilities in Critical Engineering, such as Asterm SAS, IMI Scott Limited, Zimmerman &amp; Jansen South Africa Ltd and the non-core elements of Nano Porous Solutions Limited. It also downsized its Precision Engineering operations in Brazil. An ERP was launched in 2015 in Critical Engineering's Austria and Czech Republic divisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also working on product development, and to that end acquired Bopp &amp; Reuther, a German company that makes gas separators, meters and measuring systems, in 2015.

  <p>
   IMI acquired Bopp &amp; Reuther for £109.2 million in 2015. Bopp &amp; Reuther makes safety, control and shut-off valve technology for process industries and conventional fossil and nuclear power plants, and is active in a market IMI views as having good growth potential.

  <p>
   Scotsman entrepreneur George Kynoch started the company in 1862 in Birmingham, England, by opening an ammunition manufacturing facility, which became one of Britain's largest ammunition companies. The company further diversified its product offerings, and in 1918 it took on the name Nobel Industries, which became one of the four founders of
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical Industries
   </company>
   (ICI) in 1927 to compete with German cartel I. G. Farben.
  </p>
  <p>
   Imperial Metal Industries (IMI) was formed as a subsidiary of ICI in 1962. IMI's primary operations included nonferrous metals, heat exchangers, sporting ammunition, zippers, and engineering products, all essentially non-core operations of ICI. IMI diversified horizontally into related activities and vertically into companies that supplied raw materials or purchased its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions in the early 1960s included metal refining and smelting companies, as well as firms that made finished products, such as hot-water cylinders. Around the same time the company consolidated its zipper interests to better compete. In 1966 ICI sold 10% of IMI's stock to the public. With the collapse five years later of
   <company id="41834">
    Rolls-Royce
   </company>
   -- a major customer for IMI's titanium aircraft engine fan blades -- the company diversified by acquiring three fluid power companies by 1972. Soon after those purchases, IMI bought two French companies that made special valves. These two companies formed the basis of IMI's special engineering division.
  </p>
  <p>
   ICI sold its remaining stake in IMI in 1977. During the boom years of the 1980s, the company shifted away from low value-added products toward higher-margin finished products such as pipe, tube, and fittings. It also entered the drink dispenser market in 1982 by acquiring Cornelius (US). Meanwhile, the fluid power division broadened its scope -- aided by acquisitions -- to include pneumatic products. IMI's sales exceeded £1 billion in 1989 (about $1.6 billion), but a recession soon changed the company's fortunes.
  </p>
  <p>
   With sales and profits dropping, in 1991 IMI bought A.W. Cash Valve, a US supplier of heating and plumbing controls, and Uniplex, an office software firm. Sales dropped about 25% between 1989 and 1992; the company's Building Products sector was especially hard hit by the decline in construction. IMI initiated a cost-cutting program during the recession and increased its drink dispensing business by acquiring three additional companies in that sector, including Remcor Products. In 1994 IMI sold the unprofitable Uniplex subsidiary for a big loss. The company sold its titanium interests and acquired German radiator valve company Heimeier in 1996. The next year IMI's shopping included Herion (valves, Germany), TA Hydronics (valves for heating and cooling systems, UK), Wilshire (juice dispensers, US), and ISI Automation (controls for car body shops, UK). The buying spree drove up the company's debt load considerably.
  </p>
  <p>
   To concentrate on its core businesses, in 1998 the company sold Conax Buffalo (temperature sensors and pressure and vacuum sealing assemblies, US) and six other engineering businesses. In 1999 IMI bought plastic pipe concern Polypipe for about $540 million. (It sold the unit, along with the rest of its Building Products sector, in 2005.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing to divest non-core operations, the company disposed of its Marston aerospace business and its copper smelting operation in 1999. That year sales dipped for the company's drink dispensing operations after a major soft drink customer reduced its purchasing activity. IMI responded by closing a manufacturing facility in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 IMI increased its hydronic controls product offerings by acquiring Holland-based Aero Dynamiek (hydronic systems) and Italy-based Effast (industrial tube and fittings). The company sold its copper tube and fitting business the following year, initiating a restructuring that concluded with the sale of Polypipe in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its severe service valves business when it bought valve and flow control products maker Truflo in 2006. The next year it bolstered its Fluid Controls business with its acquisition of Las Vegas-based Kloehn, which made precision syringes and pumps. It also bought Pneumatex, a German company specializing in water conditioning equipment, in 2007. All three acquisitions helped IMI increase its global scope, especially with respect to the company's European presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Starting in mid-2008 IMI cut more than 15% of its global workforce. The company aimed to reduce operating costs, as well, by pushing both its manufacturing and material sourcing to low-cost developing markets, such as China, the Czech Republic, India, and Mexico.
