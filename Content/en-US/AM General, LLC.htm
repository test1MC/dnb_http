   Morning, noon, and night, AM General is trying to design better off-road vehicles for military and commercial customers. The company is best known for designing and producing the Humvee (High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle), a light tactical truck that performs military logistics, combat support, disaster relief, and other roles for the US armed forces and allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as for
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   . In addition to its Humvees, AM General manufactures diesel engines through subsidiary General Engine Products and automatic transmissions through General Transmission Products. The company formerly produced the Humvee's civilian vehicle counterpart, the HUMMER, which was sold to
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   in 1999.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Although AM General long ago shed the HUMMER name, it still builds on the legacy of having assembled the HUMMER H1 and H2 for consumer and commercial customers. The company's subsidiary, Mobility Ventures, makes the MV-1, a purpose-built vehicle for wheelchair accessibility. The MV-1 meets or exceeds Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines, and it is the only vehicle in its class with a factory-installed compressed natural gas fuel option.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the eco-friendly vehicle arena, AM General also collaborates with
   <company id="114113">
    Azure Dynamics
   </company>
   to produce the Transit Connect Electric, an all-electric commercial van version of
   <company id="10597">
    Ford Motor
   </company>
   's Transit Connect light-duty cargo vehicle. The zero-emission Transit Connect Electric incorporates Azure Dynamics' patented Force Drive battery electric powertrain and is assembled by AM General at its Livonia, Michigan plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company recently fulfilled a larger order of Humvees for the
   <company id="150344">
    US Army
   </company>
   but demand for the big vehicles may be waning as the military looks toward the next generation of lighter vehicles. It's too soon to predict the Humvee's fate, but decrease in demand for that vehicle could also spell trouble for the related services that AM General offers, including parts, equipment and driver training, and field service support through its Service Parts Logistics Operations (SPLO) division. The SPLO division is the only distributor of genuine Humvee parts.

   To help it win the battle for who gets to transport US troops on the ground, AM General is participating in the design of the next generation of military transport under the military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program. The vehicle is a collaborative product between the US Army,
   <company id="150625">
    US Marine Corps
   </company>
   , the Australian government, and three US contractor teams: General Tactical Vehicles (a joint venture between AM General and its partner
   <company id="105179">
    General Dynamics Land Systems
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="109919">
    BAE Systems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed Martin
   </company>
   . The three contractor teams used the military's requirements to develop their own vehicle prototypes.
