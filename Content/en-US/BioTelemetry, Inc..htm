   BioTelemetry knows how to keep a beat. The company provides real-time outpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring and telemetry services for patients throughout the US. Its core product, Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT), helps physicians diagnose and monitor heart arrhythmia in patients by providing continuous heartbeat monitoring and transmitting a complete picture of the heart's functions to physicians. The system, which uses real-time, two-way wireless communication, accommodates patient mobility and remote physician adjustment. BioTelemetry also manufactures and sells traditional cardiac event and Holter monitors that record patient heart rhythm data but cannot transmit the data in real time.

  <p>
   BioTelemetry's CardioNet MCOT services rely on the system's
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved monitoring equipment, wireless transmission network, proprietary software, and a 24-hour monitoring center. The MCOT system automatically detects rhythm irregularities and transmits the corresponding ECG (electrocardiogram) data to the monitoring center.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates through three segments: patient services, which provides diagnosis and monitoring services to physicians; product, which manufactures and services its heart monitoring devices; and research services, which provides consulting, heart monitoring, and data management services to companies conducting medical trials.

  <p>
   The CardioNet System is marketed directly to doctors and patients throughout the US and has been used with more than 500,000 patients. While
   <company id="103380">
    Medicare
   </company>
   reimbursements account for a more than a third of the company's revenues, it also has contracts with more than 400 commercial payers. Part of BioTelemetry's strategy is to increase the number of (more lucrative) commercial payer contracts it has as compared to its government contracts.

  <p>
   BioTelemetry has plans to use its technology to create instant telemetry beds (which allow patients to be continually monitored by technology) in rural hospitals, step-down units, or skilled nursing facilities to help cope with acute nursing shortages by reducing the number of nurses needed to oversee ECG monitoring and reduce capital equipment costs. The company also leverages acquisitions to expand its products, services, and geographic range.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions have helped BioTelemetry with its expansion of products, services, and geographic range. The company intends to move beyond arrhythmia monitoring into new market areas such as disease management for congestive heart failure, diabetes, and other diseases that require outpatient or ambulatory monitoring and management.
  </p>
  <p>
   To that end, BioTelemetry bought
   <company id="151020">
    VirtualScopics
   </company>
   for $15.5 million in 2016. VirtualScopics provides clinical trial imaging solutions to speed up the development processes for drugs and medical devices. The deal expands BioTelemetry's clinical research offerings.
