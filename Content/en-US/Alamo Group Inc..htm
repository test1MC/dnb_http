   Remember the Alamo Group for tractor-mounted mowing equipment -- rotary, flail, and sickle-bar! The company designs, manufactures, and distributes a slew of right-of-way maintenance and agricultural equipment. Its branded lines, Alamo Industrial and Tiger hydraulically powered tractor-mounted mowers, serve US government agencies. Rhino Products and M&amp;W Gear subsidiaries sell rotary cutters and other equipment to farmers for pasture upkeep. UK McConnel and Bomford, and France's S.M.A. subsidiaries market vegetation maintenance equipment, such as hydraulic boom-mounted hedge and grass mowers.

  <p>
   The company operates almost 25 plants in North America, Europe, and Australia. The US generates 68% of its sales. Other major markets include France (11%), the UK (7%), Canada (6%), and Australia (2%).

  <p>
   Alamo sells its products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors to governmental end-users, related independent contractors, as well as to the agricultural and commercial turf markets. The primary markets for its products are North America, Western Europe and Australia.

  <p>
   Alamo has achieved unprecedented growth the last few years, with revenues climbing 24% to peak at a record-setting $839 million in 2014. Profits also reached a net income milestone of $41 million in 2014. The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years, falling slightly in 2014 due to changes in inventories and prepaid expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was fueled by a 46% surge in North American Industrial sales and a 14% bump in European sales. The increases were largely attributed to additional revenue from acquisitions and higher demand for mowers, sweepers, excavators, vacuum trucks, and snow equipment. Alamo also enjoyed growth in the UK and France during 2014.

  <p>
   Alamo's sales are impacted by a myriad of variables, including global economic conditions, pricing and availability of raw materials, government budgets and policies, interest rates, and access to credit for capital. Even more directly, demand for the company's products may teeter with a drop in farm incomes, droughts and floods, animal disease outbreaks and pest infestations of crops, worldwide general demand for farm produce, and limits on agricultural imports.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alamo has sought to counter the adverse events endemic to its industry by strategically cultivating its geographic presence and product portfolio primarily through acquisitions of businesses and branded lines that enhance, dominate, or promise to significantly rival competitors within their equipment markets. Since its start more than 40 years ago, Alamo has invested in some two dozen companies.

  <p>
   Acquisitions are an important part of the company's growth strategy. It used acquisitions to fuel revenue milestones for 2014. It made three key acquisitions in 2014. It picked up Kellands Agricultural, a UK-based manufacturer of self-propelled sprayers and multi-purpose load-carrying tractor vehicles. The acquisition enhanced its manufacture and distribution capabilities of agricultural machinery and opened the door to the self-propelled sprayer market.

  <p>
   Alamo purchased Fieldquip Australia, a manufacturer of rotary cutters as well as a distributor of various agricultural products. The deal broadened its presence in both the manufacturing and distribution of agricultural machinery sectors in Australia. The company also in 2014 snapped up Specialized Industries LP and its subsidiaries Super Products, Wausau-Everest, and Howard P. Fairfield. The transaction enhanced its market position both in vacuum trucks and snow removal equipment primarily in North America.
