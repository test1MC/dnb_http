  <p>
   Menasha has achieved growth recently by purchasing regional businesses with similar product portfolios. In 2015 the company acquired PearceWellwood of Brampton, Ontario. PearceWellwood will operate as part of Menasha Packaging and the acquisition provides Menasha an entry into Canada to serve new and existing consumers. As the part of the transaction, the company also acquired an ownership interest in Tencorr Packaging, a corrugated sheet manufacturer with plants in Brampton and Mississauga, Ontario, from PearceWellwood's parent company.

   In 2014 Menasha obtained Strine Printing Company in a move that strengthened the company's graphic packaging, merchandising, and fulfillment capabilities and expanded its base of customers in the East Coast. Also improving its position in that region, Menasha Packaging in 2013 acquired Rand Diversified of Edison, New Jersey. The deal strengthened its geographic coverage with the addition of East Coast fulfillment and contract packaging services.

   In addition to acquisitions, Menasha keeps its innovative offerings rolling hot off the press. Its largest operating unit, Menasha Packaging, introduced a retail display roller base coupled with a customized Pack 'N' Stack display. The company utilizes radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking for perishable produce containers through its ORBIS unit, which makes a slew of new products, including a powertrain pallet for carmakers, high-tech totes for distribution and automated storage and retrieval systems, and a bulk container specialized for beverages. Its LeveragePoint Media unit created a point-of-sale initiative for a large prescription company. These sorts of product offerings help to distinguish the packager from its rivals.
