  <p>
   In 2014 DSM's net sales decreased by 2% due to lower sales from North America and Western Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions added 1% to net sales. Revenues from continuing operations in 2014 were 4% higher than in 2013 as higher volume accounted for a 5% increase in net sales. However, selling prices were 2% lower than in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 net income decreased by 63% due to a change in hedging reserve and re-measurements of defined benefit pension plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by €190 million (from €998 million in 2013), primarily due to change in inventories, and trade receivables.

  <p>
   Accelerating growth through acquisitions and partnerships has been a fundamental element of DSM's business strategy. It has invested €2.8 billion in the acquisition of new businesses since 2010. It has also completed a number of value-enhancing partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also taking steps to address the challenging external environment. Its key short-term priority is to take strategic actions regarding non-core businesses and to continue to focus on operational performance of its Nutrition and Performance Materials businesses. This will be complemented by accelerated actions to improve efficiency and reduce costs, specifically in Nutrition and across all functions of the company, including ICT, HR, Finance and Purchasing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Royal DSM NV, and
   <company id="60139">
    CVC Capital Partners
   </company>
   announced an agreement for a joint venture in the form of a new company for DSM's activities in Polymer Intermediates (Caprolactam and acrylonitrile) and Composite Resins, provisionally called NewCo. The partnership with CVC allows DSM to reduce the cyclicality of its portfolio to secure a competitive supply of caprolactam on DSM Engineering Plastics in the long term and be able to focus entirely on its Nutrition, Performance Materials and innovation activities, complemented by accelerated actions to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its joint venture with
   <company id="57056">
    Sinochem
   </company>
   , DSM Sinochem Pharmaceutical, was deconsolidated following new accounting rules for joint ventures. DSP improved its performance thanks to solid organic growth. It also formed DPx in partnership with JLL, combining DSM Pharmaceutical Products and Patheon into a leading pharma services company. DSM owns 49% of this joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 DSM opened the new center for research and development of advanced materials on the Bright Lands Chemelot Campus in Sittard-Geleen. The center employs more than 400 knowledge workers and brings significant technological competence and unique expertise in the Netherlands for applications around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Royal DSM NV announces that it has reached agreement with Standard Investment on the sale of DSM Synres. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015, subject to customary approvals and notifications. DSM Synres produces alkyd solvents and acrylic coating resins site in Hoek van Holland for the global coating, adhesive and printing markets and has annual sales of approximately €50 million.

  <p>
   In 2014 DSM agreed to acquire Aland, a Hong Kong-based company producing vitamin C in China. This transaction will allow DSM to further strengthen its position in vitamin C.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 DSM obtained control of Tortuga Companhia Zootécnica Agrária Z.A., a Brazilian company with a leading position in nutritional supplements with a focus on pasture-raised beef and dairy cattle. Tortuga has annual sales of approximately €385 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year DSM also bought Unitech Industries Limited (Unitech). Based in Auckland (New Zealand) Unitech was founded in 1970 and focuses primarily on the manufacture and sale of micronutrient premixes and macronutrient blends for the rapidly growing Asian human nutrition and health markets.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Royal DSM began in 1902 with the Dutch government's desire to establish a source for coal. Previously all coal used in Holland was either imported or held by foreign companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1920 DSM began selling coke-oven gas as an energy source. In 1929, as the use of coke-oven gas began to diminish, DSM expanded to produce chemicals such as fertilizer. Although chemical production increased, the fuel shortage following WWII translated into growth for DSM's coal and coke operations. The company built a research lab in 1945, and the chemicals business expanded to produce plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1960s saw coal energy become unfeasible, so the decision to phase out coal mining came in 1965. With two-thirds of its sales and profits gone, DSM expanded its line of chemicals. It became an unquoted public company in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   DSM replaced its use of coke-oven gas with natural gas and petroleum products to produce chemicals in 1970. After spinning off its fertilizer business to a subsidiary, the company turned its focus to industrial chemicals (plastics and resins). DSM restructured in the 1980s to include a wider variety of fine chemicals. It became publicly traded in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   DSM restructured again and created an engineering plastics products division in Brussels (1990), followed by the creation of three other units (fine chemicals, hydrocarbons, and fertilizers) in 1992. A 1995 joint venture with Jiangsu Jiangyin to make thermoplastic compounds and a 1996 contract with Ford gave DSM access to the automotive market. In 1998 DSM aligned itself with Japan's JSR Engineering Plastics to sell its line of auto, electronic, and connector parts. For the purpose of making semi-synthetic penicillin, DSM entered into a joint venture with China-based Zhang Jia Kou in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 DSM sold its engineering plastics operations to Quadrant Holding for $200 million. The rumors of DSM's possible bid for
   <company id="57376">
    Rhodia
   </company>
   were verified by the existence of such a bid -- which was turned down -- causing controversy among some Rhodia investors. In 2002 DSM sold its petrochemicals business to
   <company id="53868">
    SABIC
   </company>
   for about $2 billion. Later that year the company announced that it would acquire a vitamins and fine chemicals division from
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   , the Swiss-based health care group.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 2000s DSM pared down and restructured many of its operations to control costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   DSM made a strategic decision in 2007 to turn to life sciences and performance materials because the business lines offer better profit margins and more stable revenues than the company formerly had when it disproportionately relied on petrochemicals. To support its strategic focus, DSM not only divested itself of a number of noncore assets, it also made selective acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The shift began to pay off in 2010, with the company rebounding from the global economic downturn. The company's focus on high-margin, high-quality businesses helped shield it from the impact of cyclicality. By cutting costs, working capital, and workforce, and by divesting several businesses, the company was able to reduce its net debt. Although the company's total sales for 2010 improved only slightly, its net income grew more than 33% from the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company, still following its new strategy, acquired the oilseed processing enzymes operations of industrial biotech company Verenium for $37 million. The buy gives DSM certain licenses for enzymes used in the food and beverage markets, including the Purifine brand products and those under development in the oilseed processing market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several divestments in 2010 enabled DSM to concentrate on growing sales in its target business areas: personalized nutrition, specialty packaging, biomedical, and industrial biotechnology. That year the company sold its DSM Agro and DSM Melamine operations to Egypt's Orascom Construction Industries for $416 million. It sold its DSM Special Products unit, which manufactured benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, benzaldehyde, and benzyl alcohol, to Emerald Performance Materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   DSM agreed to sell the last of its citric acid businesses, Citrique Belge, to Adcuram in 2010. It also sold its thermoplastic elastomers business Sarlink to US-based polymer company Teknor Apex, and sold the remaining part of its elastomers unit to LANXESS for $415 million. The sale of its DSM Elastomers unit in December 2010 eliminated its base chemicals and materials operations. It also completed DSM's transformation to a life sciences and materials company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it was busy divesting businesses in 2010, DSM also made key acquisitions and investments that year. They helped it grow both geographically and in product lines, particularly in Asia and North America. It picked up Mitsubishi Chemical's Novamid polyamide business in a no-cash exchange for its Xantar polycarbonate unit. DSM's acquisition of US-based specialty ingredients company Microbia from Ironwood Pharmaceuticals lets it take advantage of Microbia's proprietary platform and research and development capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010, DSM acquired US-based Martek Biosciences for more than $1 billion. Martek makes products from microbial sources that promote health and wellness through nutrition The deal adds a new platform at DSM for polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have applications in the infant formula nutrition market.
  </p>
  <p>
   DSM agreed to form a joint venture with DuPont in 2010 to develop, manufacture, and commercialize advanced surgical biomedical materials. The 50-50 venture will be called Actamax Surgical Materials. It formed another 50-50 joint venture, this time with Sinochem Group, for a biopharmaceutical venture to produce anti-infectives. The joint venture, DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals, is based in Hong Kong and includes all current DSM anti-infectives operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, through a subsidiary, DSM acquired a 51% stake in Taiwan-based AGI Corporation in a share purchase deal worth about $65 million. DSM's US-based subsidiary, DSM Resins, will use AGI's curable resins to strengthen its UV technology platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 DSM acquired Vitatene S.A.U., a Spain-based producer of carotenoids, a naturally occurring fat-soluble pigment that is synthesized by plants, algae, and certain bacteria. The acquisition allows DSM to strengthen the natural carotenoids offerings of its nutrition business as part of its strategy to grow in markets where consumer demand is high.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 JLL Partners and DSM combining DSM Pharmaceutical Products and Patheon Inc. into a new privately held company, named DPx, in which DSM holds a 49% share. That year DSM sold DSM's share in DEXPlastomers V.o.F. to Borealis for €55 million. it also sold the Euroresins business in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland and the Baltic states.
