   The Hershey Company works to inspire Almond Joy and lots of Kisses. As a global leader and North America's top chocolate producer, the company has built a big business manufacturing such well-known chocolate and candy brands as Hershey's, Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups, Twizzlers licorice, and, under license, Mounds candy bar, York peppermint pattie, and Kit Kat wafer bar. Hershey also makes grocery goods, including baking chocolate, chocolate syrup, cocoa mix, cookies, snack nuts, breath mints, and bubble gum. Products from the chocolate king are sold to a variety of wholesale distributors and retailers throughout North America and exported overseas.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's operations consist of two business segments, in which more than 80 name brands are made, marketed, sold, and distributed. Many product types sold under the Hershey's, Kisses, and Reese's names are included in the company's chocolate business unit. Other popular brand franchises -- such as Twizzlers, Mounds, York, Kit Kat, Ice Breakers, and Bubble Yum -- fall within the company's sweets and refreshment business unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hershey also has a retail presence. Referred to as The Hershey Experience, the company's retail operations comprise Hershey's Chocolate World (Hershey, Pennsylvania) and stores in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Niagara Falls (Ontario), Shanghai, Dubai, and Singapore.

  <p>
   Hershey's business focuses on three regions. The US is the company's largest market. The Americas, its second region, consists of Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Central America, Puerto Rico, and global exports. Hershey also operates a third region in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The company markets its products in about 70 countries worldwide. While the US is a top revenue generator, sales outside the US from developing regions have contributed about 17% of its total revenue.

  <p>
   After achieving historic revenue growth over the last few years, Hershey saw its revenues decline marginally from $7.42 billion in 2014 to $7.39 billion in 2015. In addition, its profits plunged 39% from $847 million in 2014 to $513 million in 2015. Cash flow from operations spiked by 44% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hershey in 2015 was affected by volume declines and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, substantially offset by favorable net price realization as well as a benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures. Its drop in profits for 2015 was attributed to increased goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in addition to a spike in business realignment charges.

  <p>
   Hershey's growth strategy includes expanding its snack foods business while continuing to invest in its core confectionery business. The chocolate maker is bolstering its snack food line up to capitalize on US consumers' growing appetite for healthier snacks. With consumers in the US snacking more than in years past, Hershey has begun offering more mixed snack options, including nut, pretzel, and chocolate mixes. The company plans to introduce additional snack categories and may pursue acquisitions of companies that produce protein-based and other types of snacks it hasn't traditionally offered. Hershey also continues to invest in its iconic brands, including Hershey's, Reese's, and Hershey's Kisses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its growth initiatives, the company is also cutting costs to improve profitably, particularly in international markets. In 2017, Hershey announced it was laying off about 15% of its global workforce. The employee reduction, intended to improve operating margins between 2017 and 2019, will affect about 2,700 mostly hourly workers outside of the US.

   , which owns Cadbury. In 2015 it picked up KRAVE Pure Foods, headquartered in Sonoma, California. KRAVE is a manufacturer of KRAVE jerky, an all-natural snack brand of premium jerky products. The transaction allowed Hershey to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further expand into the broader snacks space.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Hershey purchased The Allan Candy Company, a North American manufacturer of confectionery products based in Ontario, Canada. Allan Candy is known across Canada for its iconic confectionery brands, including Allan, Big Foot, Hot Lips, and Laces. More than half of Allan Candy's current manufacturing capacity is used to make Hershey Sweets &amp; Refreshment products such as Jolly Rancher hard candy and Lancaster caramels for North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, Hershey significantly enhanced its Asian footprint when it obtained 80% of Shanghai Golden Monkey Food Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (SGM), a privately held confectionery company based in Shanghai, China. SGM manufactures, markets, and distributes Golden Monkey branded products, including candy, chocolates, protein-based products, and snack foods in China.

   Among its significant customers, wholesale distribution giant

    McLane Company

   accounted for 26% of Hershey's sales in 2015. It's the primary distributor of Hershey products to
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   . Hershey leverages a staff of full-time sales representatives and food brokers to peddle its products to customers. In general the confectionary company counts wholesale distributors, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires, and department stores among its vast customer set. Hershey's distribution network ships its products from its manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers, using common carriers to deliver products from there to customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes a point to launch new versions of old favorites, such as Jolly Rancher lollipops and bite-size bits of chocolate bars. Although chocolate bars take center stage, most recently premium dark varieties, it introduced sugar-free chocolate to tempt the growing number of diabetic and overweight consumers. Moving into the snack aisle, Hershey has rolled out cookies, 100-calorie treats, and granola bars.

  <p>
   The Hershey Company is the legacy of Milton Hershey, of Pennsylvania Dutch origin. Apprenticed in 1872 at age 15 to a candy maker, Hershey started Lancaster Caramel Company at age 30. In 1893, at the Chicago Exposition, he saw a new chocolate-making machine, and in 1900 he sold the caramel operations for $1 million to start a chocolate factory.
  </p>
  <p>
   The factory was completed in 1905 in Derry Church, Pennsylvania, and renamed Hershey Foods the next year. Chocolate Kisses, individually hand-wrapped in silver foil, were introduced in 1907. Two years later the candy man founded the
   <company id="109296">
    Milton Hershey School
   </company>
   , an orphanage; the company was donated to a trust in 1918 and for years existed solely to fund the school. Hershey went public in 1927.
