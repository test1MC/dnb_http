The company's flagship unit is San Miguel Brewery (beer and liquor), while its Pure Food unit manufactures a variety of staples, including meats, dairy products, and coffee.

   Don Enrique Barretto y de Ycaza opened La Fabrica de Cerveza de San Miguel, a brewery, in Manila in 1890. By 1900 the European-styled beers of San Miguel were outselling imported brands five to one. The company became a corporation in 1913. By WWI the brewery was selling beer in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guam.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andres Soriano y Roxas joined San Miguel in 1918 and in the 1920s established the Royal Soft Drinks Plant (1922), the Magnolia Ice Cream Plant (1925), and the first non-US national Coca-Cola bottling and distribution franchise (1927). After WWII, the company added additional facilities and factories as it modernized and expanded.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s the firm changed its name to San Miguel Corporation (SMC). After the death of Andres in 1964, his son Andres Soriano Jr. became president. He decentralized operations into product segments. SMC continued to diversify in the 1970s.
  </p>
  <p>
   A family feud erupted in 1983 when members of the controlling Soriano and Zobel families engaged in a proxy battle. Realizing he couldn't win the proxy fight, Enrique Zobel sold all of his shares (about 20% of SMC) to Eduardo Cojuangco, a Ferdinand Marcos ally and president of United Coconut Planters Bank. Upon Soriano's death in 1984, Cojuangco became chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cojuangco's estranged cousin Corazon Aquino won the 1986 national election, and her government claimed assets associated with Marcos and his followers, including Cojuangco's share of SMC. Cojuangco left the country with Marcos, and Andres Soriano III became CEO. Cojuangco returned to the Philippines in 1989 to reclaim his share of the company. In mid-1998, immediately following Cojuangco-backed Joseph Estrada's election as president of the Philippines, Andres Soriano III stepped down, and Cojuangco returned to SMC's helm.

   SMC sold Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines to Sydney-based
   <company id="89492">
    Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA)
   </company>
   in 1995 in exchange for a 25% stake in CCA. Four years later SMC flirted with plans to sell its interest in CCA, and then went on a buying binge. SMC and a company it majority owns, La Tondeña Distillers, jointly bought Filipino juice maker Sugarland. SMC then bought Australian brewer J. Boag &amp; Son in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Estrada announced the government's plan to sell a 27% stake in SMC, but those plans were altered dramatically after Estrada's ouster in early 2001. His successor, President Gloria Arroyo, said the government would seize 47% of the company's shares controlled by United Coconut Planters Bank (27%) and Cojuangco (20%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, company expansion continued. San Miguel agreed to buy the Philippines' largest processed-meat maker, Pure Foods. The company bought 65% of bottler Coca-Coca Philippines from CCA in July, giving up its stake in CCA as part of the deal. In August 2001 SMC then acquired 83% of rival RFM's Cosmos Bottling, the Philippines' #2 soft drink company, further consolidating its domestic beverage dominance. In September the company transferred its 49% stake in Sugarland to La Tondeña Distillers, which then became the sole owner of the juice maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Japanese brewer Kirin paid $530 million for 15% of San Miguel. Following an announced expansion plan into Asia, San Miguel purchased a Thailand industrial complex for $20 million in September 2003 and Thai Amarit Brewery in April 2004. SMC snapped up a majority stake in Singapore-based ice-cream producer King's Creameries the following year and acquired control of Australia's

   </company>
   for $1.45 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 it sold its 65% stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines to
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   , which had previously owned 35% of the Philippine bottler. The deal was worth $590 million. SMC also sold

    National Foods

   for about $2.6 billion in 2007.
