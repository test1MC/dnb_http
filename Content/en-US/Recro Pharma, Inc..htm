   Recro Pharma is in the business of providing non-opioid treatments for serious pain. The clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical firm is developing pain medications, for use initially in the post-operative setting. By focusing on non-opioid based drugs, Recro expects its products will avoid side effects associated with opioids, including addiction, constipation, and respiratory distress. Its lead product, an intranasal formulation of Dexmedetomidine, or Dex, has completed a Phase Ib placebo controlled trial demonstrating pain relief. Subsequent Dex products will be developed to treat chronic pain and cancer pain. Founded in 2007, the company went public in 2014 with a $30 million offering.
