   The Alumasc Group has gone metallic green. The company still provides die casting and machining services, but most of its business comes from making environmentally sustainable products. Alumasc operates through two main divisions: Building Products (solar shades, green roofs, scaffolding, and homebuilding products) and Engineering Products (precision aluminum components, die casting, and drink dispensing systems). It operates from 12 plants located throughout the UK. The company sells to customers in the automotive, brewery, and residential and non-residential construction industries. Alumasc began operations in 1984.

  <p>
   Alumasc has made the switch to sustainable building products because it believes the growth rate in this sector will outpace the rest of the construction industry. Its energy management products (part of the Building Products division), including solar shading and screening, contribute half of the company's revenue. Water management and house building products (also part of Building Products) contribute another 42%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, the Engineering Products division (8% of revenues) focuses on supplying aluminum and zinc die cast components to industrial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating subsidiaries include Alumasc Exterior Building Products, Doranda, and Euroroof.

  <p>
   The UK is Alumasc's largest single market, bringing in 90% of sales. The company also operates in Europe, North America, the Middle East, the Far East, and other markets.

  <p>
   Revenue, which has been on the rise for the past five years, continued the trend in fiscal 2015 (ended June). That year, revenue rose 10% to £98.1 million, driven by increased sales across all building products. This was partially offset by reduced die casting sales. Higher net sales led to a rise in net income, which has been in recovery ever since crashing in 2012; it rose 8% to £4.4 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations grew 53% to £6.2 million that year.

  <p>
   Alumasc has different strategies in place for its two primary divisions. In Building Products, it intends to focus on organic growth, with selective acquisitions thrown in for good measure. Engineered Products, on the other hand, will be focused on securing more work and increasing operational efficiencies. To further boost its international operations, Alumasc is launching dedicated sales resources in the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its efforts to streamline operations and narrow its focus, the company sold two non-core units (Pendock Profiles and Alumasc Precision Components) in fiscal 2015.
