   Reser's sells its food products nationwide and across Canada, relying on national supermarket chains, independent retail outlets, club stores, and convenience stores to get its products in customers' hands. It also caters to foodservice customers.

   To expand its portfolio of products, Reser's has partnered with Mintel, the School Nutrition Association,

   , and Refrigerated Foods Association.

  <p>
   Having been listed as one of Oregon's largest privately held companies, Reser's has fueled growth over the years by entering new markets through acquisitions and by bulking up its production facility count. In mid-2014, the manufacturer broke ground on its 310,000 square foot salad and specialty food plant and distribution center in Hillsboro, Oregon, which would provide 35% more production capacity than the company's existing two Beaverton plants combined.

  <p>
   The company also works to expand its portfolio of products. In 2013, for example, it introduced side salads across the Canadian market that include Ranch Pasta Salad with Bacon, Potato Salad with Deviled Egg, Homestyle Potato Salad, and Traditional Cole Slaw with Oil and Vinegar. It has been expanding its refrigerated products, as well. Reser's Stonemill Kitchens brand of fresh artisan salads help customers boost sales across their deli departments.

   The company entered the fresh-cut market in 2011 through its purchase of family-owned
   <company id="154220">
    Vaughan Foods
   </company>
   . The more than $18-million deal, which made Vaughan a subsidiary of the company, expanded Reser's portfolio with fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, soups, sauces, prepared salads and salad kits, and side dishes. It also extended the company's reach in the foodservice and retail sales channels. Reser's took ownership of Vaughan's primary manufacturing facility in Moore, Oklahoma, and its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which makes soups and sauces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2011, the company purchased bankrupt rival
   <company id="112702">
    Chef Solutions
   </company>
   in a $69 million deal, acquiring most of Chef Solution's assets and its operating subsidiary, Orval Kent Food Company. Chef Solutions, which makes a variety fresh salads and other refrigerated side dishes for many of Reser's customers, has strengthened Reser's presence in the market for fresh prepared foods.
