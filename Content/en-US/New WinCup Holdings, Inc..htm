   If you've ordered a meal to-go, you may have taken home some New WinCup products, too. A giant producer of foam cups and containers, New WinCup Holdings (WinCup) offers a catalog of bowls, lids, straws, and stock print cups. Quick-service restaurants are among the company's top customers, along with caterers, convenience stores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and institutions.

   Analysts report that the US demand for cups and lids is expected to increase more than 4% annually through 2014, with the foodservice industry being the biggest consumer. WinCup started gearing up to meet the demand in years ago by expanding its Arizona production facility, practically doubling the size of the plant to 322,000 sq. ft.

   While the polystyrene foam cup has been vilified over the last couple of decades, the company stands behind its product as a recyclable code 6 plastic that provides insulation and is recyclable. It claims that foam requires less materials and labor than paper or plastic and is cheaper to produce in the long run. Additionally, foam has many recyclable possibilities including DVD casings, lunch trays, and transport packaging.
