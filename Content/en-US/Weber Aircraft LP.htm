   Airline seats aren't exactly known to be cushy on your tushy, but at least Weber Aircraft keeps safety in mind. The company manufactures commercial aircraft passenger seats for some of the world's most recognized airlines and aircraft OEMs in the industry (think
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   ). Weber puts its seats through rigorous strength, durability, and functionality testing to meet federal safety standards. It also does repairs, overhauls, and upgrades on aircraft interiors. Since 1992 the company has been a subsidiary of France-based Zodiac Aerospace (formerly Groupe Zodiac).
