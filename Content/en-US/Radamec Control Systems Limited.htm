   With equipment from Radamec Control Systems, you can control air and water. At least that air and water that move through pneumatic and hydraulic equipment. The company's electronic control systems and instrumentation are primarily used in the marine industry. The company's gear performs a variety of functions, such as monitoring shipboard machinery for safety and security, controlling propulsion systems, and providing telegraph communications. RCS was formerly a part of Radamec Group, which in 2005 wound up its business operations and returned its equity to shareholders. Radamec Group founder Len Whittaker bought RCS to set it up as a private company.
