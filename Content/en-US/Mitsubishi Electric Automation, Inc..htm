   One strategy for MEAU will always entail the optimizing of its automation products for improved efficiency. Responding to demand within the HVAC market for a drive that can improve efficiency of air movement through HVAC systems, MEAU in 2015 introduced the F800 Series low-voltage variable frequency drive (VFD). The low-voltage F800 is specifically designed and optimized for HVAC applications, including air handlers, cooling towers, and pumps.
