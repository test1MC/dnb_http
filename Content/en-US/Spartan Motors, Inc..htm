   Spartan Motors has built itself on the foundation of its chassis. Founded in 1975, Spartan Motors (through its core Spartan Chassis unit) makes custom chassis for fire trucks, motor homes, and other specialty vehicles, including mine resistant and light armored vehicles for the US military. The company also manufactures emergency vehicles through Spartan USA, which was formed with the 2016 merger of three subsidiaries: Crimson Fire Aerials, Crimson Fire, and

    Utilimaster
   </company>
   . Other operations manufacture chassis and other products to customer specifications for use in the package delivery, one-way truck rental, bakery and snack delivery, utility, and linen and uniform rental sectors.

  <p>
   The company has facilities in Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Indiana. Spartan markets its products throughout the US and Canada as well as select markets in South America and Asia.

  <p>
   Spartan operates through three reportable segments: Emergency Response Vehicles (34% of sales), Delivery and Service Vehicles (41%), and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles (25%).

  <p>
   Spartan markets its products primarily through the direct contact of our sales department with OEMs, dealers and end users to the recreational vehicle (RV), emergency response, government services, defense, and delivery and service markets.

  <p>
   Spartan's revenues reached $550 million in 2015, its highest total in at least six years. However, the company has posted a net loss three out of the last four years. Its most recent loss of $17 million occurring in 2015 was largely the result of the payment of additional taxes and restructuring expenses and consolidation costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty Chassis and Vehicles revenues in 2015 increased by 21%, mainly due to additional demand in motor home chassis as a result of higher unit volume and a spike in other specialty vehicles revenues, largely due to completion of an order for defense vehicles in 2015. The spike in revenues for 2015 was also fueled by an 8% increase in Delivery and Service Vehicles and a 1% increase in Emergency Response Vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spartan's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the last few years; after declining in 2014, it surged by 98% in 2015 mostly due to a large spike in customer deposits throughout the year.

  <p>
   To mitigate its losses, Spartan has been streamlining its organizational structure. In 2015 its former Spartan Motors Chassis subsidiary (which operated its Charlotte, Michigan location) and its former Crimson Fire Aerials subsidiary (which operated its Ephrata, Pennsylvania location) were merged into Spartan USA. In early 2016, its former Utilimaster Corporation subsidiary (which operated its Bristol and Wakarusa, Indiana locations) was also merged into Spartan USA.

  <p>
   Spartan Motors was founded in 1975 by George Sztykiel, a former lead engineer at Chrysler's heavy truck division, along with William Foster, Jerry Geary, and John Knox. Funded with second mortgages, Spartan started by building chassis for customized fire trucks.
