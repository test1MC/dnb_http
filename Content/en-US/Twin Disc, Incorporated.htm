  <p>
   Twin Disc owns two manufacturing, assembly, and office facilities in Racine, Wisconsin; one in Nivelles, Belgium; two in Decima, Italy; and one in Novazzano, Switzerland. The US is Twin Disc's largest market, accounting for more than 40% of sales; the US and Canada together account for more than 45%. The company's largest market outside North America is Italy (about 7% of sales).

  <p>
   Twin Disc markets its products through a direct sales force and a distributor network. It sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government, and industrial markets. The company has roughly 250 distributor sales and service locations in more than 80 countries.

  <p>
   Twin Disc's revenues declined 37% from $266 million in 2015 to $166 million in 2016. Sales for its manufacturing and distribution segments each declined by 39% during 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines were driven by a major reduction in demand for its oil and gas related products in both North America and Asia driven by the extended global decline in oil and natural gas prices. This was also affected by weakening demand in Asia for the company's commercial marine products. Demand from European customers also remained weak, hampered by local economic concerns and an unfavorable currency dynamic for its US produced goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a net loss of $13 million in 2016, its first net loss in at least 10 years. This was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $7.6 million related to its US industrial and European industrial operations. Twin Disc's cash flow from its operating activities also dropped from $17 million in 2015 to nearly $4 million in 2016. This was due to its recent net loss coupled with the goodwill impairment charge and higher stock compensation expenses.

  <p>
   Twin Disc is focused on becoming profitable once again after it suffered a rare net loss of $13 million in 2016. As demand for its oil and gas related products has diminished over the years, the company is focused on its core manufacturing and product development activities aimed at jump-starting growth and profitability.
