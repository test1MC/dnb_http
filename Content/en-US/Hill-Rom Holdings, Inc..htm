   Hill-Rom Holdings holds Hill-Rom Company, which, in turn, holds hospital patients safe and secure. Hill-Rom makes, sells, and rents hospital beds and other patient-room furniture and equipment, along with stretchers, surgical table accessories, and other equipment for lifting and transporting patients. The company also sells non-invasive therapeutic products and surfaces for the care of pulmonary, bariatric, and circulatory conditions and wounds. As most of its beds are designed to connect to patient monitoring equipment, Hill-Rom also provides information technology products for use in health care settings. Its primary customers include worldwide acute and long-term care facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
   Hill-Rom operates four business units: North America Patient Support Systems (NAPSS), International Patient Support Systems (IPSS), Front Line Care, and Surgical Solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   NAPSS sells and rents out speciality frames and surfaces and mobility solutions in the US and Canada. The segment is worth around 41% of global revenue. IPSS conducts much the same activities as NAPSS, but in geographies outside the US and Canada, and is worth 14% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Font Line Care sells and rents respiratory care products, and sells medical diagnostic equipment and devices that assess, diagnose, treat, and manage various illnesses and diseases. The segment brings in 30% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surgical Solutions sells surgical products globally, accounting for 15% of revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Hill-Rom operates a broad network of service centers that includes about 160 in locations across North America and 45 in other regions. The company maintains manufacturing operations in China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, France, Mexico, the UK, Sweden, and the US. It also operates distribution and sales centers across the globe. Its main research and development activities are located in the US in Cary, North Carolina; Acton, Massachusetts; Beaverton, Oregon; Skaneateles Falls, New York; and Batesville, Indiana; and overseas in Montpelier and Pluvigner, France; Lulea, Sweden; Saalfeld, Puchheim and Witten, Germany; and Singapore.

  <p>
   Hill-Rom's sales have been trending upwards in recent years, and in fiscal 2016 climbed a further 36% to $2.7 billion due to the contribution of the acquired Welch Allyn business to the Front Line Care segment. The International Patient Support Systems was down 15%. Net income increased by 160%, or $76.4 billion, to $124.1 million, as higher sales were partially offset by acquisition and integration costs. Cash from operations increased 32% to $281.2 million.

  <p>
   Hill-Rom sees room for future growth in the post-acute care market (long-term care facilities and home care). It has been expanding its post-acute care business via new product launches, distribution agreements, and acquisitions. Another area of growth the company is developing is the sale of products direct to consumers who seek hospital beds for home care settings. To keep its product line ticking over, it introduced the VisiVest system, a wearable high-frequency chest-wall oscillation technology, and Welch Allyn Home Hypertension Program that helps patients monitor their health at home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite already having a solid sales foundation in the bed market, the company has looked to population trends to maintain a leading position. For example, Hill-Rom recognized the opportunity presented by the expanding waistlines of some of the global populace. To address this sector, its bariatric line of products, composed of beds, stretchers, and patient-moving devices, is designed to accommodate, in some cases, patients weighing up to 1,000 pounds. Some of its bariatric products include the TotalCare BariatricPlus bed system for patients up to 500 pounds, as well as a line of bariatric stretchers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to take advantage of the health care industry's move toward digitization, Hill-Rom is expanding its range of health care information technology (HIT) products designed to let hospital staff communicate with patients and with each other, as well as manage patient data more effectively. It has also launched a line of "smart beds" that provide real-time data on patients.

  <p>
   In September 2016, the company acquired Anodyne Medical Devices, a producer of support surfaces (anti-ulcer mattresses) for $25.8 million. The acquisition insources a significant supply chain function, and will have cost and margin benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company paid $2.05 billion for fellow medical equipment maker
   <company id="54678">
    Welch Allyn
   </company>
   . The deal benefited Hill-Rom by adding Welch Allyn's point-of-care diagnostics and testing portfolio. In early 2017, in a move to expand the Welch Allyn business, Hill-Rom acquired private medical device firm Mortara Instrument for $330 million.

  <p>
   In 1906 John A. Hillenbrand, a banker, newspaperman, and general store owner in Batesville, Indiana, bought the ailing Batesville Casket Company (founded 1884) to save it from bankruptcy. Under Hillenbrand, and later his four sons (John W., who succeeded his father as president of the company; William; George; and Daniel), the casket company flourished.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1929 William Hillenbrand established the Hill-Rom Company in Batesville to make hospital furniture. Hill-Rom made its furniture out of wood instead of tubular steel and quickly became a leader in innovative hospital furnishings.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the following decades George Hillenbrand created several patented products for both
   <company id="118577">
    Batesville Casket
   </company>
   and Hill-Rom. By the 1940s, for example, the company had developed corrosion-, air-, and water-resistant metal caskets. George constantly sought ways to improve manufacturing techniques and product quality, giving the company a competitive edge in sales and productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Daniel, the youngest son, became president of Batesville Casket in 1964 and consolidated Batesville Casket and Hill-Rom into Hillenbrand Industries five years later. Hoping to make the company more competitive nationally (and eventually globally), Daniel took Hillenbrand public in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Dominion Metalware Industries (1972) and luggage maker American Tourister (1978; sold to Astrum International, maker of Samsonite luggage, in 1993). In 1984 it bought Medeco Security Locks (sold 1998) and a year later purchased Support Systems International (SSI), provider of specialty rental mattresses for critically ill and immobile patients. (In 1994 SSI was integrated into Hill-Rom.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Hillenbrand founded the Forethought Group in 1985 to provide special life insurance to cover prearranged funerals. In 1991 it entered the European market by acquiring Le Couviour, a French maker of hospital beds. The company also bought Block Medical, a maker of home infusion-therapy products, that year. August Hillenbrand, nephew of Daniel, became CEO in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Batesville Casket set out to consolidate its market, buying casket producer Cormier &amp; Gaudet (Canada). It then bought Bridge Casket (New Jersey), Lincoln Casket (Hamtramck, Michigan); and Industrias Arga (Mexico City), all in 1993. That year Hillenbrand also purchased L &amp; C Arnold, one of the biggest and oldest hospital furniture makers in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the casket market flat in the mid-1990s, Hillenbrand grew its business by going after market share in cremation products.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the 20th century drew to a close, Medicare reimbursement cutbacks bit into Hill-Rom's sales. The company cut jobs in both 2000 and 2001. Those years also brought the retirement of both August and Daniel Hillenbrand. Frederick Rockwood became president and CEO in 2000; Ray Hillenbrand (nephew of Daniel) was named chairman in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hillenbrand sold its piped medical gas unit (to Beacon Medical Products in late 2003) and the Air-Shields infant care products business of Hill-Rom, since those operations were not key to Hill-Rom's success. It acquired Advanced Respiratory, a maker of airway management equipment, in 2003 and
   <company id="12123">
    MEDIQ
   </company>
   , a company that provides medical equipment outsourcing, asset management, and rentals to the health care industry, in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on Hill-Rom and Batesville, Hillenbrand sold its Forethought Financial Services subsidiary in July 2004. As its name suggests, Forethought offered funeral prepayment products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hillenbrand simplified Hill-Rom's structure in 2005, bringing more of its support operations under the parent company and realigning its commercial divisions into two geographically focused units.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rockwood retired as CEO in 2005; Peter Soderberg replaced him the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions of manufacturers and distributors including Medicraft (Australia, 2006) and Liko (Sweden, 2008) have helped the company boost its international presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, following a review of strategic alternatives, the holding company spun off its funeral services business Batesville Casket into a separate, publicly traded company owned by newly created holding company with an old name:
   <company id="159654">
    Hillenbrand
   </company>
   . That separation left Hill-Rom Holdings focused on its remaining operating unit, Hill-Rom. The plans to split apart its two operating units were hatched in 2007 to increase value for shareholders and tighten industry focus for each unit. Leading up to the split, the company boosted its sales force effectiveness. It also focused on product improvements to reduce the side effects of long hospital stays, such as bed sores and infections. It then kick-started its rental business by cutting costs, improving efficiency, and investing in its out-of-date truck fleet, initiatives that paid off in the form of double-digit growth in that business in fiscal year 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolf Classon was the first person outside the Hillenbrand family to take on the role of chairman in 2006. At the same time, Peter Soderberg was appointed CEO and the two men oversaw the major shifts in the company's focus. Soderberg retired in 2010, and
   <company id="10188">
    Baxter International
   </company>
   veteran John Greisch was named as his successor.
