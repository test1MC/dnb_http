   The grass is always greener on The Toro Company's side. The company makes lawn mowers and other such tools for professional and residential turf maintenance. Its suite of products help create, illuminate, and irrigate lawns and landscapes; install, repair and replace underground utilities; and manage ice and snow. Toro Company's products are typically used on golf courses, sports fields, and municipal, residential, and commercial properties. Its lineup includes lawn mowers, sprinklers, trimmers, lighting, and utility vehicles for residential and commercial use. Founded in 1914, Toro's products have been put to work on such prestigious locations as the

  <p>
   The company has two primary business segments: Professional and Residential.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Professional segment, representing some 70% of sales, designs turf, landscape, construction, and agricultural products and markets them worldwide. It also includes professional snow and ice removal equipment. The segment has three product categories: Landscape &amp; Grounds, accounting for around 40% of total company (not segment) revenue; Golf, 25% of revenue; and Ag Irrigation, 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   It serves the landscape contractor equipment market through the Toro and Exmark brands, with products such as zero-turn radius mowers, heavy- and mid-duty mowers, and tree care equipment. Products for the golf course include green, fairway, and rough mowers; sprayers; sprinklers and drip tubing; rollers; aerators; rakes; and controls and sensors that measure soil moisture and salinity. Snow and ice management products are sold under the BOSS brand, and include snow plows, salt and sand spreaders, skid steers, and all-terrain vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rental and specialty products include compact utility loaders, trenchers, stump grinders, and turf renovation products. Underground construction products include directional drills and riding trenchers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toro's Residential arm (about 30% of sales) offers products similar to those of the Professional, but for use on a smaller scale. Brands include Toro, Lawn-Boy, and Pope, and Hayter in the UK. Yard tools include electric, gas and cordless trimmers and blowers, and snow throwers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toro also has a third segment, accounting for 1% of sales, that comprises its US distributorships activities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Toro rings up around three quarters of its sales in the US. The remainder comes from some 90 other countries including, Australia, Canada, and parts of Europe. The company manufactures its products in the US, Mexico, Australia, China, UK, Italy, and Romania. It has sales offices in the US, Belgium, the UK, Italy, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan, China, and Korea.

  <p>
   Toro markets most of its products through approximately 35 domestic and 110 international distributors, as well as a large number of outdoor power equipment dealers, hardware stores, home centers, and mass merchants as well as online in more than 90 countries. The company's residential business is reliant upon
   <company id="11470">
    Home Depot
   </company>
   , which represents slightly more than 10% of net sales. The company has sales offices in about a dozen countries, including China, Japan, Korea, the UK and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Professional segment sells to clients who manage facilities such as golf courses and sports fields, as well as municipal properties and private landscapes. It also sells directly to property owners such as governmental entities and retailers. Its BOSS snow and ice management products are sold through distributors and dealers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marketing channels include television, radio, print, direct mail, email, and digital, online and social media.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Steady mid-single-digit sales growth since 2010 flattened out in fiscal 2016: total revenue of $2.4 billion almost exactly matched the 2015 figure. Unfavorable currency movements impacted on sales, while the segment ratios shifted slightly -- the Professional segment revenue grew 4% and Residential fell 7.8%, to a net neutral effect. The Professional segment was boosted by higher shipments of golf equipment and irrigation products, and more generally by improved product placement and good customer reviews. Residential was hit by lower demand for snow management products, relating to lower snowfall in the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 15% to $231.0 million, at least the fifth consecutive year of increasing profits. A lower cost of input commodities (including steel and resin) and a higher representation of Professional products drove down the cost of sales, improving margins to 36.6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations increased by 53%, or $125.1 million, due to lower net receivables, as more net receivables were financed by Red Iron (the company's joint venture with TCF Inventory Finance).

   The Toro Company was overtaken by
   <company id="10444">
    Deere &amp; Company
   </company>
   in the irrigation products market in 2014, and has responded by investing in the irrigation market in Asia and Eastern and Western Europe. In 2017, it acquired German irrigation equipment manufacturer Regnerbau Calw. Regnerbau Calw sells its products under the Perrot brand, which include retractable sprinklers for sports fields, impact sprinklers and coupling systems for agricultural fields, and rain guns for industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also set internal organic growth goals. It is focused on building the strength and identity of its key brands -- Toro, Exmark, BOSS, Irritrol, Lawn-Boy, Unique Lighting Systems, Pope, and Hayter -- which are marketed to different sectors.

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, Toro acquired the BOSS professional snow and ice management business from privately held Northern Star Industries for $228 million, primarily paid in cash.

  <p>
   Toro -- Spanish for "bull" -- was founded in 1914 as The Toro Motor Company to make engines for The Bull Tractor Company. In 1921 Toro provided a tractor fitted with 30-inch lawn mower blades to replace a horse-drawn grass-cutting machine at a Minneapolis country club, and the modern power mower industry was born. By 1925 Toro turf maintenance machines were used on many of the US's major golf courses and parks, and by 1928 its products were used in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1935. Toro introduced its first walk-behind power mower for consumers four years later. In 1948 the company entered the rotary mower market when it bought Whirlwind. Toro started making snow removal equipment in 1951. With its 1962 purchase of Moist O' Matic, the company's offerings included automatic irrigation for golf courses.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was renamed The Toro Company in 1971.
