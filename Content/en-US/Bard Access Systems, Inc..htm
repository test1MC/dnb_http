   The company's products primarily fall into parent Bard's oncology products segment, which accounted for 27% of the parent organization's sales (or some $812 million) in 2012. The oncology segment has been experiencing healthy growth in recent years; a 6% increase in sales of PICCs and a 2% increase in dialysis access catheters led to an overall 4% rise in revenues for the division in 2012.
