   SCREEN Holdings (formerly Dainippon Screen Manufacturing) isn't what you might think. Its screens are used in manufacturing, not building. The company is one of the world's largest producers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. SCREEN also makes equipment for turning out flat-panel displays and printed circuit boards, and supplies printing hardware and software for newspapers and other publishers. It specializes in equipment that cleans semiconductor wafers, coats them in chemicals during various processing steps, and then etches circuit details onto the wafer. Other operations include logistics, leasing, and printing services.

  <p>
   SCREEN's reportable segments are Semiconductor Equipment, Graphic and Precision Solutions, and Finetech Solutions. The Semiconductor Equipment segment generates two-thirds of the company's revenue. It develops and makes semiconductor production equipment. About 23% of revenue comes from the Graphic and Precision Solutions segment, which makes graphic arts equipment and PCB related equipment. The FT Equipment segment, 10% of revenue, develops, manufactures, and markets production equipment and conducts maintenance services.

   SCREEN's revenue ticked up about 1% in 2015 (ended March) as semiconductor manufacturers increased orders. Orders from semiconductor foundries, however, decreased because of their capital investment cycle. Demand in Japan and Europe drove sales higher in the Graphic and Precision Solutions segment. In the Finetech Solutions (segment, sales of production equipment for high-definition small- and medium-sized LCD panels decreased while sales of equipment for large TV screens rose.

   With higher revenue and lower costs the company's net income increased in 2015.

   SCREEN became a holding company in 2014 with the three segments as its business units. The company is looking beyond its semiconductor base for new markets. One such market is life sciences. It introduced a 3D cell culture scanner in 2013 and followed with a pharmaceutical tablet printer in 2015. The company is pushing product development for inspection and measurement applications and its efforts are nearing commercialization.
