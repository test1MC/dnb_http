   Trevena hopes to make tremendous strides in medicine. The clinical stage biopharmaceutical company's lead candidate is  Phase III oliceridine (TRV130), a non-opiod pain treatment. The firm's platform of biased ligands, including oliceridine, target G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs); Trevena has a couple of similar candidates under development. In 2016 Trevena's former lead program, TRV027 for acute heart failure, did not meet its study targets. The firm then set its sights on oliceridine. Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, who won the Noble Prize in Chemistry for his discoveries, founded the company in 2007 to develop treatments based on his ground-breaking research. Trevena went public in 2014.

   The company raised about $65 million in its IPO. It has used the funds for continued clinical trials and R&amp;D for its drug candidates.

   While Trevena's now-failed candidate, TRV027, targeted heart failure, the rest of its pipeline focuses on pain and other central nervous system issues. Oliceridine is an IV-delivered severe pain medication; the company may seek collaborators for commercializing it outside the US. The next candidate, TRV734, is an oral pain treatment that Trevena believes will deliver the benefits of commonly used oral medications, like oxycodone, but without the side effects. For it, the company plans to seek a partner experienced with developing and commercializing controlled substances but will keep the US marketing rights. Finally, it's researching an oral medication for pain, depression, or Parkinson's disease. Trevena hasn't decided whether to seek partnership for the drug's development but it does intend to retain the commercial rights.

   As a development-stage company, Trevena hasn't seen any real revenue. Since its formation in 2007, it has received a total of about $9.5 million in grant and collaboration revenue (as of December 2013) and is running at an accumulated deficit of $82.3 million. The company expects the losses to continue "over the next several years."

  <p>
   Like most clinical stage pharmaceutical companies, Trevena plans to continue testing and developing its candidates. It's focusing efforts on its three lead candidates for these endeavors. At the same time, the company will be working to set up its sales and marketing organizations to reach the US acute care markets.
