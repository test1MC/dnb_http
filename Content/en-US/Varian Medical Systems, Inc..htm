   Varian Medical Systems positively radiates in electrotherapeutics. The company develops products related to the radiation treatment of cancer. It makes and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and brachytherapy. Varian makes linear accelerators, simulators, and data management software, primarily for cancer radiotherapy. Other cancer treatment offerings include devices for brachytherapy, a treatment that protects healthy tissue through the use of radiation implants. In 2017 Varian spun off its X-ray unit, which makes imaging subsystems and X-ray-generating tubes, into a new public company named Varex Imaging.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Until early 2017 the company divided its primary operations into Oncology Systems (including linear accelerators, informatics software, and treatment simulation and verification equipment) and Imaging Components (such as X-ray tubes, flat panel image detectors, and image processing software). Oncology Systems accounts for about three-quarters of revenues. In early 2017 Varian spun off the Imaging Components operations into a new public company named Varex Imaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Varian's other businesses are Varian Particle Therapy (VPT), which makes devices that use proton beams to treat cancer, and its Ginzton Technology Center (GTC) in Silicon Valley, which conducts R&amp;D for the company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Varian has domestic manufacturing plants in California, Nevada, New York, and Utah; it has additional manufacturing facilities in the UK, China, and Brazil. The US accounts for about 40% of sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's customers include university research and community hospitals, private and governmental institutions, health care agencies, physicians' offices, and cancer care clinics, among others. The largest 10 OEM customers represent more than half of its total Imaging Components segment revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Varian markets its products worldwide through a combination of direct sales forces and independent distributors or resellers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Net revenue has been increasing over the last five years (2012-16).
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended September), net revenue increased by 4% to $3.22 billion due to higher revenue for the Oncology Systems segment. That segment's revenue increased 5%, primarily due to higher product revenue driven by a rise in hardware products and software licenses revenue and an increase in service revenue pushed by strong customer adoption of service contracts (as the warranty period on the TrueBeam systems expire) and by an increased number of customers (as the installed base of its products continues to grow).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been relatively flat for the last five years. In fiscal 2016, net income decreased by 2% to $402.3 million due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses and separation costs. Those expenses increased as the result of a rise in legal expenses and employee-related compensation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash inflow decreased 24% to $356.3 million compared to fiscal 2015.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2016 the company focused on accelerating the momentum of its proton business and expanding the global reach of its Oncology Systems business. Early the following year Varian spun off its Imaging Components segment into a new company named Varex Imaging. That transaction allows Varian to focus on its cancer and proton therapy operations while Varex works to build up its portfolio of imaging components and software.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to domestic sales, Varian is working to grow sales abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company announced plans to expand its operations in Atlanta, where it had recently acquired cancer software developer Velocity Medical Solutions. Varian's Atlanta center now operates as its East Coast hub and features a customer visit facility.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Varian acquired Candela, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Poland. The acquisition allows the company to improve access to advanced care for cancer patients in Poland.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Varian also bought MeVis (a public company based in Bremen, Germany, that provides image processing software and services for cancer screening) for $25.5 million. MeVis was integrated into the company's Imaging Components unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company now plans to buy the medical imaging business of
   <company id="10490">
    PerkinElmer
   </company>
   for $276 million. That purchase, which is expected to close after the spinoff of Varian's imaging business to the newly formed Varex, will expand Varex's digital flat-panel operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Varian bought Netherlands-based Claymount, which supplies components and subsystems for X-ray imaging equipment manufacturers. Its own Netherlands-based unit paid some â‚¬50 million for the company, thereby extending its manufacturing capabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2012 Varian set up its first education center in Tokyo, to train radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and technologists who work with Varian's cancer treatment systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also grows its operations through partnerships and acquisitions. In 2012 the company partnered with
   <company id="103808">
    Siemens Healthcare
   </company>
   to market and represent image-guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery products, and to develop software interfaces between its own treatment systems and those of Siemens.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it's looking for growth in all areas, the company is really counting on its ProBeam proton therapy to boost sales. It believes the system delivers more effective therapy more cost-effectively. In 2013 it signed a research agreement with the Paul Scherrer Institute to evaluate proton therapy in treating lung, liver, pancreatic, and breast cancers.
