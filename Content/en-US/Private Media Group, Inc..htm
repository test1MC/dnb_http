  <p>
   Berth Milton, Sr., began publishing
   <i>
    Private
   </i>
   magazine in Sweden in 1965. The periodical began as a softcore publication, but Milton was featuring extreme hardcore photographs by the fifth issue. (
   <i>
    Private
   </i>
   is widely considered the world's first legal hardcore sex magazine.) The company focused strictly on adult magazines until 1991 when Berth Milton, Jr., bought out his estranged father.
  </p>
  <p>
   The younger Milton led the company into new areas of operations, including videos in 1992 and CD-ROMs in 1995. Also in 1995 the firm began licensing its name for use on adult products such as condoms, dolls, lotions, and playing cards, and began developing adult video games. (Its PornTris -- an unrelated and decidedly more risqu√© version of traditional favorite Tetris -- rewards players not with points but with glimpses of pornographic movies.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Through a reverse acquisition of Electric Entertainment International, the company's stock debuted in the US on the OTC Bulletin Board in 1997. It also took the Private Media Group name that year and launched into cyberspace with the introduction of flagship Web site private.com. Private Media expanded beyond porn the following year with the establishment of a clothing line (Private Circle; sold in 2001). Also in 1998 the company produced its first DVDs and began hawking its adult wares on a Swedish television home shopping network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Milton -- who had served in various roles throughout the years, from advisor and director to company secretary -- was appointed CEO in 1999. Private Media's stock also debuted on the Nasdaq exchange that year. In addition, the company strengthened its Web operations by launching sites devoted to videos and live entertainment and entered a joint venture with Penthouse (now
   <company id="43851">
    FriendFinder Networks
   </company>
   ) to develop softcore and hardcore videos. In 2000 it announced a two-year agreement to provide film content for use by television networks operated by
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Private Media launched PrivateCasino.com, an online gaming site, in 2001. (The operation was re-launched in 2005 under a licensing agreement.) It also launched a third joint-venture adult TV channel, Private Girls, with the UK's Zone Vision (now
   <company id="135240">
    Chello Zone
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Poor economic and market conditions forced the company to shelve a proposed secondary offering in 2002, but Private Media continued to expand its operations. The company opened its first Private Clothing (formerly Private Circle) fashion boutique on Los Angeles' chic Melrose Avenue. It also offered to acquire the defunct MP3 trading service Napster for $2.4 million. (The infamous online brand was eventually sold for $5 million to software firm Roxio, which later changed its name to
   <company id="102418">
    Napster
   </company>
   .) Milton became chairman that same year and was replaced as CEO by former
   <company id="92229">
    Commerzbank
   </company>
   executive Charles Prast. Milton returned as CEO in 2003 after Prast left the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2003 Private Media began offering a video-on-demand (VOD) service able to bring DVD-quality movies to computer desktops. It additionally began offering access to online content and commerce to cell phones and PDAs. Late in 2003, Private Media consolidated its broadcasting partnerships and began distributing its channels in the US. Shuttering Private Girls, it launched Private Fantasy the following year through an agreement with EchoStar.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 it joined with US-based
   <company id="11194">
    Playboy Enterprises
   </company>
   to merge the Private Gold and Spice Premium channels to form Private Spice, a channel operated by Playboy in Europe. The company also re-launched the Private Blue channel in the UK through a partnership with Portland Television Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Milton stepped down as CEO in 2009 (he remained as president and chairman) and was replaced by Ilan Bunimovitz who previously ran Private Media's online content division. Bunimovitz left the position after only a year and Milton returned as CEO.
