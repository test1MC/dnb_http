   CSR's recipe for business mixes building materials and aluminum with a hint of sugar. Founded in 1855 as a sugar company, CSR has since become one of Australia's leading manufacturer of construction materials such as insulation, plasterboard, roof tiles, and concrete. Its Viridian division is the country's largest glass manufacturer. CSR rounds out its operations with a 36% stake in the Tomago aluminum smelter and property holdings dedicated to land development of former industrial sites. The company runs about 35 building materials manufacturing plants in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.

  <p>
   CSR's operations are divided into the four segments of Building Products (58% of total sales), Aluminum (26%), Glass (15%), and Property (1%).

   Edward Knox, an ambitious 35-year-old businessman, founded the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) in 1855 after buying some of the assets of the defunct Australasian Sugar Company and the Brisbane House sugar refinery in Sydney. Two years later, in 1857, CSR formed a joint venture -- the Victoria Sugar Company -- to refine sugar and distill molasses in Port Melbourne. A financial crisis struck the world's sugar trade that year, and Knox countered by adding sugar milling to the company's operations. By 1869 CSR had built a number of mills in northern New South Wales.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the purchase of a small freighter -- the SS Keera -- in 1873, CSR entered the coastal shipping business. The next year Victoria Sugar Company's refinery in Melbourne burned down and was quickly replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon thereafter Knox turned the company over to his son Edward William Knox. In 1882 CSR began its first foreign project, a mill in Fiji. The next year the company formed the New Zealand Sugar Company, a joint venture with various business interests in New Zealand. CSR went public in 1887 and the next year merged with New Zealand Sugar Company, establishing itself as a leader in the Australian sugar industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1930s brought worldwide depression and a downturn in the sugar market. Edward William Knox retired in 1933 and died four months later. Edward Ritchie Knox, his son, took control during this turbulent time. As WWII approached, CSR began turning sugar cane fiber into wallboard. During the war the government forced the company to reduce sugar production and manufacture war-related materials. In 1942 CSR began mining asbestos in western Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the war the company expanded its building materials business by purchasing Fletcher Holdings, a New Zealand-based construction and timber company, and by adding new product lines such as plasterboard. CSR expanded its building materials operations during the 1950s and in 1959 bought the Bradford Insulation Group to gain a major share of the insulation market.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSR began mining iron ore in western Australia in 1964. Just five years later the company bought Wunderlich (sold in 1983), a maker of architectural metal products, asbestos, cement products, and roof tiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company increased its involvement in mining and oil and gas projects during the 1970s but sold its Fijian sugar mills to the Fijian government in 1972. The next year the company changed its name to CSR Limited.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just as the mineral boom of the 1970s crashed in the early 1980s, sugar prices plummeted, leaving the company vulnerable to a possible takeover. Bryan Kelman took control of the company in 1983 and restructured it in 1985. In 1987 CSR began to shift away from producing resources and toward manufacturing. Between 1987 and 1989 the company sold more than $2 billion of its resource assets and reinvested these monies in manufacturing and sugar operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   CSR continued to expand during the 1990s, buying three US-based building materials companies in 1996. By 1998, when Peter Kirby became CSR's managing director, the US market accounted for more than 30% of CSR's revenues. That year the company also bought out the Kuok Group, which held interests in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.
  </p>

   The company exited the timber business in 2000. In 2001 CSR trimmed its investment in the aluminum business, selling a portion of its stake in Gove Aluminium Finance to Alcan Aluminium (now
   <company id="42408">
    Alcan Inc.
   </company>
   ), although CSR kept its stake in the Australian aluminum smelter Tomago. In late 2002 CSR and joint venture partner
   <company id="41784">

   (UK) merged their cement operations with Queensland Cement, a subsidiary of

    LafargeHolcim
   </company>
   . CSR owns 25% of the new company, which is Australia's largest cement maker.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 CSR Limited's heavy building materials division, Rinker Group Limited (now
   <company id="126601">
    CEMEX Australia
   </company>
   ), demerged from CSR and began trading on the

    NYSE

   and
   <company id="156140">
    Australian Stock Exchange

   . It reduced CSR's size by about 25%.
