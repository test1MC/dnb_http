   Emerson Electric makes a slew of electrical, electromechanical, and electronic products, many of which are used to control gases, liquids, and electricity. Its InSinkErator unit is a maker of food waste disposers and hot water dispensers. Emerson gathers its business units and divisions under four chief business segments: process management, industrial automation, climate technologies, and commercial and residential solutions. It has more than 200 manufacturing locations, with about 135 outside of the US. International markets make up about 50% of Emerson's sales.

  <p>
   The company operates through four primary segments. Process management (roughly 40% of total sales) provides products and services for precision measurement, control, monitoring, and other functions for oil and gas reservoirs, power plants, and plants for processing products that include food and paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emerson's industrial automation operations (14%) provide products that aid the manufacturing process, including motors, fluid controls, and materials joining equipment. Climate technologies (26%) offers products and services for residential heating and cooling, commercial air conditioning, and commercial and industrial refrigeration. Finally, commercial &amp; residential solutions, its smallest segment 11%), sells professional tools, commercial storage products, food waste disposers, and appliances such as ceiling fans and compact electric water heaters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Across all segments the company has dozens of brand names, including AMS, ASCO, Bettis, Dixell, Fisher, Go Switch, KATO, Therm-O-Disc, and White-Rodgers. Consumer brands include ClosetMaid, InSinkErator, and ProTeam.

  <p>
   North America is Emerson's largest market, representing 52% of its total sales. Asia generates 20% of its revenue, while Europe accounts for 16%. Other targeted markets include Latin America (6%), and the Middle East and Africa (6%). The company has 200 manufacturing locations worldwide and a marketing presence in more than 150 countries. Of this amount, 135 are located outside the US.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a variety of distribution channels including its direct sales force, a network of independent sales representatives, and distributors to end-users and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Emerson serves industries such as oil and gas, pulp and paper, chemicals, power, food and beverage, and life sciences.

  <p>
   Emerson's revenues have declined the last two years, falling 35% from $22.3 billion in 2015 to $14.5 billion in 2016. Profits also plunged 40% from 2.71 billion to $1.64 billion in 2016. (Note: the company restated its 2015 annual report due to discontinued operations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The chief reason for the declines in 2016 was the absence of revenue from several divested operations. In tandem with the divestitures, process management declined by 12% during 2016 as climate technologies dipped by 2%. In addition, the decline in profits was due to the absence of gains on divestitures that the company incurred the previous year.

  <p>
   Emerson has a history of achieving growth through acquisitions and by divesting underperforming, non-core units. In early 2015, Emerson sold its power transmission solutions operations to
   <company id="12280">
    Regal Beloit
   </company>
   for $1.44 billion. In addition, the company sold its InterMetro commercial storage business to Ali Group of Italy for $411 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taking this strategy even further, Emerson sold its network power segment for $4 billion in late 2016 to
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity
   </company>
   and a group of co-investors. The company made the move to streamline its operations and focus on its remaining four core segments.

  <p>
   In the summer of 2016, Emerson announced it was buying
   <company id="14396">
    Pentair
   </company>
   's Valves &amp; Controls business for $3.15 billion. The complementary acquisition will establish Emerson's global presence in control, isolation, pressure relief valves and actuation as part of a larger strategy to build a broader automation product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout all of 2016, Emerson acquired six businesses. Of this total, four were integrated into its process management segment's final control and measurement devices operations and two were combined with its climate technologies segment.

  <p>
   Emerson Electric was founded in 1890 in St. Louis by brothers Alexander and Charles Meston, inventors who developed uses for the alternating-current electric motor, which was new at the time. The company was named after former Missouri judge and US marshal John Emerson, who financed the enterprise and became its first president. Emerson's best-known product was an electric fan introduced in 1892. Between 1910 and 1920 the company helped develop the first forced-air circulating systems.
