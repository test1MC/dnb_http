   This company's racket is structural steel storage systems. Frazier Industrial Co. is a leading manufacturer of structural, as opposed to roll-formed, steel storage racks at nearly a dozen production centers located across the US, Canada, and Mexico. These facilities can adapt production to demand and receive just-in-time delivery of raw materials. Customers use Frazier Industrial's storage racks in warehouses, factories, farms, and other industrial and commercial facilities. Among the company's storage products is the Glide 'N Pick pallet cart that automatically rolls out for greater ease in retrieving items. Frazier Industrial is owned by CEO William Mascharka.

   Frazier Industrial is taking a stand for environmentally sound business practices as green initiatives become a focal point for customers. To this end, Frazier sources all of its steel sections from North American mini-mills, which only use recycled scrap material. Fittingly, all of Frazier Industrial's scrap raw material is fully recyclable. Because the company receives preformed structural sections, energy output is minimal; these structural parts require only cutting, punching, and welding. The location of Frazier Industrial's production centers helps to keep travel time and fuel expenses to a minimum. They are all within 400 miles of the company's raw material suppliers and within 500 miles of major North American population centers.

   In 2013 the company launched a semi-automated, high-density pallet mole system across North America. The pallet mole system, a specific material handling technology, maximizes available floor space, enabling customers to store pallets up to 6-high and 50 positions deep, while measurably increasing warehouse productivity.
