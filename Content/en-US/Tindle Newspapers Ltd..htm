   Small newspapers and other publications are big business for Tindle Newspapers. The publisher regularly acquires, develops, and owns more than 220 titles of regional weekly and monthly publications in the UK and US. Altogether, the group's publications boast an audited weekly circulation of more than 1.4 million. Through its Internet Today unit, Tindle Newspapers also offers community-specific news, information, and advertising on the Internet. The company, which was founded in 1974, has grown steadily and significantly through acquisitions. Chairman Ray Tindle, who owns the company, entered the newspaper business in the late 1940s using a small sum he received after serving in the army.

   Tindle Newspapers, though its aggressive acquisition strategy, now generates a turnover of more than Â£50 million. On the heels of its biggest advertising sales and highest circulation of the year in mid-2012, Tindle Newspapers launched seven new hyperlocal titles for Streatham, Brixton, Wimbledon, Wandsworth, Dulwich, Deptford &amp; Cross, and Forest Hill &amp; Sydeham. Including these additions, Tindle Newspapers has created 17 new titles during the recession.
