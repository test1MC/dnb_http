   Hooker Furniture wants to sell you the pieces that will turn your house into a home. The company offers hardwood and metal furniture, including wall units, home office items, home theater cabinets, living and dining room tables, bedroom furniture, and accent pieces. Its youth furniture is sold under the Opus Designs by Hooker label. Hooker Furniture's popular Bradington-Young line of residential upholstered furniture features leather reclining chairs and sofas. The furniture manufacturer's Sam Moore unit makes high-end chairs. Hooker Furniture's products are sold through specialty shops (

   ) and department stores (

   ). Hooker Furniture was founded in 1924.

  <p>
   Hooker's operating segments, casegoods (wood and metal furniture) and upholstery, account for roughly two-thirds and a third of sales, respectively. The upholstery segment includes the company's leather seating business Bradington-Young, and chair, settee, and sectionals maker Sam Moore furniture. It also houses Opus Designs, Hooker's youth bedroom lines division.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company imports all of its wood furniture, primarily purchased from China, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, and Vietnam. The furniture is sent to market through the company's half-dozen distribution centers located in the US and China. Hooker also operates one furniture showroom in High Point, North Carolina.

  <p>
   Virginia-based Hooker Furniture generates more than 95% of its sales domestically. The company employs about 800 people in Virginia and North Carolina. In addition to factories in Bedford, Virginia and Hickory, North Carolina the company imports wood and some leather furniture from factories in Asia (China, Indonesia, Vietnam), Mexico, and Central America.

  <p>
   After a rough patch during the Great Recession and housing crisis, Hooker Furniture is showing signs of life. The company reported sales of $228.3 million in fiscal 2014 (ended January), an increase of nearly $10 million or 4.5%, versus the prior year. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher average selling prices on both casegoods and upholstered furniture, partially offset by higher discounting and returns and allowances in the casegoods business. Net income declined 8% year over year to $7.9 million due primarily to start-up costs for Hooker's two new businesses: H Contract, which furnishes upscale senior living facilities; and Homeware, a direct-to-consumer e-commerce operation. Despite the positive news that Hooker's sales have risen in three of the past four years, the $228.3 million the company rang up in fiscal 2014 is well below Hooker's record high of $350 million achieved in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations has been erratic -- posting large swings -- over the past four years. In fiscal 2014 (ended January) cash generated from operations totaled $5.7 million, compared with negative cash flow of $3.3 million in fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   Optimistic about the health of the broader economy (housing, job growth, and the stock market), growing consumer confidence, and improving retail conditions, Hooker is planning for growth by expanding its domestic upholstery capacity, warehousing and distribution in both the US and Asia, and capital spending on information systems. The company sees potential for its two new businesses -- H Contract and Homeware -- targeting Millennials and Baby Boomers seeking senior living options.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new H Contract product line supplies upholstered seating and casegoods to upscale senior living facilities, while the Homeware product line offers direct-to-consumer, customer-assembled, modular upholstered and casegoods products designed for younger and more mobile furniture customers (think

   ).
  </p>

   Hooker Furniture continues to focus on expanding the number of brand names and product categories it offers furniture retailers. To cater to a younger, more frugal customer, the company makes Envision furniture. Its youth design category was expanded through its purchase of kids furniture manufacturer Opus Designs in a deal valued at more than $5 million and builds on its acquisition of upholstered seating firm Bradington-Young. From its purchase of

   In February 2016, Hooker Furniture made its largest ever acquisition in buying

    Home Meridian International
   </company>
   (HMI). The $100 million-acquisition more than doubled Hooker's sales volume, making it one of the top five furniture suppliers in the US furniture market. The combined companies annual revenues would be in excess of $550 million.
