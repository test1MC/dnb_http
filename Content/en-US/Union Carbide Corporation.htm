   Union Carbide Corporation makes the legos of the chemicals world. The company, a subsidiary of
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   , turns out building-block chemicals such as ethylene and propylene, which are converted into widely used plastics resins, primarily polyethylene. The chemical company is also a leading producer of ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol used to make polyester fibers and antifreeze, respectively. Union Carbide makes solvents and intermediates (such as oxo aldehydes and esters), vinyl acetate monomer, water-soluble polymers, and polyolefin-based compounds.

  <p>
   End-users include companies engaged in the manufacture of paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture and oil and gas products.

  <p>
   Union Carbide has operations in Bound Brook, New Jersey; Greensburg, Louisiana; Houston; Seadrift, Texas; St. Charles, Lousisiana; Texas City, Texas; and in West Virginia.

  <p>
   The company primarily produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some of these materials are high-volume commodities, while others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller market niches.
  </p>
  <p>
   Union Carbide participates in partnerships and joint ventures and licenses some of its technologies. It owns 50% of Japan's Nippon Unicar Company, which manufactures polyethylene and specialty polyethylene compounds. Union Carbide also holds a 50% stake in US-based Univation Technologies, which develops and licenses polyethylene process technology and related catalysts.

  <p>
   Unon Carbide's revenues increased by 7% in 2011 as average selling prices for all products increased in response to significantly higher feedstock and other raw material costs, with ethylene glycol, polypropylene and vinyl acetate monomer products reporting the most significant price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by 41% in 2011 caused by a significant rise in feedstock and other raw material costs combined with a softening of demand and an increase in supply as off-line industry capacity returned to operations. Other factors included an increase in research and development expenses as result of a strategic realignment of research and development resources, and a decrease in interest income due to a lower outstanding note receivable with parent
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   , combined with lower interest rates.

  <p>
   As part of Dow Chemical's plan to exit its global polypropylene business  to raise cash and to focus on its core businesses, in 2012 the parent company sold its polypropylene manufacturing facility in Seadrift, Texas; railcars; inventory; business know-how; and certain product and process technology.

   Dow Chemicals acquired Union Carbide in 2001. Union Carbide has faced major litigation stemming from the Bhopal disaster in India (1984) and more recently by a landslide of asbestos claims.

  <p>
   Union Carbide Corporation traces its origins back to two chemical companies: National Carbon Company (founded in 1886), a manufacturer of carbons for streetlights and the originator of the Eveready trademark, and Union Carbide (founded in 1898), a producer of calcium carbide. In 1917 the two companies -- along with Linde Air Products (oxygen), Prest-O-Lite (calcium carbide), and Electro Metallurgical (metals) -- joined to form Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corporation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Union Carbide began establishing subsidiaries in Canada in 1919 and expanded overseas in 1925 with the purchase of a Norwegian hydroelectric power plant. UCC moved into chemical manufacturing and in 1920 established its own chemicals division, which developed ethylene glycol (antifreeze), eventually marketed as Prestone. UCC continued to grow with the purchases of Acheson Graphite (1928) and Bakelite (an early developer of plastics, 1939).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1940s UCC entered the atomic field and ran the US government's nuclear laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and in Paducah, Kentucky, until 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   UCC changed its name to Union Carbide Corporation in 1957. In the early 1960s the company introduced Glad plastic household products (sold 1985).
  </p>
  <p>
   Union Carbide built a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1975 and kept 51% ownership (giving 49% to Indian companies). The world's worst recorded industrial accident occurred in 1984 when a tank at the plant leaked five tons of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas. More than 20,000 people have died from the accident and some 120,000 suffer from related injuries. Resulting legal action against Union Carbide led to a $470 million settlement in India's Supreme Court in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1985 GAF (chemicals and roofing materials) tried to take over Union Carbide. In response, the company went $3 billion into debt to buy back 55% of its stock and defeat the attempt. The next year, to pay down its debt, Union Carbide sold its battery division (including Eveready), its agricultural products business, and its home and auto products business to concentrate on three core businesses: chemicals and plastics, industrial gases, and carbon products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spun off its industrial gases unit,
   <company id="15758">
    Praxair
   </company>
   , to shareholders in 1992. The next year Union Carbide was named as a defendant in silicone breast-implant litigation because it had supplied silicone to implant makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 Union Carbide set up a European joint venture with an Elf Aquitaine (now
   <company id="12393">
    TOTAL
   </company>
   ) operation to make specialty polyethylene resins. High raw-material costs coupled with weak prices on key products hurt the company in 1996, yet it still found the resources to buy the polypropylene business and assets of
   <company id="41841">
    Shell Oil
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Union Carbide pursued partnerships in the late 1990s that included a joint venture with Exxon (now
   <company id="10537">
    Exxon Mobil
   </company>
   ) and Univation Technologies to make low-cost polyethylene. Despite the economic downturn in Asia, Union Carbide planned to build a petrochemical plant in Malaysia with local oil and gas firm
   <company id="57058">
    Petronas
   </company>
   (1998). The big news in 1999, however, was the announcement that Dow Chemical was buying Union Carbide for $9.3 billion. News of the merger prompted representatives of Bhopal victims to file a lawsuit accusing Union Carbide of avoiding criminal prosecution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow completed its acquisition of Union Carbide in February 2001 after agreeing to divest some of its polyethylene operations to satisfy regulators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Union Carbide had been a 50% owner (with
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   's
   <company id="104856">
    Specialty Materials
   </company>
   business) of joint venture
   <company id="107124">
    UOP
   </company>
   , which licenses technology and sells catalysts to the refining industry. Dow sold that half of the JV to Honeywell for $825 million in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Dow sold Union Carbide's stakes in the OPTIMAL Group of companies to joint venture partner
   <company id="57058">
    PETRONAS
   </company>
   . The OPTIMAL Group consisted of two 50-50 joint ventures between Union Carbide and PETRONAS and one more in which
   <company id="47910">
    Sasol
   </company>
   also owned a share; they made a variety of basic and petrochemicals. Dow and Union Carbide gained $660 million from the sale.
