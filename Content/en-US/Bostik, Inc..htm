   Bostik knows how to stick the landing, and a lot of other things. The company is one of the world's largest makers and marketers of adhesives and sealants. They are used in building construction and renovation for tiling, floor covering, and waterproofing. Performance adhesives are used for packaging, product assembly, and industrial laminations. Its nonwovens division makes adhesives for disposable consumer goods like diapers, feminine hygiene products, and medical supplies, as well as for tapes and labels. Bostik serves the automotive and transportation sectors with adhesives and sealants for vehicle and component. Specialty chemicals maker

  <p>
   Arkema's acquisition of Bostik is part of its strategy to reinforce its position in specialty chemicals and further develop products in its high performance materials segment.
  </p>

  <p>
   Bostik has 51 production units in Europe, North America and Asia, operations in 40 countries, and three regional R&amp;D Centers. The company's facilities in France are located in Avelin, Venette, Colmar, Coubert, Privas, Rib√©court, and Sainville.

   Bostik makes and markets adhesives and sealants worldwide, and leverages three main proprietary technologies to support its leadership positions and generate 60% of sales. These technologies (and main focus of its R&amp;D efforts) are elastic bonding (primarily for hardwood flooring adhesives, sealants, and transportation bonding); hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives (HMPSAs, primarily used in packaging and baby diapers); and polymer-modified binders (adhesives and coating for construction, based on formulated hydraulic binders).

   The company targets three major markets -- industry, construction, and consumer.

  <p>
   Following its acquisition by Arkema, Bostik is looking reinforce its offering in the insulation and construction markets, and speed up its growth in emerging countries, especially in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support evolving trends, the company is focused on developing new products that further diversify its already broad portfolio. In addition to traditional adhesives and sealants aimed at professional tradespeople in the industrial, commercial, and residential markets, it offers zero-solvent adhesives geared towards the green building market and adhesives geared towards the do-it-yourself consumer market. Part of Bostik's strategy is to become a household name among homeowners, particularly in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Bostik opened a new production site and a training center in Dallas.

  <p>
   To broaden sales in its Consumer and Construction Business, Bostik acquired StarQuartz Industries in 2011. StarQuartz manufactures premixed urethane grout technology under the brands QuartzLock2 and StarGlass Translucent Grout.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also decided to consolidate its R&amp;D operations from multiple facilities to an R&amp;D site at the Bostik Americas Corporate Center in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. The site serves as a global R&amp;D center for the company's hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bostik was founded in the US in 1889 as the Boston Blacking Company, a maker of shoe adhesives. It set up in France in the early 1950s and became a French company in 1990.
