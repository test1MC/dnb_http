   A stitch in time may save nine; it may also secure the bottom line of American &amp; Efird (A&amp;E). The company manufactures and distributes industrial sewing and embroidery threads, and engineered yarns. Its products are used by both consumers and OEMs of apparel, automotive materials, home furnishings, and medical supplies. In addition to threads and yarns, the company distributes cords, notions, twines, zippers, and related supplies made by other companies such as

   The thread-maker's sales are driven mainly by demand for its industrial sewing thread used in apparel manufacturing. Although the industrial thread portfolio is used in a diversity of applications, A&amp;E's customer base is competitive and consumer-sensitive. Going forward, A&amp;E is aggressively expanding its foreign production and distribution activities by purchasing other manufacturers, entering joint ventures, and launching start-up businesses.
