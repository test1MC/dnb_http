   Suffering from a broken heart? Thoratec's there for the rebound. The company, a world leader in mechanical circulatory support, makes ventricular assist devices (VAD) for patients suffering late-stage heart failure, including those awaiting a heart transplant. Thoratec offers external and implantable products that provide circulatory support for both acute and long-term needs. Its products are sold under the HeartMate, CentriMag, and Thoratec brands. The company works closely with hospitals and cardiac surgery centers primarily in the US and Europe.

  <p>
   Treatments for late-stage heart failure are limited, with a heart transplant typically serving as the only long-term option. While the Thoratec VAD products help many patients manage their heart disease while awaiting a transplant (known as bridge-to-transplantation or BTT), its HeartMate LVAS (left ventricular assist system) products -- including the XVE and the II -- are the only VAD devices with
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval as a permanent treatment (other than medication) for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Such patients -- known as destination therapy patients -- account for half of US transplant volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's devices have been implanted in more than 20,000 patients worldwide. To meet the full range of heart failure patients' needs, Thoratec also makes and distributes the CentriMag and PediMag/PediVAS product lines for temporary acute circulatory support in hospitalized patients. In addition, it provides support services to clinicians and patients, including software programs that provide device monitoring and assistance capabilities.

  <p>
   Thoratec operates worldwide and has facilities in California and Massachusetts, as well as in Switzerland and the UK. The company has more than 300 global centers (located within hospitals and surgery centers) for administration of its HeartMate II devices.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Thoratec's products are sold to hospitals and other care centers through a direct sales force, as well as through its clinical specialists and market development managers. The company also uses distribution partners in select international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses in 2012 were $5.9 million, up from $4.3 million the previous year. Promotional efforts include direct marketing, medical journal advertising, and educational seminar participation.

  <p>
   Continuing with its multiyear growth trend, the company reported a revenue increase of 16% to $492 million in 2012, primarily due to increased sales of its HeartMate and CentriMag products; the increases were attributed to higher volumes of HeartMate transplants for destination therapy patients and incremental CentriMag revenue increases generated by the Levitronix acquisition. Overall revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of the Thoratec product line due to cannibalization by the HeartMate product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   After several years of profit growth, Thoratec's net income dropped by 22% to $56 million in 2012 due to higher sales, general, administrative, and R&amp;D expenses.

  <p>
   Thoratec engages in a number of research and development efforts to stay on the cutting edge of medical technologies and keep ahead of the competition. The company's programs focus on developing new products and upgraded versions of existing products, as well as on gaining new indication approvals for existing product versions. Thoratec is designing a next-generation HeartMate III device, as well as a miniaturized version (the HeartMate X) and a percutaneous heart pump (PHP) for unstable heart-failure patients. Its product enhancement activities include efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of its therapies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Thoratec pursues growth through the formation of strategic ventures and alliances, as well as occasional acquisitions. It also works to expand its network of heart center partners (which conduct the implant procedures) -- including facilities in new geographic territories -- and to increase clinician and patient education programs.

  <p>
   In late 2012 Thoratec ensured the continued supply of replacement accessories and driveline dressing supplies for customers using its Heartmate II system by acquiring certain assets of CFK Cardiac Technologies for some $3 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired Levitronix Medical, the medical business of Levitronix LLC, for about $150 million. The deal added the CentriMag product lines and solidified Thoratec's position as the leading, full-line provider of mechanical circulatory support products for both acute and chronic needs.
