   The word for "healthy" in Portuguese is sadia, which seems appropriate for a Brazilian producer entrenched in the aisles of chilled and frozen foods. Sadia -- one of Brazil's largest pork, poultry (chicken and turkey), and beef makers -- supplies some 70,000 domestic and 200 export customers. Its dozen or so plants churn out more than 1.3 million tons of protein-based offerings, including processed foods (frankfurters and sausages), as well as frozen convenience foods (such as hamburger patties, pizzas, and ready-to-eat meals). The company's other products include frozen desserts, pasta, and margarine. Founded in 1944, Sadia has operated as a subsidiary of

   (once known as Perdigão) since 2009.

   In 2005 Sadia acquired Brazilian chicken-slaughtering firm Só Frango Produtos Alimentícios for about $26 million. That year it began beef production, stating that it was complimentary to its other segments. Its beef products are aimed mainly at the export market although it does supply its domestic customers with premium beef cuts.
