   Linde's business is lighter than air. With operations in more than 100 countries, Linde is one of the leading gases and engineering companies in the world. The company runs two core operating segments: Gases, which maintains four product areas of Bulk, Cylinder, On-site and Healthcare gases; and Engineering. The latter builds process plants for companies in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and gas manufacturing industries. Founded by fridge magnate Carl von Linde in 1895, the company bears his name. In late 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by US-based rival
   <company id="15758">
    Praxair
   </company>
   for $35.1 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Gases is by far the larger of the two core units, racking up some 85% of revenue. It is divided into three regional segments: EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas. The segment produces compressed and liquefied gases for use in a number of industries, including energy, steel, chemical, food, glass and electronics. Its Heathcare business, which is growing strongly globally, works in fields such as MRI imaging, to which Linde supplies essential liquid helium, and cryogenics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineering (14% of revenue) focuses on sectors like natural gas plants, hydrogen plants, air separation and synthesis gas plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   A small third division (1% of sales), the logistics services company Gist, provides logistics and supply chain services to a broad range of commercial and industrial sectors, including electronics, grocery, retail, and gas.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Gases segment has five cross-regional Global Governance Centers, which establish and enforce best practice across the company's many regions and operations. The Gases segment's largest region is EMEA at 39% of revenue. The Americas and Asia/Pacific bring in 34% and 27% respectively, but as a share of revenue the Americas region is growing the fastest. In 2015 Linde rolled out its Voice of the Customer platform, which is a customer-engagement program, to fifteen countries around the world (with more in the pipeline).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Linde recorded steady 5% revenue growth to €17,944 million in 2015, despite difficult external conditions, much in line with recent trends (growth is lower, but still positive, after taking unfavorable exchange rate effects into account). The Gases segment recorded year-on-year growth of 8% to €15,168 million, although growth was weighted almost entirely towards the Americas region, which saw a 20% increase in sales thanks to a strong performance in the Healthcare gases sector. Growth of 1% in the Asia-Pacific region was mostly due to the acquisition of Wesfarmers Kleenheat Gas in February 2015, which contributed €86 million to the headline take. Revenue growth in EMEA, the largest region by revenue at 39%, was flat.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineering segment bore the brunt of the oil-price crash in 2015, and a sharp fall in demand for new oil and gas plants saw revenue for the year drop 16.5% to €2,594 million (from €3,106 million in 2014). The sharpest fall came in the Asia-Pacific region, which saw revenue fall nearly 60%, from €1,131 million to €459 million, on prior year. This was counterbalanced to an extent by a 20% rise in North American revenue to €998 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income after tax rose modestly in 2015, from €1,102 million to €1,149 million. This 4% rise is attributable to the rise in total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities jumped 20% to €3,593 million in 2015, outpacing the rise in net income. Part of this was due to an exceptional cost of €300 million in 2014, but even accounting for this the increase was notable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Linde's growth strategy is multi-faceted. Dealing with the sudden change in the fortunes of the oil industry has been perhaps Linde's biggest difficulty in 2014-16. It views the oil price crash as a mixed blessing: it could lower prices for secondary industries and stimulate economic growth, or a sustained low could trigger bankruptcies. So far, the Engineering segment has felt the negative effects more strongly than Gases. Linde is aiming to limit damage by making use of the advantages of a low oil price by improving execution processes in preparation for the next upswing, whenever it may arrive.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is embracing the move towards green energy solutions, and plays a leading role in the development of hydrogen technologies. It participates in the H2 Mobility Initiative, a joint venture with five other partners that aims to build 400 hydrogen filling stations in Germany by 2023. Linde is also working on processes that convert energy from renewables into gas so it can be stored more easily - a big hurdle in the way of green uptake is the difficulty in storing energy generated by renewable means.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sees Healthcare as an opportunity for growth, as witnessed in the jump in revenue in Linde's Healthcare gases division in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Linde views joint enterprises and the acquisition of small and medium-sized businesses as a means to achieve greater closeness to its target markets. To this end it acquired American HomePatient, a respiratory therapy specialist, and spent a total of €120 million on acquisitions and financial assets in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Linde acquired American HomePatient in January 2016 to expand its medical gas business in the US; Linde is looking to capitalize on the strong growth in this area in 2015. HomePatient is a specialist in respiratory therapy and owns 220 branches in 38 US states and operates mostly on the east coast. It generated €260 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also acquired the LPG business of Wesfarmers Kleenheat Gas, an Australian gas producer, in a deal worth €53 million with a view to expand its LPG business on the east coast of Australia.

  <p>
   German engineer Karl von Linde perfected the ammonia-compression refrigeration machine in 1876. For the first time ice could be produced commercially instead of being cut in blocks from lakes. In 1879 Gesellschaft fur Linde's Eismaschinen was founded to sell the machines. Its first customers were brewers who wanted to make beer in the summer; the company later designed a refrigerator for the home.
  </p>
  <p>
   Von Linde granted technology licenses to foreign firms, but many licensees couldn't create working systems. Von Linde bought his patents back, and in 1885 he set up his first affiliate outside of Germany, the Linde British Refrigeration Company, which built a London ice factory.
  </p>
  <p>
   A decade later, Von Linde, a pioneer in cryogenics, patented a process for the liquefaction of air -- he had discovered the means to mass produce liquid oxygen. At the same time, a similar process was developed by a Frenchman, George Claude. To beat his rival, Von Linde built an oxygen factory near Munich in 1902 and set up Linde Air Products (now Praxair) in the US in 1907.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Germany's defeat in WWI, the overseas businesses were seized. In the 1920s Linde's Eismaschinen bought German engine manufacturers, including Guldner-Motoren-Gesellschaftin (1929). Von Linde died in 1934 at the age of 92. Then came WWII, and in the aftermath the company again lost its industrial rights and investments overseas. (In the US, Air Products had supplied oxygen to Allied fighter pilots.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The recovering company launched Hydrocar, the first platform truck with a hydrostatic drive, in 1955. In 1958 Guldner began making forklift trucks and hydraulic equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renamed Linde AG in 1965, the firm won its first industrial construction contract, to build a petrochemical plant. Switching gears, Linde sold its home appliances business to AEG in 1967, and in 1969 Guldner stopped building tractors and diesel engines in favor of materials handling equipment and hydraulics. The forklift operations expanded further with the acquisition of SE Fahrzeugwerke (now STILL) in 1973.
  </p>
  <p>
   Linde established branches to make industrial gases in Brazil and Australia (1974) and bought forklift manufacturers: Fenwick, in France (1984); UK firm Lansing (1989); and a 51% stake in Italy's FIAT OM Carrelli Elevatori (1992). In 1992 it also increased its holding in Hoek's Machine-en Zuurstoffabriek (aka Hoek Loos), the Netherland's largest industrial gases supplier, to 60%. Other major acquisitions followed, including Italian supplier Caracciolossigeno (1994), Czech gases firm Technoplyn (1995), and US engineering firm Pro-Quip (1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also built up its lines of refrigerated cases. It had taken a stake in CRIOSBANC, an Italian manufacturer, in 1992 (buying the rest in 1998). Linde acquired UK supplier Radford Retail Systems in 1997, and the next year gained controlling stakes in Brazilian supplier Seral do Brasil and in European distributor Chief Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Linde also bought Thyssen Krupp Stahl's air separation plants in Duisburg-Ruhrort. A year later, Linde reorganized its gases division as a separate operating company (Linde Technische Gase), and in 2000 it acquired Swedish industrial gases giant
   <company id="90887">
    AGA
   </company>
   in a deal that made Linde the world's #4 gas supplier. That year, after abandoning plans to take over rival Messer Griesheim's gas operations, Linde inked a deal with Japan's Komatsu Forklift for global collaboration. The demise of the Messer Griesheim merger led Linde to restructure its gas and engineering business segment and its refrigeration operations in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Linde sold its refrigeration equipment and cooling systems business to

    Carrier

   (a subsidiary of
   <company id="11559">

  </p>
  <p>
   Linde became the world's largest gas manufacturer ahead of France's
