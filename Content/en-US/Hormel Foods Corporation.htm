   The maker of such thrifty pantry staples as SPAM lunch meat and Dinty Moore stew has turned sophisticated. Besides canned meats, Hormel Foods produces a slew of refrigerated processed meats and deli items, ethnic entrees, and frozen foods, sold under the flagship Hormel brand, as well as Don Miguel and MegaMex (Mexican), Country Crock (side dishes), and Lloyd's (barbeque). Food service offerings include Hormel Natural Choice meats, Caf√© H, Austin Blues, and Bread Ready pre-sliced meats. Hormel is also a major US turkey and pork processor, churning out

    Jennie-O
   </company>
   turkey, Cure 81 hams, and Always Tender pork. More than 30 Hormel brands are ranked #1 or #2 in their respective markets.
  </p>

  <p>
   Hormel Foods operates five business segments. The largest, Refrigerated Foods makes pork and beef products and includes the company's 50%-owned Precept Foods joint venture, and accounts for about 50% of total sales. The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment is the next biggest earner (at about 20%), and the shelf-stable Grocery Products segment, which counts on products such as the MegaMex Foods line, also accounts for around 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not so familiar with consumers, the company's Specialty Foods segment (about 10% of sales) packages and sells a variety of sugar and sugar-substitute products, salt and pepper, liquid-portion products, dessert mixes, ready-to-drink products, gelatin products, and private-label canned meats. Its primary customers are retail and foodservice firms. The segment also makes nutritional food products and supplements for hospitals, nursing homes, and other marketers of nutritional products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's International arm brings in the remaining revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel subsidiaries include Alma Foods, Applegate Farms, Diamond Crystal, and Hormel Financial Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel sources its hogs from suppliers in Minnesota, Iowa, Utah, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment rears around 75% of its turkey requirements itself, while the remainder comes from contracted independents.
  </p>

  <p>
   Hormel Foods is based in Austin, Minnesota. While nearly 95% of the company's sales come from the US, Hormel boasts operations and/or joint ventures across the globe, including in Australia, Canada, China (the world's biggest market for pork), Japan, and the Philippines. Other major markets include Mexico, Micronesia, Singapore, and South Korea.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel has 35 facilities, including three plants that process hogs and seven turkey harvesting and processing locations.
  </p>

  <p>
   In the US, Hormel sells its goods through sales personnel, independent brokers, and distributors. Abroad, subsidiary Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC) does Hormel's marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="11600">

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended October), revenue climbed 3% to $9.5 million, putting the company back onto its previous growth trajectory after a small sales decline in fiscal 2015. Refrigerated Foods grew the most in real terms, up $275 million, while Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products also grew strongly. The 53-week financial year also added to sales figures. Specialty Foods declined by 15%, due in part to the sale of Diamond Crystal brands in mid-2016, while International &amp; Other also fell, by 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped 30% to $891 million amid a broad-based increase in profitability among Hormel's segments (International aside, which was flat). Cash generated by operating activities was unchanged on prior year.

  <p>
   Hormel's strategy is to extend existing brands and roll out new brands. While SPAM may be its best known brand, Hormel has a diverse and growing portfolio of consumer products, with Muscle Milk nutrition products being the newest addition. The company is focusing on developing and acquiring new products to drive sales, as well as bumping up advertising on established brands such as Skippy peanut butter and SPAM. Hormel is also looking to grow its ethnic business at home and abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Precept Foods joint venture with
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   markets case-ready fresh beef and pork under the Always Tender brand. Hormel operates another joint venture with
   <company id="95338">
    Herdez Del Fuerte
   </company>
   to market Mexican foods in the US. Called
   <company id="53970">
    MegaMex Foods
   </company>
   , it is integral to Hormel's plan to further diversify its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2015 the company purchased organic processed meat company Applegate, which now operates as a standalone subsidiary. The $775 million acquisition added Applegate's deli meats, frozen burgers, and sausages into the same pantry as SPAM and Dinty Moore stew, and advances the firm's growing push into natural and organic foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel is building a new prepared meats manufacturing facility in China. It will produce SPAM and refrigerated and frozen meat items for sale in the foodservice and retail channels.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016, Hormel acquired Justin's, LLC, a maker of nut butter products such as spreads, squeeze packs, peanut butter cups, and snack packs. Hormel paid $280.9 million for Justin's, which will bolster Hormel's nut butter-based snacking category.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired Applegate Farms, which produces natural and organic prepared meats, for $775 million in 2015. Applegate is now a subsidiary of the Refrigerated Foods segment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   George Hormel opened his Austin, Minnesota, slaughterhouse in an abandoned creamery in 1891. By 1900 Hormel had modernized his facilities to compete with larger meat processors. In 1903 the enterprise introduced its first brand name (Dairy Brand) and a year later began opening distribution centers nationwide. The scandal that ensued after the discovery in 1921 that an assistant controller had embezzled over $1 million almost broke the company, causing Hormel to initiate tighter controls. By 1924 it was processing more than a million hogs annually. Hormel introduced canned ham two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jay Hormel, George's son, became president in 1929; under his guidance Hormel introduced Dinty Moore beef stew (1936) and SPAM (1937). A Hormel executive won a contest, and $100, by submitting the name, a contraction of "spiced ham." During WWII the US government bought over half of Hormel's output; it supplied SPAM to GIs and Allied forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1959 Hormel introduced its Little Sizzlers pork sausage and sold its billionth can of SPAM. New products rolled out in the 1960s included Hormel's Cure 81 ham (1963). By the mid-1970s the firm had more than 750 products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company survived a violent, nationally publicized strike triggered by a pay cut in 1985. In the end only 500 of the original 1,500 strikers returned to accept lower pay scales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sensing the consumer shift toward poultry, Hormel purchased Jennie-O Foods in 1986. Later acquisitions included the House of Tsang and Oriental Deli (1992), Dubuque (processed pork, 1993), and Herb-Ox (bouillon and dry soup mix, 1993). After more than a century as Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., the company began calling itself Hormel Foods in 1993 to reflect its expansion into non-pork foods. Former General Foods executive Joel Johnson was named president and CEO that year (and chairman two years later).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel proved it could take a joke with the 1994 debut of its tongue-in-cheek SPAM catalog, featuring dozens of SPAM-related products. But when a 1996 Muppets movie featured a porcine character named Spa'am, Hormel sued
   <company id="47507">
    Jim Henson Productions
   </company>
   ; a federal court gave Spa'am the go-ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1996 Hormel teamed up with Mexican food processor
   <company id="95338">
    Grupo Herdez
   </company>
   to sell Herdez sauces and other Mexican food products in the US. It then formed a joint venture with Indian food producer Patak Spices (UK) to market its products in the US. Late that year Hormel paid $64 million for a 21% interest in Spanish food maker
   <company id="93310">
    Campofrio Alimentacion
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Earnings fell in 1996, due in part to soaring hog prices. The company was hit hard again in 1998 when production contracts with hog growers meant it wound up paying premium rates, despite a market glut. In 1998 the Smithsonian Institution accepted two cans of SPAM (one from 1937, the other an updated 1997 version) for its History of Technology collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   SPAM sales soared in 1999 as nervous consumers stockpiled provisions for the millennium. To build its growing HealthLabs division, Hormel acquired Cliffdale Farms (2000) and Diamond Crystal Brands nutritional products (a division of
   <company id="13747">
    Imperial Sugar
   </company>
   ) in 2001 -- boosting its share of the market for easy-to-swallow foods sold to hospitals and nursing homes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 Hormel acquired family-owned The Turkey Store for approximately $334 million and folded it into its Jennie-O division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel produced its 6 billionth can of SPAM in 2002 and traded $115 million in stock to acquire the rest of
   <company id="13747">
    Imperial Sugar
   </company>
   's Diamond Crystal Brands unit, which packages single-serve packets of sugar, sweeteners, seasonings, and plastic cutlery for the foodservice industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further diversify, in 2003 Hormel acquired food manufacturer Century Foods International (whey-based protein powders, beverages, and nutrition bars) and added it to its burgeoning specialty foods group. In 2004 Hormel sold off its stake in Campofrio to
   <company id="14734">
    Smithfield Foods
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Its last act of business in 2004 was to purchase Southern California's
   <company id="124417">
    Clougherty Packing
   </company>
   for about $186 million. The pork processor's facilities help extend Hormel's capacity for further-processed foods in the southwestern US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company purchased Mexican food manufacturer Arriba Foods for $47 million in cash. Later that year it bought Lloyd's Barbecue Company from
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Responding to the growing trend of the US population to dine out, Hormel expanded its foodservice segment (which it refers to as its specialty foods business) with the 2005 purchase of foodservice food manufacturer and distributor Mark-Lynn Foods. Mark-Lynn's products include salt and pepper packets, ketchup, mustard, sauces and salad dressings, creamers, and sugar packets, as well as jellies, desserts, and drink mixes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Adding to its grocery product offerings, in 2006 the company acquired canned, ready-to-eat chicken producer Valley Fresh Foods for $78 million. It also bought pepperoni and pasta maker
   <company id="14496">
    Provena Foods
   </company>
   , and sausage and sliced meat maker Saag's Products. It added another to its list of countries in which it has joint ventures in 2006, when it formed a JV with
   <company id="41836">
    San Miguel
   </company>
   to raise and market hogs and animal feed in Vietnam. The JV is 49%-owned by Hormel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hormel acquired
   <company id="117037">
    Burke Corporation
   </company>
   , a maker of pizza toppings and other fully cooked meat items in 2007 for $115 million in cash. The acquisition allowed Hormel to extend its pizza-topping operations into the foodservice sector. The following year, it acquired Boca Grande Foods for $23.5 in cash. Boca Grande makes Poco Pac branded jams, jellies, and pancake syrup portion-control products for foodservice operators.
