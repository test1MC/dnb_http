  <p>
   Hanesbrands' annual sales and profits have been growing over the past few years as new brand acquisitions have spurred more sales in more geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales rose nearly 8% to $5.73 billion during fiscal 2016 (ended January, 2016) mostly thanks to 40%-plus International segment growth stemming from business growth in Europe with its late 2014 acquisition of DBApparel. Its Activewear sales also grew as its Knights Apparel acquisition led to higher sports apparel sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales growth in FY2016 drove Hanesbrands' net income up 6% to $428.2 million, despite higher selling, general, and administration costs associated with acquisition and integration charges. The apparel maker's operating cash levels plunged 55% to $227 million for the year as it used more cash to build its inventory levels, paid $100 million in pension contributions, and decreased its accounts receivables collections due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter.

  <p>
   Hanesbrands has been expanding its business overseas by acquiring top brands in its less-tapped markets. In 2016, for example, the company expanded in Australia after buying top intimates maker Pacific Brands in Australia. In late 2014, Hanesbrands acquired DBApparel Group of France, a maker of intimate apparel in Europe that holds the license to manufacture and sell apparel under the Wonderbra and Playtex trademarks in the European Union, as well as several other nations in Europe and South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also hopes to identify and capitalize on the long-term megatrends related to their top product lines over the next five to 10 years. To this end, in early 2015, the company purchased Knights Apparel to expand its sports licensed collegiate apparel business with a goal of appealing to college students as that market grows over the next years and decades.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond growth, Hanesbrands has been reducing production costs by improving operating efficiencies in using a low-cost global supply chain based upon a combination of owned, contracted, and sourced manufacturing.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2016 the company acquired leading Australian undergarment company Pacific Brands Limited in a cash deal valued at $800 million. The acquisition gave Hanesbrands the top market position in Australia for intimate apparel. In addition to its core products, Pacific Brands Limited also operates pillow business Tontine and flooring business Dunlop. Hanesbrands intends to divest both businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hanesbrands also acquired Champion Europe, which owned the Champion brand in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, in 2016 for $228 million in cash. The company operates Champion Europe as a division of Hanes' global Champion organization.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company bought Knights Apparel, a leading retailer of licensed collegiate logo apparel, to enrich its own Gear for Sports licensed collegiate apparel business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2014, Hanesbrands traveled across the Atlantic to acquire DBApparel, a maker of intimate apparel, hosiery, and underwear in Europe, for â‚¬400 million ($528 million). DBApparel's brands include DIM, Playtex, and Wonderbra.
