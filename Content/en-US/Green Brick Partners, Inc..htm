   Green Brick Partners (formerly BioFuel Energy) climbed aboard the ethanol bandwagon, but found that bandwagon be on traveling down an uncertain course. The company's two plants (sold 2013) had the combined capacity to produce 220 million gallons of ethanol annually, as well as 720,000 tons of distillers grains. It sold all of its production to agribusiness giant
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   , which in turn gave it reliable corn supplies, an established logistics/transportation network, and marketing expertise. BioFuel Energy went public in 2007, using the proceeds to repay outstanding debts, as well as to fund construction of its ethanol facilities. The name change to Green Brick Partners occurred in late 2014.

  <p>
   <company id="40079">
    Cargill
   </company>
   supplied all of the corn that was needed by Green Brick, about 41 million bushels per year at each of its two plants (Wood River Nebraska and Fairmont, Minnesota). The company believed that its plants' proximity to corn supplies, natural gas, and rail transportation positioned it to compete favorably in the ethanol industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corn oil produced at its two plants was nonfood grade used primarily as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel and as an animal feed ingredient. Distillers grain was sold by the ton and, based upon the amount of moisture retained in the product, was either sold 'wet' or 'dry.'
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, facing financial difficulties, the company agreed to sell its two ethanol plants.

  <p>
   Green Brick marketed the corn oil produced in the Wood River facility, although a portion was often sold to the same third-party marketer that purchased its dried distillers grain from that facility. Most of the corn oil produced in Fairmont was sold to a biodiesel producer under an off-take agreement.
  </p>

  <p>
   Green Brick got most of its revenues from ethanol sales. However, due to the divestment of its ethanol, distillers grain, and corn oil assets in 2013, the company did not report revenues that year. Its revenues had decreased $165 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes (the Fairmont plant was idle for all of 2013), partially offset by an increase in prices received for both its ethanol and co-products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net income decreased by 2% in fiscal 2013, due to a decreased loss from discontinued operations, offset by an increased loss on its disposal of its plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased by $12 million in 2013, due to a decrease in net loss, offset by working capital sources and noncash charges (depreciation and amortization and loss on disposal of plants).

   Facing heayy debts and a difficult market, in 2013 Green Brick engaged
   <company id="14443">
    Piper Jaffray &amp; Co
   </company>
   to act as its financial adviser to help explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of one or both of its plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year a definitive agreement was entered into for the lenders to sell Green Brick's ethanol plants plus working capital to
   <company id="149320">
    Green Plains Renewable Energy
   </company>
   . Through the deal the lenders agreed to pay the company $3 million in full satisfaction of any obligations of the lenders amd extinguish all of the amounts due under Green Brick's credit facility ($177 million in principal and interest).
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to this deal, hedge fund firms
   <company id="101059">
    Greenlight Capital
   </company>
   and Third Point controlled more than 50% of the company. Cargill owned another 10%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cargill, which had owned 5% of the company's stock since 2007, gained another 5% from Green Brick's rights offering in February 2011, which satisfied the company's debt to Cargill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite favorable tax credits for renewable fuels, Green Brick has been struggling since a slump in the ethanol market began in 2009. Several ethanol plants were shuttered after the economic downturn and high gasoline prices caused people to drive less. The prices of corn, the company's main ingredient, had increased in June 2008. Green Brick experienced hedging losses on corn, and subsequently restructured its debt with Cargill.
