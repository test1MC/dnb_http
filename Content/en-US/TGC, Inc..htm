   Like other television sports networks, The Golf Channel depends on live event coverage to draw in viewers.

The channel also serves as the LPGA's US broadcasting outlet during international events. In addition, The Golf Channel has a 15-year broadcasting package with the PGA TOUR that started in 2007.
