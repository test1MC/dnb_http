   This company has cheesecake, buttered popcorn, orange sherbet, and jalapeño on the menu -- who could ask for anything more? You could and can. The Jelly Belly Candy Company makes Jelly Belly jelly beans in 50 "official" flavors, with new and sometimes startlingly flavored (and named) versions introduced periodically, such as Chili Mango. The company's other products include gumballs, gummies, and sour candies in Jelly Belly flavors. Its more than 100 confections also include candy corn, sour candies, jellies, novelty candy, chocolates, chocolate-covered nuts, cinnamon confections, and licorice, along with seasonal offerings. Jelly Belly's candy is sold in more than 70 countries worldwide.

   California-based Jelly Belly Candy manufactures its sweets at its factory in Fairfield, north of San Francisco. In addition to making candy, the company dabbles in retail. It operates half a dozen retail Jelly Belly candy stores in California, as well as a visitor center/warehouse (with tours) in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin.

   The candy maker continues to attract new customers by developing and rolling out new flavors and collections. In 2014 it launched a new beer flavored jelly bean and a collection of candies designed to capitalize on the popular

   movie "Frozen". Some of Jelly Belly's other not-so-traditional flavors include black pepper, ear wax, skunk spray, baby wipes, booger, rotten egg, and vomit. In a less adolescent vein, the company also makes caffeinated Sport Beans for active jelly bean consumers. Joining other food companies in offering healthier sweets, Jelly Belly sells Superfruit beans made with real juice and natural flavors and coloring. The selection includes Acai Berry, Barbados Cherry, Cranberry, Blueberry, and Pomegranate. To appeal to a more adult audience, Jelly Belly in 2010 launched a namesake Cocktail Classics collection with such flavors as Mojito, Peach Bellini, and Strawberry Daiquiri.

   Jelly Belly also makes money through licensing agreements with other companies in the food and beverage sectors.

   The company concentrates on business in the US, but it has extended its reach in recent years to decrease its exposure to American economic woes. To expand the distribution footprint of its candy in Europe, Jelly Belly in 2008 acquired Starkfried, a Germany-based supplier of confectionery, biscuits, and muesli.
