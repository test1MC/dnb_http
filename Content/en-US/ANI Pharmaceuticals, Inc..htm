   ANI Pharmaceuticals wants to stabilize hormonal ups and downs. The firm is developing topical hormone therapy gels to deliver supplemental estrogen, progestogen, and testosterone. It focuses on areas including narcotics, anti-cancers, hormones and steroids, and complex products with extended release or combination formulations. More than half of the company's earnings come from its menopause treatment Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone (EEMT); other products include Hydrocortisone Enema (for ulcerative colitis), Methazolamide (for ocular conditions), and Opium Tincture (diarrhea). The firm is also developing potential cancer vaccine therapies. ANI also performs contract manufacturing.

  <p>
   Revenues have been on the rise for the past three years. In 2015, revenue rose 36% to $76 million, thanks largely to a 54% jump in generics sales. This was attributed to an increase in the sales price of EEMT as well as the recent launches of Methazolamide, Etodolac, Propafenone, and Vancomycin. Branded product sales remained steady, and contract manufacturing operations slowed down, but contract services and royalty income rose that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which had been rising significantly, declined 47% to $15 million in 2015 due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations has followed net income's suit: In 2015 it fell 22% to $17 million on the lower profits as well as changes in income taxes and accounts payable.

   ANI Pharmaceuticals is actively launching new products to grow its prescription drug sales. In 2015 it received abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for more than 20 generic products. The company will buy portfolios of existing drugs to boost its portfolio. It also partners with other firms to introduce products to the US market. For example, it entered a distribution agreement with IDT Australia in 2015 through which it will market a number of products.
