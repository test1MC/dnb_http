   Besides having shed their mortal coils, what do you suppose Beau Brummel, Sir Winston Churchill, Oscar Wilde, Salvador Dali, and Frank Sinatra have in common? All were customers of one of Britain's oldest family-owned and -run businesses: James Lock &amp; Co (Lock's). London's leading hatter, which was established in 1676, specializes in custom-fit headwear. The company holds files of impressions of clients' heads taken using a conformateur. It specializes in a variety of headwear, from tweed caps to riding headwear, ladies summer hats to couture hats, and fedoras to top hats. Hats with the James Lock name can be found in leading shops throughout the world.

   Lock &amp; Co's couture collection, sold under the Couture Millinery by Sylvia Fletcher name, is available within four weeks custom-ordered and -dyed. To capture younger audiences and stay at the forefront of fashion, James Lock caters to women with a growing portfolio of felt, faux fur, straw, and trilby styles along with the traditional pillbox hats worn by royalty. It also stocks hat boxes, brushes, and jacks, along with accessories like hat brushes, canvas bags, and cashmere scarves.

   In addition to its own line, the company offers a few products imported from equally lofty brands including Borsalino of Italy, Stetson from the US, Akubra of Australia, and Tilley from Canada.

   In addition to a number of Royal Highnesses, Lock's still holds paper patterns for Charlie Chaplin, Admiral Lord Nelson, Charles de Gaulle, and the Duke of Windsor. Descendants of the founder still run and own Lock's after more than 300 years.
