   The lunch lady makes a mean meal with help from JTM Provisions. The company produces hundreds of fully cooked meals, from traditional to ethic dishes, for the foodservice industry. Its mainstay offerings are marketed in North America under name brands, including Cecilia's Italian Favorites, Caramba Cantina Mexican Favorites, Soaring Dragon Asian Sauces, and Main Street Cafe American Fare. JTM also supplies bakery items, such as hoagie rolls, and prepared meats, including meatloaf. It caters to food distributors and institutional buyers for schools, restaurants and delis, military commissaries, and some convenience/grocery stores. The company is owned by the founding Maas family.

  <p>
   JTM consists of four operations that are referred to by the company as capabilities. The Kettle Cooked Foods capability produces boilable/steamable bagged cooked main dishes. The Prepared Meats arm includes a fully cooked meat line that processes a variety of product shapes and sizes. The company's Bakery specializes in breads that are frozen and fully baked or par-baked, sliced or unsliced. And JTM's Crumbles-Fully Cooked Ground Meat Product comes in several shapes to serve the institutional food market. It comprises beef, chicken, pork, and turkey.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company, which claims to serve about half of US schools, provides foods to more than 13 million K-12 students at 7,000-plus school districts nationwide. JTM offers more than 150 menu items and delivers a variety of finished food products.

  <p>
   JTM is strategically positioning itself as a leader in the trend toward reduced-fat, reduced-sodium, and low-sodium food processes. It started by introducing a reduced-sodium beef taco filling and three reduced-sodium beef meatball items to school lunch menus. Student acceptance -- it reportedly supplies about half the schools in the nation -- spurred the company to later reduce the sodium in its macaroni and cheese product and its vegetarian soups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond schools, the company targets kitchens in the healthcare and military markets, although they often lack the standardized requirements of public education systems. The company also looks to court co-manufactures and retailers calling for slim-down meal alternatives.
