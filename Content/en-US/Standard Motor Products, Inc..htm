  <p>
   SMP's Engine Management segment (72% of sales) sells both wire and cable products (primarily ignition wire sets) and computer-controlled engine management equipment that controls ignition, emission, and fuel injection systems.  As the modern car becomes more computerized, the Engine Management segment provides the sensors it needs to monitor various functions and the valves, switches, and other components to regulate performance. The segment's ignition and emission control parts help vehicles meet emissions standards set by the federal Clean Air Act and state environmental laws.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engine Management segment's products are sold under brand names that include Standard, BWD, Intermotor, OEM, TechSmart, and GP Sorensen. The segment also produces such private label brands as CARQUEST,

    O'Reilly

   Import Direct and Master Pro, NAPA Echlin, and NAPA Belden.
  </p>
  <p>
   Temperature Control (27% of sales) makes the compressor that is at the core of all air-conditioning systems as well as the ancillary parts that support the system, such as filter driers, hose assemblies, and blower motors. Temperature Control products are sold under such brand names as Four Seasons, EVERCO, ACi, Hayden, Factory Air, and Imperial, as well as such private labels as CARQUEST, NAPA Temp Products, and Murray. Temperature Control also provides training in the repair of the smaller but more complex air-conditioning systems that are increasingly common.

   SMP serves warehouse distributors, large retailers, OEMs, and original equipment service parts companies in the US, Canada, Latin America, and Europe. In general SMP relies on a small number of large customers: its five largest account for upwards of two-thirds of sales, while NAPA Auto Parts alone accounts for 19% of sales. Other key customers include

  <p>
   Sales have fallen at SMP following an all-time high recorded in 2012, although only marginally: in fiscal 2015, net revenue was down around 1% on 2014 to $972.0 million. A 2% decline in Engine Management outweighed 2% growth in Temperature Control, to a net negative effect. The first full-year contribution from Annex Manufacturing, acquired in 2014, added $4.7 million to sales. The top line was also impacted by the strong dollar against the loonie and the Polish Zloty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was up 7% to $46.0 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income was due to a reduced asbestos-related liability expense in 2015 for $2.1 million, compared to $9.9 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was up 38% to $65.2 million.

   SMP is expanding its customer base beyond its traditional core of warehouse distributors and retailers to more automotive, industrial, marine, military, and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers. In 2016 it introduced three new product categories: Fuel Pump Driver Module, Inverter Coolant Pumps, and OE-Match Power Running Board Motors.

  <p>
   In 2016, the company acquired US-based General Cable Corporation's automotive ignition wire business for approximately $71 million. The acquisition will include the purchase of General Cable's automotive ignition wire business in North America, as well as a subsidiary in Mexico. Also in 2016, it acquired Annex Manufacturing, a distributor of temperature control products for the automotive aftermarket, for $11.5 million.
