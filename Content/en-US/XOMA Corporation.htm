   XOMA Corporation doesn't want to toil in anonymity. Instead, the company pairs with larger drug firms to develop and market its products, primarily monoclonal antibodies (biotech drugs based on cloned proteins). It's developing lead candidate gevokizumab with French drugmaker
   <company id="149969">
    Servier
   </company>
   . The firm partners on therapeutics for infectious disease, inflammatory ailments, and autoimmune conditions and receives royalties on drugs developed from licensing its technologies. XOMA has collaborative agreements with pharma companies
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   and
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ; it also has metabolic and oncology candidates.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to gevokizumab, which treats a rare inflammation-related eye condition, the company's main pipeline products include its XMet series (XMet A, S, and D) of diabetes and other metabolic disease treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Separate from its drug development, XOMA has created tools to help other drug companies discover and make antibodies and other proteins. It licenses its proprietary bacterial cell expression (BCE) technology, a process for discovering and selecting recombinant proteins for further development. More than 60 companies have signed licensing agreements for BCE technology and will pay development milestone payments and royalties on any antibodies covered by the licenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 contracts brought in about 70% of XOMA's revenue (Servier contributed about 56% of that) while the
   <company id="100358">
    National Institutes of Health
   </company>
   (NIH), which XOMA has worked with to find treatments for bioterrorism threat botulinum, brought in 37%.
  </p>
  <p>
   XOMA began selling its first product, Aceon, a high blood pressure drug purchased from Servier, in 2012. But it sold the development and commercialization rights to drug maker Symplmed in mid-2013.

  <p>
   As a development-stage company, XOMA's revenues are directly tied to licensing, R&amp;D collaboration, and royalty fees.  It makes around $35 million per year in fees but it spends about $70 million on R&amp;D each year. This trend will continue until the company has products to market. Its total accumulated deficit was $1 billion at the end of 2013.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The cornerstone of XOMA's strategy is using its expertise in recombinant protein development and production to build a diverse portfolio of drug candidates in core therapeutic areas. In addition to advancing its lead drug candidate, the firm plans to license or acquire new products to strengthen its internal development efforts, as well as to form new partnerships and technology agreements with third parties. Once it has a product ready to market, XOMA will use its own sales force in the US. It plans to license the two diabetes drugs in its XMet series while retaining full rights to third, which treats a rare insulin-regulation condition.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company sold its biodefense program, including its XOMA 3AB botulinum antibody being developed for NIH, to Florida-based biopharmaceutical Nanotherapeutics. Early the following year, it sold an antibody manufacturing pilot plant to
   <company id="99279">
    Agenus
   </company>
   .
