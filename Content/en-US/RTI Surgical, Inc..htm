   When it comes to surgical implants, RTI Surgical (formerly RTI Biologics) recommends the natural alternative. The firm develops products made from human and animal tissue that are used in orthopedic, dental, and other surgeries to repair fractures, spinal disorders, sports injuries, breast reconstruction, and other procedures. Using its BioCleanse, Cancelle SP, and Tutoplast processes, the company sterilizes tissue -- including bone, tendons, and skin -- that is then used in surgeries. RTI Surgical sells its allografts (made from human tissue) and xenografts (made from animals) in the US and more than 50 countries around the globe. Its direct sales force targets the sports medicine and general orthopedic markets.

  <p>
   In July 2013, following its purchase of Pioneer Surgical Technology, RTI Biologics changed its name to RTI Surgical.

   RTI Surgical's fastest-growing segment comes from products for sports medicine procedures, which accounts for about 25% of sales. As customer demand for such products increase, a good portion of RTI's research and product development capabilities are focused on expanding its offerings for sports medicine applications. The bone graft substitutes (BGS) and general orthopedic segment and the surgical specialties (breast, hernia, urology, and ophthalmology) segments are also growing. However, its revenues in its spine and dental divisions have fluctuated in recent years, primarily due to lower sales levels by its key distributors in those segments.

  <p>
   RTI is headquartered in Florida, where it also has two tissue processing facilities. It also processes tissue at a plant in Germany and has metal and synthetic implant manufacturing facilities in Michigan and North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for about 90% of the company's revenue, but it does offer its products and services in nearly 50 nations.

   In addition to its direct sales efforts, RTI has also forged a distribution network of agreements with other companies, each targeting a specific product market. Its agreements include deals with
   <company id="10981">
    Medtronic
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14815">
    Stryker
   </company>
   to handle spine implants and with
   <company id="103803">
    Zimmer
   </company>
   to handle spine and dental implants. It uses its own representatives and independent distributors for its sports medicine and wound-repair products. International distribution is also handled by independent distributors.

   RTI has seen slow but steady revenue growth in the last five years. It increased by 11% in 2013, from $178 million to $198 million, as unit volume and revenue per unit rose in its spine segment after an acquisition. Net income has been fluctuating for several years and 2013 delivered an $18 million loss, down $20 million from the previous year. The drop was due to a restructuring charge and acquisition-related expenses. After declaring $20 million in cash from operations in 2012, RTI used $4 million in cash for operations in 2013 due deferred income tax and accrued expenses.

  <p>
   One of the challenges RTI faces is that it competes with not-for-profit allograft-processing firms for the limited supply of human tissue. In addition, the biologic implant industry must comply with strict regulations, and the company is dependent upon third parties to secure human tissue ethically. Finally, other companies are busily working to develop synthetic tissues that may eventually eliminate the need for some of RTI's products. It deals with these challenges by pushing to ever expand its product portfolio. In 2014 it launched new bone wedges and instruments, as well as a system to treat spinal stenosis, tumors, and disc degeneration. In addition to launching new products, RTI occasionally makes acquisitions to increase its product line, like the 2013 purchase of a spinal and orthopedic implant and instrument maker.

  <p>
   As part of its ongoing efforts to expand its product portfolio, RTI in 2013 purchased spinal implant and instrument maker Pioneer Surgical Technology for $126 million. The buy also brought Pioneer's distribution network under the RTI umbrella and caused the company to change its name from RTI Biologics to RTI Surgical.
