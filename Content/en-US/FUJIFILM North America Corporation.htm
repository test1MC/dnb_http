   The business has been rapidly shifting the focus of its business to digital, including in its print division, to take advantage of the increasing number of cell phones that capture digital photos. To this end, customers of
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   , among other carriers, can use FUJIFILM's Web-based service to print and share their digital photos.

   Before it went calling on mobile phone owners, FUJIFILM North America in 2008 developed a photo services agreement with

    Rite Aid
   </company>
   . As part of the deal, the drugstore chain offers FUJIFILM products and photofinishing services at its locations. Rite Aid customers can also upload their photos online and pick them up in-store.

   In 2010 FUJIFILM North America halted production of pictography products in light of increased demand for inkjet and other dry digital print technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   FUJIFILM North America has been shaking up its organizational structure to present a more unified business to customers. To this end, subsidiary FUJIFILM Optical Devices U.S.A. was converted into FUJIFILM North America's optical devices division at the start of 2011. Also FUJIFILM Hawaii Inc., which provides photographic products on the Hawaiian Islands, became a regional sales and marketing office of FUJIFILM North America.
