   Trinity Industries manufactures auto carriers, box cars, gondola cars, hopper cars, intermodal cars, and tank cars -- in short, railcars for hauling everything from coal to corn syrup. Trinity also leases and manages railcar fleets. Its Inland Barge unit builds barges used to transport coal, grain, and other commodities. In addition to transportation, other Trinity businesses provide products and services to the industrial, energy (structural towers for wind turbines, metal containers for liquefied petroleum gas and fertilizer), and construction (concrete, aggregates, highway guardrails) sectors.

   About 90% of the company's business is US-generated. The rest of the company's business is generated in Mexico, where company tanks are manufactured under the brand name TATSA. Throughout North America, Trinity serves its customers from five business groups: Rail, Construction Products, Railcar Leasing, Inland Barge, and Energy Equipment. The divisions conduct business through subsidiaries.

  <p>
   Trinity Rail Group in 2015 shipped about 34,295 railcars -- 41% market share (by shipment) -- of the North American railcar industry. The division manufactures freight railcars that transport liquids, gases, and dry cargo.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Construction Products Group produces concrete, aggregates, and asphalt; it manufactures highway products, which include beams and girders used in highway bridge construction. Other highway products include guardrails, cable barrier systems, and crash cushions, which are sold in the US and over 60 countries worldwide. Trinity's Railcar and Leasing Management Services Group operates primarily through Trinity Industries Leasing Company (TILC), as well as other subsidiaries, and markets its services under the TrinityRail brand name. It provides leasing options to companies involved in petroleum, chemical, agricultural, and energy industries, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
   Inland Barge Group makes dry cargo barges (flat-deck and hopper), which transport products such as grain, coal, and aggregates. Tank barges carry petroleum, fertilizer, chemicals, and other liquid cargoes. This business makes fiberglass barge covers and deck hardware (brand name Nabrico), including hatches, castings, and winches for other watercraft and dock facilities. Primary customers are commercial marine transportation companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinity's Energy Equipment Group makes tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels, propane tanks, and structural wind towers.

  <p>
   Trinity has enjoyed significant growth over the last few years. From 2014 to 2015, its net revenues jumped 5% from $6.2 billion to peak at a record-setting $6.4 billion. The company's profits surged 17% from $678 million in 2014 to $797 million in 2015, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was attributed to a 5% rise in Railcar sales and a 11% spike in Energy Equipment Group sales. This was attributed to an increase in railcar revenue results fueled by an increase in unit deliveries and improved pricing, partially offset by product mix changes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in profits for 2015 was fueled by the additional revenue coupled with increased gains on the disposition of property, plant, and equipment. Trinity's cash flow has also increased the last several years, climbing 15% from $819 million in 2014 to $940 million in 2015.

  <p>
   One way Trinity has achieved milestone revenue growth is through acquisitions. In 2014 it acquired the assets of WesMor Cryogenic Companies, which specialized in the manufacturing, repair, and rehabilitation of cryogenic containers that store and transport LNG.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinity also obtained Alloy Custom Products, an Indiana-based manufacturer and repairer of cryogenic transportation products, including cryogenic tanks and semitrailers that store and transport LNG and other industrial gases. The transaction expanded Trinity's product offerings and geographic footprint in the cryogenics containers market within its Energy Equipment Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, in 2014 Trinity bought Meyer Steel Structures, a provider of tubular steel structures for electricity transmission and distribution and the utility steel structures, for approximately $600 million. Meyer was integrated into the Energy Equipment Group. The acquisition enhanced Trinity's presence in the energy and infrastructure markets.

  <p>
   Trinity Industries resulted from the 1958 merger of Trinity Steel, a maker of metal products for the petroleum industry, and Dallas Tank Co. The enterprise was headed by Ray Wallace, a Trinity Steel veteran since the 1940s. The company took the name Trinity Industries in 1966.
