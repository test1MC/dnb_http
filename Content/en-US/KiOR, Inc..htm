   Renewable crude oil. Wait - what? KiOR makes actual crude oil using renewable, non-food biomass like wood chips and switch grass. It also makes gasoline and diesel as well as blends for standard gasoline from its crude. Refined in standard petrochemical refinery equipment, the development stage company's products can be transported using existing oil and gas transportation infrastructure. Unlike ethanol and biodiesel KiOR's fuel is completely interchangeable with fossil fuels and can be "dropped in" to engines. The company claims it can produce a gallon of gas for $1.80 with an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard gasoline.

   KiOR has developed a unique proprietary technology platform to convert abundant and sustainable non-food biomass into fuels for use in vehicles on the road today. KiOR's cellulosic fuels, which may be transported using existing distribution networks, help ease dependence on foreign oil, reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and create high-quality jobs and economic benefit across rural communities.

   KiOR posted revenues of $1.83 million in 2013 (up from $0.85 million in 2012) was primarily due to increase in the product revenue and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) renewable credit revenues. Product revenue was $1.5 million. Product revenues of $1.5 million wasy generated by cellulosic gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil shipments from the Columbus facility. RINs were associated with cellulosic gasoline and diesel shipments from Columbus.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company posted a net loss of $347.4 million (comared to a net los of $96.4 million in 2012)  due to increased operating expenses as a result of higher product costs and a loss on impairment. The cost of product revenues increased by $57.1 million in 2013 as a result of producing finished products and having first cellulosic diesel shipment from the Columbus facility. Depreciation, operating and manufacturing costs incurred at Columbus facility subsequent to placing the plant into service were presented as a cost of product revenues. KiOR reported a loss impairment of $185 million for Columbus facility as a result of the Columbus facility not generating positive cash flows and the company not being able to get the facility to 'steady state' operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   KiORs reported cash outflow of $98.7 million in 2013 (compared to $79.4 million in 2012) as the result of a net loss of $347.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $248.7 million and a $0.1 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges consisted of $196.3 million for loss on impairment related to Columbus facility and design costs for previously planned commercial production facility, $26.7 million for non-cash interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, $12.1 million in stock based compensation, $10.9 million in depreciation and amortization, and $2.8 million in prepaid insurance amortization.

  <p>
   The company plans to build, own, and operate its commercial production facilities in the US. It began making cellulosic diesel and gasoline shipments from their Columbus facility in 2013. In early 2014 KiOR temporarily halted operations in Columbus to complete a series of optimization projects and upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 KiOR announced plans to double production capacity at its Columbus, Mississippi, cellulosic fuels facility through construction of a second facility incorporating KiOR's commercially proven technology. KiOR estimates that the project will cost $225 million and will take 18 months to construct and start up. Its long-term goal is to produce 92 gallons of biomass from the Colombus plant.

   KiOR was formed in 2007 and went public in 2011.

  <p>
   The company to use its $100 million in IPO proceeds to fund its first full scale plant in Mississippi and for general corporate purposes. Going forward KiOR intends to use a "build, own, operate" strategy for its plants as well as a "copy exact" model using modular construction to repeat best practices at all its facilities. Though it doesn't use government subsidies, the company will take advantage of environmental mandates and local, state, and federal loans and loan guarantees. KiOR has begun developing a jet fuel and exploring overseas expansion. Internationally it is looking for areas with abundant, sustainable, non-food feedstocks and possible joint venture partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company began constructing its initial scale processing plant in Columbus, Mississippi with a $75 million interest-free loan from the state's development authority. The plant's 500,000-gallon-per-day capacity puts it between the development stage facility it built outside Houston and its 1.500-million-gallon-per-day full scale facility in Newton, Mississippi. KiOR has an agreement with Hunt Refining to purchase its gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil blendstocks beginning in mid-2012. The company is still seeking
