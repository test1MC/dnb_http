   Agfa-Gevaert is all about image. The company makes and markets imaging systems for printing, graphic arts, motion picture, and medical imaging processes.
   <company id="148620">
    Agfa-Gevaert Graphics
   </company>
   (more than half of sales) makes prepress film and printing plates, industrial inkjet printers, and related supplies. It also provides workflow automation, proofing, and digital printing software. Agfa's health care unit offers films, chemicals, software, and printers used in digital radiography and other medical applications. The company's specialty products serve other industries, offering film for sound and image recording to the movie industry, synthetic paper, specialty films for printed circuit boards, and industrial inkjet inks.

  <p>
   Agfa's graphics business includes not only prepress products but also industrial inkjet printing. Imaging products make up 60% of the health care segment, while the remainder of the unit's sales come from IT services, such as image and data networks, information systems, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS).

  <p>
   As digital approaches continue to overtake conventional printing, Agfa has been pursuing the growing industrial inkjet, wide format printing market. Two other key trends in imaging and printing technology are the need for shorter production run-lengths and for print-on-demand capabilities. As print media becomes more focused and targeted to specific markets, printers are called upon to produce shorter runs of specific publications.

  <p>
   Agfa-Gevaert Group was formed by the merger of Germany-based Agfa, a longtime subsidiary of chemical company
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   , and Belgium-based Gevaert Photo Producten.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agfa traces its roots to a dye factory founded near Berlin in 1867. It was named Aktiengesellschaft fur Anilinfabrikation (Agfa) in 1873. Agfa began making photographic supplies in 1888. Having made alliances with other German chemical companies as early as 1916, Agfa in 1925 merged with seven other German chemical companies, including Bayer, to form IG Farben.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1935 Agfa introduced its Agfacolor film, unique for using a single exposure and single developing process. Agfa chemist Edith Weyde discovered diffusion transfer, a process that is the basis for many imaging products, in 1938. (Around the same time, Gevaert chemist Andre Rott also discovered the process.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII the Allies dismantled IG Farben, which made such chemicals as Zyklon-B, which was used during the war for the mass murders of Jews and others in the gas chambers of German concentration camps. Despite the breakup, in 1952 Agfa became a full subsidiary of Bayer. In 1959 Agfa offered the first fully automatic miniature camera. The company's 1964 merger with Gevaert Photo Producten created one of Europe's largest photographic companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gevaert Photo Producten dates back to a photographic paper workshop in Antwerp, Belgium, founded in 1890 by Lieven Gevaert. Four years later his company was named L. Gevaert &amp; Cie. In the early 1900s the company moved its headquarters to Mortsel, Belgium. Gevaert expanded its product line in 1920 to include photographic plates, roll films, and chemicals, and the company was renamed Gevaert Photo Producten. In 1929 the company began to sell films for X-rays.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Gevaert Photo Producten merged with Agfa, the combined company became Agfa-Gevaert Group (Agfa), and Bayer retained a 60% stake. In 1971 the company developed Europe's first xerographic copier. A rise in the cost of silver (a key ingredient of photo supplies) pushed Agfa into financial troubles in the late 1970s, and in 1981 the company again became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 Agfa-Gevaert, Inc. (the company's US operations) bought pre-press equipment company Compugraphic and medical imaging equipment company Matrix. Agfa grew by further acquisitions, acquiring the printing plate activities of
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   in 1996,
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   's films and printing plates business in 1998, and US-based Sterling Diagnostic Imaging in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Longtime Bayer executive Klaus Seeger became CEO in 1998. In 1999 Bayer sold all but a 30% stake in Agfa to the public. (It sold the rest to
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   in 2002.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Agfa announced it was in talks with Schroder Ventures (one of the world's largest investment firms) concerning the possible sale of Agfa's consumer imaging unit, but Agfa later backed out, and Seeger resigned. Vice chairman Ludo Verhoeven succeeded him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Agfa decided in 2001 to cut about 4,000 jobs over the next two years and to focus on digital products to reduce operating costs and restore profit margins. In 2002 the company acquired Mitra, a Canadian provider of imaging and information-management systems for the health care industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better focus on photography and graphics, Agfa sold its Non-Destructive Testing business to
   <company id="57976">
    GE Aircraft Engines
   </company>
   in 2003. Agfa made several small acquisitions in 2004, including Symphonie On Line, a French maker of software for hospital information systems; Lastra, an Italian maker of printing plates; and ProImage, an Israel-based maker of graphics workflow software.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2004, Agfa divested its business in fonts and typography software; that business became
   <company id="155441">
    Monotype Imaging
   </company>
   . In a move to focus on the more profitable HealthCare and Graphic Systems units, Agfa also divested its consumer photography operations; that business became a private company called AgfaPhoto, which later declared bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company spent more than $130 million to acquire Heartlab, a US-based maker of cardiology imaging and IT equipment. The next year it divested its Netherlands-based film and equipment logistics operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Agfa-Gevaert announced plans to eventually transform its three units, which have operated independently since 2006, into separate, publicly traded companies. The demerger plans stalled, however, due to poor results and a difficult economic environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   After scrapping its plans to demerge, Agfa-Gevaert refocused on operational improvements and cost reduction. In 2008 the company closed its computer-to-plate (CTP) equipment factory in Wilmington, Massachusetts, and extended its OEM relationship with a manufacturer of commercial CTP equipment so it can offer a full portfolio of products, services, and supplies to US customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Agfa made acquisitions that served the company's strategy of focusing more on industrial inkjet products. It bought the assets of the Harold M. Pitman Company, a family-owned supplier of prepress, industrial inkjet, press, and packaging printing products. Earlier that year the company acquired the assets of Gandi Innovations Holdings, a manufacturer of large-format inkjet systems, and Insight Agents, a European developer and producer of contrast media used in health care imaging applications.
