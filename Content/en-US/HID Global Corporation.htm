   HID Global Corporation doesn't have to keep things hidden -- it just keeps things under restricted access. The company provides products and services for physical access control, authentication and credential management, highly secure government ID, identification technologies, and card printing and personalization. HID uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology in electronic locks, alarms, biometric devices, and systems that use encrypted access control. In addition to HID, brands include ActivIdentity, EasyLobby, and FARGO. With locations worldwide, the company serves customers across a broad range of industries. HID is a subsidiary of the world's largest lock maker, Sweden's

   HID is focused on expanding its product offerings andÂ geographic reach. In late 2012 the company partnered with

    Dell

   to offer enhanced security products to the healthcare industry. Earlier that year it opened an office in Mexico City to better serve the growing Mexican and Latin American markets.

  <p>
   Acquisitions represent HID's primary method of expansion. In early 2013 it acquired Codebench, which provides complementary identity management products for the government market. The prior year it bought EasyLobby, a leading provider of visitor management products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other significant acquisitions include
   <company id="13232">
    LaserCard
   </company>
   and
   <company id="54061">
    ActivIdentity
   </company>
   . For HID, the acquisition of California-based LaserCard opens new horizons for business in the government sector, as well as offers synergistic capabilities, including imbedded hologram technology and counterfeit resistant optical security media (OSM). The ActivIdentity purchase expanded its logical and physical access capabilities.
