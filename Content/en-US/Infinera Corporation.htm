   To Infinera, and beyond! The buzz on this company is that it designs photonic integrated circuits (PICs) intended to replace much larger components within optical networks. (Optical networks are used to provide high-speed Internet access, 3G/4G mobile broadband, business Ethernet services, cloud-based services, and wholesale bandwidth services.) Infinera also offers networking equipment built around these chips, which are made from indium phosphide -- a specialized compound semiconductor material that offers light-years faster performance than standard silicon. Customers include service providers, cloud operators, governments and enterprises. They include

   Manufacturing of Infinera chips is handled by four contract manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Sweden, and Thailand. The company has the capability to move manufacturing to the US-qualified factories of two of its electronic manufacturing services partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company gets 87% of its revenue from its products while services account for the rest.

  <p>
   Infinera gets 68% of sales in the US, 20% from Europe, and 5% from Asia. The company operates from three US offices and international locations in Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, and the UK. It runs research and development facilities in the US, China, Canada, and Sweden and it has a software development facility in India.

  <p>
   Infinera makes most of its sales directly, with a small portion sold through resellers. Altogether it counts about 110 customers.

  <p>
   In 2015, Infinera's revenue spiked 33% higher to $887 million from $668 million in 2014. The increase was from continued sales momentum of the Infinera DTN-X platform in projects building new networks and those adding capacity. The Cloud Xpress platform also contributed to sales as did products acquired in the Transmode deal of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income leaped 276% in 2015, rising to $51 million from $13.6 million. Contributing were higher revenue and gains from foreign currency exchange rate changes and foreign currency forward contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $133 million in 2015, up from $36 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Infinera is looking to diversify and expand its customer base. While it counts Tier 1 telcos as customers, it would like to add more Internet content providers, long-haul network operators, regional and metro network operators, bandwidth wholesalers, subsea network operators, and cable multiple systems operators. Specifically, it would like to upgrade existing customers and land new customers for the Infinera DTN-X platform. Currently, the company depends on a small number of customers for a large portion of sales, and it doesn't have any long-term customer contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Infinera expanded its Cloud Xpress offering to include 10 gigabit Ethernet (GbE), 40 GbE and 100 GbE client interfaces to meet customer specific requirements.
