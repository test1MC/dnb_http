   ATI Ladish tries to keep up with the latest developments in aerospace and industrial technology. ATI Ladish, an
   <company id="11448">
    Allegheny Technologies
   </company>
   (ATI) subsidiary, designs and manufactures high-strength forged and cast metal components for aerospace and industrial markets. In 2012, complex jet engine parts, missile components, landing gear, helicopter rotors, and other aerospace products generated about 60% of ATI's High Performance Metals segment sales; general industrial components accounted for bulk of the remainder. Major aerospace customers include

  <p>
   The very nature of ATI Ladish's industry is capital-intensive and raw material costs can vary greatly. Titanium, a staple component in aircraft and aerospace parts manufacturing, increased in cost by more than 70% in a decade. Other key materials, such as aluminum and nickel-based superalloys, have seen similar price swings. To mitigate the high cost of raw materials, the company recycles by-products, such as machine turnings and test pieces.

  <p>
   The High Performance Metals segment of ATI Ladish's parent reported a 12% increase in revenues, with sales to the aerospace and defense markets up 13%, thanks to a full year of ATI Ladish sales, which offset reduced demand in the jet engine aftermarket.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2011
   <company id="11448">
    Allegheny Technologies
   </company>
   (ATI) acquired and renamed Ladish, and joined its operations with ATI's High Performance Metals segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The deal, valued at approximately $778 million, enabled the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based manufacturer of stainless and specialty steels and alloys to expand the scope of its product portfolio and customer base, particularly in the aerospace market. Ladish also benefited; its technology and manufacturing capacity complemented ATI's footprint while preserving its own established business.
  </p>
  <p>
   ATI Ladish started in 1905 when Herman Ladish bought a 1,500-lb steam hammer.
