   Webasto Roof Systems believes your car is the best place for a little sun and fresh air. The company, founded in 1974, makes and markets convertible roof systems and sunroofs for carmakers across North America, as well as for the automotive aftermarket. Webasto also builds temperature-management systems -- air conditioners and heaters that don't need the engine to run -- for cars, trucks, RVs, emergency vehicles, buses, rail cars, boats, and specialty vehicles. The company sells its products by partnering with nearly every major OEM and through distributors worldwide. Webasto Roof Systems is a unit of family-owned German auto parts maker Webasto AG.

   The company has been able to free up 35% more floor space for production by transferring the parts warehouse and non-production equipment functions offsite. The added space allowed Webasto to install another production line and offer just-in-time delivery.

   As the Chinese auto market heats up, Webasto has been expanding its plants there. It added two additional facilities, in central and northeastern China, in 2014 on the way to its target of reaching €1 billion there by 2018.

   By buying the bankrupt Wilhelm Karmann convertible roof business in the US and Mexico in 2010 -- by outbidding
   <company id="47972">
    Magna International
   </company>
   -- Webasto established Webasto-Edscha Cabrio USA and Webasto-Edscha Cabrio México. The move has strengthened Webasto's presence worldwide in the convertible roof systems market.
