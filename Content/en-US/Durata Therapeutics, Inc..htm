   You don't even want to think about the infections Durata Therapeutics is hoping to treat. Its lead candidate, dalbavancin, is designed for people with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections usually caused by
   <em>
    Strep
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Staph
   </em>
   bacteria. The drug is given once a week by IV as opposed to the current treatment, which must be given several times a day. The development-stage company is conducting clinical trials in the US and Western Europe and hopes to begin selling dalbavancin to hospitals via its own sales force in late 2013. Durata's other drug candidates include pleuromutalins and lincosamide, also high-level antibacterials. The company, formed in 2009, went public in 2012 but was bought in 2014 by Actavis, since acquired by

    Allergan
   </company>
   .
