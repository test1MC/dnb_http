   If someone compliments your threads, you should probably thank Coats plc, a leading global supplier of apparel and industrial thread. In addition to clothing thread, the company manufactures specialty thread (with applications for footwear, camping equipment, bedding, furniture, and automotive), zip fasteners and trim, and craft thread. It claims to own 20% of the world's market share in sewing thread manufacturing. Coats serves customers in more than 100 countries through its 70 manufacturing facilities spanning the globe. The company's thread division accounts for more than two-thirds of its total sales each year. Coats is a wholly owned subsidiary of London-based investment firm

  <p>
   David Alliance, the son of a textile merchant, left Iran for Manchester, England, in 1951. Alliance bought Thomas Hoghton, a failing cotton goods firm, in 1956. The purchase began a series of deals in which Alliance scouted troubled textile companies, made friendly acquisition offers, and restructured the companies to improve performance. By the late 1960s he operated three companies: Alliance Brothers (textiles and mail order), R Greg &amp; Company (spinning and fashion fabric), and Northern Counties Securities (finance).
  </p>
  <p>
   Alliance took over Spirella Company of Great Britain in 1968. The next year he formed Spirella Group as a holding company for his textile interests, which he organized into three areas: foundation garments, textiles and spinning, and household textiles. In 1975 Alliance acquired rival household textiles firm Vantona, a company that had been eyeing Spirella as a takeover target. Alliance's holding company adopted the Vantona Group name the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1982 Vantona Group bought Carrington Viyella, a diverse textile company eight times its size. The larger company had a heavy debt load, but owned a host of well-known brands, including Dorma, Van Heusen, and Viyella. Alliance changed the group's name to Vantona Viyella in 1983. The next major buy occurred in 1986 when Alliance acquired Coats Patons, a thread and knitting wool producer. Along with Coats came Dynacast, a diecast metal and injection-molded component maker. In 1987 the group's name was changed to Coats Viyella. Together Coats Viyella and Tootal Group dominated the international thread market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alliance stepped down as CEO in 1990 and appointed Neville Bain to the post. Formerly the deputy chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes (now a part of
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   ), Bain initiated the company's 1991 hostile takeover of Tootal, whose low-cost garments and textiles had been undercutting Coats Viyella's business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bain continued picking up companies in Asia and Eastern Europe and shedding noncore assets such as Coats Viyella's carpet business. By the mid-1990s it was clear that the 1986 Coats Patons deal still hadn't created the expected synergies. Restructuring, cost-cutting, and overseas production were words of the day, but the company continued to sink. Profits had dropped nearly 100% in 1997, and that year Michael Ost, former CEO of the engineering group McKechnie, replaced Bain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Coats Viyella split its clothing and household textiles businesses from its thread operations. As part of the restructuring that year, the company sold Dynacast to venture capital firm Cliven and reorganized its board of directors. Alliance retired as chairman that year and the post was filled by director Sir Harry Djanogly. Ost later resigned as CEO and was not immediately replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lord Rothschild, maverick investor and 18% owner of the company, made an offer to take it private in 2000, but the offer was rejected. That year the company sold a majority of its clothing and home furnishing (Viyella) businesses, due in part to the loss of major customer Marks and Spencer, to focus on its threads operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has gone through a number of name changes since 1983 when it was known as Vantona Group plc. Subsequent names have included Coats Viyella, Coats plc, Vantona Viyella, Spirella Group, and Coats Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Coats division head Martin Flower took over as CEO in 2001. In 2002 Coats disposed of its remaining fashion retail businesses, selling its Jaeger and Viyella operations to Riverhawk Investments Limited. Sir Harry Djanogly stepped down as Chairman in 2003, replaced by former CEO Martin Flower. Mike Smithyman was appointed CEO in late 2003. In 2004 Chairman Martin Flower's resigned leaving Gary Weiss as the newly appointed Chairman.
