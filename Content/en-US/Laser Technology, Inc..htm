   Beware the leadfoot: This company gives cops a feel for how fast you're driving. Laser Technology, Inc. (LTI) makes laser-based speed and distance measuring systems, most notably the handheld speed guns used by police to nab lead-footed drivers. The company also makes survey and mapping systems that can be integrated with software for recordkeeping and data analysis. Other products include docking aids (to measure distance and speed) used on ships and

   space shuttles, and recreational rangefinders. It also makes tilt and compass sensors for measuring heights and azimuth bearings. The company's primary customers are government and law enforcement agencies.

   David Williams was working at his brother DeWorth Williams' venture capital firm in 1985 when he was asked to raise start-up money for International Measurement and Control Company to survey and map ship channels. A conflict soon arose between International's president and some shareholders. David took charge of the company, which in 1989 became Laser Technology, Inc. (LTI).
  </p>
  <p>
   With Jeremy Dunne at the technology helm, LTI focused on developing products and uses for laser-based measurement devices. In 1991 LTI created its first laser speed-detection system, offering police greater precision than radar-based devices. One of the company's first mapping products, developed in 1992 for the US Forestry Service, let rangers survey trails and campgrounds. LTI went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 a modified version of LTI's speed gun was used to help the space shuttle Atlantis dock with Russia's Mir. Weakening demand in Europe for LTI's products caused sales to stagnate in 1997. A dispute in 1998 over several years of allegedly misstated results led to suspended trading of the company's stock, class-action shareholder lawsuits (settled in 1999), and the resignation of David Williams and the company's auditors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lawsuit left losses for fiscal 1999. Shareholder politics helped cause heavy executive shuffling through 2000. That year, engineering manager Eric Miller was named president and CEO. In 2001 the company began recognizing royalty revenue from the consumer market. That year Bushnell Performance Optics introduced a range-finding device that was co-developed by LTI.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 LTI was taken private by LTI Acquisition, a private company consisting of former executives, current board members, and sports optics equipment maker Kama-Tech.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the buyout, David Williams returned to serve as LTI's CEO, while Eric Miller remained president and took the COO's post.
