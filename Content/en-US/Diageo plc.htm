   Diageo hopes it will be invited to your next party. The company is the leading premium spirits business in the world by volume, net sales, and operating profit. It produces and distributes eight of the world's top 20 spirits brands. Diageo is also one of the few international drinks companies that span the entire beverage alcohol market, offering beer, wine, and spirits. Its well-known brands include Smirnoff vodka, Baileys cream liqueur, Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, José Cuervo tequila, Tanqueray gin, Captain Morgan rum, Guinness beer, and wines from Mey Icki, Chalone, and the Acacia Winery. Diageo products are sold worldwide.

  <p>
   The company divides its operations along geographic lines, with North America accounting for nearly a third of sales. Europe (22%), Asia/Pacific (18%), Africa (12%), and Latin America and the Caribbean (8%) account for the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diageo owns 200-plus production facilities, including malting, distilleries, breweries, packaging, maturation, vineyards, wineries, and distribution, spread across 30 countries.

  <p>
   Diageo has offices in 80 countries and production facilities in North America, Latin America and Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region. It sells products in more than 180 markets in these regions, with subsidiary
   <company id="114873">
    Diageo North America
   </company>
   accounting for about one-third of the sales.

  <p>
   Revenue has been up and down for the company in the last five years. In 2015 revenue rose 5% due higher sales across the board. Despite fluctuating revenue, Diageo has turned in rising profit for the last five years. In 2015 that trend continued with a 13% increase due to the higher sales numbers.

  <p>
   Fundamental to its growth strategy, Diageo aims to sell up to 50% of its products to developing markets by 2015. To that end, Diageo has increased its stake in China's leading white spirits maker, Shui Jing Fang, to 53%. Shui Jing Fang produces of the country's most profitable and fastest-growing spirits, Shanghai White vodka.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has also been focused on the growing American market for whiskey by launching several new brands and product lines. Diageo also purchased the 50% of ultra-premium tequila brand Don Julio that it didn't already own.
  </p>
  <p>
   Declining prices coupled with slow demand in the US and Europe spurred Diageo to pare down
   <company id="117518">
    Diageo Chateau &amp; Estate Wines
   </company>
   , its US wine division, for years before selling it in 2016. Australia's
   <company id="54453">
    Treasury Wine Estates

   paid $552 million for the unit. Other recent divestments include the Gleneagles Hotel and The Old Bushmills Distillery Company.

  <p>
   Diageo -- from the Latin word for "day" and the Greek word for "world" -- was born from Guinness and GrandMet's 1997 merger to fight flat liquor sales and spirited competitors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Guinness began business in 1759 when Arthur Guinness leased a small brewery in Dublin, Ireland.
   <l1>
    Guinness
   </l1>
   began specializing in porters in 1799. Managed by the third generation of Guinnesses, the company went public as a London-based firm in 1886.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s managing director Hugh Beaver was credited with conceiving the
   <i>
    Guinness Book of Records
   </i>
   . During the 1970s Guinness bought more than 200 companies, with disappointing results. Guinness refocused on brewing and distilling operations in the late 1980s by selling noncore businesses and acquiring firms such as Schenley (Dewar's). In 1988 and 1989 it bought 24% of
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton
   </company>
   (later exchanged for 34% of LVMH's wine and spirits business). More acquisitions followed in the 1990s, capped by Guinness' 1997 announcement of its $19 billion merger with
   <l2>
    Grand Metropolitan.
   </l2>
  </p>
  <p>
   GrandMet was established by Maxwell Joseph. In 1931 he began acquiring properties for resale, but WWII slowed his progress. He started buying hotels in 1946, and by 1961 GrandMet had gone public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diversification began in 1970 with the purchases of catering firms, restaurants, and betting shops. In the early 1970s, in what was the largest British takeover to that time, GrandMet bought brewer Truman Hanburg, followed by Watney Mann, which owned International Distillers &amp; Vintners, makers of Bailey's, Bombay Gin, and J&amp;B.
  </p>
  <p>
   GrandMet looked overseas through the 1970s, taking over the Liggett Group, a US cigarette maker (sold 1986) whose Paddington unit was the US distributor of J&amp;B Scotch. In 1987 it bought Heublein (Smirnoff, Lancers, José Cuervo). Two years later it bought The
   <company id="44318">
    Pillsbury
   </company>
   Company (
   <company id="54531">
    Burger King
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10639">
    Green Giant
   </company>
   ) in a hostile takeover.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Guinness and GrandMet combined, creating Diageo and dividing the companies and brands among four divisions: The Pillsbury Company, Burger King, Guinness, and United Distillers &amp; Vintners.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 COO Paul Walsh, a former Pillsbury CEO, took over as CEO of both Diageo and its newly combined alcoholic beverage division, Guinness/UDV. Also that year Diageo, along with fellow wine and spirits producer Pernod Ricard, agreed to pay $8.2 billion to
   <company id="92356">
    Vivendi
   </company>
   for the Seagram's drinks business that holds several brands, including Crown Royal, VO Canadian whiskies, and Sterling Vineyards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Diageo sold its Guinness World Records business to media company
   <company id="102832">
    Gullane Entertainment
   </company>
   for $63 million. That year the company also completed its sale of Pillsbury to General Mills. After months of wrangling with the
   <company id="139112">
    FTC
   </company>
   , Diageo finally won regulatory approval for the Seagram's drinks purchase from Vivendi in 2001. The company gained the Crown Royal, and VO Canadian brands through this purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Diageo completed the sale of its Malibu rum brand to Allied Domecq for about $796 million; the deal also sealed Diageo's ownership of the Captain Morgan rum brand, as Allied Domecq agreed to drop its lawsuit involving Captain Morgan. Diageo discontinued marketing its Captain Morgan Gold rum drink in the US later that year because of disappointing sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2002 Diageo sold Burger King for $1.5 billion to a group composed of
   <company id="51545">
    Texas Pacific Group
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs Capital Partners
   </company>
   . Diageo's decision to sell its Pillsbury unit and its Burger King business (the #2 burger chain, after
   <company id="10974">
    McDonald's
   </company>
   ) was part of the company's new focus on its spirits, wine, and beer businesses. The Pillsbury divestiture gave the company a 33% stake in General Mills (Diageo sold nearly half of its shares in October 2004). Also in 2002 Diageo and Pernod Ricard, which together own rights to the Seagram's brand, sold Seagram's line of nonalcoholic mixers to
   <company id="10359">
    The Coca-Cola Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Diageo and
   <company id="59752">
    Jose Cuervo
   </company>
   said they would jointly sell Don Julio and Tres Magueyes tequilas. Diageo also joined with
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   to purchase 30% of InBev's (now
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev's
   </company>
   ) Namibia Breweries in southern Africa. The brewery will make Heineken and Beck's beer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diageo said in 2003 that it would launch a low-alcohol version of its highly popular Baileys Irish Cream. Known as Baileys Glide, the drink is made with Irish whiskey, but Diageo said it would be manufactured in Germany. Also that year Diageo reopened the George Dickel distillery in Tullahoma, Tennessee. In addition, Diageo cut 150 jobs in 2003 from its Guinness operation amid declining sales of the well-known stout.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Diageo and Heineken formed a partnership for the production and distribution of Guinness in Russia. The company also acquired
   <company id="12943">
    The Chalone Wine Group
   </company>
   in 2005 for about $260 million. It added the winery into Diageo's current US wine operations, which are organized under
   <company id="117518">
    Diageo Chateau &amp; Estate Wines
   </company>
   . Diageo also acquired Netherlands distiller Ursus Vodka for an undisclosed amount and added Bushmills Irish whiskey to its stable, with the purchase of the brand from
   <company id="46900">
    Pernod Ricard
   </company>
   for $363 million. It also agreed to stay out of any negotiations regarding the takeover of Allied Domecq. (In 2005 Pernod Ricard acquired Allied Domecq.) That year it also disposed of its 4% holdings in
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   , saying the investment was not congruent with its business strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company acquired about a 45% stake in Quanxing, which distills the traditional premium Chinese liquor
   <em>
    baijiu
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Diageo formed a 50-50 joint venture with Dutch vodka maker Ketel One, paying €610 million ($900 million) for its interest. The partnership followed Diageo's abandoned plans to bid on Absolut vodka maker
   <company id="92083">
    V&amp;S Group
   </company>
   . (Ultimately the V&amp;S Group was auctioned off to
   <company id="46900">
    Pernod Ricard
   </company>
   by its owner, the Swedish government.) Also that year Diageo took full ownership of D Distribution, the Russian distributor of the Smirnoff and Smirnov brands. It paid about $30 million for the remaining 25% stake held by Alfa Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diageo saw its leadership change in 2008 when Lord James Blyth of Rowington, stepped down as chairman. He was replaced by Franz Humer, who previously served as CEO of F. Hoffmann-La Roche.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Diageo has signaled an interested in acquiring
   <company id="41804">
    Moët Hennessy
   </company>
   , the spirits and wine subsidiary of French luxury conglomerate
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH
   </company>
   ; however, LVMH is not inclined to sell. Diageo owns about 35% of Moët Hennessy. Undeterred from building its liqueurs portfolio, Diageo in mid-2010 increased its interest in the London Group, which supplies the premium NUVO brand of liqueurs, to a little more than 70%. London Group was created through a joint venture between Diageo and New York entrepreneur Raphael Yakoby.
