   NeoMagic is trying to deliver chip magic for everything from smart phones to electronic toll collection systems. The company develops and markets semiconductors, including a family of system-on-chip (SoC) processors sold under the MiMagic brand, and software for audio, video, imaging, graphics, and television. It also provides design services on system and software development that help OEMs bring their products to market. NeoMagic sells through distributors and representatives in the US, the UK, and Asia. Among the company's customers is California-based startup ViV Systems, a home theater developer and manufacturer.

   Startup wizard Kamran Elahian, founder of
   <company id="12986">
    Cirrus Logic
   </company>
   and CAE Systems (engineering software, sold to
   <company id="11444">
    Tektronix
   </company>
   ), started NeoMagic in 1993 with Prakash Agarwal and Deepraj Puan. All had previously held executive positions at Cirrus Logic.
  </p>
  <p>
   NeoMagic shipped the MagicGraph128, the first single-chip graphics subsystem, in 1995. (Cirrus Logic promptly sued, charging misappropriation of trade secrets, among other things; the suit was later settled.) The following year NeoMagic accelerators were chosen by several leading laptop makers, including
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   NeoMagic went public in 1997. That year it introduced versions of MagicGraph offering 3-D graphics and catering to entry-level notebooks. In 1999 NeoMagic bought its way beyond notebook markets into the consumer realm, purchasing the UK-based Optical Drive Development Group (mixed-signal chip design and DVD optical storage products) of Mitel Corporation (now
   <company id="53112">
    Zarlink Semiconductor
   </company>
   ), as well as Israel-based chip developer Associative Computers Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 NeoMagic shifted its strategy to making processors for wireless communications devices and Internet appliances, discontinuing its previous product line. As part of the shift, the company sold its DVD drive product line to LSI Logic (now
   <company id="13932">
    LSI Corp.
   </company>
   ) and cut a third of its workforce later that year. The following year Elahian resigned. Later in 2001 NeoMagic announced the first in its MiMagic series of chips for handheld appliances. Also that year the company acquired the assets of LinkUp Systems, a designer of chip cores based on
   <company id="56243">
    ARM Holdings
   </company>
   ' RISC processor designs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prakash Agarwal resigned as president, CEO, and a director in 2005. He was succeeded as president and CEO by Doug Young, who was the company's VP of worldwide sales. Young also was named to the board of directors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold the rights to four patents to chip giant
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   for $1.4 million. In addition to the cash, NeoMagic received non-exclusive, worldwide licenses to the patents.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 NeoMagic laid off nearly all employees and suspended most operations. The company terminated 92 employees in 2008, unable to raise any additional capital. NeoMagic commenced winding down operations by making shipments to customers and preserving assets that may be sold to pay off creditors. The winds of change came in January 2010 when all ties with president and CEO Douglas Young were severed. The company's COO since 2007, Syed Zaidi stepped in as president and interim CEO.
