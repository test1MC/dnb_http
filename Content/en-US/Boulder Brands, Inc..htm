   Trying to reach the pinnacle of healthy eating? Boulder Brands may help; its growing portfolio of food brands target the health conscious and those with health problems, such as diabetes and gluten allergies. The company makes Smart Balance buttery spreads and other alternative food products, including peanut butter, popcorn, and cooking oils. As the company has grown, its Smart Balance business has been outweighed by its Natural foods segment, including the Glutino, Gluten-Free Pantry, Udi's, Earth Balance, and the EVOL brands of shelf-stable and frozen products. Boulder Brands' products are sold by food retailers throughout North America. Founded in 2005, the company was acquired by
   <company id="162901">
    Pinnacle Foods
   </company>
   in January 2016.

   In January 2016,
   <company id="162901">
    Pinnacle Foods
   </company>
   , which makes Duncan Hines cake mixes, Birds Eye frozen vegetables, and Synder snacks, acquired Boulder Brands. Boulder Brands had been exploring strategic alternatives for a few months.

  <p>
   The company has two operating segments based on product, including: Smart Balance (spreads, butter, grocery, and milk); and Natural comprised of Earth Balance, Glutino, and Udi's branded products.

   While the Boulder-based company sells its products in the US, UK, and Canada, it rings up nearly 90% of its sales in the US.

   Boulder Brands mostly sells its products through food wholesalers and supermarket chains. The company's largest customers in 2014 were
   <company id="52266">
    United Natural Foods
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , which made up 17% and 12% of gross sales, respectively. Other

  <p>
   Its US-based grocery, military, drug, and mass market channels are primarily sold through the sales agency
   <company id="109683">
    Acosta Inc.
   </company>
   , while Presence Marketing is the primary sales agency for the company's natural channels in the US. In Canada, the company has sales representatives that sell to the club channel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boulder spent $3.4 million on advertising in 2014, significantly less than the $8.4 million and $15.2 million spent in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

   Boulder Brands has enjoyed growing revenue in recent years as its Natural product sales continued to climb while Smart Balance product sales have mostly declined. Revenue in 2014 jumped by 12% to $516.63 million, mostly as Natural product sales jumped by more than 30%, driven by higher Udi and EVOL product sales. Glutino products and Smart Balance brands, however, suffered slight sales declines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite higher revenue in 2014, the company reported a loss of $127 million (its first loss since 2010), mostly due to a $150 million impairment charge related to the goodwill of the Smart Balance segment, driven by a brand decline and underperformance of the Smart Balance brand products. In 2013, net income had spiked by 148% on higher sales, lower marketing, restructuring, acquisitions, and integration-related costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations fell by 43% to $19 million, mostly due to a combination of lower earnings and because the company used more cash to increase its inventories and pay down its payables and accrued expenses.

   Boulder Brands have been diversifying its healthy product lines beyond just the Smart Balance brand in recent years. Following its purchase of Udi's Healthy Foods, the company changed its name from Smart Balance to Boulder Brands in January 2013 and relocated its corporate headquarters to Boulder, Colorado in the summer. The name change was meant to reflect the company's multibrand focus following the acquisition of Udi's, a maker of gluten-free bread and bakery products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since its re-brand, the company has continued its active acquisition schedule, adding high-growth natural food companies to its portfolio of products. It wound down its Bestlife spreads business, although it retains a health and wellness, subscription-based website (bestlife.com) under the Bestlife name. With its knack for investing in new natural brands, the company has also formed the Boulder Brands Investment Group to target early-stage growth companies in the natural and organic food and beverage industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boulder has also been expanding its distribution beyond just retail stores. In 2014, for example, it partnered with
   <company id="89521">
    Pizza Hut
   </company>
   to launch new varieties of gluten-free pizza, making Pizza Hut the first major pizza chain to use procedures approved by the Gluten Intolerance Group.
  </p>

  <p>
   Fast-growing Boulder Brands has diversified its brand portfolio through acquisitions. In October 2014, the company purchased Real Food Matters for $0.8 million, which specializes in natural foods research, product development and commercialization for retail food brands, food manufacturers, and restaurant concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In December 2013, Boulder Brands acquired EVOL Foods from owner Phil's Fresh for about $48.9 million. Based in Boulder, EVOL Foods makes and markets frozen foods that are antibiotic-, hormone-, and GMO-free, and have no artificial preservatives or flavors. In July 2013, the company bought an 80% stake in GlucoBrands, LLC, the owner of Level Life foods for $2.4 million.  Level Life makes diabetic-friendly convenience foods for the daily management of diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spying the rapidly rising gluten-free food aisle, in mid-2012 the company acquired $60-million-in-sales Udi's Healthy Foods for $125 million in cash from Hubson Acquisition (an affiliate of buyout specialist E&amp;A Industries), and the family of founder Udi Bar-on and other minority stakeholders. Denver-based Udi's is primarily known for gluten-free bread and bakery products. A year earlier, Boulder Brands took over another, albeit smaller, gluten-free foods purveyor Canada-based Glutino Food Group, for $66.3 million. Glutino makes and sells premium-priced, gluten-free snacks, frozen baked goods and entrees, and baking mixes. Both deals extend the company's footprint in the retail market, and food service outlets, as well as its distribution reach into Canada, formerly a less significant market. Glutino's addition also bolts on one of only a few manufacturing facilities in North America that exclusively make gluten-free products.
