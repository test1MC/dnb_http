   Cancer patient? Midatech Pharma US (formerly DARA BioSciences) is looking to help. The drug development company is dedicated to  providing healthcare professionals with a synergistic portfolio of medicines to help cancer patients adhere to their therapy and manage side effects arising from cancer treatments. Formerly called Point Therapeutics, the firm failed in its previous efforts to advance lead cancer drug talabostat and was forced to regroup and consider its options. The company turned to its preclinical pipeline, which included a potential diabetes drug, and then in 2008 executed a reverse merger with privately held DARA BioSciences. The company was acquired by UK-based Midatech Pharma in 2015.
