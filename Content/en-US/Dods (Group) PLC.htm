   Dods (Group) knows a thing or two about parliamentary procedure. The political communications company provides information and services for policy makers in formats such as print (magazines, directories, newsletters, and books), digital (websites, monitoring, and databases), and events (seminars, conferences, and award ceremonies). Publication titles include
   <em>
    The Parliament Magazine
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Who's Who in Public Affairs
   </em>
   , while websites include politicshome.com and theparliamentmagzine.eu. In addition, Dods's Westminster Explained unit provides Parliament and policy training.  The company does business in the UK and other parts of Europe, and was formed in 2001.

  <p>
   Following an assessment of go-to-market effectiveness, Dods introduced a client portfolio approach alongside the existing product sales method. The company rejigged its events and training business to make it more specialized and scaleable.
