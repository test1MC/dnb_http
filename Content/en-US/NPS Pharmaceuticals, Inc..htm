   Those suffering from intestinal failure are rooting for NPS Pharmaceuticals. The drug development company has a handful of candidates in development for gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders, focusing on rare conditions with few available treatment options. Lead candidates Gattex (teduglutide) is a treatment for short bowel syndrome, a rare gastrointestinal disorder. Another, Natpara, is being studied as a treatment for a hormone deficiency disorder known as hyperparathyroidism. The company outsources much of its research; it also often partners with or licenses candidates to larger firms to help fund late-stage development and commercialization efforts.
   <company id="56567">
    Shire
   </company>
   bought NPS Pharma for $5.2 billion in 2015.

  <p>
   The deal marked the largest acquisition to-date for Shire, which has been on a buying spree as it moves towards becoming a $10 billion earner. It also strengthens Shire's portfolio of treatments for rare diseases.

   Through its partnerships, NPS earns royalties on product sales once a candidate reaches commercialization stages or from milestone and license fees on partnered development candidates. Royalties from drugs licensed to third parties account for the majority of the company's revenues. Among its development successes: NPS worked with
   <company id="12623">
    Amgen
   </company>
   and the pharmaceutical unit of
   <company id="41768">
    Kirin Brewery
   </company>
   to develop thyroid drug Sensipar (also known as Mimpara or Regpara). NPS' osteoporosis drug Preotact is approved for use in Europe and is marketed by
   <company id="56037">
    Takeda
   </company>
   , and the company has a similar agreement with
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen
   </company>
   for pain treatment Nucynta.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the proprietary development programs for Gattex and Natpara, drug candidates in NPS' pipeline include potential treatments for disorders of the central nervous system, Crohn's disease, and osteoporosis.

   Products developed by NPS Pharmaceuticals are sold in North America, Europe, and Asia (primarily through licensing partners). It handles direct sales of Gattex in the US market.

   Following FDA approval of Gattex in 2012, NPS established a small sales force of about 30 representatives. The sales team focuses on promoting Gattex to gastrointestinal specialists. The company has also established a distribution network consisting of specialty pharmacy firms that have the capacity to deliver home infusion drugs to patients (such as
   <company id="58258">
    Accredo
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="51404">
    BioScrip
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="42071">
    Coram
   </company>
   ).

  <p>
   Despite increased earnings in recent years on income from royalties, licensing, and milestone payments (including a 29% revenue increase to $131 million in 2012), NPS has yet to post a profit because so much of its revenue goes directly back into research and development. Since its inception, NPS has incurred losses of more than $990 million and it expects to continue to lose money for several years to come as it furthers its development projects, especially those related to bringing Gattex and Natpara to market in the US.

  <p>
   The firm's focus on rare diseases gives it limited competitive exposure, while its outsourcing and partnership strategy allows it to streamline its infrastructure and expend its resources on development rather than commercialization efforts. For example, granting non-US marketing rights for Gattex to Swiss firm Nycomed is helping to fund that drug's development. In addition to developing new compounds, NPS is working to extend applications for existing drugs; for instance, it aims to gain approval for Gattex's use in pediatric patients with SBS.

   The company took a one-time payment of $25 million from Amgen in 2012 in exchange for its royalty rights for Sensipar.
