   Branching out from its original "takes a licking" designs, Timex is strapping on fresh faces so it can tap new markets worldwide. The nation's largest watch manufacturer has expanded its lines from simple, low-cost watches to include high-tech tickers capable of paging or downloading computer data. Its sports watches have gone upscale and gadgety with its Expedition and Ironman lines. The company also makes and markets thermostats, pedometers, and weather instruments. Through a licensing agreement, Timex makes watches for

   , among others. Timex Group USA is a subsidiary of Dutch holding company Timex Group B.V.

   Timex Group and its rivals are facing an uphill battle as ubiquitous cell phones replace watches as time tellers, particularly for younger people. To stay relevant, the company has focused on fashion and niche markets, such as sports watches. In 2014 the watchmaker expanded its Timex GPS portfolio with the launch of Timex Marathon GSP, and the Timex Ironman Run Trainer, a next-generation GPS-enabled watch that tracks pace, distance, heart rate, and elapsed time. It also entered into the Smartwatch space, with the introduction of Timex Ironman One GPS+, wearable technology, which gives consumers stand-alone wireless connectivity without a phone.

  <p>
   Also, Timex has partnered with apparel retailer
   <company id="40243">
    J. Crew
   </company>
   to update vintage Timex military watches from the 1940s and 1950s to sell in the retailer's stores. Also, looking to update its products portfolio with an established name as it battles face to face with the likes of
   <company id="91992">
    Swatch
   </company>
   , Timex sells a Versace-brand high-end watch in India. The move allows Timex to chase after a double-digit growth rate there through a variety of initiatives including new product introductions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The watchmaker is also extending its reach into licensing and upscale niche markets as Timex targets women who wear several styles of watches depending on the occasion.

   Mostly in the sports arena, Timex regularly sponsors events to keep its name in front of time-conscious consumers. The company has been the official timing sponsor for the

   New York City Marathon, a prestigious honor that competitor

   also had also enjoyed.

  <p>
   Previously, Timex purchased the Marc Ecko watch trademark in 2009 to diversify its brand names. Prior to the deal, Timex had been the licensee of the fashion firm's branded watches since 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   Timex was founded in 1854.
