  <p>
   Koch's business strategy centers around owning diverse businesses which are in different stages of maturity and perform in complementary business cycles. This strategy has enabled it to maintain a strong financial position and to continue growing over many years.
  </p>
  <p>
   A large portion of Koch's revenues are from manufacturing automobile parts for such major auto OEM suppliers as
   <company id="57867">
    Visteon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="57829">
    Delphi
   </company>
   . Koch has continued to focus on developing greener, lighter, more cost-effective vehicle-related components. Its investment has helped to sustain its competitive position, and improve the profit margins of core lines.
