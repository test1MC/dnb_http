   You say Danone, I say Dannon; let's call the whole thing one of the largest dairy food and water producers in the world. The company is organized around four core activities: Fresh Dairy Products, Waters, Early Life Nutrition and Medical Nutrition. The #1 maker of fresh dairy products worldwide, Danone sells dozens of global and regional yogurt brands, including top-sellers Dannon and Activia, functional brands like Actimel and DanActive, and Greek yogurt brands Oikos and Danio. The company's evian, Volvic, Aqua water brands (among others) make it #2 worldwide in bottled water, and Danone is also the world's #2 baby nutrition company. Its medical nutrition products are #1 in Europe. In 2016 Danone agreed to acquire organic food giant
   <company id="61086">
    WhiteWave Foods
   </company>
   for $12.5 billion.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Danone operates more than 190 production plants worldwide. The Fresh Dairy Products segment contributes about half of all sales, and comprises a variety of product lines including Greek-style yogurt, functional brands, indulgent brands, and brands aimed at adolescents. Early Life Nutrition and Waters contribute around 20% to total revenue each. The former makes products for the first 1,000 days of an infant's life (including Aptamil and Nutrilon brands), and the latter worldwide and regional bottled water brands.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Paris-based Groupe Danone is a force in dairy, water, and nutrition products in more than 140 countries worldwide. Overall, Groupe Danone rings up around 80% sales in Europe and ALMA (the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa). The remainder comes from the CIS countries (former Soviet Republics) and North America. Argentina, Russia and Mexico are the group's fastest growing markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Danone approaches the market through distribution aimed at major retail chains and commercial sales points. The Early Life and Medical Nutrition products are also sold through specialized distribution channels such as hospitals and pharmacies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Danone's top ten customers accounted for some 18% of consolidated sales, and the top five accounted for 12%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   <em>
    Note: Growth rates may differ after conversion to US Dollars.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, strong regional dynamics helped the group's sales increase 6.0% to €22.4 billion on prior year. By segment, growth was uneven: Waters and Early Life and Medical Nutrition saw upwards of 10% revenue growth, while Fresh Dairy Products, the largest segment, fell -0.6% to €11.0 billion. Sales of Volvic in Q4 were helped by a Star Wars™ tie-in. Two percentage points of the total sales growth came from exchange rate effects, accounting for which revenue was a lower (but still positive) 4.4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geographically, the strongest growth was in the ALMA region (the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa) at nearly €1 billion on prior year, to over €9 billion - indeed, this increase saw the region marginally overtake Europe (€8.9 billion) as the biggest revenue source. In the CIS (former Soviet states) &amp; North America region, revenue fell 1.2%. While like-for-like growth was up in North America, the current instability and weak macroeconomics in the CIS states saw sales fall.
  </p>
  <p>
   China is proving a tricky market for Danone. Sales of its Mizone water brand have shrunk, and while exports of Early Life products, like Aptamil and Nutrilon, from Europe have done well among Chinese consumers, Dumex, Danone's Early Life brand actually aimed at the Chinese market, is struggling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall net income rose 11.6% in 2015 to €1.4 billion, broadly in line with the rise in revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities was €2.4 billion in 2015, up 8.2% on 2015 on the back of higher sales and an increase in operating margin, as well as favourable exchange rate effects.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Amid difficult market conditions, Danone is focusing resources on its strengths. To this end, the company is investing in growing its product lines in its high-growth markets of Indonesia, China, Russia, the US, Mexico and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   A holistic approach to marketing supports Fresh Dairy, Waters and Early Life that seeks to promote dairy, hydration and infant nutrition respectively as essential to general good health. A large part of Danone's Fresh Dairy Product and Early Life Nutrition strategy is to demonstrate the relevance of its products to its target market demographics through consensus among opinion leaders and healthcare professionals. An Early Life-specific strategy is to create associations between nutrition and taste in infants. To promote the value of water, and hydration more generally, Danone runs a 'Hydration for Health' scientific platform to facilitate discussion among scientists as to the importance of hydration to a healthy lifestyle. Tying into this strategy is Danone's R&amp;D wing, which includes two international research centres (France, the Netherlands) and six specialized centres (France, Singapore, Spain, Russia, China), and which collaborates with external bodies like universities to conduct research on the links between food, nutrition and health.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has specific segment strategies. Fresh Dairy constantly refreshes its product lines in terms of taste, texture and packaging to reach new consumer groups, in accordance with its 'Nutriplanet' nutrition map that identifies nutritional deficiencies in target markets for the purpose of product-tailoring. Products in the Waters segment, including flavoured waters such as the Volvic Touch of Fruit range, are promoted as healthier alternatives to sodas and other sweetened beverages. Danone's Medical Nutrition strategy differs from the other four in that it takes a geographical approach, with expansion into new markets key. It also looks to capitalise on structural factors, like population aging, new diseases and an increase in screening procedures.

  <p>
   Danone agreed to acquire
   <company id="61086">
    WhiteWave Foods
   </company>
   , an organic food company, in mid-2016 for $12.5 billion. The acquisition represents a step into the sustainable, environmentally conscious food market and makes Danone the world's largest producer of organic foods. WhiteWave makes dairy alternatives, including brands such as Silk, So Delicious, and Alpro. The acquisition is expected to close by year end.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were no notable acquisitions in 2015, but in 2014 it acquired a 40% stake in Brookside Dairy, East Africa's largest dairy producer, and a 25% stake in Yashili International, a Chinese instant formula firm.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1965 Antoine Riboud replaced his uncle as chairman of family-run Souchon-Neuvesel, a Lyons, France-based maker of glass bottles. Antoine quickly made a mark in this field -- he merged the firm with Boussois, a major French flat-glass manufacturer, creating BSN in 1966.
  </p>
  <p>
   Antoine enlarged BSN's glass business and filled the company's bottles by acquiring well-established beverage and food concerns. In 1970 BSN purchased Brasseries Kronenbourg (France's largest brewer), Société Européenne de Brasseries (another French brewer), and Evian (mineral water, France). The 1972 acquisition of Glaverbel (Belgium) gave BSN 50% of Europe's flat-glass market. The next year BSN merged with France's Gervais Danone (yogurt, cheese, Panzani pasta; founded in 1919 and named after founder Isaac Carasso's son Daniel). This moved the company into pan-European brand-name foods.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increasing energy costs depressed flat-glass earnings, so BSN began divesting its flat-glass businesses. In the late 1970s it acquired interests in brewers in Belgium, Spain, and Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   BSN bought Dannon, the leading US yogurt maker (co-founded by Daniel Carasso, who had continued making Danone yogurt in France until WWII), in 1982. It established a strong presence in the Italian pasta market by buying stakes in Ponte (1985) and Agnesi (1986). BSN also purchased Generale Biscuit, the world's #3 biscuit maker (1986), and RJR Nabisco's European cookie and snack-food business (1989).
  </p>
  <p>
   In a series of acquisitions starting in 1986, BSN took over Italy and Spain's largest mineral water companies and several European pasta makers and other food companies. Adopting the name of its leading international brand, BSN became Groupe Danone in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Antoine's son, Franck, succeeded him as chairman in 1996 and restructured the company to focus on three core businesses: dairy, beverages (specifically water and beer), and biscuits. By 1997 Danone had begun shedding non-core grocery products. The company simultaneously stepped up acquisitions of dairy, beer, biscuit, and water companies in developing markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1998 purchase of AquaPenn Spring Water for $112 million doubled its US water-bottling production capacity. Danone in 1999 completed a merger and subsequent sale of part of its BSN Emballage glass-packaging unit to UK buyout firm CVC Capital Partners for $1.2 billion; Danone retained 44% ownership. Thirsty for the #2 spot in US bottled water sales, Danone gulped down McKesson Water (the #3 bottled water firm in the US, after Nestlé and
   <company id="108178">
    Suntory
   </company>
   ) for $1.1 billion in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2000 Danone's joint venture Finalrealm (which includes several European equity firms), along with Burlington Biscuits, Nabisco, and
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (then called Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst), acquired 87% of leading UK biscuit maker
   <company id="90455">
    United Biscuits
   </company>
   . Danone then bought Naya (bottled water, Canada) and sold its brewing operations (#2 in Europe) to
   <company id="90370">
    Scottish &amp; Newcastle
   </company>
   (later acquired by
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   and
   <company id="114222">
    Carlsberg
   </company>
   ) for more than $2.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2001 Danone announced restructuring would shutter two LU biscuit plants and eliminate about 1,800 jobs; the move met with strikes and legal battles. That same year, having been bumped to the #2 spot in the US yogurt market (after
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   ' Yoplait brand), Danone acquired 40% of
   <company id="103880">
    Stonyfield Farm
   </company>
   , the #4 yogurt brand in the US, and ultimately came to own 84% of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company launched 2002 with a series of beverage acquisitions, including Frucor (New Zealand) and Zywiec Zdroj (the top brand of water in Poland). Danone then struck a deal handing
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   the distribution and marketing of Evian in North America and formed a joint venture with Coke to distribute its lower-end water brands. Antoine Riboud died that same year at the age of 83.
  </p>
  <p>
   Danone divested noncore companies during 2002, including the sale of its Italian meat and cheese business, Galbani, and its Kro Beer Brands (Kronenbourg, 1664 brands) to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Then, typical of its consolidation strategy, later in 2002 Danone acquired the home and office water delivery companies Chateaud'eau (France), Patrimoine des Eaux du Quebec (Canada), and Canada's Sparkling Spring (now
   <company id="58084">
    Aquaterra
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Danone sold its 10% interest in the Australian dairy firm National Foods. Later that year it announced an alliance with Japanese dairy group Yakult Honsha to focus both companies' efforts with probiotics. Danone is a 20% shareholder of Yakult and has agreed not to increase its share holdings of Yakult for five years and not to pursue majority control for another five. Also in 2004 Danone acquired the Mexican bottled water company, Arco Iris.
  </p>
  <p>
   While its dairy and water businesses bubbled along nicely, Danone found its cookies crumbling. Opting for a new recipe, in 2004 it joined with Argentine food giant ARCOR Group to merge both companies' biscuits operations in South America. Later that same year, Danone sold off its W&amp;R Jacob Ltd. biscuits operations in Ireland to local company Fruitfield Foods. It also sold Italaquae, its Italian bottled water business, to LGR Holding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Long after its departure from brewing, in 2004 Danone was fined €1.5 million for forming a beer distribution cartel along with
   <company id="41852">
    Heineken
   </company>
   in 1996. In 2005 Danone and Coca-Cola ended their 2002 water-distribution joint venture, with Coke buying out Danone's 49% share for about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Danone got out of the brewing business altogether, with the sale of its 33% stake in Spanish brewer
   <company id="100423">
    Mahou
   </company>
   . It sold its HP Foods Group, including Amoy, Lea &amp; Perrins, and HP sauce brands, to
   <company id="10693">
    Heinz
   </company>
   and its biscuits businesses in the UK and Ireland. That year it sold its US home and office water-delivery company,
   <company id="110333">
    DS Waters of America
   </company>
   , to investment firm
   <company id="99303">
    Kelso &amp; Company
   </company>
   . Danone has increased its ownership of Russian dairy and beverage company
   <company id="105712">
    Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods
   </company>
   to almost 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to slow sales for its chilled products and competition from lower-priced brands, in 2006 Danone introduced Senjà (a soy-based yogurt) in France. It acquired Egyptian fresh dairy products company Olait (which it renamed Danone Dairy Egypt) and Algerian bottled water company Tessala. On the Asian front, Danone acquired 23% of fruit-drink company China Huiyuan Juice Group and 51% of Wahaha. (It sold its interest in Huiyuan Juice in 2010.) In the Ukraine, it bought fresh dairy company JSC Molochnyi Zavod. In the US, it launched the Activia brand yogurt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because it wants to introduce more organic products in Europe, in 2006 Danone announced the spending of $66 million on the expansion of its subsidiary
   <company id="103880">
    Stonyfield Farm
   </company>
   's New Hampshire production plant. (That year, Stonyfield bought a 34% interest in Irish organic dairy, Glenisk.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Danone sold its Amoy Asian sauce and chilled foods business to
   <company id="55924">
    Ajinomoto
   </company>
   , exiting the sauce business altogether. It then sold virtually all of its grocery activities, glass-container business, its cheese and cured meat activities (Galbani), and its beer activities in Europe. It also sold New Zealand biscuits maker Griffins Food to investment firm Pacific Equity Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Danone paid €12 billion (about $16 billion) for Numico, maker of infant food and medical nutrition (nutritional bars and shakes) in 2007. The Numico products (Cow &amp; Gate, Dumex, Mellin, milupa, NUTRICIA) joined Danone's blédina baby-food brand to create a wide array of well-known nutritional products for babies and adults. The purchase made Danone the largest baby-food maker in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to announcing the Numico purchase, Danone announced the sale of its cookie business to
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft Foods
   </company>
   ; that deal closed in late 2007. At the time, some analysts saw Danone as ripe for a takeover; hence, the Numico deal was construed as a way for Danone to remain independent. (The acquisition was viewed as helping ward off predators who might have been attracted to the cash that Danone accrued as a result of the Kraft deal.) As part of its strategy to divest itself of all biscuit/cookie activities, in 2009 the company ended its Indian joint venture with the Wadia Group. Danone sold its 50% interest in the operation, ABI Holdings, to Wadia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strengthening its business in Asia, in 2007 Danone acquired all of the Japanese joint venture with
   <company id="55924">
    Ajinomoto
   </company>
   and Calpis that it did not already own. Renamed Danone Japan, the operation manufactures fresh products for the expanding Japanese dairy market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saying it wanted to "regain room for maneuver[ing]," in 2007 it sold off its 20% stake in and terminated its distribution agreement with Shanghai-based
   <company id="147781">
    Bright Dairy
   </company>
   . Danone cited no specifics surrounding the move, but the company has had legal disputes with various joint-venture partners in China and India recently, relating to how its brands are marketed and produced.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2007 the company exited its joint venture with Chinese company
   <company id="147580">
    Mengniu Dairy Group
   </company>
   , citing time frame and other condition difficulties. (Both companies agreed to the termination of the venture, which was initiated in 2006.) Turning to South America that same year, Danone acquired a 70% holding in Chile's fresh dairy company, Vialat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among its divestments in 2008, in order to fulfill European Union requirements for its acquisition of Numico, the company sold off its French baby milk and baby drinks businesses to
   <company id="54346">
    Groupe Lactalis
   </company>
   . That year it also sold its subsidiary, Frucor, a maker of non-alcoholic beverages in New Zealand and Australia, as well as its international brands V and Mizone (with the exception of in China and Indonesia) to
   <company id="52517">
    Suntory
   </company>
   for some €600 million ($780 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   Danone took full control of its South African joint venture, Danone Clover, in 2009. It purchased Clover's 45% stake for R1,085 ($145 million). (Clover is one of South Africa's largest dairy companies.) Other partnerships include a joint venture with
   <company id="53912">
    Weight Watchers
   </company>
   formed in 2008. The 51% Weight Watchers-49% Danone operation provides weight-management services to the People's Republic of China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following its acquisition of a controlling interest in a venture with Russia's Unimilk in 2010, Danone sold its 18.4% stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods back to the Russian dairy and juice producer for $470 million.
