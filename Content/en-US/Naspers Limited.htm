   Africa just isn't a big enough continent to contain Naspers. The media company operates primarily in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, but also does business in Asia, Europe, and South America. Through several subsidiaries and ownership stakes in foreign companies, Naspers offers Internet content (e-commerce websites and classified ads), pay TV, and print publishing. Its largest stakes are in Russian email provider

   and Chinese ISP

    Tencent

   . Its MultiChoice unit provides cable and satellite TV to more than 7 million households in about 50 countries across Africa, while its print media division publishes books, magazines, and newspapers.

   Outside of Africa, the company has operations in Brazil, China, Eastern Europe, India, the Netherlands, Russia, and Thailand. Altogether it provides services in more than 130 countries.

   When converted to US dollars, Naspers has experienced revenue growth for the past five fiscal years, since 2009. Its Internet business is its largest and fastest-growing segment, accounting for about 45% of sales. The pay TV division makes up 40% of sales, while the print media division (which only operates in South Africa and through a minority stake in Abril, a Brazilian magazine publisher) accounts for the remaining 15%.

  <p>
   As a holding company, Naspers mainly grows through acquisitions and equity stakes in companies in emerging markets. It also plans to focus on investment in technology; the company has worked to upgrade and improve its subscriber and user platforms by investing in e-commerce transaction platforms and instant-messaging communication.

   The company also sees growth opportunity in the market for digital cable subscribers. With limited broadband infrastructure and almost no cable access in Africa, Naspers is able to provide cable, satellite and other pay-TV services such as mobile TV.
