   Metsäliitto Group supplies and produces an array of wood and wood-based products from Nordic wood. The company operates in five segments: tissue and cooking paper, paperboard, pulp, wood products, and wood supply and forest services. An affiliate, Vapo also supplies bio fuels. The company does business in some 30 countries; its sales force serves industrial construction, fine paper and box board manufacturing, a range of consumer packaging, as well as household to institutional end uses. The group is held by Metsäliitto Cooperative, a union of 120,000 members who own about half of the private forests in Finland.

   Like most companies within the manufacturing sector, Metsäliitto Group grows by augmenting its manufacturing capacity. In 2015 Metsä Fibre, part of Metsä Group, started construction of a bioproduct mill in Äänekoski, Finland, in the area of an existing pulp mill. The mill is scheduled to be completed during the third quarter of 2017.
