   Joy Mining's products are used in the mining and processing of coal, potash, salt, trona and other minerals and ores. The company also maintains an extensive network of service and distribution centers to rebuild and service equipment and to sell replacement parts and consumables in support of its installed base. This network includes five domestic  service centers and eight international locations, all of which are strategically located in major underground mining regions.

   Joy Mining's underground machinery represents nearly 55% of its parent's annual sales. Despite its global presence (and the optimism its name implies), Joy confronts mix demand for commodities, and so the need for mining equipment, as the economic recovery flags. Its challenges include volatile copper prices coupled with cyclical steel production. With the uptick in ore and oil prices, Joy is counting on these producers to continue at full capacity, thus mitigating the downturn suffered in other mining sectors.

  <p>
   The foundation for Joy Mining Machinery was laid when inventor Joseph F. Joy received a patent for his mechanical gathering arm loader in 1919.
