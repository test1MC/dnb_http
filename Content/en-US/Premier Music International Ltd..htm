   Premier Music International (PMI) is one company making it possible for people to march to any number of different drummers. PMI makes drums, drum sets, and accessories under the Premier and Cabria names. The company's products are distributed across seven continents through those who sell musical instruments and other specialty retail outlets. PMI cut its teeth on the growing demand for drum kits brought on by the birth of cool in the 1920s. PMI is owned and operated by the descendants of company founder Alberta Della Porta, and continues to grow its operations.

   In 2014 PMI released a selection of three-piece Modern Classic drumset that look retro, produce clean tones, and have a modern build quality. The origins of the Modern Classic date back to 2001, when it was launched as a dedicated snare range inspired by classic drum designs. The all-new Modern Classic drumset draws on the concept of the original snare drums, and are the result of a creative collaboration between master craftsman Keith Keough and legendary British drummer Steve White. Modern Classic kits are offered as three-piece shell packs: the Bebop 18 and Bebop 20 come with 8×12 and 14×14 toms and either a 14×18 or 14×20 bass drum, respectively. The Concert Master 22 is made up of an 8×13' rack tom, a 14×16 floor tom, and a 14×22 bass drum.The company moved into marching products and orchestral items in 2013.

   In late 2011 PMI purchased KD Drums, known for its custom-built snare drums and drum sets. The move helps the company expand its business as one of the world's top drum makers and allows it to return to its roots as a UK manufacturer. As part of PMI's takeover of KD Drums, it formed The Premier Drum Company Limited, a unit focused on research and development. While the company continues to source products in Asia through suppliers, PMI has supplemented its manufacturing operations by launching exclusively-British production from a new Lancashire factory in 2012.

   Albert Della Porta founded PMI in 1922 as Premier Drums, changing its name in 1984.
