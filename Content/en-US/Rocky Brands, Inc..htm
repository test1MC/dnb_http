Its footwear brands include Rocky, Georgia Boot, Creative Recreation, Durango, Lehigh, and licensed brand Michelin. The company targets six markets: outdoor, duty, work, military, lifestyle, and western. (Its Rocky brand is sold to the US military.) A wholesaler and retailer, the company's products are sold in the US and Canada through more than 10,000 retail stores, such as sporting goods and outdoor stores (

   ,

    Cabela's
   </company>
   ), mass merchandisers, and farm store chains. It also sells Lehigh-brand footwear online and through mobile and outlet stores. Brothers William and F. M. Brooks founded Rocky in 1932.

  <p>
   The company's products are sold through three business segments: wholesale, retail, and military. The wholesale business accounts for more than 80% of sales. The division distributes its products through a variety of shoe retailers, specialty retailers and sporting goods stores -- in more than 10,000 retail store locations. The retail business accounts for 15% of Rocky's sales, while military makes up the remainder.
  </p>
  <p>
   Product-wise, nearly 50% of Rocky's sales come from its Work footwear products, while Western footwear makes up more than 15% of revenue. Another nearly 15% of revenue comes from Duty and Commercial Military footwear sales.

   Rocky distributes its products mainly in the US, Canada, South America, Europe, and Asia. The US accounts for roughly 95% of Rocky Brands' sales. Canada accounts for most of the rest. The company operates manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. It also sources footwear from China.

   The footwear maker sells shoes through various channels and markets. Its outdoor products are sold through sporting goods stores, including
   <company id="57958">
    Dick's Sporting Goods
   </company>
   , outdoor specialty stores (Cabela's), catalogs, and mass merchants. Its work products are sold at retail uniform stores, catalogs, farm store chains, such as
   <company id="17090">
    Tractor Supply Co
   </company>
   ., and hardware and other specialty shops. Duty products (for law enforcement personnel, postal employees, and others) are sold primarily through uniform stores and specialty catalogs. Military footwear is sold at base exchanges, such as
   <company id="40039">
    Army Air Force Exchange Service
   </company>
   . Western-style footwear is sold at western wear stores, farm and ranch stores and fashion-oriented footwear retailers. Its Lifestyle footwear line targets more fashion-minded urban consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its retail business, Rocky Brands sells its products directly to customers through consumer and business websites, its Lehigh Outfitters retail stores, and a Rocky factory outlet store located in Nelsonville, Ohio. The company also uses sponsorships, media outlets, and grassroots campaigns to promote its Rocky, Georgia Boot, and Durango brands to customers. Rocky's product prices range from $49.99 for value-priced products to $359.99 for premium products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rocky Brands spent $8.62 million on advertising expenses in 2014, or about 7% more than it spent in 2013, and 21% more than it spent in 2012.

  <p>
   Revenue grew for a second-straight year, jumping by 17% to $286.24 million in 2014. The higher sales mostly came from the company's wholesale sales division, which enjoyed a 135% boost in Lifestyle footwear product sales, and 20%-plus sales growth in the Western and Outdoor footwear product lines. Rocky's Work and Commercial military footwear sales also grew by double-digits. The company's Retail business also grew by 3%, mostly from higher business-to-consumer, e-commerce sales.  The Military division, suffered a 10% decline coinciding with the draw-down of military activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rebounded by nearly 34% to $9.85 million -- its highest profit since 2005 -- thanks to higher revenue. Profit had fallen in 2013 after years of growth, mostly due to costs related to the Creative Recreation acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash levels from operations also rebounded sharply, providing $12.98 million in 2014, thanks mostly to higher earnings and because the firm increased its accounts payable and other accrued liabilities balances.

  <p>
   The company has been relying more on its wholesale channel to grow in recent years. Indeed, the company's retail sales were just 15% in 2014, (versus 22% in 2009) while its wholesale business has grown to 82% of sales (from 76% in 2009). As part of its wholesale growth strategy, the company has worked to acquire companies and products that appeal to trending consumer tastes. Indeed, in 2014, nearly one-third of the company's top-line growth came from its Lifestyle footwear line, which grew in large part thanks to the company's acquisition of the popular Creative Recreation brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, the Retail business continues to be a vital part of the company's growth. In 2014, looking to expand the success of its e-commerce channels, Rocky Brands launched digital commerce sites for Rocky Boots, Durango, Georgia Boot, and Creative Recreation brands on the
   <company id="162415">
    Demandware Commerce
   </company>
   platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Rocky Brands is based in the US, it makes and sources its goods overseas and is looking to international markets for growth. The company sources products from manufacturers in Asia, primarily from its 20-year Chinese partner General Shoes US Corporation, which represented some 10% of 2014 sales. Rocky is expanding its retail footprint to Asia, Europe, and South America. It has entered the market in Eastern Europe through an agreement with Rapala, based in Helsinki, Finland. The agreement allows recreational fishing supplier Rapala to distribute Rocky Outdoor-branded hunting boots in Finland, Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Moldova.

  <p>
   In 2013, Rocky Brands purchased select assets from Kommonwealth, Inc., which included the lifestyle footwear brand and trademark Creative Recreation, for $8.7 million. The acquisition expanded the company's product offerings into the fashion-conscious urban footwear market.

  <p>
   The William Brooks Shoe Company was founded in 1932 by brothers William and F.M. Brooks (Mike, the current chairman's great-uncle and grandfather, respectively) to offer shoes for the serious outdoorsman. William bought out Mike and sold the firm to the Irving Drew Shoe Co. in 1959; Mike's son John continued to work for the company. In 1974, after fighting a losing battle against imported shoes, Irving Drew sold the business to John, who was immediately joined by his son Mike.
  </p>
  <p>
   To survive in the cutthroat shoe industry, the Brooks Company created its own niche: handmade rugged shoes. In the 1980s it began using waterproof GORE-TEX insulation, which, along with the "Made in America" tag, made the boots an instant hit. The firm began marketing occupational shoes for police officers and mail carriers in 1983. After expanding production to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico in 1987, the Brooks Company was deep in debt. John, who had resisted growing the company and taking it public, retired in 1991. Two years later the firm adopted Rocky Shoes &amp; Boots as its name and went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 1993 Rocky has doubled its number of styles and outsourced some of its manufacturing to China and Taiwan. The Nelsonville, Ohio, factory outlet opened in 1994 (manufacturing operations there were closed in late 2001). Order delays helped contribute to a financial loss the next year. New products in 1997 included chest and hip waders. In 1999 Rocky continued to expand its casual footwear, introducing Formz comfort sandals. In 2000 the company moved about half of its 112 manufacturing jobs overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rocky began producing military boots under government contract in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company acquired Gates-Mills, a producer of performance outdoor and dress gloves, which kicked off an expansion of Rocky's product line into areas beyond footwear. In January 2005 Rocky purchased EJ Footwear Group for $89.5 million plus $10 million in stock.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company signed a licensing agreement in 2006 to produce a line of men's and women's casual footwear under the Zumfoot brand name for Sole Matters, an operator of nine shoe stores under the Zumfoot banner. Also that year, a deal with Michelin Footwear (a unit of Gear Six LLC) made Rocky the private labeler for Michelin to make and market Michelin-branded footwear in North America.
