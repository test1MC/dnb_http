   Newport helps all sorts of customers take a measured approach. The company makes lasers, precision components, and automated assembly, measurement, and test equipment. It makes products that are used around the world in such fields as fiber-optic communications, health care, life sciences, military/aerospace, scientific research, and semiconductor manufacturing. Industrial and scientific components include lenses and other devices for vibration and motion control. Newport also offers automated systems used to make fiber-optic components and photonics. More than 60% of sales come from outside the US. In 2016 Newport was acquired by

    MKS Instruments

   .

  <p>
   With the acquisition, Newport became a part of MKS. The companies expect $1.4 billion combined annual revenue. The $905 million price covered Newport's shares and about $93 million debt. The deal brings together companies with products in adjacent markets. They plan to cross-sell to each others' markets as well as to develop offerings for new customers.

   Newport operates manufacturing plants stateside and abroad. US plants are located in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Montana, New York, and Utah. Internationally its plants are located in developed and emerging markets in Austria, China, France, Germany, Israel, and Romania.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US is its largest single market, accounting for about 38% of sales. Europe and Asia each are responsible for about a quarter of sales.

   Sales for 2015 (ended January 2016) dropped 4% to $603 million from 2014. Photonics, its biggest revenue generated, managed a 1.5% revenue increase, but Lasers and Optics both had less revenue in 2015. In terms of markets, both microelectronics and life and health sciences sales were lower in 2015 while scientific research sales rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   Newport's profit dropped 11% to $31 million in 2015 from 2014. While administrative and R&amp;D costs were lower in 2015, the company recognized losses in selling a facility and software applications it no longer uses. The cost of eliminating some debt also reduced its profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow generated from operations was $52 million in 2015, down from $58 million in 2014.

   Newport has made several acquisitions to help it shift from a provider of research instruments to one that manufactures both components and integrated systems for research and commercial applications. The company's brands now consist of
   <company id="102187">
    ILX Lightwave
   </company>
   , New Focus, Newport, Ophir, Optimet, Oriel Instruments, Richardson Gratings, Spiricon, and
   <company id="54968">
    Spectra-Physics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also divests businesses that are not considered part of its core operations. In late 2013 it announced plans to sell its Micro Robotics Systems advanced packaging business (MRSI) to a private investment group. MRSI makes turn-key die bonding and dispensing systems, while Newport is focused on lasers, optics and photonics technologies.
