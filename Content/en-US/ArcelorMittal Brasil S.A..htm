   ArcelorMittal Brasil hopes that you can build a BRIC with steel. A subsidiary of the world's largest steel company, ArcelorMittal Brasil is also Brazil's industry leader. The company produces steel from 13 facilities throughout the country and heads up ArcelorMittal's entire South and Central American operations, which include five more plants in Argentina and Uruguay. ArcelorMittal Brasil's strength lies in its long carbon steel production, but it also manufactures flat carbon and stainless steel products. The company produces steel and iron ore more than 11 million and 7 million tons per year respectively. The company is wholly owned by

   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The Brazil segment accounted for 13% of ArcelorMittal's 2014 revenues
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net revenues decreased by 1% due to lower steel prices.

  <p>
   Its former parent company, Arcelor, ;had a foothold in Brazil since 1920 through its interest in the former Companhia Siderúrgica Belgo-Mineira.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Arcelor combined its holdings -- which included Belgo,
   <company id="95158">
    the former Acesita
   </company>
   , Tubarão, and Vego de Sul -- into one entity called Arcelor Brasil. The parent company, like the rest of the international business world, was looking to the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) for expansion. Arcelor settled on Brazil as its best bet and began in 2004 to consolidate its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Arcelor spent most of the first half of 2006 fighting off a hostile takeover bid by the world's No. 1 steel company, Mittal. Its strongest maneuver was the potential acquisition of the Russian company

    Severstal
   </company>
   . That combination also would havestrengthened Arcelor's position in South America, had it gone through.
  </p>
  <p>
   It didn't. Arcelor and Mittal managed to come to terms, and the two giants merged to form a company three times as large as its next biggest competitor. Afterward the combined company offered more than $3 billion to Arcelor Brasil's shareholders to consolidate its ownership in the formerly publicly trade subsidiary. By late 2007 the company owned 100% of the Brazilian unit and changed its name to ArcelorMittal Brasil.
