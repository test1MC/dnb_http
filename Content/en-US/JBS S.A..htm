   Carnivores have a friend in JBS. With a daily slaughter capacity of 86,000 head of cattle, JBS is the world's biggest beef (and pork, poultry, and lamb) processor and exporter. In addition to fresh and processed beef and pork (it is the #3 pork producer in the US), JBS offers cooked and canned meats, ready-to-eat meals, as well as hides and dairy products. JBS sells beef domestically under the Friboi brand. It also owns about 75% of US poultry giant
   <company id="11187">
    Pilgrim's Pride
   </company>
   . JBS exports products worldwide; top markets include Japan, the Middle East and Africa, and Mexico. Positioned as an integrated food company, JBS is expanding in the US and Australia. The Batista family through FB Partiçipacões owns 47% of JBS.

   After nearly two decades in operation, JBS began to expand its business significantly and steadily during the 1970s by purchasing independent slaughterhouses and cattle processing facilities throughout Brazil. These acquisitions continued through the end of the century at which point JBS also began to turn an acquisitive eye toward Argentina.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the Brazilian meat giant took its first step abroad, buying 85% of Swift Armour, Argentina's largest beef processor, for $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company acquired US-based Swift Foods for $225 million and assumed its heavy debt load, estimated at more than $1 billion, a few months after going public on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 JBS acquired Australian-based beef producer Tasman Group for $107 million in cash. Also that year, it bought US processor Smithfield Beef from Smithfield Foods for $565 million. In Europe it formed a 50:50 joint venture with Italy's Cremonini and subsidiary Inalca, with plants in Italy, Russia and Africa, for $328 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 JBS filed with US regulators to hold a $2 billion initial public offering for JBS USA Holdings (It withdrew the proposed IPO in 2011.) Also in 2009 JBS acquired a  64% stake in restructured US poultry producer Pilgrim's Pride for $800 million. Prior to declaring bankruptcy in 2008, Pilgrim was the #1 US chicken producer and, despite selling off some of its operations, was still a huge poultry operation. Other than saying it hoped to increase Pilgrim's competitiveness both domestically and internationally, JBS made no other statement as to Pilgrim's future. In late 2009, JBS acquired Australia's Tatiara Meat Company from the Dutch company,
   <company id="136906">
    VION Food Group
   </company>
   , for $28 million. Tatiara is Australia's largest exporter of fresh lamb meat; it also offers value-added lamb products. It was integrated into JBS's Swift Australia operations. At home, JBS bought #2 Brazilian beef producer Bertin, with 38 plants at home and abroad, in an all-stock deal in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eyeing acquisitions on the other side of the globe, JBS in September 2010 bought Australia's Rockdale Beef from joint owners
   <company id="119680">
    Itoham Foods
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi Corporation
   </company>
   . The deal, valued at about $38 million, boosted the firm's processing capacity by some 550 cattle per day and secured its foothold in the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   In February 2011 Wesley Batista succeeded his brother Joesley Batista as CEO of the company. Wesley, formerly head of the company's US subsidiary, is a 22-year veteran of JBS. Joesley Batista continued as chairman. In March JBS terminated its joint venture with Italy's
   <company id="99138">
    Cremonini
   </company>
   after a protracted dispute by selling its 50% stake in Inalca back to Cremonini for $304 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2012 JBS, through its subsidiary JBS USA Holdings, increased its stake in Pilgrim's Pride to more than 75% through the purchase of nearly 19 million shares owned by Lonnie Bo Pilgrim for about $107 million.
