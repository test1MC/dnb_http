   Vical counts DNA as its main ally in tackling disease. The biopharmaceutical&#160;firm researches and develops vaccines based on its DNA delivery technology, which uses portions of the genetic code of a pathogen to induce an immune response. Vical has a number of drug candidates in its pipeline that it is developing independently and through corporate and government collaborations. Its pipeline is focused on infectious disease, cancer immunotherapies, and cardiovascular disease. Vical is developing Allovectin-7, an immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma.&#160;It gets most of its revenues from a license agreement for TransVax (designed to prevent reactivation of disease after a transplant) with

        <p>
   In 2011 the company's revenues increased by a whopping 245% thanks to the $25.3 million jump in license and royalty revenues related to a license agreement with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   , partially offset by a decrease of $2 million in license revenues from its Allovectin program.
  </p>
        <p>
   Vical's net loss dropped by 76% in 2011 thanks to higher revenues and a decrease in research and development expenses due to lower costs related to clinical trials for TransVax and Allovectin. Other factors included manufacturing and production costs decreasing by 10% as the result of the capitalization of $1.2 million in manufacturing costs related to the production of TransVax under the company's service and supply agreement with Astellas, and investment and other income dropping by 35%. These gains were offset by a 9% increase in general and administrative expenses.
  </p>
        <p>
   Despite its various strategies to garner revenue (licensing, contract manufacturing, and royalties, among others), Vical is still operating in the red. Like most drug development companies, it spends more on research and development than it earns trying to make its treatments. It's likely the company will continue to operate at a loss until (and if) it brings a candidate to market.

   Vical's strategy is to develop products independently, expand the applications of its technologies through strategic collaborations, and pursue contact manufacturing opportunities.
  </p>
        <p>
   It was developing late-stage candidate TransVax independently until 2011 when it licensed development and marketing of the drug to Astellas.

   , and AnGes. Under some agreements, Vical conducts the research with money supplied by its partner, under others the partner works to develop the product and pays Vical for the opportunity. Either way the strategy provides Vical with revenue and backing from some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.

   Prior to its development for human therapy, Vical's DNA delivery technology was tested on animals and subsequently led to the development of veterinary vaccines. Its Apex-IHN product was developed to prevent infectious disease in farm-raised salmon. Apex-IHN is licensed to Aqua Health for commercial sale in Canada. Vical's other animal product, tyrosinase, is a vaccine to treat oral melanoma in dogs. Licensee

   Vical manufactures its own supply of plasmids used in its DNA vaccines and offers contract manufacturing to other pharmaceutical companies and government agencies for an additional revenue stream. Some of Vical's contract manufacturing customers include IPPOX Foundation to manufacture plasmid DNA vaccines against HIV and the
