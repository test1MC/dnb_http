   CooperVision wants you to be able to clearly see the benefits of its products. CooperVision (CVI) is a leading manufacturer of soft contact lenses, offering a wide range of lenses that address myriad vision problems and are offered in different replacement schedules (including single-use daily, bi-weekly, and monthly). CVI specializes in lenses for astigmatism, presbyopia, and ocular dryness. CooperVision has distribution and manufacturing facilities in about a dozen countries. Brands include Avaira, Biofinity, and Proclear. The contact lens maker is owned by the global medical device company

        <p>
   The contact lens maker rings up nearly 45% of its sales in the Americas. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa accounts for 35% of sales, while the Asia-Pacific region represents about 20%. The company's ophthalmic products are primarily made in the UK and Puerto Rico, as well as West Henrietta, New York.

   CooperVision's fiscal 2013 (ended October) sales approached $1.3 billion, a 7% increase versus the prior year, accounting for 80% of its parent company's sales. The increase in sales was driven primarily by a higher volume of lenses sold and the introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses. By product category, sales of CVI's multifocal lenses rose 29%, while single-use sphere lens sales increased by just 1%. Sales of toric lenses rose 9% and accounted for 31% of CooperVision's total sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas and in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) increased 9%. Sales to the Asia-Pacific region declined 2% (due to the impact of the weakening Japanese yen relative to the US dollar), after posting strong growth in the previous annual comparison.

        <p>
   Operating income rose 10% in fiscal 2013 versus the prior year, to $289.3 million.

        <p>
   CooperVision (CVI) is one of the largest contact lens manufacturers in the world. The company has been shifting its production to include more lenses made of silicone hydrogel, as market trends in recent years indicate that consumers prefer the material. (Silicone hydrogel supplies more oxygen to the cornea, which helps to prevent damage to the eye.) CVI has launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical, toric, and multifocal lens products over the past five years and its leading Biofinity brand is the fastest-growing contact lens brand in the US. In keeping with its strategy to focus on its core soft contact lens business, the company in fall 2013 sold its Aime rigid gas-permeable contact lens and solutions business in Japan to Nippon Contact Lens, taking a $21 million loss on the transaction.
  </p>
        <p>
   CVI is focused on expanding its worldwide market penetration through the introduction of new products and expanding its presence in established and emerging markets, including through acquisitions.
