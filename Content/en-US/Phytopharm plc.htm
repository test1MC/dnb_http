   IXICO (formerly Phytopharm) assists those who work to treat serious brain diseases. The company provides digital health care technologies in the form of clinical data management and analysis to clients who research treatments for such neuro-degenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other forms of dementia. IXICO's TrialTracker platform provides image data and query management. Other products include Assessa, a medical device with CE marking that measures hippocampal volumes to support dementia diagnosis; and MyBrainBook, an online tool for people with cognitive impairment including dementia to record information about themselves.

  <p>
   Another tool, TrialWire, helps transfer Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image data anonymously between computers. IXICO makes the tool available at no charge.

   Headquartered in the UK, the company does its largest share of business in the US, which accounted for 46% of revenue in fiscal 2015. The UK came in a close second at 44% of revenue; IXICO also does business in the rest of Europe and China.

   IXICO serves clients including the pharmaceutical sector, biotech firms, academic institutions, and medical charities. It markets its products through alliances. For example, it has a partnership with clinical trial imaging tools provider

  <p>
   The company's revenue comes from services provided to pharmaceutical companies undertaking clinical trials, as well as licensing revenues from partner VirtualScopics. Due a slowdown in business in Europe (including the UK) and China, revenue declined 9% to £3 million in fiscal 2015. However, net loss declined by nearly half to £1.2 million as operating expenses went down. Operating cash outflow was also cut nearly in half to £1.3 million, thanks to the year's smaller losses and less cash used in payables.

  <p>
   IXICO partners with pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to grow its business. Currently, the company is focusing on developing Assessa for the clinical management of Multiple Sclerosis. It initiated a collaboration with a pharma company to develop a version of the device during 2015. Also that year, IXICO secured two new contract awards through which TrialTracker will be implemented into a VirtualScopics platform. And in early 2016 the company gained four new contracts with pharmaceutical firms and a specialist biotech firm.

   The company also seeks acquisition opportunities to expand its presence in the digital health care space.
