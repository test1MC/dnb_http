   Numbering more than 3,300 member/farmers, Agropur Cooperative is Canada's largest dairy cooperative. Agropur runs about 30 plants across North America and it processes more than 3.3 billion liters of milk annually. Its fluid milk, cheese, and cream products include the Allegro, Natrel, Québon, La Lácteo, and Island Farms brands. The co-op's joint venture, Ultima Foods, holds the license to sell the Yoplait brand in Canada. Beyond consumer foods, Agropur also produces dairy ingredients for the food manufacturing and food service industries. Formed in 1938, Agropur has agreed to merge with New Brunswick-based Dairytown Products Ltd.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In March 2014, Agropur announced an agreement in principal to merge with Dairytown Products Ltd., a specialized ingredient supplier to the processing, retail, and food service industries. Dairytown also makes butter, skim milk powder, and custom milk powder blends. The combination is expected to close in the first half of 2014 and comes on the heels of an acquisitive 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year Agropur acquired the dry blending business of
   <company id="42186">
    Foremost Farms USA
   </company>
   to grow its baking and blending operations. The purchase included the Reddi-Sponge, PZ-44, Econo Bake, Dairy Bake, Nutrimix, and Baker's Special brands. Other purchases in 2013 included Cook's Dairy, a leading milk brand in southwest Nova Scotia. The purchase strengthened Agropur's position in the milk and cream category in Nova Scotia. It also acquired British Columbia's Coast Mountain Dairy, an ice cream producer based in Chilliwack, and M. Larivée International, Inc., a trading house specializing in dairy products and food ingredients. The purchase will allow Agropur to reestablish its Export Group and develop international markets for its products.

        <p>
   The Canadian dairy cooperative has divisions in the US and South America, where it holds a 50% share in Argentine milk producer La Lácteo. The coop's US arm (based in Minnesota) is a major contract manufacturer of ultra-high temperature pasteurized dairy and nondairy beverages.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Agropur reported sales of more than C$3.8 billion ($3.5 billion) in 2013, a gain of 5% versus 2012. Net income increased 37% over the same period, to C$53 million ($48.3). Canada accounted for 71% of sales. The coop reported cash outflow of C$58 million in 2013 compared to cash inflow of C$87 million in 2012 due to an increase in cashed used in vesting activities related to its three business acquisitions.

        <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
        <p>
   Agropur is investing in important expansion and modernization projects to achieve its growth goals in the coming years. Recently it made significant investments in its facilities in Oka, Lethbridge, and Luxemburg. It's also building a new head office, which will be connected to its fine cheese business unit's existing building in Longueuil, Quebec. That project is expected to be completed in early 2016.
