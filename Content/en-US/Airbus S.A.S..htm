   to be the world's #1 commercial jet maker. Airbus' commercial division manufactures more than a dozen aircraft models that seat 100 to 525 passengers, including single-aisle (A320 and derivatives) and wide-body (A330 and A340). The A350 XWB is made largely of composite material and the upcoming jumbo twin-deck A380 XWB is expected to rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. Its military division offers the CN235 maritime patrol aircraft, Multi Role Tanker Transport (air-to-air refueling), and upcoming A400M airlifter. Freighters include the A330-200F and Beluga.

   Airbus operates in more than 170 locations worldwide. It produces helicopters in Brazil, maintains research centers in Singapore, India, the US, China and Russia, and runs maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) hubs on five continents.

   Airbus rounds out its offerings to include freighters and corporate jets. The company's subsidiary Airbus Transport International (ATI) operates a fleet of five Belugas (the A300-600ST Super Transporter), one of the world's largest cargo carriers. These aircraft perform airlift duties, carrying fuselage sections and wings between production sites. They are also available for chartered commercial flights. Military and space hardware manufacturers have chartered the Beluga to move temperature-sensitive spacecraft and satellites.

   Airbus' revenue jumped 5% from 2013 to 2014, driven by an overall increase in deliveries to a record 629 aircraft and a more favorable delivery mix (including 30 A380s compared to 25 in 2013). Airbus Helicopters sales also increased by 3% compared to 2013 driven by higher demand from government programs. The company's profits also increased 58% in 2014.

   In mid-2014, Airbus secured a 60.16% ownership in Spain-based Alestis Aerospace S.L., an aerostructure supplier and engineering and composite materials manufacturer. The deal enhanced its supply chain operations for civil and military programs in Europe.

  <p>
   In the 1970s three US companies, Boeing, Lockheed, and McDonnell Douglas, dominated the commercial aircraft market. France and the UK had been discussing an alliance to build competing jets since 1965, but political infighting stalled the talks. Finally, in 1969 France and West Germany committed to building the Airbus A300. Airbus Industrie was born in 1970 as a
   <i>
    groupement d'intérêt économique
   </i>
   (grouping of economic interest, a structure used by allied French vineyards). Seed money came from partners Aerospatiale Matra and Deutsche Airbus. CASA joined in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   The A300 entered service with Air France in 1974, but Airbus had trouble selling it outside member countries. The following year the firm hired former American Airlines president George Warde to help market the A300 in the US. His efforts paid off when Eastern Air Lines decided to buy the A300. Also in 1975 Airbus launched the A310, a smaller, more fuel-efficient version of the A300. The UK joined the consortium in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1980 Airbus trailed only Boeing among the world's commercial jet makers. The A320 was introduced in 1984 -- it featured a groundbreaking "fly-by-wire" system that allowed pilots to adjust the aircraft's control surfaces via a computer, helping to make it the fastest-selling jetliner in history. The firm launched the A330 and A340, larger planes designed for medium- and long-range flights, in 1987. Two years later Airbus introduced the A321, an elongated version of the A320, and received a $6 billion order from Federal Express.
