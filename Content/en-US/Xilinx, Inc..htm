   Xilinx gives control to the programmer on the ground. The company is a top supplier of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). Customers program -- and reprogram -- these integrated circuits (ICs) to perform specific functions, providing greater design flexibility and cutting time to market. Xilinx also offers a broad range of design software and intellectual property used to customize its chips. The company, which contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce its chips, sells to the automotive, aerospace, broadcast, consumer, data processing, and wired and wireless communications markets. More than 70% of revenue comes from customers outside the US.

  <p>
   Xilinx groups its products by where they are on the continuum of development, from newest to oldest. Sales from New Products, which are the company's latest creations, contribute 44% of total sales. Sales of its oldest products, the Base Products segment, accounts for 28% of revenue while Mainstream Products, which aren't as old as Base products, are about a quarter of sales. About 4% comes from Support Products.

  <p>
   Xilinx, which is headquartered in the US, has facilities in Singapore, Canada, China, India, Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, and the US. The Asia/Pacific region, including Japan, accounted for almost 50% of its net sales in 2016 (ended April). Other major markets are the US (27% of revenue) and Europe (19% of revenue).

   Xilinx has sales offices worldwide. In addition to direct sales, global mega-distributor
   <company id="10151">
    Avnet
   </company>
   accounted for 50% of the company's revenue. The communications and data center markets generated 41% of its net revenues for 2016; the industrial, aerospace, and defense sector contributed 42%; and broadcast, consumer, and automotive accounted for 17%.

  <p>
   Xilinx reported lower revenue and profit in 2016 (ended April) as sales of its older products continued to erode.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of the company's new products grew 20% in 2016, which helped to hold revenue to a 7% drop to $2.2 billion, compared to about $2.4 billion in 2015. Sales fell in all geographic markets except in parts of North America outside the US. Lower sales in China and Europe wiped out about $100 million in revenue compared to 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit fell 15% to $550.8 million in 2016 from $791 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company generated about $730 million from operations in 2016, compared to $791 million in 2015. It was the second straight year for a drop in cash flow.

   The semiconductor industry has gone through a wave of consolidation in the past two years. It included
   <company id="12568">
    Altera
   </company>
   , a chief Xilinx rival, being bought by chip giant
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   for some $16.7 billion. Intel is integrating Altera's FPGA capabilities into some of its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, the company introduced 16 nanometer Zynq UltraScale+ portfolio of devices. The devices provide 64-bit processor scalability and combine real-time control with soft and hard engines for graphics, video, waveform, and packet processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Xilinx scaled up R&amp;D by 2% in 2016 to $534 million from 2015. Its lab efforts are directed to developing software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software. The company intends to spend even more on R&amp;D in 2017 and focus on its 16nm portfolio roll out, early investment on 7nm development, and creating a 28nm Spartan 7 product portfolio.

  <p>
   In 1984 Bernie Vonderschmitt, Ross Freeman, and Jim Barnett started Xilinx when
   <company id="13211">
    ZiLOG
   </company>
   , their employer, rejected the idea of investing in a programmable chip operation. Xilinx introduced the first field-programmable gate array (FPGA) the next year. Successive products featured more logic gates, providing greater computing power. A chip with up to 5,000 usable logic gates came out in 1987; three years later that number quadrupled. (Freeman died in 1989; Barnett left the company in 1990, the year Xilinx went public.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Xilinx acquired FPGA software developer NeoCAD in 1995. That year Xilinx formed a joint venture with
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics
   </company>
   to build a wafer operation, United Silicon, in Taiwan. Xilinx brought in
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   veteran Willem (Wim) Roelandts as CEO in 1996, replacing Vonderschmitt, who remained chairman until his retirement in 2003. (Roelandts then succeeded him in the chairman's role as well; Vonderschmitt died the next year.)
