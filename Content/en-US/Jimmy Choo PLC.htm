   Although the man himself has been shooed, many fashionistas are willing to pay dearly to be shod in Choo's shoes. Jimmy Choo gained its original notoriety from celebs strutting in the strappy shoes down Oscar-night carpets and across Fashion Week runways. Still, the upmarket shoemaker caters to self-proclaimed divas. It designs and manufactures shoes, distributing them through about 30 of its own standalone stores and some 167 high-end retail outlets. Jimmy Choo also sells products online.

   Jimmy Choo has a store network in 32 countries and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide.

   Women's shoes are the core of Jimmy Choo's product offerings, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men's shoes. Its product line has grown to include more comfortable shoes, such as jelly sandals, flats, and espadrilles, as well as handbags and small leather goods, lingerie, swimwear, sunglasses, and perfume.

   While customers may still consider stilettos Jimmy Choo's primary product, the company has been diversifying in recent years in a bid to become a global luxury brand.
  </p>
  <p>
   The shoemaker and marketer has its eye on growing its brand internationally. To this end, Jimmy Choo has entered Asia and the Middle East. Its namesake boutiques can also be found in Africa, Australia, Europe (including Turkey and Russia), Japan, South America, and the UK.

  <p>
   Jimmy Choo's namesake, who'd served as chief designer, exited the company during its first buyout in 2001. Ten years later Jimmy Choo was acquired by the Labelux Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Financial details of the sale to Labelux were not disclosed; however, Jimmy Choo was valued at £400 million-£500 million (roughly $645 million-$805 million). The valuation was more than twice the initial investment made by former owners TowerBrook Capital Partners and Jimmy Choo management (including founder Tamara Mellon and ex-CEO Robert Bensoussan); they paid £180 million ($297 million) for the brand to former owner

   . The potential to expand the Jimmy Choo brand globally and into men's shoes and handbags made Jimmy Choo an attractive target. Labelux, established in 2007 as a division of the Riemann family fund, boasts brands such as Switzerland's

   and the Italian accessories firm Zagliani.

   The company has a 10-year fragrance deal with France's Selective Beauty. (The first Choo fragrance debuted in 2009.) A licensing deal inked in 2007 with

   Jimmy Choo has grown into a top fashion brand from its humble beginnings as a Hackney cobbler. Mellon bought the company in 1996 in an initial investment backed primarily by her

   magnate father Tommy Yeardye. Immediately following the 2001 initial buyout, tensions rose between Mellon and chief designer Choo that are said to have led to Choo's resignation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's first Jimmy Choo store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street in London.
