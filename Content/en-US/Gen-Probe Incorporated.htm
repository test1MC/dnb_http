   Gen-Probe knows the answer is flowing through your veins. The company is a leading provider of molecular diagnostic tests and instruments to detect a host of infectious disease-causing viruses and bacteria, including those behind HIV, Chlamydia, tuberculosis, strep throat, and influenza. Gen-Probe's diagnostic tests provide results within hours, while traditional cultured tests can take days. In addition, the firm has screening products to help identify compatible transplant matches, and it also makes instruments and testing assays to screen donated blood for diseases. Customers include clinical and research laboratories and blood banks. Gen-Probe is part of the Diagnostics segment of medical equipment maker
   <company id="13907">
    Hologic.
   </company>

  <p>
   Gen-Probe's strategy for growth has included increasing its scale and expanding geographically by investing in internal development programs and by acquiring new businesses that complement its operations. The company worked to expand into markets adjacent to its core operations (women's health, infectious diseases, blood screening, and transplant diagnostics), where it sought to hold a competitive advantage. Genetic testing, which includes prostate oncology applications, is an example within its clinical diagnostics segment.
