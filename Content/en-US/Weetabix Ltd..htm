   Weetabix has been part of British breakfasts for some 80 years. Venturing beyond the Isles, the food maker has extended its reach to now sell its flakes and muesli in more than 80 countries. The
   <company id="162791">
    Bright Food
   </company>
   company's breakfast cereals include its flagship brand Weetabix (a UK version of shredded wheat), Weetos, Ready brek, Alpen, and Oaty. The Weetabix brand accounts for about 7% of the UK's total cereal sales. Weetabix products jockey for space on store shelves alongside cereals made by US cereal behemoths
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg
   </company>
   . But Weetabix faces other foes as well, such as private-label cereals, ever more popular cereal bars, and busy people who skip breakfast.

   Weetabix exports to more than 80 countries around the world from its mills in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire.

   In the UK, Weetabix is second only to
   <company id="10841">
    Kellogg
   </company>
   in breakfast cereals and cereal bars.
  </p>
  <p>
   To broaden its products mix, the company markets snack-sized versions of its cereals. Also, in response to niche-marketing trends, Weetabix sells a line of organic wheat biscuits (Oatibix) and cereal bars under its Oaty and Alpen names.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cereal manufacturer also owns

   </company>
   in the US, which, in addition to making its own cookies, crackers, breakfast cereals, instant mashed potatoes, and salty snacks, produces and distributes Weetabix products for the North American market.

   The company products are available via British goods websites such as www.britsuperstore.com and does not have its own online outlet. The mills at Burton Latimer export to more than 80 countries around the world.

   In 2015, there were news reports that Chinese company
   <company id="162791">
    Bright Food
   </company>
   , which owns 60% Weetabix, could potentially buy the remaining 40% after
   <company id="139170">
    Lion Capital
   </company>
   exercised a put option to sell its 40% stake. The deal is estimated to be worth about £1.28bn.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the innovation front, in 2015 Weetabix launched a new breakfast pot range. It was first time ever that the product was sold in a breakfast pot format as well as the first time it uses

    Clondalkin
   </company>
   's flexible packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, Weetabix launched On The Go breakfast drinks.

  <p>
   Bright Food, one of China's largest food manufacturers acquired 60% of Weetabix from the London-based private equity firm Lion Capital in a deal valued at £1.2 billion (or $1.9 billion) and involved Lion Capital selling a 60% stake to the Shanghai-based food maker while both Lion Capital and Weetabix management retained a 40% share.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (at the time known as Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst), bought Weetabix in 2003 from the George family for about $1 billion in cash. A year later, Hicks Muse's European unit split off, naming itself Lion Capital and took Weetabix with it.
