   For those who wish to fly and breathe, Intertechnique offers relief. The company manufactures aircraft oxygen and life support systems, branded EROS. Its lineup includes flight-deck controls, and aircraft fuel circulation and management systems. The company offers ground and in-flight refueling systems for aircraft and helicopters, as well. On the road, it is the sole source for refueling machines at

   acquired Intertechnique in 1999, forming Zodiac's Aircraft Systems segment.
As part of Zodiac Aerospace, Intertechnique aims to offer customers integrated product systems for aerospace needs. Research and development expenses average for more than 15% of total revenue. The company touts an array of firsts, such as the pneumatic, quick donning mask, smoke goggles, and tension control harness (added comfort for the large and small passenger).

   A liaison officer between the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA) and the French Resistance during WWII, Pierre Simon founded Intertechnique with Jacques Maillet in 1951. The former spy turned entrepreneur and his partner created the company to manufacture US electronics equipment under license in France.

   The company quickly shifted to solving the problem of providing oxygen to aircraft crews. Intertechnique spent the next three decades providing civil and military aircraft manufacturers with equipment and systems in three main areas: fuel systems, on-board intelligence and information processing systems, and oxygen and life support systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1980s Maillet, who in his 70s still headed the company, decided that Intertechnique needed to expand into the US. The US aerospace market accounted for more than 70% of the world aerospace sales, and the US military offered many lucrative projects. However, the US military market was virtually closed to non-US manufacturers. Maillet dodged this obstacle by buying US companies such as Eros (75%), a maker of pilots' oxygen masks.

  <p>
   A frail Jacques Maillet retired in 1992 with Edmond Marchegay succeeding him as chairman and CEO. Co-founder Pierre Simon died in 1998. French aerospace and nautical equipment maker Groupe Zodiac bought Intertechnique in 1999. The company delivered its 100,000th oxygen mask in 2002.
