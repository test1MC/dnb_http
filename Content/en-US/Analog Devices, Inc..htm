   If the world is turning digital, Analog Devices is paving the way. Its linear integrated circuits (ICs) translate real-world phenomena such as pressure, temperature, and sound into digital signals. It's a leading maker of linear IC as well as mixed-signal analog integrated circuits and digital ICs. Its line of 22,000 devices includes converters, amplifiers, power management products, and digital signal processors (DSPs). ADI's chip designs are used in industrial process controls, medical and scientific instruments, communications gear, computers, automobiles, and consumer electronics. Its chips operate in high-tech goods from more than 100,000 companies. Customers outside the US account for most of the company's sales.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
        <p>
   ADI's industrial segment accounts for about 45% of sales, followed by ICs for communications applications with about 20% of sales, automotive at more than 15%, and consumer at about 20%.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company makes some of its IC products and outsources some 60% of production to third-party manufacturers, primarily
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
   </company>
   . ADI's wafer fab facilities are in Wilmington, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. The company operates test facilities in the Philippines and uses third-party subcontractors for assembly and testing.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US is ADI's single biggest market, accounting for about 40% of sales, followed by China with more than 15% and Japan less than 10%. Customers in Europe account for a bit less than 30% of ADI's revenue. Headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts, the company has facilities in the US, the Philippines, Ireland, India, and China.

        <p>
   Although more than 50% of the company's sales are made through distributors, ADI also sells through direct sales offices and sales representatives worldwide and via its website. Apple, the company's biggest customer, accounts for about an eighth of revenue while the 20 largest customers account for about 40% of revenue.

   ADI's 2016 (ended October) revenue of $3.4 billion hardly budged from 2015, but profit and cash flow from operations increased year-to-year.
  </p>
        <p>
   The automotive market and China kept ADI from a revenue retreat. The company reported a 3% automotive increase from automakers' demand for ADI powertrain, advanced driver assistance systems, and infotainment products. The sales of chips for consumer applications fell on lower demand for portable devices. In China, where sales rose 13% in 2016, ADI saw rising demand for automotive as well as industrial and communications products.
  </p>
        <p>
   ADI kept expenses under control in 2016, allowing it to post a $862 million, a 24% increase from 2015. The company spent more on research and development, but reduced, slightly, its selling, general, and administrative expenses. It also had a lower tax bill in 2016.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cash flow from operations came in at $1.3 billion in 2016, from more than $900 million in 2015. The increase came from a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable.

        <p>
   ADI, which marked its 50th anniversary in 2015, is in the midst of a transition to broaden its product line and its markets. Since 2009, the company has invested $4 billion in research and development with most of the money going toward products for the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets. The company is trying to develop a more varied mix of customers and diminish its dependence on consumer-oriented customers such as Apple (12% of revenue in 2016). The automotive emphasis is already paying off as the sector produced the company's notable revenue gain in 2016. ADI's products find homes throughout vehicles, especially in the electronics required for self-driving vehicles.
  </p>
        <p>
   The nearly $15 billion Linear Technology acquisition, which closed in 2017line, is another major step in ADI's transformation. ADI and Linear combine to grab top-two market share across the analog market in data convertors, power management, amplifiers, interface, and high performance RF and microwave. ADI expects the combination to achieve about $150 million in manufacturing and operating expense synergies. ADI has made smaller acquisitions to provide more capabilities that provide additional value to its customers. Transactions have brought board technologies for internet of things applications, cloud security, and LIDAR.
  </p>
        <p>
   ADI also has taken steps to tighten its operating processes to save money and increase cash flow. A tighter inventory management program reduced inventory by $36 million (9%) in 2016.

        <p>Analog Devices agreed to buy OneTree Microdevices for an undisclosed amount in March 2017. OneTree is a fabless semiconductor company with a GaAs and GaN amplifier portfolio for cable TV and fiber-to-the-home applications. The acquisition extends Analog's product lineup to those uses.</p>
        <p>
   ADI concluded its acquisition of 
   <company id="13973">
    Linear Technology
   </company>
   , also a maker of analog ICs, for about $15 billion in  2017. While both companies produce analog devices, their product mixes are complementary, executives said. The acquisition should expand ADI's possible market from $8 billion to $14 billion. Linear posted profit of about $494 million on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2016 (ended June).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016 ADI acquired SNAP Sensor SA, a privately held company that specializes in vision sensing technologies. The acquisition advances ADI's leadership position in sensing and signal processing and build upon platform-level internet of things products such as ADI's Blackfin Low Power Imaging Platform.
  </p>
        <p>
   ADI also made acquisitions concentrated in autonomous vehicles. ADI acquired Innovasic, a developer of Ehternet technology that allows for deterministic real-time communication; the cyber security products of Sypris, which can provide customers with sensor-to-cloud security products; and technology from Vescent Photonics that should help ADI develop a solid state scanning LIDAR system that complements its RADAR-based ADAS products.

        <p>
   ADI acquired

   </company>
   in 2014 for $2.4 billion. Adding Hittite technologies strengthens ADI's capabilities in RF, microwave, and millimeter wave applications for developing products for industrial, healthcare, aerospace and defense, automotive safety, and communications infrastructure applications.

   veteran, and Matthew Lorber founded Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) in 1965 to make amplifiers for strengthening electrical signals. The company soon expanded into converters used to control machinery and take measurements, and went public in 1968. Lorber left the company that year and went on to found several startups, including Printer Technology, Torque Systems, and Copley Controls.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1969 ADI began manufacturing semiconductors. Stata become chairman and CEO in 1973. In 1977 he launched the influential Massachusetts High Technology Council to fight taxes that he felt were restricting the growth of high-tech firms.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the early 1980s ADI acquired stakes in several technology firms, including Charles River Data Systems (microcomputer hardware and software), Jupiter Systems (color graphics computers), Photodyne (fiber-optics test instruments), and Tau-Tron (high-speed digital instrumentation).
  </p>
        <p>
   ADI's profits declined in the mid-1980s as Japanese competitors acquired market share. In 1990 the company acquired Precision Monolithics, a maker of passive electronic components. The next year ADI introduced the world's first commercial micromachine, an automotive air-bag trigger.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1992 ADI formed a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard to develop mixed-signal chips. The company extended its global reach in 1996 by acquiring Mosaic Microsystems, a UK radio-frequency design company. It also formed Washington State-based chip producer WaferTech with
   <company id="43493">

   </company>
   and others. Also in 1996 company veteran Jerald Fishman became ADI's president and CEO; Stata remained chairman.
