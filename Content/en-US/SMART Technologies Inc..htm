   SMART Technologies is the valedictorian of interactive presentations. The world leader in interactive digital whiteboards primarily serves the education sector. Along with its products' interactive and download capabilities, the touch-sensitive surfaces of its whiteboard also give users the power to control computer software during a presentation without needing a computer mouse. SMART also sells to the commercial and government sectors. It was founded in 2007 by chairman David Martin and CEO Nancy Knowlton. In 2016 SMART was acquired by

   SMART generates about 80% of its revenue from its education offerings, with enterprise products accounting for 19%. The NextWindow segment chipped in the other 1% of sales after a severe contraction in 2015.

  <p>
   SMART is based in Canada and has offices in the US and a presence in Mexico, China, and South Korea. The US is the company's biggest market with 52% of sales, followed by Europe, 31% and Canada, 8%. Other countries accounted for 9%.

   In 2015 revenue dropped 16% to $493 million from 2014. Sales of interactive whiteboards and projects slowed in the education market, though sales perked up for interactive flat-panel displays and software. SMART also lost ground in the enterprise market as some of its customers opted to buy tablets and network infrastructure instead of SMART's products. Disappointing sales of NextWindow prompted the company to get out of that business and wind down the unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   SMART posted a second straight profit in 2015, two years after it lost $54 million. Profit rose 17% to $24 million in 2015 from 2014. The company managed to make a profit with restructuring and gains on amortization of intangible assets and interest expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations fell to about $18 million in 2015 from $243 million in 2014.

  <p>
   SMART closed its NextWindow business in 2015 and is now focusing on developing its presence in the interactive flat-panel (IFP) market. In fact, the company expects that IFP revenue will eclipse white board revenue in 2016 as it continues to expand its IFP product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy is based on four key initiatives -- leading the interactive flat panel (IFP) market, monetizing its software, enabling the collaborative enterprise with SMART Enterprise Solutions, and revolutionizing the dry erase board and flip chart.
  </p>
  <p>
   SMART is looking to expand its sales channels through partnerships such as the one with Westcon European Operations to expand enterprise sales in some regions of Europe.
