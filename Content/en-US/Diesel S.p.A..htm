   Diesel jeans are considered high-octane by some in the fashion-forward set. Despite noxiously high prices (jeans are priced at $300 and up), Diesel takes pride in producing unusual yet modish men's and women's casual wear. The company also makes sportswear and kids' clothes, and licenses its name to makers of jewelry, watches, leather goods (handbags, wallets), eyewear, fragrances (Only the Brave, Fuel for Life), furniture, and footwear. Diesel's products are sold in more than 80 countries through department stores and specialty retailers, as well as at about 400 company-owned Diesel stores globally. The company also markets its goods through catalogs. CEO and owner Renzo Rosso founded Diesel in 1978.

   After graduating from a textile school in 1975, Renzo Rosso worked as a production manager at Moltex, a Venice, Italy, jeans maker. Rosso came up with a plan to improve production when faced with losing his job, and he convinced the plant's owner, Adriano Goldschmied, to adopt it. Rosso's plan worked, and in 1978 Rosso convinced Goldschmied to launch Genius Group to make jeans.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1980s the company began making Diesel jeans and apparel (so named because "diesel" is pronounced the same across the globe). A factory outlet store opened in 1982. Rosso bought out Goldschmied (as well as 10 other Moltex businesses) in 1985 and took sole possession of the Diesel line. Rosso nurtured an independent spirit and gave his designers stylistic freedom, telling them to ignore the catwalk and design intuitively. He immediately began to expand Diesel internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 the Diesel line was in 40 countries, with annual sales of $135 million. In the US, prestigious stores such as Barneys New York carried its jeans. To expand, that year the company signed an agreement with manufacturer Russ Togs to distribute jeans, sportswear, and accessories in the US and Mexico. The next year the company launched its "Guide To Successful Living" ad campaign, featuring an irreverent look at modern life, mixed with a heavy dose of irony. Diesel ads included takes on things as diverse as homosexuality, gun control, cigarette smoking, and religion. The ads helped put the company on the fashion map and gave it a cult following.
  </p>
  <p>
   Less than two years after becoming a Diesel distributor, Russ Togs went bankrupt in 1991, slowing Diesel's American expansion. (By 1994 Diesel had nearly $340 million in sales; only $15 million came from the US.) Also in 1991, in an unusual branding move, Diesel bought an art deco hotel in Miami's South Beach, and redecorated it in the same style reflected in its ads. The company licensed its name to Safilo in 1994 to make Diesel Shades (sunglasses) with names such as Porn Star, Nose Job, and Atomic Sun. The next year the company launched its unisex fragrance, Diesel, and its extreme sports clothing collection 55DSL. Diesel's outrageous ad campaigns continued during the 1990s and picked up Clio and Cannes Film Festival awards in the process.

   Diesel first embraced US retail in 1996, opening its first store in New York City. Many cities followed, and by 1998 the company had about 30 stores in some of the world's best shopping districts. In late 1998 the company, possibly in response to the industrywide slump in denim sales, launched its nondenim DieselStyleLab line. The casual wear collection is aimed at a slightly older crowd.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company signed a licensing agreement with watchmaker Fossil in 1999. Early in 2000 Rosso confirmed that he had wanted his company to go public, not for the money, but as a way to get employees involved in ownership. Also that year Diesel stepped into luxury goods, buying Italian apparel manufacturer Staff International. Staff owns several brands and makes others under license, including Vivienne Westwood. In 2001 Diesel announced plans to increase its US presence, opening 26 stores by 2003.

   In September 2002 Diesel purchased a majority stake in Belgian designer Martin Margiela's Paris-based fashion house.
