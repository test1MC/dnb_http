   Besides being one of the nation's top poultry processors, Foster Poultry Farms never uses hormones (nor does it inject salt water into its birds to plump them up). Vertically integrated, the company takes chickens and turkeys from the incubator to grocers' meat cases, delis, and freezers. Doing business as Foster Farms, it sells some 750 poultry products mostly under the Foster Farms brand. Aside from its primary retail-centric operations, the company supplies prepared foods to the foodservice industry, including restaurant and other hospitality operators. The family-owned and -operated company was established in 1939 by Max and Verda Foster. The family also owns and operates sister company
