   They're not going out on a limb with that name! Specialty medical products maker Limbs &amp; Things really does deal in body parts, albeit artificial ones. The company doesn't make prosthetic devices, rather it manufactures synthetic soft tissue anatomical models used for medical education and training. (Think birthing, pelvic exams, and catheter insertion.) Sister company Medical Skills Ltd provides multimedia training kits that incorporate products from Limbs &amp; Things. Founded in 1990 by former medical illustrator and current company president Margot Cooper, the company sells its medical simulation models worldwide.

  <p>
   Some of Limbs &amp; Thing's products include eye examination simulators, cardiology patient simulators, ear examination simulators, and a whole range of products for specialty procedures such as laprascopic surgery, joint injection, gynecology, obstetrics and midwifery, urology, and wound care, among many others. Additionally, the company builds custom education materials for industry and corporate clients.

   Limbs &amp; Things manufactures more than 90% of its products in the UK.

   Limbs &amp; Thing's uses a network of more than 80 distributors to sell its products worldwide from Argentina to Vietnam. Customers include universities, public authorities, and health and primary care trusts. If a medical school's country is not on Limbs &amp; Things' distribution list it can order directly from the company.

   Limbs &amp; Things focuses on training clinical skills, women's health, and surgical specialties. Though the company has been around for more than 20 years, it's not teaching the same skills it was way back in 1990 -- the company works with leading clinicians worldwide to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and skill sets medical providers will need when they're working on real patients.

   In 2014 the company launched a new adult male circumcision training product; it also introduced an improved clinical male pelvic trainer that year. Another 2014 launch was its female genital mutilation (FGM) deinfibulation trainer to help health professionals develop skills for FGM reversal surgeries.

   It contracted with
