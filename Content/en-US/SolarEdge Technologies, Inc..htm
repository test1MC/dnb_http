   SolarEdge capitalizes on the old adage, "The sun is new each day." The company makes solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Its direct current (DC) optimized inverter system maximizes power generation and lowers the cost of energy produced by the system. Its system consists of power optimizers, inverters, and a cloud-based monitoring platform. The product serves a wide variety of solar market segments, from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility-scale solar installations. SolarEdge's products have been installed in solar PV systems in more than 70 countries. It has shipped a total of 5.1 million optimizers and 222,000 inverters. The company was founded in 2006 and launched an IPO in early 2015.

  <p>
   SolarEdge launched an IPO in 2015 and raised $126 million in proceeds. It's using the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for alleviating debt.

   SolarEdge catered to 200 direct customers in 38 countries and 8,300 indirect customers (through its cloud-based monitoring platform) in 2014.
  </p>

   It sells its products directly to large solar installers and engineering, procurement, and construction firms (EPCs) and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers. Its customers include

    SolarCity Corporation
   </company>
   (accounting for 19% of net sales in 2014), SunRun, and Vivint Solar.
  </p>
  <p>
   SolarEdge sells to specific solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers such as AliusEnergy BV, Krannich Solar Group (8% of net sales in 2014), Segen, and Soligent Distribution. Its power optimizers are sold to several PV module manufacturers that offer PV modules with its power optimizer physically embedded into their modules.

  <p>
   SolarEdge has experienced explosive revenue growth over the years, with revenues almost doubling from $79 million in 2013 to $133 million in 2014. Primarily due to the high research and development and sales and marketing costs involved with making its products, the company suffered net losses of around $25 million each year from 2012 to 2014.

  <p>
   To achieve long-term growth, SolarEdge plans to capitalize on the trend featuring the transition from traditional inverter architecture to DC-optimized inverter architecture. It will continue to invest in its sales and marketing operations to acquire new customers in its existing markets, grow internationally, and drive additional revenue. The company is also expanding its product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments.
