  <p>
   Spirent's Networks &amp; Applications unit develops testing for networks and applications that simulate real-world conditions in the lab, before a launch, and in a live network. The testing products are for data centers, cloud computing, network virtualization, applications and security, high-speed Ethernet networks and services, and test automation and management. The segment accounted for 51% revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another 35% of revenue comes from the Wireless &amp; Positioning segment, which tests 4G LTE and 3G mobile devices and services as well as satellite positioning, navigation, and timing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Service Assurance segment, 16% of revenue, offers network monitoring and field test equipment that helpcustomers to diagnose and troubleshoot live network problems.

  <p>
   In 1936 Jack Bowthorpe, son of a General Electric Company (GEC, later Marconi, now
   <company id="41750">
    telent
   </company>
   ) employee, spun off his company from a local football club. Goodliffe Electric Supplies' first specialty was overhead transmission line fittings. (The company's slogan? "Up the pole.") Its first employee was 15-year-old Ray Parsons, who later became Jack's brother-in-law. The company became Bowthorpe Holdings in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   After several decades as a general engineering firm, Bowthorpe refocused during the 1980s on niche markets under the leadership of Parsons (who became chairman after Jack Bowthorpe's 1978 death) and former nuclear physicist John Westhead, who joined the company from GEC in 1979. Bowthorpe also accelerated its expansion beyond the UK, forming Bowthorpe International in 1982 to pursue US acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the late 1980s, when defense contracts accounted for a third of sales, Bowthorpe began building its electronics offerings through nearly two dozen acquisitions. The buying spree included Optim Electronics (1987), Atlantic Scientific (surge suppression devices, 1987), 80% of the Cambridge Analytical Group (1988), the B&amp;F Instruments Division of FX Systems (1988), and thermal management specialist Thermalloy (heat sinks, 1988).
  </p>
  <p>
   By the early 1990s Bowthorpe had grown to 50 companies in 20 countries, with the US its largest market. In 1990 it sold some non-core assets, including its medical instruments business and European defense manufacturers Hellerman Deutsch and McGeoch. The next year Parsons retired after 55 years with the company and was named honorary life president.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Bowthorpe acquired B&amp;D Instruments and Avionics, a maker of voice and data flight recorders. The company entered the environmental market in 1993 when it bought the emissions monitoring systems business of Lear Siegler, as well as electrical systems makers Penny &amp; Giles and Odessa Engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   executive Nicholas Brookes joined the company as chief executive in 1996. Westhead became non-executive chairman (and retired in 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 1997 acquisitions spurred growth in the advanced telecommunications testing market. By then Bowthorpe had ballooned into 12 divisions encompassing nearly 100 autonomous companies -- mostly in Europe and the US. Brookes began disposing of non-strategic businesses, reorganizing the company into five divisions with particular attention to the fast-growing telecommunications and aerospace markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued in 1998, including US power supply company Conversion Equipment. The next year Bowthorpe bought the wireless and satellite testing business of
   <company id="16117">
    Wireless Telecom Group
   </company>
   and the digital subscriber line simulation operations of Consultronics. The company also bought Netcom Systems, a maker of Internet protocol and network test products, and sold more non-core businesses, including its thermal management operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Bowthorpe changed its name to Spirent. The company also acquired
   <company id="99251">
    Hekimian Laboratories
   </company>
   (network testing equipment) from Axel Johnson for about $1.58 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the midst of a broad slowdown in the global electronics industry in 2001, Spirent cut jobs to lower costs. Later that year the company sold its sensors business to a unit of GE Industrial Systems for $220 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company sold its aerospace components business to
   <company id="10425">
    Curtiss-Wright
   </company>
   for $60 million in cash. Later that year Spirent sold its Monitor Labs subsidiary (environmental monitoring instruments) to
   <company id="61246">
    Teledyne Technologies
   </company>
   for $24 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Spirent sold its 51% interest in WAGO, a joint venture making wiring products and electric modules for process automation, to the Hohorst family, which owned the other 49%. The company realized nearly £59 million net in cash from the sale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Spirent sold aerospace and aviation logistics and asset management software maker MIRO Technologies to Solis Capital Partners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spirent changed its name to Spirent Communications in 2006, a name its US-based subsidiary was already using.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2006 Spirent paid more than $70 million to acquire Switzerland-based SwissQual Holding from
   <company id="13033">
    Comarco
   </company>
   ; SwissQual developed test and measurement technology used in wireless telecom applications. It also bought QuadTex Systems, a supplier of test tools for Internet protocol multimedia subsystems and VoIP equipment, for around £5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Spirent acquired Scientific Software Engineering (SSE), a US developer of network infrastructure testing software. SSE became part of the company's Performance Analysis division. SSE created the Landslide software suite, which Spirent was reselling since 2003. Spirent paid $10 million in cash for SSE, with another $6 million payable depending on certain technical milestones and the retention of key SSE employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 the company acquired the business of Imperfect Networks, a developer of network security testing software. Spirent was the exclusive reseller of Imperfect's ThreatEx product since 2005. The company paid £2.2 million for Imperfect's business, and paid another £2.2 million in 2007. ThreatEx was integrated with Spirent's Avalanche offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sherborne Investors, which owned nearly 15% of Spirent, proposed to replace most of the company's board, an idea that was rejected by the board, although Spirent was willing to let the investment firm nominate two directors, one of whom would serve as deputy chairman. Sherborne rejected that counterproposal and teamed with other investment firms to force the company to call an extraordinary general meeting in 2006. Sherborne and its allies prevailed at the EGM, with shareholders voting out chairman John Weston and directors Andrew Given and Frederick D'Alessio. Four nominees put up by the dissident shareholders were elected to the board. Following the meeting, directors Marcus Beresford and Kurt Hellstrom resigned from the board. All of the resolutions proposed by the dissident slate were approved, with majorities ranging from 54% to 63%.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Anders Gustafsson remained on the board, but resigned from the company two months later, in 2007. Chairman Edward Bramson, one of the new members of the board, then became executive chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eighteen months after acquiring SwissQual Holding, Spirent sold the unprofitable business to private investors for only $3 million in cash. The divestiture came after the new board and management conducted an operating review of Spirent's product lines and concluded that SwissQual didn't fit into the company's core business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Spirent delisted its American depositary shares on the
   <company id="41286">
    New York Stock Exchange
   </company>
   , citing the increased cost of complying with US regulations for publicly listed companies, particularly the compliance facets of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The company spent about £3 million a year on being registered with the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   and listing in the US. Spirent maintained its primary listing on the
   <company id="100694">
    London Stock Exchange
   </company>
   ; stock regulations were less demanding in the UK. While Spirent also deregistered with the SEC, its ADS shares continued to trade on the over-the-counter market in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company retooled its business by selling its Sensing Solutions business (to a unit of
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   ), part of its aerospace business (to
   <company id="10425">
    Curtiss-Wright
   </company>
   ), and its air quality monitoring instrument unit (to
   <company id="61246">
    Teledyne Technologies
   </company>
   ). Spirent also sold its HellermannTyton unit, which made networking products, to
   <company id="102744">
    Doughty Hanson
   </company>
   for around £289 million.
