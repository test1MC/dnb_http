   Windows of opportunity abound for Andersen, a maker of wood-clad windows and patio doors in North America. Andersen offers window designs from hinged, bay, and double-hung to skylight, gliding, and picture windows. Its Renewal by Andersen subsidiary provides start-to-finish window renewal services in more than 100 markets in the US. Anderson Storm Doors makes storm and screen doors. Through independent and company-owned distributorships (including its Andersen Logistics division), Andersen sells to homeowners, architects, builders, designers, and remodelers. The company, which builds some 12 million doors and windows each year, is owned by the Andersen family and company employees.

   In 2015 Andersen opened its newest manufacturing facility in Bayport, Minnesota, which makes Andersen 100 Series products, a fast-growing line of windows and patio doors first introduced in 2009. It also made a second major expansion at its Cottage Grove and North Branch facilities to support the future growth of the company's Renewal by Andersen window replacement business and the extrusion of a proprietary composite material technology used in both Renewal by Andersen and 100 Series products. The expansions represented a combined investment of more than $45 million.

  <p>
   Danish immigrant Hans Andersen and his two sons, Fred and Herbert, founded Andersen in 1903. Andersen's first words in English, "All together, boys," became the company motto. Andersen arrived in Portland, Maine, in 1870 and worked as a lumber dealer and manufacturer. In the 1880s he bought a sawmill in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and later managed one in Hudson, Wisconsin. When the Hudson mill owners asked him to let workers go during the off season, Andersen refused and then resigned. He subsequently launched his own lumber business -- Andersen Lumber Company -- in 1903 and hired some of the men who had been laid off. He opened a second lumberyard, in Afton, Minnesota, in 1904.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andersen and his sons revolutionized the window industry in the early 1900s by introducing a standardized window frame with interchangeable parts. Buoyed by success, the Andersens sold their lumberyards in 1908 to focus on the window-frame business. (Andersen purchased lumberyards again in 1916 before exiting the lumberyard business for good in the 1930s.) Around 1913 the company moved from Hudson to South Stillwater (now Bayport), Minnesota.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thrifty Hans launched the company's first (and the US's third) profit-sharing plan shortly before his death in 1914. Herbert became VP, secretary, treasurer, and factory manager, and Fred became president. Herbert died in 1921 (at age 36), but Fred proved to be a versatile and capable successor. Among his accomplishments, Fred came up with the tag line "Only the rich can afford poor windows."
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1929 the company changed its name to Andersen Frame Corporation. In the following decade Andersen introduced a number of innovations, including Master Frame (a frame with a locked sill joint, 1930); a casement window, the industry's first complete factory-made window unit (1932); and a basement window (1934). The company adopted its current name in 1937.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andersen introduced the gliding window concept in the early 1940s. It also launched the Home Planners Scrap Book consumer ad campaign in 1943. During the 1950s Andersen's new products included the Flexivent awning window, which featured welded insulating glass that served as an alternative to traditional storm windows. In the 1960s the company produced a gliding door and introduced the Perma-Shield system. The system featured easy-to-maintain vinyl cladding to protect wood frames from weathering. By 1978 Perma-Shield products accounted for three-quarters of sales. Fred, who had run the company as president until 1960 and had subsequently held the positions of chairman and chairman emeritus, died in 1979 at age 92.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1984 and 1994 the company increased its sales threefold by introducing additional customized and state-of-the-art products, including patio doors. In 1995 it launched Renewal by Andersen, a retail window-replacement business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andersen acquired former long-term strategic partner Aspen Research (materials testing, research, and product development) in 1997. Among its jointly developed products is Fibrex, a composite material used in replacement windows. Also in 1997 the company moved its international division office from Bayport, Minnesota, to the Minnesota World Trade Center in St. Paul to help boost its export drive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 company veteran Donald Garofalo succeeded Andersen's president and CEO Jerold Wulf, who retired after 39 years with the company. Andersen reinforced its company-owned distributorships in 1999 when it bought millwork distributors Morgan Products (now Andersen Logistics) and Independent Millwork.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its product offerings, Andersen purchased privately held EMCO Enterprises (storm doors and accessories, Iowa) in 2001. Other acquisitions from about 1993 to 2003 included Dashwood Industries (windows, skylights, roof windows, doors; Canada) and KML Windows (architectural windows and doors, Canada). The company also opened a new production facility in Menomonie, Wisconsin.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the close of 2002, Andersen's COO James Humphrey was promoted to president, becoming the company's ninth president; he gained the added role of chief executive the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andersen celebrated its 100th year in 2003, publishing a book on its history, and the company kicked off a community project to build 100 Habitat for Humanity homes throughout North America over a period of five years (it met that goal in 2007).
