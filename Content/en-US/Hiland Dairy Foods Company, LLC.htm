   Reflecting the herd mentality of its industry, Hiland Dairy Foods is a joint venture between
   <company id="40371">
    Prairie Farms Dairy
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40314">
    Dairy Farmers of America
   </company>
   . Hiland's cows produce the raw ingredient for churning out butter, ice cream, fluid milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products, free of artificial growth hormones. The milk is distributed through 25 sites dotting the southwest US. Beyond dairy, Hiland supplies juices, bottled milk and coffee (cravélatté), as well as green tea, water, and other to-go drinks. It features limited-run specialty items, such as peanut butter s'mores ice cream. Founded in 1938, the farmer-owned venture operates manufacturing plants in the Midwest.

   In line with the company's focus on sustainable initiatives, the farmer-owned dairies that provide raw materials to Hiland Dairy Foods work to preserve and protect resources. To this end, the dairy cooperative recycles and saves water, batteries, oil, cardboard, office paper, plastic, aluminum. In all, it has saved more than 19,000 barrels of oil and a total of 6.6 million KWh of electricity.

   In 2013 Hiland Dairy Foods undertook the effort of marketing the milk and dairy products of two of the nation's leading family-owned and -operated dairy farms. Coleman Dairy Foods, which has been a division of Hiland Dairy Foods since 2006, began marketing its own dairy items under the Hiland Dairy Foods label. The benefit to both companies is that retail demand is higher for dairy products that are sold under one brand name and one UPC across multiple states and markets.
