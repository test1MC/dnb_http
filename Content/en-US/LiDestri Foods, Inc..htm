   Ladle it on, LiDestri Foods says. The company manufactures Italian pasta sauces under the Francesco Rinaldi label. They include tomato sauces (such as traditional marinara, meat-flavored, and chunky garden-style), Alfredo sauces (traditional, vodka, and sundried tomato), and ToBe Healthy sauces with Omega 3's. The company also produces olive oils and cooking wines. Products under the Francesco Rinaldi name are sold in US retail food outlets and online. LiDestri Foods also offers its customers private-label manufacturing services. The company, which is today owned and operated by the LiDestri family, has ties to the Ragu packing company founded in 1937.

   For growth, LiDestri Foods is looking at libations to fuel its bottom line. It operates a spirits business and moved into

   LiDestri Foods has since invested in expansion plans at the former Eastman Kodak building. In 2013 it spent $1.4 million for more land in the Eastman Business Park, closing on eight properties at the park that total 180 acres. Already at the park, LiDestri operates a research and development-focused Innovation Center, a production line for smaller run sizes, and a line of high-proof spirits.

   It has worked to expand its relationship with Campus Solutions by offering Spikes Salsa to college campuses across the Northeast. College students are one of its target demographics, particularly for its salsas.
