   Huffy's business isn't as old as the bicycle (invented in 1861), but it's close. The company, which has been peddling bikes and other wheeled vehicles for more than a century, is best known for its all-purpose bikes, although scooters also play a role in its product portfolio. Its Huffy, Micro, and Royce Union bikes include kids' bikes and tricycles, comfort cruisers, mountain bikes, and BMX racing bikes. Products include licensed names

   Horace Huffman founded Huffman Manufacturing Company in 1924 to make equipment for the fledgling automobile service station industry. With the US in the throes of the Depression, Huffman saw a market for cheaper transportation and began manufacturing bicycles in 1934. Son Horace Jr. came on board and updated Huffman's operations, doubling production and increasing sales to more than $1 million by 1940. In 1949 the company introduced the hit Huffy convertible bike (it had removable training wheels). Huffman went public in 1968.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s the growth of retail chains opened up a new market for bicycles, and Huffman soon settled into its mass-market niche. The introduction of the Huffy Thunder Trail bicycle in 1977 made the company the nation's leading bicycle manufacturer. That year the firm bought Frabill Manufacturing (fishing and basketball products, and renamed it Huffy Sports) and changed its name to Huffy. It continued to diversify in the 1980s with YLC Enterprises (product assembly) and Washington Inventory Service. In 1990 Huffy added True Temper Hardware (garden tools).
  </p>
  <p>
   Stiff competition, the waning mountain bike craze, and a lagging retail market caused a $10.5 million loss in 1995. Huffy regrouped with the release of new BMX models in 1997. That year the company bought Royce Union Bicycle Company (high-end bikes). At the end of 1997 Don Graber became chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing increased competition from Asian manufacturers (some 60% of bikes purchased in the US are made overseas), Huffy closed its Celina, Ohio, bicycle factory in 1998 (cutting about 1,000 jobs and contributing to a loss that year). In 1999 Huffy sold True Temper to U.S. Industries for $100 million and closed its two remaining US bicycle plants. The company took a $1 million charge in the first quarter of 2000 related to the plant closings. Later it sold Washington Inventory Service to Sterling Investment Partners for about $85 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In July 2001 Huffy offered to buy rival bike maker Schwinn/GT's trademarks and cycling brands for about $60 million; however, it withdrew its bid in September. It moved into additional sports equipment in 2002 when it bought Gen-X Sports and added to its retail support and merchandising business when Service Solutions (formerly Service First) acquired McCalla, which offers similar services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2003 Huffy began to reverse its acquision trend when it sold its Volant ski business to Atomic, the winter sports division of
   <company id="90933">
    Amer Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2004 Huffy sold its Gen-X Opportunity operations (which purchases excess sporting good inventories and sells it to retailers) to a group made up of the original founders (who sold it less than a week later to Canadian sporting goods retailer,
   <company id="60904">
    The Forzani Group
   </company>
   ). The deal included the Gen-X name, resulting in the Gen-X operations in Toronto being renamed Huffy Sports Canada. A month later, it sold Service Solutions to National Product Services, a Texas-based investment firm, and in July athletic apparel manufacturer Russell bought Huffy's Sports division (basketball backboards and related items) for about $30 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2004 Huffy Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That month D'Aloia resigned as chairman of the board.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to extend its reach with toy retailers and explore a new niche of the market, Huffy in 2007 entered the backyard playground equipment market with its Huffy Playcenters line, which is sold in toy and home improvement stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2010 COO Bill Smith was promoted to president and CEO of the company. He succeeded Michael Buenzow, who served CEO from 2007 until 2010.
