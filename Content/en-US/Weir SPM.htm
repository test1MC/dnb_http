   Weir SPM operates as a part of the Pressure Pumping segment of its parent company.

  <p>
   The Pressure Pumping segment's revenues increased by 9% in 2013 driven by strong aftermarket growth as a result of the normalization of inventory levels and a product bundling strategy. Weir SPM aftermarket orders exceeded 2012 levels.

  <p>
   Responding to the slower than expected recovery in upstream markets in 2013 the company increased its range of products and  leveraged its industry-leading service center network to grow aftermarket revenues. It also consolidated operations to improve operational efficiency. Pressure Pumping manufacturing was consolidated in Fort Worth, Texas, and two small satellite manufacturing units were closed.

  <p>
   Expanding its global service center network to better provide service support to its customers, in 2012 Weir SPM opened of a new service facility in Maca√©, Brazil to support oilfield service companies in offshore and onshore Brazil, and in other countries in Latin America. In 2012 the company also invested in flow capacity expansion and in integration projects at UK-based Seaboard and US-based Novatech, (both acquired by

   in 2012).

   Seeking to boost its trained workforce at its manufacturing plant, in 2012 Weir SPM partnered with Tarrant County College to provide job training using a $282,116 Skills Development Fund grant from the

    Texas Workforce Commission

   to custom train 334 new and existing workers.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company began a major capacity expansion of its manufacturing and service facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The $40 million investment is part of its parent's growth strategy to take advantage of increased drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities in oil and liquid-rich North American shale formations. The expansion includes a pump overhaul facility, several warehouses, an assembly and engineering office, a pipe shop, a swivel manufacturing plant, and a service center.

  <p>
   SPM Flow Control was acquired by The Weir Group in 2007 for $653 million. The acquisition increased Weir's presence in the rapidly growing upstream oil and gas market, especially in the high-demand well stimulation segment.
