   Mettler-Toledo's broad customer base is spread across the electronics, food retailing, laboratory, pharmaceutical, precious metals, and transportation markets, among others. A direct sales force helps customers for sophisticated products weigh their options while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels.

  <p>
   Mettler-Toledo's steady, if unspectacular, revenue increases halted in 2015 when sales slipped 3.6% lower. Revenue was $2.4 billion in 2015, down from $2.5 billion the previous year. Sales fell in all three segments, but industrial stumbled the most with revenue declining 7% ($72 million) on weaker sales in China, Russia, and Brazil, which the company blamed on their weakened economies. Revenue also was affected by the negative impact currency conversion. In the US, Mettler-Toledo's revenue increased 7%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reductions in research and development and administrative costs helped boost the company's net income in 2015. It posted a $353 million profit for the year, compared to $338 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations at the end of 2015 was $427 million compared to $419 million at the end of 2014.

  <p>
   Historically, Mettler-Toledo's growth has been fueled by acquisitions, and it continues to seek strategic fits to bring into the fold. It considers the life sciences, product inspection, and process analytics sectors as its main areas of focus for acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has instituted sales and marketing programs to boost sales. The Field Turbo initiative deploys field specialists to focus on accounts with big potential. The company reported better-than-market sales where Field Turbo has been implemented and it continues to invest in the program. Another program, called Spinaker, includes the use of big data analytics to identify significant opportunities(including replacement of old products) in which customers are poised to buy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The precision instrument maker invests in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to its customers for existing and new applications. The company spends about 5% of sales on R&amp;D.

  <p>
   Engineer Erhard Mettler weighed in to the precision scale industry in 1945 when he started Mettler Instrumente AG in Kusnacht, Switzerland. Mettler invented a single-pan analytical balance that proved to be more accurate than the then-standard two-pan weighing equipment. By the mid-1950s the company expanded into the US, and its equipment's popularity had the industry using "Mettler balance" to refer to nearly any high-precision laboratory scale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1960s the company made its first acquisition and began expanding into analytical measuring instruments. Mettler moved its headquarters to Greifensee, Switzerland, near the decade's end. During the 1970s the company diversified into food retailing products and converted its product offerings from mechanical to electronic systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swiss conglomerate Ciba-Geigy (now part of
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ) bought Mettler in 1980; Erhard Mettler retired. In 1989 Ciba bought US industrial scale manufacturer Toledo Scale Corporation (founded 1901) and merged it with Mettler, renaming the unit Mettler-Toledo.
