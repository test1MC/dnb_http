   California Steel Industries (CSI) doesn't use forensic evidence, but its work does involve a steel slab. The company uses steel slab produced by third parties to manufacture steel products such as hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel, galvanized coils and sheets, and electric resistance weld (ERW) pipe. Its customers include aftermarket automotive manufacturers, oil and gas producers, roofing makers, tubing manufacturers, and building suppliers. CSI serves the western region of the US. The company operates slitting, shearing, coating, and single-billing services for third parties. Japan's

   CSI has an annual production capacity of 2.8 million metric tons of flat rolled steel and pipe. It is the leading producer of flat rolled steel in the Western US, and the only West Coast steel supplier capable of producing more than 2 million tons of steel in five different product lines: hot rolled, pickled and oiled, galvanized, and cold rolled sheet, and electric resistance welded pipe.

  <p>
   Most of CSI's product lines are also sold to service distribution centers throughout the Western and Midwestern US, with some product also sold worldwide through the export market. Its steel framing studs, roofing, decking and metal lath products are used in the home and commercial building industries. Other uses include water, gas, and oil pipelines, automotive pans, tubing (used by construction and furniture makers), and heating and cooling parts.

   In 2014 CSI built a new pipe mill on its site near Fontana, California. The mill produces high-strength electrical resistance welded pipe, up to 24 inches in diameter and up to 80 feet in length. Its existing pipe mill was limited to 16-inch diameter and 60-foot lengths.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 1992 CSI has invested more than $1 billion on its facilities to maintain, modernize, and expand operations.
