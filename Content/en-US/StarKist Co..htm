   StarKist's Charlie the Tuna, a fixture since 1961, says the company is the world's #1 supplier of canned tuna. It's a top producer, distributor, and marketer of shelf-stable seafood products nationwide. Besides water- and oil-packed canned tuna, StarKist's other albacore and regular tuna products include tuna fillets in pouches, ready-mixed tuna salad, and ready-to-eat lunch kits. To add market value to its portfolio, StarKist has introduced ready-to-use marinated tuna in pouches. The company's products are marketed to food retailers and foodservice operators worldwide. StarKist is owned by South Korea's Dongwon Industries.

   StarKist, which has earned a 37% share of the US tuna market, is known for its innovation. It was the first brand to roll out the StarKist Flavor Fresh Pouch, lightly marinated StarKist Tuna Creations, and a dolphin-safe policy. Nevertheless, some 90% of its sales comes from tuna in a can.

   The company is spending more money on US TV advertising, using Charlie the Tuna as its spokesperson. It also markets its popular tuna pouches by giving away samples at events, such as marathons. It sells its products directly to food retailers the likes of

   and grocery stores, and supplies them to foodservice operators.

   Innovating and regularly rolling out new products are key growth vehicles for Starkist. In 2015, for instance, the company launched five new products: Salmon Creations in Lemon Dill and Mango Chipotle; Kid's Creations in Bacon Ranch and Honey BBQ; and a new Tuna Creations flavor, Hot Buffalo Style.

   Aware of the public's sensitivity to the nature of deep-sea fishing, StarKist says that it does not purchase any tuna caught in association with dolphins, such as those caught with gill or drift nets that can also net, injure, and sometimes result in the death of the popular aquatic mammal. Also, the company uses no farm-raised tuna, but rather tuna that is caught in the wild. Its tuna is sourced from fisheries in the Pacific Ocean and Western Atlantic Ocean; species include Skipjack, Yellowfin, and Albacore (white) tuna.
