   Good vision is essential with Essilor International. Banking on the fact that one-fifth of the world's population wears glasses, the company is a leading maker of ophthalmic products and supplies, particularly corrective lenses. Its Varilux progressive lenses have become a top choice for people needing bifocals, and the firm is renowned for developing lighter, more durable lenses. The company's products treat the common sight problems myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (reduced ability to change focus from far to near). The company announced an agreement to merge with eyewear giant
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica
   </company>
   in early 2017.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to Varilux, brand names include Crizal (anti-reflective lenses) and Xperio (polarized lenses), as well as Definity (progressive lenses for active lifestyles), Kodak (midrange lenses), and Foster Grant (reading glasses).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its corrective lens operations, Essilor is a leading maker of optical instruments. The company specializes in two areas: lens edging and surfacing instruments used by prescription laboratories, and vision screening systems used by schools and other institutions. Essilor pursues growth through acquisitions and development efforts in this operating segment as well.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's customers include opticians and optometrists, purchasing groups, wholesalers, and optical chain stores. More than half of Essilor's sales are generated outside of Europe, and the company continues to expand its global presence, which includes operations in over 100 countries. In particular, it is focusing growth efforts on developing countries, where a smaller percentage of people with poor eyesight wear corrective lenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essilor distributes its lenses through a global network of some 300 company-owned prescription laboratories, as well as through independent labs.

  <p>
   In early 2017, Essilor announced an agreement with eyewear giant
   <company id="44642">
    Luxottica
   </company>
   to merge. The new company, to be named EssilorLuxottica, will have combined revenue of €15 billion. The merger arose as a result of the two giants eyeing each others' turf: in recent years Luxottica has been moving into the lens space, and Essilor frames.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essilor pursues an acquisition strategy aimed at strengthening its distribution capabilities and enhancing product innovation. It frequently buys up its distributors, including independent laboratories, especially in high-growth and emerging markets. Aside from acquisitions, Essilor has had good luck over the years with growth through the introduction of its own new or next-generation products, with emphasis on value-added lenses such as progressive lenses (no-line bifocals), variable-tint lenses, and lenses using digital surfacing technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essilor plans to broaden international sales efforts for the Kodak lenses, which provide an affordable, high-quality midrange lens solution that the company hopes will boost sales to middle-class customers in emerging markets.

  <p>
   In early 2017, the company agreed to a €50 billion mega-merger with eyewear giant Luxottica. The combined company will be renamed EssilorLuxottica.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Essilor acquired sunglass company Three Hundred (dba Fabris Lane) and its retail business Red Hot Sunglasses. It also bought Vision Source, a member alliance which connects independent optometrists with medical groups and integrated health systems. In 2016 the company acquired European online contact lens retailer Vision Direct. It now plans to buy UK-based MyOptique Group, which sells contact lenses, glasses, and sunglasses online. That purchase will provide Essilor with an entry into Central Europe.

  <p>
   Essilor International's roots go back to the 1849 formation of the Association Confraternelle des Ouvriers Lunetiers, a workers cooperative of eyeglass makers that became the Societe des Lunetiers, then S &amp; L, and finally in the 20th century, Essel. An Essel engineer invented the Varilux lens in 1959.
  </p>
  <p>
   Increased international competition in the 1960s spurred the 1972 merger of Essel and rival Silor, a maker of lenses and frames. Silor, founded by optician Georges Lissac, brought with it the Orma shock-resistant organic glass lens it had developed in 1956.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the merger, Essilor focused on international expansion, setting its sights first on the US. Building on its parents' established presence in that country, the company partnered with biomedical firm Milton Roy to open a plant in 1974; Essilor bought out its partner the next year. The company went public in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the firm continued to expand its geographic reach and improve and expand its products. By the end of the 1980s Essilor had become a prominent player in the optics market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essilor experienced a sales slump in the early 1990s and responded by cutting jobs and restructuring operations worldwide. Sales of Varilux lenses, plus the introduction of a new product line (Crizal antireflective lenses) in 1992, helped the firm rebound by the mid-1990s. Essilor then continued its global expansion, entering or expanding its presence in such countries as Australia, China, India, and the US through acquisitions and joint ventures with
