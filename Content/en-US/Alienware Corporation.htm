   Like its parent company, Alienware (acquired in 2006) built its fortunes selling directly to customers. However, as Dell has expanded its marketing efforts with channel sales, Alienware has moved into the retail space. Dell has a partnership with

    Best Buy
   </company>
   to sell Alienware models in their stores. As time goes by, Alienware is becoming more of a brand within the Dell product line, rather than an autonomous subsidiary.
