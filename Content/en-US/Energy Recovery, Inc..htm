   Desalination makes seawater potable; Energy Recovery (ERI) makes desalination practical. The company designs, develops, and manufactures energy recovery devices used in sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants. The SWRO process is energy intensive, using high pressure to drive salt water through membranes to produce fresh water. The company's main product, the PX Pressure Exchanger, helps recapture and recycle up to 98% of the energy available in the high-pressure reject stream, a by-product of the SWRO process. The PX can reduce the energy consumption of a desalination plant by up to 60% compared with a plant lacking an energy recovery device. Subsidiary Pump Engineering also makes high pressure pumps.

  <p>
   ERI has its headquarters and main manufacturing center located in California. Other offices reside in Shanghai and Dubai.

  <p>
   Primary customers for ERI consist of international engineering, procurement, and construction firms that build large desalination plants. Energy Recovery also sells its products and services to OEMs of pumps and other water-related equipment for small to mid-size plants used in hotels, cruise ships, farm operations, and power plants. Major customers have included IDE Technologies Ltd, Thiess Degremont J.V., Hydrochem, Acciona Agua, and UTE Mostaganem.

  <p>
   ERI's revenues decreased 29% from 2013 to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower mega-project (MPD) shipments as well as lower OEM shipments. The decreases in MPD and OEM sales were offset by higher aftermarket shipments and revenue attributable to an oil and gas operating lease and lease buy-out.
  </p>
  <p>
   ERI has suffered five straight years of net losses. Its $19 million net loss in 2014 was fueled by higher sales and marketing expenses coupled with the lower net revenue. Research and development expenses also spiked during 2014.

  <p>
   Going forward, ERI intends to benefit from a significant presence in Spain and other countries. Energy Recovery's lineup, for example, supports most of Spain's desalination plants. ERI also plans to enter into the material science and manufacturing of ceramics -- a key component of its PX devices. The strategy aims to boost device production, cut costs, and improve product quality.
