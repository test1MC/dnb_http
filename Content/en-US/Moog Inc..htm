   Moog (rhymes with "rogue") makes precision-control components and systems used in aerospace products, industrial machinery, and medical equipment. Servoactuators, Moog's core product, receive electrical signals from computers and then perform specific actions. Using its servoactuators, Moog builds flight and control systems for commercial and military aircraft, as well as hydraulic and electrical controls for automated industrial machinery, wind turbines, and control systems for satellites and spacecraft, launch vehicles, and missiles. It also makes infusion therapy pumps, slip rings for CT scanners, and motors used in devices for sleep apnea. Customers in the US make up more than half of sales.

   Aircraft controls, accounting for 44% of sales, provides primary and secondary flight controls for military and commercial aircraft, including large commercial transports, supersonic fighters, business jets, and rotorcraft. Development programs in this segment include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the

   787 Dreamliner, and the
   <company id="40566">

   A350XWB, and the Black Hawk/Sea Hawk helicopter. The aftermarket accounts for about 36% of the segment's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial systems (21% of sales) serves such markets as wind energy, flight simulation and training, plastics making, power generation, testing, metal forming, oil exploration, and material handling. Products include electric rotor blade pitch controls, electromechanical motion simulation bases, and control assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The components segment (20% of sales) focuses on slip rings, fiber-optic rotary joints, and motors. Slip rings and fiber-optic rotary joints both are available in several sizes, which makes them useful in several applications, such as radar pedestals and floating platforms for offshore oil exploration. The segment's motors include factional horsepower brushless motors that operate with minimal noise and are optimal for sleep apnea equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Space and defense controls (15% of sales) serves satellites and space vehicles, armored combat vehicles, and launch vehicles, and tactical and strategic missiles (such as Hellfire, TWO, and Trident), among other technologies.

   Moog operates through manufacturing facilities in Asia, Canada, Costa Rica, Europe, the Philippines, and the US. The US accounted for about 55% of its net sales each year. Germany and the UK collectively accounted for 15%, while Japan generated 7% of its total revenue.

  <p>
   The company's principal customers are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end-users for whom it provides aftermarket support. Aerospace and defense OEM customers collectively represented 52% of 2016 sales. The majority of these sales are to a small number of large companies. Industrial OEM sales, which represented 31% of 2016 sales, represented a wide range of global customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Major aftermarket customers include the US government and commercial airlines. In 2016, aftermarket sales accounted for 17% of total sales. The company has long-term contracts with some of its customers which mainly reside within its aircraft controls, and space and defense controls segments.

  <p>
   Moog saw its net sales decline 5% from $2.53 in 2015 to $2.41 billion in 2016. Moog's net income also declined 6% from $132 million in 2015 to $124 million in 2016 due to a spike i research and development expenses. In addition, its cash flow from operations fell 35% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue decline for 2016 was driven by weaker foreign currencies, in particular the British pound and the euro relative to the US dollar. Components segment sales dipped by 13% due to declines in the energy market where the macro-economic conditions centered around the significant decline in the price of crude oil resulting in lower demand for its marine products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The industrial market was affected by unfavorable order timing in 2016. Within the aerospace and defense market, sales declined due to lower demand for aftermarket products. Sales also declined in the medical market, as lower sales for its sleep apnea products were partially offset by higher sales for medical pump sales.

  <p>
   Moog is aiming for sales in 2017 to increase by 1%. It expects that aircraft controls will drive the sales growth, due mostly to the ramp up of the Airbus A350 program. It also projects slight sales increases in space and defense controls; medical devices; and industrial systems, and a small decrease in components' sales. Moog expects the benefits of its 2015 cost containment strategies to drive the marginal expansion.

  <p>
   In 2016, Moog paid $23 million to acquire a 70% ownership in Linear Mold and Engineering, a Livonia, Michigan-based company specializing in metal additive manufacturing. Linear provides engineering, manufacturing, and production consulting services to customers across a wide range of industries, including aerospace, defense, energy, and industrial. The acquisition also included a redeemable non-controlling interest in the remaining 30%, which is exercisable beginning three years from the date of acquisition.
