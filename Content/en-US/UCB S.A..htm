   You see, UCB wants to be a world leader when it comes to treating ailments related to the immune and central nervous systems (CNS). The company manufacturers prescription drugs to treat Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. UCB's top products include Cimzia for Crohn's disease,Vimpat to treat epilepsy, and Neupro for Parkinson's disease. The company also makes allergy blockbuster Zyrtec. UCB has operations in nearly 30 countries, and markets its products through an internal sales force and through strategic relationships with other pharmaceutical companies. Marketing, manufacturing, and development partners include
   <company id="59531">

  <p>
   Along with its small stable of revenue drivers, the company has a number of drugs in its clinical pipeline it believes are poised to bring in significant revenue once they complete their clinical development. The company has research, development, and marketing agreements with just about every major pharmaceutical company in the industry. Along with AstraZeneca and Novartis some of its partners include
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   (marketing),
   <company id="139987">
    Amgen
   </company>
   (product development), and
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   (research).

  <p>
   UCB is counting on Cimzia, Vimpat, and Neupro to drive its future growth, perhaps because in 2010, North American sales of Cimzia increased by more than 130%, while Vimpat's sales were up 220%. Sales for those drugs were also up in Europe, driven by further national launches throughout both the US and Europe.

   The company's R&amp;D efforts are focused on discovering treatments for severe diseases in its key product areas (central nervous system disorders and immunology), with an emphasis on antibody research. UCB is also working to expand the applications for its existing pharmaceuticals. For example, Cimzia is approved for the additional use of treating rheumatoid arthritis along with its primary use of treating Crohn's disease. Neupro is being studied for the additional use of treating restless leg syndrome. By gaining additional approvals on existing drugs, the company is able to earn more money from a single treatment and diversify its products ahead of patent expirations.

   To better focus on central nervous system drugs and immunology, UCB sold its US generics business Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals to
   <company id="105950">
    Lannett
   </company>
   for $1.23 billion in late 2015.

   UCB was formed in 1928 by Emmanuel Janssen as Union Chimique Belge (UCB). At that time UCB was primarily focused on manufacturing industrial chemicals. By the 1940s it was developing pharmaceuticals during World War II. Decades later, the company treats more than 200,000 patients. Its pipeline is stuffed with seven late-stage candidates and six early-stage, all in central nervous system and immunology.
