   Olivetti has IT in its blood, not to mention its name. The company provides multifunction inkjet imaging systems, laser and portable inkjet printers, photocopiers, and related supplies. Other products include calculators, fax machines, cash registers, point-of-sale terminals, postal equipment, ticketing machines, lottery terminals, and electronic voting systems. The maker of the first Italian typewriter, Olivetti once controlled 55% of former monopoly

   , the peninsular nation's #1 fixed-line and mobile phone operator. A 2003 reorganization turned the tables, however, and now Olivetti is the office equipment and systems services subsidiary of Telecom Italia.

  <p>
   Inspired by a trip to the US, Camillo Olivetti founded Olivetti in 1908 to produce the first Italian-made typewriter (introduced in 1911). After diversifying into office furniture, teleprinters, and adding machines, the company went public in 1932.
  </p>
  <p>
   Camillo's son Adriano led Olivetti into computers, and in 1959 the company developed Italy's first mainframe. That year Olivetti bought control of ailing US typewriter maker Underwood, which later became Olivetti Corporation of America (OCA).
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Adriano's death, the Olivetti family relinquished direct management of the firm, and in 1964 a consortium of bankers bought Olivetti. The firm, slow to switch from mechanical to electric office equipment in the 1960s, saw earnings stagnate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former
   <company id="41777">
    Fiat
   </company>
   executive Carlo De Benedetti bought 14% of the firm in 1978 (increased to 20% in 1988) and became CEO. De Benedetti slashed debt while increasing spending on research and development. Olivetti introduced its first electronic typewriter in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   OCA suffered through more than a decade of losses, and in 1982 De Benedetti sold it to Dallas-based ATM maker Docutel for a 46% stake in that company. In 1985 Olivetti bought the rest of Docutel and used it to establish a new US unit, Olivetti USA.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company unveiled its first PC in 1982, a year after

   rolled out its first desktop machine.

   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba

   bought 20% of Olivetti's Japanese operations in 1985. De Benedetti hoped AT&amp;T and Toshiba would boost Olivetti's global market share, but competition from lower-priced PCs hurt the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Europe Olivetti expanded further, buying 80% of the UK's Acorn Computers Group (1985);
   <company id="41853">
    Volkswagen
   </company>
   's ailing office products maker, Triumph-Adler (1986); and bank automation firms Bunker Ramo (1986) and I.S.C. Systems (1989). However, world demand for minicomputers softened by the late 1980s, and in 1991 Olivetti posted its first loss in 13 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   De Benedetti was convicted in 1992 of bankruptcy fraud in the scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. (His conviction was thrown out in 1998.) In 1995 Olivetti formed fixed-line operator

   and its 36%-owned
   <company id="89503">
    Omnitel Pronto
   </company>
   venture (formed in 1989) began offering mobile phone service. De Benedetti, pressured to resign in 1996, chose Francesco Caio as his successor. But Caio clashed with De Benedetti and quit after 70 days. Roberto Colannino, another executive close to the former CEO, replaced him. That year Olivetti sold part of its stake in Omnitel Pronto:
   <company id="41805">
    Mannesmann
   </company>
   and Bell Atlantic (now
   <company id="10197">
    Verizon
   </company>
   ) each bought 5.8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 venture capitalists bought Olivetti's PC business. That year Olivetti and Mannesmann formed OliMan as a telecom holding company for Omnitel Pronto and Infostrada; the German firm got a 25% stake.
   <company id="12443">
    Wang Laboratories
   </company>
   bought Olivetti's Olsy computer services business in 1998 in a multimillion-dollar deal that gave Olivetti an almost 19% stake in Wang (later reduced to about 16%). Mannesmann upped its ownership in OliMan to 49% in 1999, and OliMan expanded its stake in Omnitel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olivetti began redefining itself with its 1999 hostile takeover of
   <company id="42394">
    Telecom Italia
   </company>
   . It paid $33 billion for the larger rival. To help raise cash, it sold its stakes in Omnitel Pronto and Infostrada to Mannesmann (later acquired by
   <company id="47982">
    Vodafone
   </company>
   ) and agreed to sell its 80%-owned Ricerca subsidiary to

   , Olivetti's acquisition vehicle, in exchange for Tecnost stock were abandoned after shareholders voiced disapproval. The next year Olivetti bought the 26% of Tecnost it didn't already own and merged the two companies. In 2001 the company changed the name of its Lexicon unit to Olivetti Tecnost.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then Olivetti itself became the subject of a takeover bid. A holding company controlled by tire maker
   <company id="41369">
    Pirelli
   </company>
   and the
   <company id="41756">
    Benetton
   </company>
   family took over Olivetti in 2001 by buying out a group led by former Olivetti CEO Roberto Colaninno. After Colaninno stepped down,
   <company id="91650">
    Montedison
   </company>
   veteran Enrico Bondi and Pirelli's Carlo Buora were named co-CEOs (Bondi resigned from the board in 2002 and Buora stepped down after the 2003 reorganization). Then, to make the corporate structure a little easier to understand, and to capitalize on the core telecom strategy, which was bringing in more than 95% of revenues, Olivetti and Telecom Italia traded places, with the telecommunications firm becoming the parent entity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to the restructuring, Olivetti's largest shareholder was Olimpia (29%), a company owned by Pirelli, Edizione Holding (the Benetton family's holding company), and other investors.
