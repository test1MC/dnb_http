   The source of Corning's revenue and profits is transparently obvious: it's glass. Once known for kitchenware and lab products, the company makes glass, ceramic, and other components for a variety of products in the consumer electronics, telecommunications, automotive, and life sciences industries. Its products include substrates for flat-panel displays and computer monitors, optical fiber and cable, substrates and filters for automotive emissions control products, labware and scientific equipment, and glass and optical materials for a wide range of industries. Corning has about 90 manufacturing and processing facilities in some 17 countries. More than half of its sales come from the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Corning operates in five segments. Its largest, Display Technologies, accounts for 34% of sales and includes glass substrates for flat-panel liquid crystal displays. Optical Communications, which includes fiber and cable and other components for the telecom industry, brings in about 33% of sales. Corning's Specialty Materials business, which accounts for about 12% of sales, is powered by superstar cover glass product, Gorilla Glass, which is used in consumer electronics devices such as notebook computers, mobile phones, and TVs. Other segments include Environmental Technologies (substrates and filters for automotive and diesel products), 12% of sales, and Life Sciences (glass and plastic equipment for labs and other scientific applications), 9% of sales.

  <p>
   Customers based in the US generate 30% of Corning's revenue followed by China and Korea accounting for 20% and 16% of sales, respectively. The Asia-Pacific region as a whole contributes about 54%.

   Corning counts Korean LCD panel makers, including

   <company id="132810">

  <p>
   Corning's sales were sheared by 6%  in 2015 from 2014 by the combination of the impact of currency conversion and lower prices for some of its most important products. Revenue dropped to $9.1 billion in 2015 from $9.7 billion in 2014. The position of the strong dollar to the Japanese yen yanked about $446 million while prices fell about 10% in Display segment. Revenue from a key customer was interrupted because of a contract dispute that was resolved. On the plus side, the company's Optical Communications unit posted a 12% gain in revenue to nearly rival Display as Corning's top sales unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income experienced a more precipitous drop than revenue, about 45%, falling to $1.36 billion in 2015 from $2.5 billion in 2014. Currency again played a role as Corning more than $1 billion in a foreign currency hedge.
  </p>
  <p>
   Corning generated less cash flow in 2015 posting $2.8 billion compared to $4.5 billion in 2014.

   Corning thinks that the Glass Age is at hand -- and on the desk and on the wall and even in the car. The way people interact with technology is via a screen, whether to view or touch or both.  The company's R&amp;D process came up with Gorilla Glass, its protective cover glass used in thousands of consumer products such as cell phones, computers, and TVs. The company will keep up the R&amp;D tradition by pumping $10 billion into the search for and development of new products. It will look for advances in products for optical communications, mobile consumer electronics, displays, automotive, and life sciences vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Getting into the automotive market could blunt its perhaps biggest weakness: Concentration of customers. In 2015, Corning's 10 largest customers accounted for 45% of its sales. Three customers for its Display Technologies segment generated 62% of sales for the Optical Communications segment. Consolidations could result in even more concentration. In early 2016, the company formed a joint venture with
   <company id="40729">
    Saint-Gobain Sekurit
   </company>
   , normally one of its many competitors, to produce lightweight auto glazing that could be use throughout a vehicle..
  </p>
  <p>
   In automotive, as well as other markets, Corning faces is stiff competition.
   <company id="52333">
    Asahi Glass Company
   </company>
   , one of Corning's key competitors, has entered the automotive market, even building a plant for automotive glass in Mexico.

  <p>
   After wrapping up a key acquisition in 2014, Corning increased its procurement pace in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014, the company wrapped up the acquisition of what is now Corning Precision Metals. Corning bought the 43% owned by Samsung with $1.9 billion in stock, but the companies will continue to collaborate on technology development and products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Corning acquired iBwave Solutions, a developer of design software for in-building wireless solutions for a wide range of customers and system integrators. Its customers include telecom operators, system integrators, and equipment manufacturers in more than 80 countries. iBwave will operate under its current name as a wholly owned subsidiary of Corning in Corning's Optical Communications segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another deal with Samsung, Corning completed the purchase of Samsung Electronics Co.'s fiber optics business in 2015. Corning will integrate the business into its Optical Communications segment. The acquisition widens it optical portfolio and access to markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2015 acquisition of NovaSol, a provider of hyperspectral imaging systems, adds to the capabilities of Corning's Advanced Optics business unit in it Specialty Materials segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   And also in 2015, Corning completed the acquisition of TR Manufacturing, Inc., a provider of fiber-optic and copper cable/component interconnects and electro-mechanical assemblies to manufacturers in a range of technology industries. TR Manufacturing reports to the Optical Communications segment.

  <p>
   Amory Houghton started Houghton Glass in Massachusetts in 1851 and moved it to Corning, New York, in 1868. By 1876 the company, renamed Corning Glass Works, was making several types of technical and pharmaceutical glass. In 1880 it supplied the glass for Thomas Edison's first lightbulb. Other early developments included the red-yellow-green traffic light system and borosilicate glass (which can withstand sudden temperature changes) for Pyrex oven and laboratory ware.
  </p>
  <p>
   Joint ventures have been crucial to Corning's success. Early ones included Pittsburgh Corning (with
   <company id="11139">
    Pittsburgh Plate Glass
   </company>
   , 1937, glass construction blocks), Owens-Corning (with
   <company id="15483">
    Owens-Illinois
   </company>
   , 1938, fiberglass), and
   <company id="40132">
    Dow Corning
   </company>
   (with
   <company id="10471">
    Dow Chemical
   </company>
   , 1943, silicones).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1945 the company's laboratories had made it the undisputed leader in the manufacture of specialty glass. Applications for its glass technology included the first mass-produced television tubes, freezer-to-oven ceramic cookware (Pyroceram, Corning Ware), and car headlights.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII, Corning emphasized consumer product sales and expanded globally. In the 1970s the company pioneered the development of optical fiber and auto emission technology (now two of its principal products).
