   The Hardware &amp; Home Improvement segment's net sales in 2013 was $870 million (or 21% of its parent's net revenues). Sales growth was driven by double-digit improvements in the segment's US residential security and plumbing categories due to the housing market recovery.

  <p>
   Partnerships and product innovation are key the company's growth. In 2013, Kwikset entered into a strategic partnership with UniKey Technologies to offer hands-free access control technology enabled by a smartpone. That year, to support dealers in satisfying growing homeowner demand for sophisticated and flexible wireless security and home automation solutions, Kwikset offers its complete line of SmartCode locks with Home Connect technology for both Z-Wave and ZigBee wireless protocols at ADI branches across North America through a partnership with ADI.

  <p>
   In 2013, in a continuing effort to offer consumers locks that are part of a complete security and home automation system, Kwikset announced a new integration with ipDatatel, an innovator in the telecommunications and security industry. As a result of the arrangement, the Zigbee version of Kwikset's SmartCode deadbolt locks with Home Connect technology integrates with ipDatatel's Gateway product.
