   What keeps arctic explorers warm on the tundra and marathon runners dry in the long run? Polartec's high-tech fabrics do. The company -- which introduced Polarfleece more than 30 years ago -- makes more than 300 types of all-season synthetic textiles used primarily in the manufacture of performance apparel and outerwear under the eponymous Polartec brand. Its textiles are fundamental to active garments produced for retailers such as

   , and

   , as well as the military. Polartec is owned by private equity firm Versa Capital Management.

   Polartec is  a premium producer of innovative textiles and supplies advanced fabric innovations. Its products range from advanced lightweight wicking fabric to insulation and weather-protection textiles.

   Among the applications for Polartec fabrics, the US military apparel is a particularly promising outlet. Polartec's fabrics for hostile climates are used by all branches of the armed forces. The company has delivered to the

   Polartec stays afloat by offering more than just performance fabric. It is repositioning its signature brand, carving out sales for its fabrics by introducing new technologies and applications that deliver an end product with improved insulation, protection, and performance characteristics. The company holds more than 200 patents on fabric construction, thermal insulation, weather protection, wicking fabrics, and high loft fleece.

  <p>
   A technological alliance has been made between Polartec and Finetex EnE, a filtration materials maker. Polartec gained exclusive global rights to market Finetex's micro-porous membrane technology combined with Polartec's lamination engineering. The results are sold under the Polartec Power Shield Pro nameplate and offer an array of water resistant and breathable soft shell fabrics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Polartec also grows by rolling out new products. In 2013 it introduced Polartec Alpha synthetic insulation, a new fabric product with an emphasis on durability, versatility, breathability, and warmth. Adopters of the new product include

   Growing its network of clients, in 2013 the company signed deal with
   <company id="118976">
    Quick-Med Technologies
   </company>
   to allow it to develop a range of products using Polartec materials and technologies.
