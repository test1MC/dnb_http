   <company id="110036">

   To keep its portfolio of products fresh, GAF regularly rolls out new products. In 2013 the company began producing EnergyGuard Polylso Insulated Sheathing, a high-performance building envelope insulation that aims to reduce energy costs and increase comfort thanks to its high R-value. The company also launched a new color line -- TruSlate -- that includes an Americana Collection of five slates and an International Collection with three slates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also been focusing on expanding its manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) single-ply membranes, and polyisocyanurate (ISO) insulation materials by breaking ground on several new state-of-the-art plants nationwide. In 2015, it opened a new PVC manufacturing line at its commercial roofing plant in Cedar City, Utah, which also produces TPO and ISO products. GAF also announced that it was looking to open an additional plant in the eastern US to manufacture the three main product materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   GAF has also been a charitable company in recent years. In 2014, the company donated roofing materials and installation services from approved contractors across the US to
   <company id="48056">
    Habitat for Humanity
   </company>
   . Through its collaboration with contractors, GAF has helped to build more than 700 homes for needy families over a three-year period.

  <p>
   GAF operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 2001 through early 2010; it filed due to asbestos liability claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company agreed to a proposed settlement with the US and state of Vermont to take steps to clean up asbestos contamination caused by its former operations at the Vermont Asbestos Group Mine Site, as well as a dozen other industrial sites where GAF may have disposed of hazardous waste. Under the settlement, GAF will construct fencing, gates, and road barriers to restrict public access; provide onsite surveillance; monitor air emissions; and conduct dust suppression over a span of eight years. It will also pay $850,000 for damages to local wetlands and waterways contaminated by the site.
