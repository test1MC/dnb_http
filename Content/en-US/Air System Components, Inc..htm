   An air conditioner is nothing but a sum of its parts, with Air System Components (ASC) supplying the parts. It makes components such as grilles, registers, diffusers, and terminals for air conditioning, heating and ventilation systems, and other air distribution products. ASC's products are used in industrial facilities, institutions, and commercial and residential buildings. Its brands, which operate as independent companies, include Titus, Krueger, Tuttle &amp; Bailey, Superior Rex, and PennBarry. Its Trion Indoor Air Quality arm focuses on air filtration supplies. Products are available through wholesalers and distributors. ASC, which has about 10 plants, is a subsidiary of Air Distribution Technologies.

  <p>
   In 2012 the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquired Air Distribution Technologies from British engineering firm
   <company id="90096">
    Tomkins
   </company>
   for $1.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Tomkins was acquired by Canada's
   <company id="52539">
    Onex
   </company>
   and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5 billion. The deal helped steady Tomkins in the midst of an uneasy market and provided shareholders a nice payday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2010 Tomkins added to ASC's lineup of brands with the acquisition of Koch Filter Corporation, a maker of non-residential air filters in the US.
