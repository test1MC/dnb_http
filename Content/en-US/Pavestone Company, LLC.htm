   Pavestone Company has cobbled together quite a niche. The company manufactures concrete pave stones used to create patios, pathways, driveways, landscape edgers for gardens and flowerbeds, and retaining walls for terraces and larger-scale planters. Pavestone offers its products in a wide range of shapes, colors, and textures. Customers include architects, engineers, and contractors who work on commercial, residential, retail consumer, and industrial projects, as well as do-it-yourself homeowners. Founded in 1980, the company boasts more than 20 regional manufacturing locations throughout the US. Since 2012 it has been owned by packaged concrete company
   <company id="120898">
    QUIKRETE
   </company>
   .

   Since being acquired by QUIKRETE, Pavestone has been expanding its business. In 2013 it bought a manufacturing facility located in Bowman, South Carolina, that makes a variety of pavers, patio stones, wall blocks, thin bricks, and other hardscapes for the region's retail and commercial customers.

  <p>
   Pavestone was founded in 1980 by Bob Schlegel, who later sold the business to Oklahoma Publishing Company. In 2012 industry giant QUIKRETE bought the firm.

   The deep recession and accompanying slowdown in construction, depressed demand for Pavestone's pave stones. Amid falling sales, the company reduced its workforce by about a third to cut costs. Other actions included an unsuccessful merger plan with rival
   <company id="111761">
    Oldcastle
   </company>
   (nixed by the
   <company id="139112">
    Federal Trade Commission
   </company>
   as anticompetitive in 2009), followed by a successful search for a private investor, Oklahoma Publishing, which bought Pavestone in 2010.
