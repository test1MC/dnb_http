   Ascent Healthcare Solutions is banking on the idea that one doctor's trash could be another doctor's treasure. The company is out to help hospitals with the three "R"s -- reduce, reuse, and recycle. Ascent focuses on reprocessing disposable medical devices for health care facilities (from small rural providers to surgery centers and group purchasing organizations). Its OR-based systems permit the collection of thousands of tons of devices marketed as "single-use," as well as a range of recyclable materials. After collecting the used devices, it cleans, sterilizes, tests, and then returns them from its centers in Florida and Arizona. The company is part of the MedSurg division of medical products maker

   Venture capital firms Coral Ventures,

   In 2001, Alliance Medical bought Paragon, a company that specialized in electrophysiology catheter reprocessing. The company shelved plans to go public in 2002. In 2006 Alliance merged with Vanguard Medical Concepts and changed its name to Ascent.
