   When you think SCHOTT. . .think glass. Schott AG's varied lines include architectural glass, kitchenware (Jenaer Glass), cooking surfaces (CERAN), opticals, lighting, lab equipment, pharmaceutical packaging, and components for appliances, television, and computer screens. SCHOTT is also involved in high-tech glass applications such as solar power products, photovoltaics, fiber optics, lithography, and semiconductor manufacturing. Additionally, it makes hermetic enclosures for automotive and aerospace electronics and sensors. About 75% of the company's sales are generated outside of Germany. SCHOTT, along with
   <company id="59002">
    Carl Zeiss
   </company>
   , is owned by
   <company id="91093">
    Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung
   </company>
   , an independent foundation based in Germany.

   Schott Glas crystalized from the collaborative work of German chemist Otto Schott, physics professor Ernst Abbe, and optical instrument specialists Carl and Roderich Zeiss. The men founded Glastechnische Laboratorium Schott und Genossen (later called Jenaer Glaswerk Schott und Genossen) in Jena, Germany, in 1884. Carl Zeiss and Abbe had worked together since 1866 and had been partners at the Zeiss Works in Jena since 1875. Schott met Abbe in 1881, and Abbe urged Schott to apply scientific techniques toward the development of new kinds of optical and industrial glasses for use in Zeiss' microscope products. The collaboration soon became the primary source of raw materials for the Carl Zeiss Works.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carl Zeiss died in 1888, and the following year Ernst Abbe founded the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung (similar to a foundation) in order to help preserve the social ideals of the founders. Abbe transferred his shares in the Zeiss and Schott works to the Stiftung in 1891. Otto Schott followed suit in 1923. Between 1887 and 1893, Schott developed borosilicate glass capable of withstanding high temperatures. The world's first television funnel screen came in 1936.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allied bombs did substantial damage to the Schott works during WWII. After the war, in accordance with the agreement fashioned at Yalta, Germany was divided into four sections, each of which was controlled by a major ally (US, France, England, USSR). Schott's Jena works fell under the control of the Soviets in 1948, and the works became a communist, nationalized enterprise. By 1952, with the Iron Curtain separating East and West Germany, the works at Mainz became the new headquarters for Schott Glas.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the move, Schott continued its glassmaking innovations. The company's ZERODUR glass-ceramic helped advance telescope mirror substrates used in astronomy in 1968. CERAN glass-ceramic cooking surfaces followed in 1974. In 1991 Schott produced the world's largest telescope mirror substrate, with a diameter of 8.2 meters; other technological advances led to the company's 1993 production of flat-display glass as thin as 0.03 mm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schott acquired Indian pharmaceutical tube maker Bharat Glass in 1998. The following year Schott struck up a deal with China's largest producer of TV screens to manufacture large-format TV screens. In 2000 Schott announced that it would take several of its subsidiaries public in order to fund future growth. Schott also formed a joint venture with Japanese PC and semiconductor maker NEC to make hermetic terminals used to protect electronic parts. In 2002 the company founded Schott Nexterion, which produces glass substrates for "biochips," and RWE SCHOTT Solar, a joint venture that had RWE Solutions and Schott Glas combining their terrestrial photovoltaic operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Schott was made a legally independent stock corporation with its shares fully owned by Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung. Its legal name changed from Schott Glas to SCHOTT AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   SCHOTT Solar was formed as a joint venture with
   <company id="91237">
    Wacker Chemie
   </company>
   , which in late 2009 decided to withdraw from its solar wafer joint venture WACKER SCHOTT Solar. It transferred its stake to SCHOTT Solar, which continues to focus on solar cell and module production.
