   Some people think petroleum is just fine the way it is; NewMarket thinks it needs a little something extra added to it to improve engine performance. The company is a holding entity for two petroleum additive subsidiaries:
   <company id="133036">
    Afton Chemical
   </company>
   (its primary business) and
   <company id="132565">
    Ethyl Corporation
   </company>
   . Afton Chemical manufactures petroleum additives used to improve the performance of gasoline, diesel, and other fuels and as a lubricant in motor oil, fluids, and grease. Ethyl's main product is the antiknock additive tetraethyl lead, though TEL has lost substantial ground in markets where unleaded gas is preferred or required.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has operations in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America. It operates six Research, Development, and Testing facilities in Ashland and Richmond, Virginia (US); Bracknell and Manchester (UK); Tsukuba, Japan; and Suzhou, China. It has about 10 Manufacturing and Distribution facilities in the US, Belgium, India, the UK, Brazil, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for 36% of total sales in 2015; Europe, Middle East, Africa, India (EMEAI), 31%; and Asia-Pacific, 21%

   NewMarket's petroleum additives are used in lubricating oils and fuels to enhance their performance in machinery, vehicles, and other equipment. The petroleum additives marketplace is comprised of two broad product applications: lubricant additives and fuel additives. Lubricant additives (81% of 2015 sales) are highly formulated chemical packages that improve the efficiency, durability, performance, and functionality of mineral oils, synthetic oils, and biodegradable fluids, thereby enhancing the performance of machinery and engines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuel additives (18%) are chemical components and formulations that improve the refining process and performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels, resulting in lower operating costs, improved vehicle performance, and reduced tailpipe or smokestack emissions.
  </p>
  <p>
   NewMarket's
   <company id="133036">
    Afton Chemical
   </company>
   unit is among the world leaders in producing lubricant additives. The company joins with
   <company id="59701">
    Infineum
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10921">
    Lubrizol
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="108652">
    Chevron Oronite
   </company>
   to produce more than 80% of the world market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though its
   <company id="132565">
    Ethyl Corporation
   </company>
   subsidiary still markets its primary product, tetraethyl lead, in the US and abroad, sales have dwindled to less than 1% of NewMarket's overall business. The company plans to eliminate the Ethyl segment at some point in the future as the global market for leaded gasoline is phased out.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another subsidiary, NewMarket Services, provides various administrative services to NewMarket, Afton, and Ethyl.

   Lubricants are widely used in operating machinery from heavy industrial equipment to vehicles. The petroleum additives market is an international marketplace, with customers ranging from oil companies and refineries to OEMs and other specialty chemical companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The engine oil market's primary customers include consumers, fleet owners, service dealers, and OEMs. Engine oil additives are typically sold to lubricant manufacturers. Industrial additives are generally sold to oil companies, service dealers for after-market servicing, and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other products includes hydraulic transmission fluids, universal tractor fluids, power steering fluids, shock absorber fluids, gear oils, and lubricants for heavy machinery. These additives are sold to oil companies for ultimate sale to vehicle OEMs for new vehicles (factory-fill), service dealers for aftermarket servicing (service-fill), retailers, and distributors.

  <p>
   In 2015 (after five years of growth) NewMarket's net revenues decreased by 8% to $2.1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Petroleum additives revenues decreased in all regions, except for Latin America, reflecting lower net sales (with decreases ranging from  7% in North America and Asia-Pacific to 15% in EMEAI) due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and lower selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income increased by 2% to $238.6 million due to a decrease in interest and financing expenses, and other income  primarily reflecting the impact from a derivative instrument representing an interest rate swap recorded at fair value through earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 NewMarket's operating cash inflow increased by 14% to $268 million (compared to $235 million in 2014) due to higher net income and a decrease of $15 million as the result of higher working capital requirements.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NewMarket pursues a strategy of organic growth with an emphasis on product innovation. Its research is focused on the development of new technologies that perform well in new, modern engine designs and changing fuel properties, as well as addressing the growing need for increased fuel economy and emissions reduction, and higher energy efficiency in the industrial additives product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also continuing research to improve its transmission fluid, axle oil, and tractor fluid product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company planned to continue to pursue growth through geographic and product line expansion, and to increase reinvestment in the business to meet its customers' growing needs and to assure future growth.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 it launched new technologies across all of its lubricant additive and fuel additive product areas, including new engine oil products including gasoline performance additives and diesel performance additives, as well as specification and distribution fuel additives.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, NewMarket expanded its laboratory and mechanical testing capabilities in five of its principal technical centers around the world: Richmond, Ashland, Bracknell, Suzhou, and Tsukuba. This increased its capacity for providing differentiated solutions and additional process development capability to enhance its speed-to-market for new products and technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash and streamline its operations, in 2013 the company sold its real estate assets for $144 million. The real estate development segment (NewMarket Development) represented the operations of Foundry Park I. In 2007, Foundry Park I entered into a Deed of Lease Agreement with MeadWestvaco under which it is leasing an office building which NewMarket built on three acres in Richmond, Virginia. The lease expires in 2023, subject to certain extension options.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Afton completed its acquisition of Polartech for $43 million. Polartech is a global company specializing in the supply of metalworking additives. The company acquired all physical assets of the Polartech business, including its headquarters, R&amp;D, and manufacturing facilities in the UK, as well as manufacturing sites in India, China, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   NewMarket was founded in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company.
