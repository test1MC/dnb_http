   The Ingersoll-Rand Climate Control Technologies division originally comprised Thermo King and refrigeration equipment maker
   <company id="53961">
    Hussmann
   </company>
   ; both were manufacturers of refrigeration systems. With the integration of
   <company id="40026">
    Trane
   </company>
   , which provides residential and commercial HVAC systems, Ingersoll-Rand created its Climate Solutions division to house the three businesses, which account for almost 70% of Ingersoll-Rand's revenues. The organizational changes were facilitated to create a more customer-focused business.

   -- Thermo King has been developing custom refrigeration units incorporating fuel-efficient engines to help companies control costs. Thermo King designed the Spectrum SB, a multiple-temperature refrigerated trailer unit with a 30-foot frozen compartment in the middle, for Wal-Mart, which subsequently equipped thousands of its trailers with the unit.

  <p>
   Thermo King's Frederick McKinley Jones Research and Development Center is the backbone of the company's operations. The center is named for the African-American engineer who developed the first transport refrigeration unit in 1935, and later co-founded Thermo King. The company has evolved through various owners. It was purchased by
   <company id="57858">
    Westinghouse Electric
   </company>
   in 1961 and then acquired by Ingersoll-Rand in 1997 for a little more than $2.5 billion in cash.
