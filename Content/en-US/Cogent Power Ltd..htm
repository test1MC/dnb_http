   <company id="152209">
    SSAB Svenskt Stål
   </company>
   , produces and supplies electro-technical materials and products. Electrical steels, having magnetic properties, are used for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. Cogent specializes in grain-oriented steels, 3% silicon-iron alloys that provide lower power loss and are used for power transformers. Its non-oriented steels are used for motors, generators, alternators, and other electromagnet applications. The venture has plants in South Wales and Sweden and a North American subsidiary, Cogent Power Inc.
