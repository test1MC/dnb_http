   Increasingly, Lexmark is about what ends up on a printed page than it is about the printing. Still a leading maker of printers and related supplies, the company has been adding software for capturing and managing data and images to its business. Its printer business, Imaging Solutions and Services (ISS), offers laser and dot matrix printers, multifunction devices, and related products. Through its Enterprise Software segment, the company offers content, document output, and business process management services. In November 2016 Apex Technology and investor partners closed on their acquisition of Lexmark.

  <p>
   Lexmark had hired Goldman Sachs to explore alternatives to its ongoing business strategy. A group of investors led by China-based Apex Technology and PAG Investment Capital bid about $3.6 billion for Lexmark, which was accepted. With the closing, Lexmark's Enterprise Software group is to be spun off and rebranded as Kofax, which Lexmark acquired in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ISS offers a broad portfolio of monochrome and color laser printers and laser multi-function products as well as a wide range of supplies and services covering its printing products and technology solutions. Enterprise Software offers a complete suite of Enterprise Content Management (ECM), Document Object Model (DOM), intelligent data capture and search software as well as associated industry specific solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   ISS accounted for more than 85% of revenue in 2014 with Enterprise Software bringing in the rest. In terms of products, supplies, which includes printer ink, made up 60% of Lexmark sales while hardware was 20% and software 20%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lexmark has facilities in the US, as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Mexico, The Netherlands, the Philippines, Switzerland, and the UK.  It sells its products in more than 170 countries, with the US accounting for about 46% of sales. The EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) accounts for about 35%. Lexmark grouped the other 19% of sales in "other international."
  </p>

  <p>
   The company distributes its printers and related products via IT resellers, direct marketing resellers, and copier dealers. It markets it software through a direct sales force, as well as a network of third-party resellers.

  <p>
   Lexmark's revenue fell 4% in 2015 to $3.5 billion from 2014. Revenue from the ISS unit dropped 12% from the impact of the company's exit from the inkjet printer market and from currency exchange rates. Sales of laser printer hardware fell from competitive pressures. Enterprise Software revenue, however, jumped 81% in 2015 on increases in maintenance and support, license, professional services and subscription revenue as the effect of the Kofax and ReadSoft acquisitions kicked in.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a loss of $40 million in 2015, compared to net income of $80 million in 2014. Higher expenses associated with the Kofax and ReadSoft acquisitions combined with the reduced revenue to cause the loss.

  <p>
   Like a number of other companies, Lexmark is de-emphasizing hardware to focus more on supplies and services that generate recurring revenue. The document management services offered in its Enterprise Software unit reflect that move as was the 2013 sale of its inkjet technologies and assets to
   <company id="119491">
    Funai Electric Co
   </company>
   for about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lexmark still depends on its printing products to generate software, supplies, and services sales. In 2016, it released seven single-function color laser printers and 11 color multi-function printers. The products run on faster computer chips to speed the printing process.

  <p>
   Lexmark significantly boosted its software business with the $1 billion acquisition of
   <company id="119703">
    Kofax Ltd.
   </company>
   in 2015. Kofax's software is aimed at increasing its customers' responsiveness to the needs of their customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015 Lexmark bought Claron, a provider of medical image viewing, distribution, sharing, and collaboration software technology, for $37 million, adding to Lexmark's capabilities in the medical and healthcare markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   A key 2014 acquisition was of ReadSoft AB, a provider of software that automates business processes on premise and in the cloud. ReadSoft's software manages hard copy and digital documents, extracting and verifying relevant information before depositing it into a customer's record system.

  <p>
   During the late 1980s, as a horde of Davids took aim at Goliath
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   , the computer giant began downsizing to become more competitive. IBM cut its workforce by 100,000 between 1986 and 1992 and began to sell off its peripherals businesses. One of these was Lexmark ("Lex" as in "lexicon" and "mark" as in "marks on paper").
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 IBM sold Lexmark to a group led by investment firm
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   for $1.5 billion. Martin Dubilier, who helped found the firm in 1978, learned the leveraged buyout (LBO) ropes as a turnaround expert for Jerome Kohlberg, founder of investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (now
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   ), during the 1970s. Clayton, Dubilier's LBO of Lexmark was financed primarily with bank loans, leaving the new company over $1 billion in debt. Marvin Mann, a 32-year IBM veteran, was appointed Lexmark's chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mann took a cue from his former bosses and did some downsizing of his own at Lexmark, cutting the number of employees from 5,000 to 3,000. Mann also put more of the responsibility for running the company in the hands of his line managers, allowing them to come up with their own goals and business plans rather than take strategy from above.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although many employees were given their walking papers, Mann put up a "Help Wanted" sign in his sales department. As an IBM subsidiary, Lexmark relied on Big Blue's general sales force and Mann now needed to create one from scratch. By the end of 1991, staff rose to 4,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   As another sign of Lexmark's break from IBM, where it sometimes got lost in the shuffle, Mann reorganized the company into four operating groups and made each group's financial information available to everyone in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lexmark began to flex its muscles as an independent in 1992, when it introduced the first products (IBM PC-compatible keyboards) bearing its own name rather than the IBM logo. That year Lexmark's first color printer debuted. Lexmark's operating profits doubled in 1992, its second year of operation. Using the additional cash flow, the company reduced its debt ahead of schedule, to about $750 million. In 1993 it made its first acquisition when it bought Australian printer maker Gestetner Lasers; the purchase increased Lexmark's presence in the Pacific Rim.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company entered the 2010s, it began to shift toward processing and managing information rather than printing it. Lexmark made a series of acquisitions of software companies leading up to its biggest deal, the $1 billion purchase of Kofax in 2015.
