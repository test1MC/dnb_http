   Hi-Tech's expertise is with difficult-to-manufacture liquid and semi-solid dosage products, including ophthalmic and inhaled pharmaceuticals. It provides contract manufacturing services to other drug firms needing this specialty. The company's products are marketed across the US through large retailers and wholesale distributors.

   Prior to Hi-Tech's acquisition by Akorn, the ECR division relaunched Zolpamist and DexPak in 2013, while divesting its Hylase and Orbivan offerings. The division announced its intention to focus its operations on Bupap, Tussicaps, Zolpimist, and DexPak.

  <p>
   Reuben Seltzer started Hi-Tech Pharmacal's predecessor, Success Chemical, around 1930 in the back of his brother's drugstore in Brooklyn, New York. His son, Bernard, joined the company in the late 1940s and continued the business after his father died. The firm was acquired in 1967 by drug wholesaler Ketchum &amp; Co. and adopted the name Ketchum Labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seltzer and an associate bought the liquid and ointment division from Ketchum in 1981 and started the new company as Hi-Tech Pharmacal to make generic drugs. It went public in 1992 and started its Health Care Products division the next year to market hemorrhoid pads, cough remedies, and skin creams. In 1994 the company purchased Dr. Rose, Inc., a maker of generic over-the-counter and prescription suppositories, creams, and lotions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hi-Tech Pharmacal's 1995 product introductions included generic equivalents of constipation medications developed by what is now Sanofi-Aventis. In 1996 the company began marketing DiabetiSweet sugar substitute for diabetics and other people on special diets. That year the company opened a facility for making sterile ophthalmic and ear medication products. In 1996 and 1997 Hi-Tech Pharmacal won FDA approval for six new products, including a generic substitute for hair-growth stimulant Rogaine. The next year it added a painkiller and pediatric antibiotic to its roster.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Hi-Tech Pharmacal signed a co-marketing agreement with Diabetic.com, a website that targets the needs of individuals with diabetes. The company also launched its Kosher Care brand of products (cough, allergy, and pain treatments), aimed at the kosher consumer market. The following year the firm further bolstered its Internet presence with its acquisition of diabetic support site SweetThoughts.com.
