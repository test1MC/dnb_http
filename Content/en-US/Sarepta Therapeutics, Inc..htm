   Sarepta Therapeutics makes sense of antisense. A developer of biopharmaceutical compounds, the company's investigational therapies are based on its RNA-based antisense drug technology, which can halt disease processes at the genetic level. The drug developer is working on drugs that could potentially be used in the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including genetic and infectious diseases. Sarepta has research and development programs for targets including the Ebola and Marburg viruses, dengue fever, anthrax, and pandemic influenza. In 2016 the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   granted tentative approval for Sarepta's Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, eteplirsen. It was the first FDA approval of a treatment for that condition.

  <p>
   Sarepta's development pipeline (eight candidates) is primarily focused on treatments for infectious and genetic diseases. Its efforts in the area of infectious disease include compounds targeting pandemic influenza strains (such as H1N1) and bioterrorism targets, including Ebola and Marburg viruses; these programs are conducted in collaboration with the

    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company currently has eteplirsen (for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD) and AVI-7100 (for the treatment of influenza) in active clinical development. Its other candidates are in preclinical development or inactive.

  <p>
   The company intends to commercialize eteplirsen itself in the US. It will build a sales force and establish a sales infrastructure when the drug receives marketing approval.

  <p>
   Revenues are generated by contracts with US and European governments. Revenue fell 31% to $9.7 million in 2014 as an agreement with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to develop AVI-700 as a treatment for pandemic H1N1 influenza virus expired.

  <p>
   The company has incurred operating losses every year since its founding. Its net loss increased 21% in 2014 to $135 million as R&amp;D and personnel expenses rose. Its accumulated debt was $679 million at the end of 2014.

  <p>
   Sarepta is focused on becoming a leading developer and marketer of RNA-targeted therapeutics to treat rare, infectious and other diseases. It has worked toward this by investigating a varied portfolio of drug candidates. Its key strategic efforts include advancing the development of candidate eteplirsen and others, explore funding and collaboration around other treatment candidates, and partnering, licensing, or collaborating with other industry firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Sarepta met with the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   to secure New Drug Application (NDA) status for eteplirsen, a proprietary therapeutic aiming to treat DMD. The following year, after much dispute and under pressure from patients' families and advocates, the FDA cleared the treatment for the deadly degenerative condition. The drug entered the accelerated approval program for promising treatments that have yet to be confirmed in trials. It was the first drug approved in the US to fight the disease.
