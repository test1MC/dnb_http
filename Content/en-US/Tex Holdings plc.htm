   You won't find Tex Holdings home on the range, but the company is quite comfortable at construction sites. The company, operating through several subsidiaries, produces industrial boring and construction equipment (asphalt and concrete mixers, chip spreaders, compactors, drills, emulsion sprayers, and hammers), plastic products (custom injection moulding), and retail display boards and panels. Its Tex ATC unit designs, manufactures, and installs prefabricated air traffic control rooms. The company's Allied Kiosks &amp; Enclosures makes wall-, post-, or floor-mounted enclosures. The UK accounts for about 85% of sales.
