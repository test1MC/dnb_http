   Phillips-Medisize Corporation injects itself into the competitive world of molded products. The manufacturing company is a custom injection molder of plastic and metal, creating end products that range from calculators to fishing reels to radios. It even makes molded parts for firearms. The company's tooling department offers market-entry design, production, and prototype tooling services. Phillips-Medisize serves customers primarily in the automotive, consumer electronics, defense, and medical markets. It is owned by private equity firm

   The company posts annual sales of over $500 million with 75% of its total revenue coming from drug delivery, medical device, primary pharmaceutical packaging, and diagnostic products. (These include disposable insulin pens, glucose meters, specialty inhalation drug delivery devices, single use surgical devices, and consumable diagnostic components.)

   Phillips-Medisize in 2013 acquired two manufacturing operations from
   <company id="176933">
    Adval Tech Group
   </company>
   . These included China-based Adval Tech Medical (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. and Mexico-based Omni Manufacturing Services S.A. de C.V. This transaction expanded Phillips-Medisize's global footprint and allowed it to immediately service its global customer base from these two new locations.

  <p>
   The company expanded in 2011 through the purchase of Medisize, Inc. -- a Finland-based outsource provider of design and manufacturing services catering to European clients in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic and medical device sector. The key transaction augmented Phillips' medical business by widening its European footprint and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. On the heels of the deal, the former Phillips Plastics Corporation updated its name to Phillips-Medisize Corporation throughout 2012.

   Phillips-Medisize has stayed competitive by investing heavily in up-to-date technologies that permeate the company's processes from design to manufacture. For example, the company pioneered magnesium injection molding, a process in which magnesium chips are melted into a semifluid state for die casting. The resulting parts require no additional finishing, are 100% recyclable, and can replace aluminum because they also shield against electromagnetic and radio frequency interference. The fact they weigh much less than aluminum (by as much as 30%) makes them attractive to the

    US Army
   </company>
   , whose goal is to reduce the weight of the equipment that soldiers carry. The magnesium components, which are durable and resistant against corrosion, are used in military communication gear.
