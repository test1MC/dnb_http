   Competing with the big boys is more effective in an alliance. The Craft Brew Alliance brings together Redhook Ale Brewery (Seattle), Widmer Brothers Brewing (Portland), and Kona Brewing (Kona, Hawaii) to brew, market, and sell their beers throughout the US and in international markets. The Alliance divides its business between beer, comprising brewing and selling craft beers, and pubs and other operations, including five pubs, four of which neighbor its breweries. Its lineup offers year-round and flagship brands (Pilsner, Hefeweizen, Longboard Lager). The Alliance competes against big beer makers and works with them. Its beers are distributed through an agreement with
   <company id="10116">
    Anheuser-Busch
   </company>
   , which owns about 32% of the Alliance.

  <p>
   Craft Brew Alliance (CBA), formerly Craft Brewers Alliance, was formed through the merger of Pacific Northwest brewers Redhook Ale and Widmer Brothers in 2008. Included in the deal were Widmer's minority interests in Kona Brewing and Goose Island Beer. In 2011 CBA sold its 42% stake in Fulton Street Brewery to Anheuser-Busch, a subsidiary of
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   , (A-B) for about for $16 million. As part of the deal, CBA received additional retailing support and lower distribution fees from A-B.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in late 2012 signed an agreement with CraftCanTravel to distribute its craft beer brands in Europe and Asia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   More than 80% of CBA's revenue comes from beer sales made through retailers that it reaches through distributors aligned with Anheuser-Busch. Another 6% of revenue was generated by contract brewery done for other beermakers. The CBA's pubs account for the remaining revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CBA brewed more than three-quarters of a million barrels in 2015 led by Kona, which accounted for 47% of production. Red Hook and Widmer beers each made up about a quarter of shipments. The alliance's gluten-free Omission brand accounted for the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CBA operates four company-owned breweries in Portland, Oregon; Woodinville, Washington (a Seattle suburb), Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. It also runs a brewery in Memphis, Tennessee that's owned by its brewing partner. Additionally, the company owns and operates two small breweries in Portland, Oregon and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

  <p>
   Besides distribution through A-B wholesalers, the alliance maintains its own sales and marketing organization that handles brand management, field marketing, field sales, and national retail sales. The company advertises and promotes its products through television, radio, print, outdoor advertising, on-line and social media, sponsorships, trade events, promotions and print. In 2015, A-B owned distributors accounted for 35% of the company's shipment.

  <p>
   In 2015, revenue increased 2% to $204 million from 2014. Beer-related revenue grew 2% with a product mixed shifting from draft to packaged beer, which has a higher selling price per barrel. More visitors dropped in to sample beer at the alliance's pubs in Hawaii, which pushed pub-related revenue 6% higher.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit fell 28% to $2.2 million in 2015 from 2014. The company conducted a planned sales and marketing push in 2015, which reduced profit.

  <p>
   The CBA's strategy is to pour it on.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company expanded its geographic reach through partnerships with regional brewers. It teamed up with Appalachian Mountain Brewery, based in Boone, North Carolina, to reach more beer drinkers in the southeast US. And it partnered with Cisco Brewers, based in Nantucket, Massachusetts, for a piece of the New England market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CBA has planned to invest $10 million to expand the capacity of its Portland brewery to 750,000 barrels. In Hawaii, the operation at Kailua-Kona is adding another 100,000 barrel capacity.
