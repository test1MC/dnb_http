  <p>
   CMC's revenues have fallen the last few years, dropping 23% from$ 5.99 billion in 2015 to $4.61 billion in 2016. Its profits plummeted by 61% from $142 million in 2015 to $55 million in 2016 mainly due to the payment of debt. CMC's operating cash flow also skyrocketed by 87% during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue dip for 2016 was fueled by decreases across all segments. Most notably, Marketing and Distribution segment revenue decreased by 37% due to a decrease in volumes from the raw materials and steel trading divisions headquartered in the US and a decline in average selling prices in Europe.

  <p>
   CMC has responded to its turbulent balance sheet by lowering inventory costs, maximizing internal purchases, and opening new mills. Throughout 2015, the company sold its Australian steel distribution business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the summer of 2015, the company announced plans to build a new mini-mill in Durant, Oklahoma, to better serve a growing North Texas market as well as expand into markets in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.

  <p>
   Russian immigrant Moses Feldman moved to Dallas in 1914 and founded scrap metal company American Iron &amp; Metal the next year. In the 1920s Feldman suffered a heart attack, and his son Jake helped out with the business. Low metal prices hurt the company during the Depression. In 1932 Jake formed a two-man brokerage firm, Commercial Metals Company (CMC), which was combined as a partnership with his father's scrap metal operations. Moses Feldman died in 1937. CMC was incorporated in 1946 and began buying related businesses during the 1950s. It was listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1960.
