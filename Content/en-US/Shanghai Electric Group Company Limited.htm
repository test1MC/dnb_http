  <p>
   In 2014 Shanghai Electric's net revenues decreased by 3% due to a dropin high efficiency and clean energy sales as a result of a decline in the coal-fired power equipment business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income increased by 8% in 2014 due to a decrease in the cost of sales and share of profits and losses accounted for using the equity method (joint ventures and associates).
  </p>

  <p>
   Shanghai Electric is focused on the energy industry as its core business. Its new development strategy is to move the company towards becoming an innovative, high-end technology, asset-light business structure, with group level centralized management and controls and simplified operations.

  <p>
   Shanghai Electric sold its equity interest in Shanghai Diesel Engine to
   <company id="57065">
    Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.
   </company>
   in 2007. The diesel engine subsidiary makes engines for commercial trucks and passenger cars, not key end markets for Shanghai Electric. The company also plans to exit the solar energy business by selling its stake in Shanghai Topsolar Green Energy. A deal to sell its 35% interest in the company fell through in 2009 when the buyer, Yancheng Dongtou New Energy Equipment, defaulted on its second payment. Shanghai Electric, which has not found a way to incorporate its solar energy holdings profitably into its future development plans, will focus instead on the wind power sector, which is more in line with its core turbine and power generation equipment business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shanghai Electric has expanded geographically and has won contracts to build power plants outside of China. In 2009 the company scored a contract worth about $1.4 billion from Vietnam Electricity Group to build a coal-fired power plant in southern Vietnam. Earlier that year the company got a contract from the state-owned Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh Ltd. to build a power plant in Bangladesh.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shanghai Electric consolidated three joint ventures with
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   into one company. Shanghai Power Equipment Co. Ltd., Shanghai Turbine Co. Ltd., and Shanghai Turbine Generator Co. were combined into one new company, Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. Shanghai Electric owns 60% of the consolidated JV firm, while Siemens holds 40%. Siemens has also agreed to partner with Shanghai Electric on expanding its power generation business into overseas markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shanghai Electric Power Generation has also announced plans to work with Saudi group ACWA Power International, which builds power and desalination plants, on two projects in the Gulf region. The partnership demonstrates China's growing role as a key infrastructure contractor in the oil-rich region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded as China's first machinery factory in 1880.
