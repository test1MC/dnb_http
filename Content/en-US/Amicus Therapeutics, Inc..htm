   Amicus Therapeutics develops drugs that treat rare genetic diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders. Unlike other treatments which replace defective enzymes, Amicus uses small molecule pharmacological "chaperones" which bind to a patient's own defective proteins and restore their functions, a process it calls Chaperone-Advanced Replacement Therapy (CHART). Its lead drug candidate, migalastat HCl, is aimed at aiding patients with Fabry disease. Other candidates are in development to treat Pompe disease. The company is also researching treatments for neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's.

  <p>
   While its targeted disorders are rare, Amicus Therapeutics is not the only biopharmaceutical firm vying to introduce treatments for Fabry and Pompe disease.
   <company id="13560">
    Genzyme
   </company>
   (part of
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   ) already has marketed products available to treat both of the lysosomal disorders. But Amicus is persisting, confident that its product will be easier to manufacture (Genzyme's delicate protein manufacturing has been marred with contamination woes), easier to administer (oral rather than intravenous), and easier for the body to distribute.

  <p>
   As a development-stage company, Amicus has not reported any significant revenue. In fiscal 2015, the company made
   <em>
    no
   </em>
   revenue, versus $1.2 million in research revenue in 2014. (This was due to the ending of a collaboration in September 2014.) Net loss in 2015 totaled $132.1 million, nearly double its net loss in 2014. The increase in loss was largely due to the absence of revenue as well as a 62% increase in R&amp;D expenses and a doubling of general and administrative expenses including consulting fees and personnel costs.

  <p>
   Amicus focuses on bringing treatments for rare ailments to the market, especially ailments that don't yet have any treatments available. While migalastat remains its lead candidate (it expects to introduce the product under the name Galafold in Europe, followed by a launch in the US), the company has also expanded its portfolio through the acquisition of Scioderm and through the continued development of proprietary biologics.

  <p>
   In 2015, Amicus Therapeutics acquired private biotech Scioderm, which specialized in rare diseases including epidermolysis bullosa (EB), for $229 million. The purchase added a late-stage topical cream for the treatment of EB -- potentially the first treatment to hit the market -- to the company's rare disease candidate portfolio.
