   Calsonic Kansei manufactures automobile parts and modular systems. A module clusters a number of components (for instance, a dashboard, instrument panel, glove box, and radio) into a single part in order to simplify and lower the cost of automobile final assembly. The company's module offerings include front-end and cockpit modules. Other automotive products include exhaust and air-conditioning systems, as well as keyless entry systems. Calsonic Kansei also manufactures parts for the automotive aftermarket. In recent years the company has divested non-automotive offerings to focus on the auto industry.
