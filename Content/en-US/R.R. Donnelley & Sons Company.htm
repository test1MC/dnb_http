   If you can read it, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons can print it. The formerly huge printing firm split itself up into three smaller companies with separate management teams in 2016. Donnelley formed LSC Communications to serve its retail and merchandise clients. In addition to LSC and the R.R. Donnelley core printing business, the split created Donnelley Financial Solutions to focus on printing work for the financial, investment, and legal industries. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons remains the biggest of the three companies, with about $7 billion in revenue and 42,000 employees. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons will provide legacy printing services for direct mail, labels, forms, and other commercial and digital printing jobs.

   As the demand for printed catalogs, magazines, brochures, and other documents continues to shrink, printing companies are lowering prices in a effort to retain customers.

   Prior to its splitting up, Donnelley's revenue had been steady over the past several fiscal years. In fiscal 2015 the company brought in more than $11.2 billion in revenue. However, its profit margins had been shrinking.

   Before its breakup, Donnelley was twice as large as the printing industry's next biggest company

   . It hopes that by serving niches customer groups the three different companies can maximizes profit margins and shareholder value.
