Its tires are sold to consumers, the military, OEMs, and replacement centers. A major subsidiary of France-based tire maker giant

   Two plants specialize in making semi-finished goods taking raw materials and turning them into components for the plants that produce tires; one plant  produces only synthetic rubber. MNA produces finished goods at roughly 20 plants; two plants produce retreads for the trucks; and one site produces retreads for the aircraft industry.

   The breadth of MNA's mobility portfolio helps the company weather ecomomic downturns in a particlar segment. It is also seeking to gain revenues by offering tires for niche market. The company's Energy Saver tires, for example, feature reduced fuel consumption and emissions, compliant with government energy performance labeling requirements. In addition, Michelin North America's silica-based snow and ice tires are experiencing a sales bonanza, spurred by Quebec's mandatory winter tire regulation.
