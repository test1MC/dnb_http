   For Iberpapel Gestión pulp is far from fiction. The company manufactures printing and writing papers and pulp. Operating through multiple subsidiaries, its business is divided between three divisions: forestry (some 25 thousand hectares of eucalyptus woodland in Spain, Argentina, and Uruguay), industrial (comprising a cellulose fiber plant, a paper mill, and power plant) and pulp and paper or commercial segment. Commercial products include packaging paper, laser paper, photocopy paper, and labels. Outside of Spain, Iberpapel Gestión has operations across much of Western Europe, as well as in North Africa and South America. Exports represent about 55% of sales.

   During 2013 Iberpapel made investments in environmental projects, factory safety, increasing its production capacity, and improvements in cellulose production productivity. The company is focused on maintaining strict cost controls and increasing the sale of higher added value paper and continuing to open new markets. It also maintains a strategy to diversify its sales between the domestic and export markets.
