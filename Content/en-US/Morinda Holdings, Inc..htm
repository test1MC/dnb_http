  <p>
   Morinda was founded in 1996 by a group of executives who continue to lead the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Morinda Holdings is formally an investment holding company that operates through its multi-level marketing subsidiary Morinda, Inc. (dba Morinda Bioactives). Sales representatives are paid for products they sell (through catalogs, e-retailing, and tele-services) and for the sales made by representatives that they have recruited. The company claims to have created income producing opportunities for "hundreds of thousands" of people, at home and abroad. Commissions to distributors of the lineup are said to top more than $2 billion since Morinda's start in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Morinda Agricultural Products, established in 2008, is the parent company's research and development subsidiary for farm animal products based on the noni plant. The subsidiary distributes products under the MorindaMax brand name.

  <p>
   Morinda's growth strategy relies on product development and extending its geographic reach by recruiting new representatives. The company in 2012 changed its marketing subsidiary's name to Morinda, Inc., formerly known as Tahitian Noni International, to refocus the products as natural medicinal plant bioactives versus exotic noni fruitaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Morinda continues to diversify its product packaging and extend into new product categories. In 2014 the company launched two new product lines: TruAge Peformance that features TruAge Rapid Fuel, an energy beverage; and TruAge Body, which features TruAge Sugar Stop, designed to help the body block the adverse effects of sugar and starch absorption. Both products are designed to combat advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which may be influencers of diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's and other maladies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also developed The TruAge Scanner, a device which it claims can determine the age of one's "internal self" in just 12 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company's Morinda Bioactives subsidiary rolled out a new Thrive Adaptogenics line, which contains double the iridoids of Extra and four times the iridoids of TNI's Original Bioactive Beverage.
