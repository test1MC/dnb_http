   If you're a wind energy producer, Broadwind Energy wants to be the wind beneath your wings. The company serves the wind power generation industry with wind turbine towers and gear systems along with engineering, repair, and logistics services. Its gear systems are also used by other energy and mining companies. Broadwind's logistics segment specializes in transporting the oversize and overweight components used in constructing wind power generation facilities. The company's locations are spread across North America in areas where wind energy production is heavy.

  <p>
   The company divides its operations into three segments: Towers and Weldments (70% of sales), Gearing (18%), and Services (8%).

    Siemens

   and
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   represented about 10% of its sales in 2013. Throughout the year, about 80% of its sales were linked to the wind energy industry, predominantly for towers used for new wind turbines, but also to service the installed base of wind turbines.

   Despite three steady years of revenue growth, Broadwind has yet to be profitable. Revenues climbed 2% from $211 million in 2012 to $216 million in 2013. The growth for 2013 was driven by an 18% surge in sales within its Towers and Weldments segment. This was offset by a 27% decline in Gearing and a 21% dip in Services sales due to decreases in industrial demand and construction activity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Broadwind has posted 10 straight years of net losses; however, the losses have shrunk over the last four years. During 2013 its net loss decreased by 41% to $10.5 million due to a decline in cost of sales and gains on the sale of a South Dakota facility. Broadwind's operating cash flow has risen the last three years due to the decreased operating losses and larger receipts of customer deposits used to fund raw material steel purchases.

  <p>
   Broadwind is capitalizing on the steady rise in wind turbine tower and gear systems sales by expanding its customer base through its market research and sales force activities. It also focuses on keeping its operating structure lean. In 2013 it sold its tower plant in Brandon, South Dakota, for approximately $12 million. Two years earlier, in 2011, the company divested its logistic segment with the sale of Badger to BTI Logistics.
