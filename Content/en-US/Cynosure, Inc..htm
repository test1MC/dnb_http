   If beauty is only skin deep, then Cynosure can surely enhance it. The company develops, makes, and markets aesthetic laser and pulsed light systems used by dermatologists and doctors to remove hair, reduce pigmentation, rejuvenate the skin, and treat vascular lesions. For patients who want to go deeper, its Smartlipo workstation allows cosmetic surgeons to perform a less-invasive procedure than conventional liposuction to target and reduce fat. Cynosure's laser systems consist of a control console and one or more hand pieces. The company's direct sales force and international distributors market and sell its products worldwide under such names as Accolade, Affirm, Cynergy, Elite, and PicoSure.

    Hologic

   is buying Cynosure for $1.7 billion.

  <p>
   In early 2017, women's health firm
   <company id="13907">
    Hologic
   </company>
   agreed to buy Cynosure in a deal which will allow it to enter the medical aesthetics space. Through the deal, Cynosure will gain access to a wider customer base.
  </p>

  <p>
   In order to serve the broadest base of physician customers and patient skin types, Cynosure keeps its technology and product portfolio diverse. Its products incorporate various lasers and other light-based energy sources, from Alexandrite, pulse dye, and diode to Nd:Yag and intense pulsed light, for a range of aesthetic applications. The company offers its products at various price points, with many of its newer models capable of being upgraded to systems with greater functionality as customers' practices expand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although aesthetic treatment procedures that use lasers and light-based equipment are traditionally performed by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, Cynosure also targets a non-traditional customer base by marketing to primary care physicians and OB/GYNs. It sees opportunity here as more physicians opt to open medical spas, sometimes adjacent to their existing medical practices. Additionally, the company partnered with
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   to develop a laser treatment system for home use; the device received
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for treating facial wrinkles in 2012 and launched in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another key product for commercial distribution is the company's Cellulaze Cellulite Laser Workstation. Cellulaze is the only minimally invasive medical device approved for cellulite reduction. Outside the US, the company markets Cellulaze in Canada, the EU, Australia, and South Korea, and is seeking regulatory approvals in other international markets.

  <p>
   Outside of North America, Cynosure conducts sales and service operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Australia, South Korea, China, Japan, and Mexico. The company also sells through distributors in almost 120 other countries where it doesn't maintain a direct sales presence. In those markets, its distributors sell, install, and service Cynosure's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for about half of the company's 2013 sales.

   Cynosure sells its products globally through a direct sales force to dermatologists and plastic surgeons as well as physicians, obstetricians, and gynecologists offering extended "medical spa" services.

  <p>
   Revenue has risen steadily over the past few years at Cynosure keeps introducing new products. In 2013 it reported a 47% increase, from $153 million to $226 million, as domestic and foreign sales volume and pricing improved along with service revenue. In spite of those gains, net income took a hit for the first time in years as the company incurred litigation- and acquisition-related costs. Net income went from a peak of $11 million to a net loss of $2 million. Cash used in operations has followed a similar trajectory, rising to $14.6 million in 2012 but falling more than $11 million to $3.4 million in 2013 due to the drop in net income and deferred income tax.

  <p>
   To fulfill its goal of becoming the world's leading provider of non-invasive and minimally invasive aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure's strategy includes offering a full range of tailored aesthetic solutions, developing new and innovative solutions and products that target unmet needs in significant aesthetic treatment markets, and developing applications of its technology for home use. It also relies on business from its existing customers to generate additional revenue and ongoing comprehensive customer service to retain its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also relies on acquisitions to fuel growth and product expansion. To that end, in 2014 it purchased an aesthetic laser maker. The previous year it had launched two new products in China and received approval for PicoSure to treat acne scars and remove tattoos from the US

  <p>
   In 2014 Cynosure purchased Kentucky-based Ellman, a maker of aesthetic lasers, for $13.2 million. The move added Ellman's radio frequency technology, and its just-approved cellulite reduction laser, to Cynosure's product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cynosure acquired
   <company id="46080">
    Palomar Medical Technologies
   </company>
   in 2013 for some $294 million. The merger widened Cynosure's product offerings and strengthen its global distribution network; it also created cross-sales opportunities for both companies.
