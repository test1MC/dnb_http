  <p>
   The company is one of the top suppliers of premium down pillows to leading US hotels.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the downfall of Pillowtex (2003), Pacific Coast Feather became the largest pillow maker in the US. The company also holds rank as the nation's biggest down comforter manufacturer.

  <p>
   To extend its reach, Pacific Coast partnered with mattress giant
   <company id="44486">
    Spring Air International
   </company>
   in late 2013. As part of the alliance, Pacific Coast designs, makes, and markets a collection of top-of-bed accessories for consumers that are marketed under the Spring Air, Sleep Sense, and Chattam &amp; Wells names.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pacific Coast in 2014 bought an industrial facility in Gastonia, North Carolina, for $2.2 million in cash. The property will serve as the company's new mattress pad production operation to replace its Wayne, Nebraska, plant, which was destroyed by a tornado.
