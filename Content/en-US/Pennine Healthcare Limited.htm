   Ivor Shaw Ltd (dba Pennine Healthcare) makes products that may be disposable, but they're anything but dispensable. The family owned, UK-based company makes sterile, single-use medical devices at its facilities in Derby. The disposable products are designed for applications in airway management (suction catheters, mucus extractors), gastroenterology (stomach tubes, bile bags), and respiratory uses (anesthetic, oxygen therapy). Pennine Healthcare also makes urology catheters and surgical suction and microsuction tubes, as well as custom procedure packs for a variety of surgeries. Its products are sold to hospitals and other health care facilities by third-party distributors in more than 50 countries around the globe.

  <p>
   The company's 100,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant includes storage and shipping facilities and clean room areas for sterile packaging. Its medical devices are primarily made with plastic extrusion and molding technologies; some of its products, such as its procedure packs, include products made by third parties (such as disposable surgical drapes). All the manufacturing of the 70 million individually wrapped, sterile medical products takes place at its Derby plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pennine Healthcare's wide range of single use devices for surgical suction (including hollow-ware, and a range of diathermy disposables) are made in the same factory, making them readily available for inclusion as the basis of many custom procedure packs.

  <p>
   While Pennine Healthcare has seen some reduction in European sales in recent years as hospitals seek to cut expenses during troubled economic times, it is able to keep its competitive edge by investing in automation technologies and providing low-cost products that can be customized to individual customer needs. The company is also focused on growth in emerging markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   Upgrading its equipment, in 2014 the company introduced a new automation machine at its Derby-based manufacturing plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a big contract win, that year Pennine Healthcare announced its latest contract with
   <company id="135325">
    HCA International
   </company>
   (Hospital Corporation of America) to provide more than 100,000 procedure packs a year to the organization's six hospital sites across London.
