   John Crane seals the deal, if we're talking industrial process equipment. The company is a leading global manufacturer of seals, including Flexibox mechanical seals for oil and gas exploration, Safematic sealing and lubrication systems for the pulp and paper market, and Sealol metal bellows seals for oil refining, chemical processing, and refrigeration systems. Other products include bearings used in rotating equipment, power transmission couplings, and filtration systems. John Crane sells these products to OEMs, but a majority of its sales are made from providing aftermarket services on already installed equipment. The company is a subsidiary of UK-based

   with operations in more than 50 countries.

   The company divides its business broadly between OEMs (38% of sales) and aftermarket (62%).

  <p>
   John Crane contributes about a third of its parent's revenue and profit. In fiscal 2015 John Crane's revenues were down 2%, driven mainly by weaker demand from first-fit customers, although aftermarket for rotating equipment was resilient (up 4%).

  <p>
   The division's business strategy is focused on sustaining a cycle of growth and productivity. John Crane seeks to expand the installed base, build-out selected growth markets, maximize aftermarket performance, and drive continuous productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand for John Crane's products and services is influenced by a number of factors: global demand for energy, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and the need to replace aging infrastructure especially in emerging markets. These drivers coupled with a targeted acquisition strategy have helped to double its market since 2007. The company mainly seeks to acquire businesses that offer a complementary portfolio of products and services, primarily in the areas of engineered bearings and specialized filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward John Crane is looking to add sales offices and service centers particularly in the Middle East and Asia/Pacific, both regions with high growth potential.
  </p>

  <p>
   Many industries see Africa and the Middle East as the next logical places for growth. Accordingly, John Crane doubled down on its investment in the region by doubling the size of its Dubai headquarters in 2012. The site includes a special customer viewing area where onlookers can witness advanced oil and gas seal tests. It also expanded facilities in China and Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 John Crane acquired Texas-based Turbo Components &amp; Engineering (TCE), an aftermarket bearing repair facility. The TCE acquisition built on John Crane's global bearing business by giving it additional products, services, and brand recognition.

   John Crane traces its roots back to the creation of the Crane Packing Company in 1917. Prior to World War II, the company's UK-based operations were sold to Tube Investments, which resulted in the creation of TI Group. In 1987, TI Group acquired the remaining regional operations and the company reunited as John Crane (one of the company's original founders). In 2000, TI Group merged with Smiths Industries to become
   <company id="90392">
    Smiths Group plc
   </company>
   , a global technology company based in London. Today, John Crane is the largest subsidiary of Smiths Group.
