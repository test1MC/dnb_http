   </company>
   , it makes chemical catalysts and adsorbents, used in pharmaceutical, steel, and packaging products, as well as other chemicals, at some 30 sites worldwide. BASF Catalysts produces catalysts used in emission-control systems, such as catalytic converters for automobiles. The unit holds leading global positions in making mobile emission catalysts, process catalysts for the chemicals industry, and fluid catalytic cracking catalysts for refineries. It also sources precious and base metals as raw materials for manufacturers. Its battery materials unit serves cell and battery manufacturers worldwide.

  <p>
   German immigrant Charles Engelhard came to the US in 1891 to work as a representative for a platinum marketer. In a short time he managed to acquire stakes in Baker &amp; Co. (platinum), Irving Smelting (gold and silver), Hanovia, and a number of other precious-metals firms. In 1902 he set up Engelhard Industries as a precious-metals fabricator.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the early 1900s Engelhard pioneered industrial uses of platinum (such as for lightbulb filaments) while meeting traditional demands in dentistry and ornamentation. But it wasn't until the 1920s that Engelhard secured a regular supply of the previously scarce element. Working with Inco, he became the Canadian mining firm's sole US platinum dealer. In the 1930s Engelhard, working with DuPont, invented a process to mass-produce nitric acid using a platinum and rhodium catalyst. That decade Engelhard benefited from the development of the platinum spinnerette (used in machines that produced synthetic fibers). Engelhard acquired D.E. Makepeace (gold and silver sheet), Amersil (fused quartz), and National Electric Instruments (medical instruments) in the 1940s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Charles Engelhard Jr. set up his own company, Precious Metals Development, in South Africa in 1949, shortly before his father's death in 1950. He built his business exporting gold in the 1950s. With shipments of bullion banned, gold could be shipped internationally only in the form of art objects. Consequently, Engelhard's company made solid-gold plates, bracelets, and the like for export to markets where the gold was then melted down again. The flamboyant Engelhard, an acquaintance of Ian Fleming, is said to have been the model for the writer's Auric Goldfinger character.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engelhard expanded its chemicals business in 1963 by buying 20% of Minerals &amp; Chemicals Philipp (MCP), a producer of kaolin and fuller's earth owned by Philipp Brothers. In 1967 Engelhard and MCP merged to become Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corp. (EMCC).
  </p>
  <p>
   The fast-growing Philipp Brothers spun off EMCC as Engelhard Corporation in 1981. During the 1980s much of Engelhard's revenues came from selling fluid catalytic cracking materials to the petroleum industry. Engelhard acquired Harshaw/Filtrol Partnership (pigments and additives) in 1988. The company won a contract in 1992 to produce Russia's first automotive catalytic converters. It opened factories in Germany (1994) and South Africa (1995) and introduced automotive catalysts in Europe and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engelhard acquired Mearl Corp. (pearlescent pigments and iridescent film) in 1996 for $272 million. That year automaker Ford pulled its support of Engelhard's development of a smog-eating car, claiming that the capacity of the Engelhard radiators to convert ozone into fresh air on contact was much overestimated.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed a joint venture with UCAL Fuel Systems Ltd., called Engelhard Environmental Systems (India) Ltd., in 1997 to make automotive-emission catalysts in India. The next year Engelhard bought
   <company id="10798">
    Mallinckrodt
   </company>
   's catalyst businesses for $210 million. In 1999 Luxembourg-based Minorco sold its 32% stake in Engelhard. The same year Engelhard found itself the target of a Peruvian investigation into tax-fraud charges stemming from its gold operations in that country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engelhard sold its electroless gold-plating operations and its metal-joining products business in 2000. In 2001 the company launched a major expansion of its diesel-emission-control technologies in order to take advantage of new legislation passed by the US and Europe reducing emissions for heavy- and medium-duty diesel engines. In early 2002 Engelhard acquired the ceramic coating business of Pittsburgh-based O.Hommel Co. At the end of 2003, Engelhard decided to raise its prices on its specialty kolin-based and mica-based pigments to offset increases in energy, labor, and other expenses.
