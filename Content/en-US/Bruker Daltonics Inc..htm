   In 2013 the company joined with Denver-based Biodesix to provide support for Biodesix's VeriStrat and other diagnostic tests that utilize matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Also that year it announced a collaboration with Germany's CovalX in which the companies will use their respective technologies in protein interaction research and enhanced an agreement with BD Diagnostics (first established in 2010) regarding the distribution and support of their co-branded BD Bruker Maldi Biotyper system.

  <p>
   Bruker Corporation purchased three product lines from instrument manufacturer
   <company id="59190">
    Varian
   </company>
   for $37.5 million in cash in 2010. It formed a Chemical Analysis Division within the mass spectrometry business of Bruker Daltonics to house them. The product lines focused on laboratory gas chromatography, gas chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry systems. The acquisition added facilities in Australia and the Netherlands, and the US.

   In 2011 the company bought the radiation detection instruments business of Illinois-based PROTECT-US to expand its selection of products for homeland security and military applications. PROTECT-US specializes in instruments designed to detect concealed nuclear weapons by measuring radiation output. That year Bruker also acquired California-based Michrom Bioresources, a maker of a wide range of instruments, accessories, and consumables used in liquid chromatography (LC), to complement its core mass spectrometry product line.
