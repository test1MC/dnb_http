   No need to ask how the meal will be prepared at Weber-Stephen's company parties. The firm is one of the nation's top makers of barbecue grills, including portable, charcoal, and gas versions. Its portfolio includes several brands, such as Spirit, Genesis, Summit, Performer, One-Touch, and Weber Q. Portable models include Smokey Joe and Go-Anywhere. Founded in 1951, the company also markets fireplaces and grilling accessories. Weber-Stephen's products are sold through home improvement stores, hardware retailers, department stores, and mass merchandisers.

   The company has benefited from the popularity of football game tailgates and backyard parties on Fourth of July and Labor Day. Weber-Stephen's grill owners have also been firing up on Thanksgiving and Christmas to celebrate traditional holidays in a new way. Latching on to expanded interest in grilling, Weber-Stephen released the companion cookbooks
   <em>
    Weber's On the Grill: Chicken &amp; Sides
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Weber's On the Grill: Steak &amp; Sides
   </em>
   . The titles followed up
   <em>
    Weber's Way to Grill
   </em>
   . All three books were written by chef Jamie Purviance. Weber-Stephen also posts grilling recipes on its website.
