   Space is not the final frontier for Orbital ATK, as long as its aerospace/defense offerings are paving new paths. Through several operating segments, the company (formerly Alliant Techsystems) is a leading manufacturer of mission-critical products, including launch vehicles and related propulsion systems; satellites and associated components and services; composite aerospace structures; tactical missiles, subsystems and defense electronics; and precision weapons, armament systems and ammunition. It spun off its sporting goods business as Vista Outdoor in 2015 upon its merger with

   Alliant Techsystems and
   <company id="13046">
    Orbital Sciences
   </company>
   merged their aerospace and defense operations in early 2015, in a $5 billion transaction that created Orbital ATK, a defense and aviation systems developer with a combined $4.5 billion in revenue. As part of the deal, Alliant spun off its sporting segment (Vista Outdoor), which focuses on commercial sporting equipment, to shareholders.

   After the merger, Orbital ATK organized into three groups: Flight Systems, Defense Systems, and Space Systems. The Flight Systems Group provides small and medium-class space launch vehicles, solid rocket propulsion systems, interceptor boosters and target vehicles, and composite structures for commercial and military aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Defense Systems Group offers propulsion and controls for tactical missiles and missile defense interceptors, advanced defense electronics, and ammunition (small-, medium-, and large-caliber). Lastly, the Space Systems Group supplies commercial satellites, spacecraft for research and security missions, and spacecraft components and subsystems.

   In 2015 Orbital ATK established a jointly owned subsidiary in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to support the company's growing regional presence. The company is strengthening its existing alliances in the country and collaborating with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help it become stronger in the realms of national security, defense, and training.
