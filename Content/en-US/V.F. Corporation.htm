V.F.'s stable of popular outdoor brands include The North Face, Jansport, Vans, Kipling, SmartWool, and recently-acquired Timberland, a maker of adventure-oriented footwear and apparel.

Imagewear, which includes licensed athletic apparel and occupational clothing, accounts for around 10% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's direct-to-consumer operations include full-price stores, outlet stores, and e-commerce. V.F. operates more than 1,400 stores, most of which are single-brand shops, such as The North Face, Timberland, Vans, among others.

   The company generates most of its sales through other retail chains. V.F. Corporation's 10 largest customers accounted for 22% of total revenues in 2015. Retail-giant
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart Stores
   </company>
   is V.F.'s largest customer, accounting for 27% of its total sales, and a major buyer of its jeanswear. V.F. also sells products on a direct-to-consumer basis through VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites, which accounted for 27% of total revenues in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The apparel maker buys ads in trade publications, and on radio and television. Its digital initiatives include social media, mobile platforms, and the Internet. The company spent nearly $713 million (almost 6% of net sales) on advertising and promotion in 2015, compared to $714 million and $671 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   V.F. Corporation has enjoyed revenue and profit growth for much of the past several years as it continues its worldwide expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continued strong demand for its outdoor and action sports brands propelled V.F.'s sales up 1% to a record $12.38 billion in fiscal 2016 (ended January). Its Outdoor &amp; Action Sports line grew by 3% with light global sales growth for The North Face, Vans and Timberland brands. The company's direct-to-consumer revenue grew 6% thanks to new store openings and an expanding e-commerce business. Geographically, sales in the US rose 4% while international sales declined 5% mostly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income rose 1% to $1.2 billion thanks to revenue growth and because in FY2015 it incurred more than $250 million more in goodwill impairment and intangible asset expenses. Cash from operations fell 32% to $1.15 billion for the year as the company paid $250 million in discretionary contributions to its US qualified pension plan and used more of its cash to build its inventory.

  <p>
   V.F. Corp. takes a two-track approach to growth: both organic and through acquisitions. The company already established an aggressive revenue target of $17.3 billion by 2017 (up from a record $12.38 billion in 2015), expecting annual growth of 10% (8% from organic growth and 2% from anticipated acquisitions). To this end, V.F. Corp. opened 186 stores worldwide during 2015 after opening 188 stores and 164 stores in 2014 and 2013, respectively. It's been focusing on brands with high retail-growth potential, such as Vans, The North Face, Timberland, and Kipling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beyond its brick-and-mortar stores, the company expects its direct-to-consumer business, via e-commerce sites for countries around the world, will grow at a faster pace the overall growth of the company and amount to 25% of total sales by 2021. In late 2014, the company continued to roll out country-specific brand sites in Europe and Asia, enhancing its ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience. Also in 2014, V.F. opened a new distribution center in fast-growing China to enhance its responsiveness and grow sales in the emerging region.

  <p>
   The gear-and-apparel maker has invested heavily in acquisitions to further build its outdoor and action sports business, which has grown to account for more than 50% of sales. V.F. in September 2011 acquired global footwear maker
   <company id="12390">
    Timberland
   </company>
   for $2 billion. Marking the biggest acquisition in the company's history, V.F. was enticed by Timberland's overseas presence and its strong growth during the past decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010, on the wholesaling side V.F. took control of its Vans-branded products marketing venture in Mexico. The roughly $30 million purchase also put V.F. in charge of Vans retail stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   V.F., founded in 1899, is controlled in part by trusts established by its late founder John Barbey.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1899 six partners, including banker John Barbey, started the Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company. Barbey bought out his five partners in 1911 and changed the name of the Reading, Pennsylvania, company to Schuylkill Silk Mills in 1913. Barbey expanded the mills' production to include underwear and changed the mills' name to Vanity Fair Silk Mills (after a contest with a $25 prize in 1919).
  </p>
  <p>
   Barbey (who banned the word "underwear") and his son J. E. led their lingerie company to national prominence. The mills made only silk garments until the 1920s, when synthetics were developed. In response to the US embargo on silk in 1941, Vanity Fair changed to rayon, finally converting to the new wonder fabric, nylon tricot, in 1948. Vanity Fair was then manufacturing all stages of its nylon products, from filament to finished garment. It won awards for its innovative advertising with photographs of live models in Vanity Fair lingerie.
  </p>
  <p>
   J. E. owned all of Vanity Fair's stock until 1951, when he sold one-third of his holdings to the public. In 1966 the stock, previously traded over the counter, was listed on the
   <company id="41296">
    NYSE
   </company>
   .V.F. Corp. is not afraid to cut brands that aren't profitable to free up resources. In 2012, for example, it sold its majority stake in upscale men's designer brand John Varvatos to private equity  Lion Capital.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, V.F. Corp. was hoping to boost its outdoor business and its bottom line further through its 2013 bid to take over Australia's boardwear maker Billabong but the Aussie company wanted more than the 526.8 million Australian dollars (US $556 million) V.F. was willing to pay.
