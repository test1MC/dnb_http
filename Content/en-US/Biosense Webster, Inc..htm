   Biosense Webster makes products that explore, and in some cases alter, the terrain of the human heart. Its catheters and imaging systems are used by heart specialists worldwide to find and treat heart arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms). Its CARTO electrophysiology (EP) navigation systems uses 3-D imaging technology to map the heart's electrical activity and lets doctors navigate the heart using the company's diagnostic catheters. Biosense Webster also makes therapeutic ablation catheters and systems that destroy faulty electric pathways in the heart that cause arrhythmias. Biosense Webster is a part of
