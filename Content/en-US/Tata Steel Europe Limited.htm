   Tata Steel Europe is one of the largest steel producers in the world and a division of Indian giant
   <company id="138408">
    Tata Steel
   </company>
   . The steel producer makes coated and uncoated strip products, sections and plates, wire rod, engineering steels, and semi-finished carbon steel products. Customers include the automotive, construction, engineering, and packaging industries. The company ranks behind
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   among Europe's largest steel concerns, producing 15 million tons annually from operations primarily in the UK. However, adverse economic conditions forced Tata Steel in 2016 to drastically cut back its business in Europe. That year it agreed to sell its UK specialty steels business to Liberty House for £100 million.

   In 2015 Europe accounted for 52% of
   <company id="138408">
    Tata Steel
   </company>
   's total revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 2014-15 financial year, liquid steel production in Europe of 15.2 million tons was 2.5% lower than the previous year. Deliveries in 2014-15 nearly matched the improved volumes of the previous year (just 1.4% lower).

  <p>
   Tata Steel Europe has adopted a sales and marketing approach that focuses on investing in projects to improve its product mix and service offerings. It also conducts research programs aimed at developing cutting-edge manufacturing and product technology to improve the sustainability and use of its steel products.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, a tough global commodity market has forced the company to trim its operations. In 2016 the parent company announced a massive consolidation and debt reduction drive to bring debt down by 10 to 15% by the end of the year. It sold its long-products steel business in Europe to British investment firm Greybull Capital, and is looking to identify and sell other non-performing assets (including, possibly, its UK business in Port Talbot).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Tata Steel sold its South Yorkshire-based specialty steels business.

  <p>
   It took decades of aggressive government regulation of the UK steel industry to hammer out Corus Group. The process began with price-control measures in the 1930s and in 1950 the Labour government followed up by nationalizing steel producers on the grounds that they represented an unduly powerful oligopoly. A Conservative government took over in 1951 and sold most of the nationalized firms, primarily to their former shareholders. In place of nationalization, an Iron Steel Board -- with the power to set maximum steel prices and with the final say on large investments -- was formed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The presence of price controls and an ever-present chance of renationalization discouraged capital investment. Even so, technological innovations such as continuous casting and oxygen-based production enabled UK steelmakers to double production between 1945 and 1960. Meanwhile, competition from European producers stiffened, as did competition from a rebuilt Japan. To add to the UK steel industry's woes, demand began slacking off in the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1964 the Labour Party, which was committed to renationalizing steel, returned to power. It passed the Iron and Steel Act of 1967, nationalizing about 90% of the UK's steel-making capacity under a new holding company, British Steel Corporation (BSC). However, specialized, nonintegrated companies and rerolling companies remained freestanding, allowing them to benefit from price controls on BSC steel. BSC consisted of 14 crude steel companies' assets with a 475,000 ton annual capacity. The government compensated shareholders based on stock market values, paying much more than the companies were worth. To make matters worse, the companies' return on capital was a meager 3.7%.
  </p>
  <p>
   BSC began consolidating its small, outdated facilities into larger works with advanced equipment. In the midst of a huge investment program, the mid-1970s' energy crisis hit and steel demand fell; the company began closing its outdated mills. A 1980 strike cost BSC a large chunk of its market share and showed that steel requirements could be met through imports. That year the European Commission (EC) established production limits to reduce the steel glut. It also decided to regulate the amount of state aid steel producers could receive. By the end of 1980, BSC's workforce had been reduced to about 130,000 people -- half its size when the companies were nationalized in 1967. During the 1980s BSC disposed of about $1 billion in noncore assets to focus on efficient steelmaking. State aid to European steel producers was largely prohibited in 1985 and the EC's quota system ended in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   The British Steel Act of 1988 privatized BSC, and British Steel was born. The company recorded big profits in 1990, but then a recession hit, and British Steel suffered two years of losses before returning to profitability in 1994. The next year the company announced plans to expand its operations in emerging markets such as Asia, Central Europe, and Latin America. In 1996 British Steel sold about 6,000 tons of rails to Latin America. The next year it built a steel plant in Alabama -- its first outside the UK -- and sold its British Steel Forgings unit, which made components for the aerospace and automobile industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 British Steel joined other steelmakers in asking the EC to investigate Asian steel dumping. Stiff competition and a strong domestic currency caused the company to suffer a loss for fiscal 1999. That year British Steel paid $2.4 billion for Dutch steelmaker Koninklijke Hoogovens. At the same time, British Steel became Corus, a name chosen because it has no significant meaning in any language. Amid losses, joint chief executives John Bryant and Fokko van Duyne were forced out in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company announced that it was cutting more than 6,000 jobs in an effort to return to profitability. In 2002 Corus agreed to sell its stainless steel operations to Outokumpu Oyj (Finnish metal producer) for approximately $525 million. That same year, Corus came close to buying Brazil's largest steelmaker, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN), but its debt of about $2.6 billion and the weakening Brazilian currency put a stop to the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 president Anthony Pedder resigned after a tumultuous financial year and a court decision that prevented the sale of its aluminum business to French aluminum maker Pechiney. The next year Corus sold Tuscaloosa Steelworks.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2006, the company sold its downstream aluminum business to
   <company id="13732">
    Aleris International
   </company>
   for almost $1 billion. French aluminum producer
   <company id="42955">
    Pechiney
   </company>
   (since merged into what is now
   <company id="42408">
    Rio Tinto Alcan
   </company>
   ) had tried to buy the unit in 2003, but the supervisory board of Corus Nederland rejected the sale and its decision was upheld by an Amsterdam court.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010,
   <company id="138408">
    Tata Steel
   </company>
   renamed Corus Group and its subsidiaries to reflect the parent company's brand. The new name, Tata Steel Europe, was designed to align the division with its India-based parent company.
