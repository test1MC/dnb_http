   The first footprints on the moon didn't come from Neil Armstrong, but from Hexcel, a maker of composite materials. Back then Hexcel made the footpads on the Apollo 11 lunar module; today the company makes advanced structural materials used in everything from aircraft components to wind turbine blades. Its composite materials include structural adhesives and honeycomb panels used in products like satellites, auto parts, golf clubs, and even window blinds. Commercial aerospace companies account for nearly 60% of Hexcel's sales; governmental space and defense sales and industrial sales account for the rest. Markets for Hexcel industrial products include wind energy, recreational equipment, and transportation.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Hexcel operates domestic manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington. International locations reside in Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. It also holds an interest in a manufacturing joint venture in Malaysia that makes composite structures for the company's Commercial Aerospace segment, and a joint venture in the UK which specializes in lightweight multi-axial fabrics.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US represents more than 50% of its total sales, while France and Spain account for 17% and 12%, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's advanced composites are divided into two main segments: Composite Materials (78% of total sales) and Engineered Products (22%). Composite Materials include carbon fiber, resins, specialty reinforcements, prepegs (resins impregnated with fibers) and other fiber-reinforced materials, and honeycomb core products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered Products include lightweight high-strength composite structures, molded components, and specialty machined honeycomb products. The end markets for Hexcel's products make up its three main sales segments: Commercial Aerospace (60% of total sales), Space and Defense (23%), and Industrial (17%).

  <p>
   Hexcel gets 31% of its total sales from contracts from Boeing and related contractors (29% for its Commercial Aerospace segment and 5% for its Space and Defense segment).
   <company id="101208">
    Airbus
   </company>
   , including its subcontractors, account for 35% of the company's total sales (31% for its Commercial Aerospace market applications and 4% for Space &amp; Defense market applications). The Space and Defense segment has worked on a number of military projects, including Blackhawk helicopters, the F/A-18 Hornet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the Airbus A400M military transport.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company serves international markets through manufacturing facilities, sales offices and representatives. Its sales personnel, sell and market its products directly to customers worldwide. It also uses independent distributors and manufacturer representatives for certain products, markets and regions.

  <p>
   Net sales of the company have seen an upward trend since 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 revenues increased by $5.7 million due to increased sales from composite materials segment partially offset by sales from engineered products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Composite materials segment revenues rose, driven by an increase in Commercial Aerospace sales as a result of new programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineered products segment sales decreased due by a decrease in Space &amp; Defense sales across all regions and reflected the C-17 program coming to an end combined with a decline in commercial rotorcraft sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income of the company has also seen an upward trend since 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased by 13% compared to 2014 due to the absence of other expense and decreased provision for income taxes partially offset by increased interest expense.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 2015 effective tax rate included a benefit related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions as well as other benefits recorded during the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interest expense increased due to a higher average interest rate on debt outstanding as a result of the company issuing, in August 2015, $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.7% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net cash provided by the operating activities decreased by $17 million due to a change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

  <p>
   Hexcel has cut down on spending, but it continues to add production capacity in key areas and to develop new products. Hexcel also focuses on growth markets where it believes it can achieve a competitive advantage over the long term.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's strategy has succeeded, with demand for Hexcel composites -- used to build both Airbus and
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   aircraft -- soaring. Production rates for the super jumbo A380 of Airbus and the ramp up of Boeing's new B787 and B747-8 jets have helped grow Hexcel's sales each year for the last four years. The company's involvement in major product development with both Boeing and Airbus have driven its sales increases. Hexcel has been a major parts supplier for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Series, as well as the Airbus A360 and A380 -- all aircraft that have a large amount of advanced composite parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hexcel continues to innovate and introduce new products, including Hex-SHIELDTM, an advanced technology product providing high temperature resistance in aircraft engine applications. It also continues to make advancements in its Acousti-Cap noise-attenuating honeycomb that allows multi-degree of freedom liners to be precisely tuned to engine operating conditions to achieve even greater noise dampening capability.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's ongoing priority is to optimize the system to ensure it derives the full benefits of its first company-wide ERP platform.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Hexcel announced that it will expand its global engineered core capacity by building a 117,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Casablanca, Morocco. The new facility is part of Hexcel's ongoing worldwide investment to create a diversified and robust global supply chain to support aerospace customers' growing demand for engineered core.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company broke ground on a site for a new carbon fiber plant in Roussillon, France and announced capacity expansions at nearby weaving and prepreg facilities.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016, Hexcel Corporation acquired Formax UK Limited (a leading manufacturer of composite reinforcements, specializing in the production of lightweight carbon fiber multi-axials and highly engineered glass fiber and aramid fiber fabrics) for $12 million. Hexcel had acquired a 50% interest in the privately-owned company in December 2014. The purchase of the remaining interest in Formax allows Hexcel to further advance dry reinforcements technology for future aerospace applications and provide scale for growing industrial markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Hexcel was founded in 1946 and incorporated in California in 1948. The company's businesses formerly included polymer technology for medical devices, chemicals, electromagnetic materials, and a European resins unit. These were all sold as part of Hexcel's restructuring following Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Hexcel purchased the composite divisions of specialty chemicals maker
   <company id="10721">
    Hercules
   </company>
   and Swiss drugmaker
   <company id="41771">
    Ciba-Geigy
   </company>
   ; it then combined the operations with similar businesses of Arizona's Fiberite in 1997, thus positioning itself for leadership in the manufacture of preimpregnated reinforcing materials and honeycomb products used to make aircraft wings, flaps, and elevators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Hexcel bought Clark-Schwebel's glass fiber business to broaden its printed circuit board offerings to the electronics and telecommunications industries and reduce its reliance on the aerospace industry. To establish a presence in Asia, the company formed China-based BHA Aero Composite Parts, a joint venture with
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   and Aviation Industries of China, and Asian Composite Manufacturing, a Malaysian joint venture with Boeing, Sime Darby Berhad, and Malaysia Helicopter Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US Department of Justice began an antitrust investigation of Hexcel in 1999 as the market leader in the production and sale of carbon fiber and preimpregnated materials (ongoing in 2002). Hexcel sold its aircraft interiors unit to
   <company id="57728">
    Britax International
   </company>
   for $117 million in 2000. The same year
   <company id="53105">
    Ciba Specialty Chemicals
   </company>
   sold the bulk of its 49% stake in Hexcel to a
   <company id="40176">
    Goldman Sachs
   </company>
   investor group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another effort to decrease its reliance on the aerospace market, in 2001 the company announced production of an energy-absorbing honeycomb made of spun-bond nylon and polyester for the automotive market. Responding to the downturn in the aerospace market after September 11, Hexcel began a restructuring plan that cut fixed overhead costs, capital spending, and about 25% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 investment group OSS Capital initiated a proxy fight to place three new, independent directors on Hexcel's Board. OSS said that it believed Hexcel's management hadn't done enough to improve its margins and lagged behind competitors like Cytec and
   <company id="52509">
    Toray Industries
   </company>
   . In the end, the company-backed slate of directors won out.
