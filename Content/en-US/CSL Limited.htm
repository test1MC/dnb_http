   CSL Limited proposes that human plasma holds the potential to save lives. The biopharmaceutical holding company operates through two main subsidiaries:
   <company id="48079">
    CSL Behring
   </company>
   develops plasma-derived and recombinant products used to treat infections, bleeding disorders, and autoimmune diseases, while bioCSL manufactures influenza vaccines that are marketed and sold globally. CSL Biotherapies' Immunohaematology unit manufactures in-vitro diagnostic products to test blood for transfusion and to detect snake venoms in Australia and Papua New Guinea. CSL also has an intellectual property (IP) arm that licenses intellectual property it isn't using to third-parties.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The plasma products are developed, made, and marketed by CSL Behring (human plasma is culled from a network of collection centers in the US and Germany through CSL Behring's subsidiary
   <company id="117721">
    CSL Plasma
   </company>
   ). CSL Behring is the company's largest segment, with immunoglobulins (used to treat infections and autoimmune diseases) showing the most growth across that subsidiary's product portfolio. Privigen, an intravenous immunoglobulin for patients with primary immune deficiency, is one of its leading products. Other approved products include therapies for haemophilia and coagulation disorders, hereditary angioderma, and inherited respiratory disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   bioCSL runs one of the world's largest manufacturing facilities for producing seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. It also sells diagnostic reagents and in-licensed vaccines in the Asia Pacific region.

  <p>
   Although the group's research and development, manufacturing, sales, and distribution operations are spread throughout the world, it operates predominantly in four geographic areas, namely Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and its largest market, the US.

  <p>
   In 2013 CSL's revenue grew 8% as global demand for the company's products increased. Net income jumped 20% due to increased revenue. The increase appeared even bigger against poor currency exchange results from the prior year. Cash flow also improved, by 9%.

  <p>
   CSL has established and continues to maintain strong research and development operations. It has long-standing partnerships with other companies and academic institutions in Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America. It is also capable of manufacturing complex R&amp;D biopharmaceuticals and overseeing the safety profiles of its products. CSL's strategy is to build an R&amp;D portfolio of candidates particularly in the areas of immunology, hemophilia, specialty plasma products, and protein-based breakthrough medicines.
