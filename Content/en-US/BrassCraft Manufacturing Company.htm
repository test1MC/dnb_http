   BrassCraft has retooled its marketing and product development divisions in order to focus on developing new product lines. The company is looking to grow its core water and gas products. Key initiatives include streamlining package design and developing environmentally friendly concepts. One such product is a line of tankless water heater installation kits.

On the product side, that year BrassCraft launched a new line of coated stainless steel water heater connectors designed to provide superior corrosion resistance to deterioration from harsh chemicals.
