   MICR technology is most commonly used for financial transaction documents. The unique font (used for the numbers at the bottom of checks) and magnetized ink used in MICR systems allows characters to be easily scanned. Another security feature from TROY is its security toner product, which includes a dye that that creates a red stain if solvent is used to try to alter the printed image.

   The company's TROY Healthcare Solution division offers software and secure printers that prevent prescription fraud and help providers comply with patient data security regulations.

   In 2016, the company introduced the TROY x451 SecureUV Printer, which provides a covert layer of personalized security to documents when printed.
