   Clarient can help provide clarity for cancer patients and their physicians. The firm is a specialized diagnostic services provider, offering a collection of advanced tests that detect and monitor the progression of various types of cancer. In addition to testing materials, Clarient provides pathology lab services and delivers the test results via its PATHSiTE Web portal. The company's principal customers include pathologists, oncologists, hospitals and biopharmaceutical companies that outsource all or most of their specialized testing functions. Founded in 1993, Clarient was acquired by

  <p>
   GE Healthcare acquired publicly traded Clarient in a 2010 deal worth valued at $580 million. The cancer diagnostics company's technologies, combined with GE Healthcare's strengths in diagnostic imaging, are expected to accelerate the development of new integrated tools for the diagnosis and characterization of cancer.

  <p>
   Clarient's diagnostic tests focus on conditions including breast, colon, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The company's laboratory services include immunohistochemistry (abnormal cell detection), flow cytometry (multiple cell measuring and analysis), and genetic testing. The company also provides diagnostic and research services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, helping them to develop new cancer treatments and diagnostic tools. Its services aim to not only find malignancies, but also to provide information doctors use to prescribe the most effective treatments.

  <p>
   While GE doesn't breakout Clarient's sales, in 2009 (the year before it was acquired) Clarient has sales of $93 million.

  <p>
   The rise of individualized medicine as the new direction in oncology has created demand for Clarient's diagnostic products and services, such as flow cytometry and molecular testing. The firm is expanding its market by developing new, proprietary "companion" diagnostic markers for therapeutics in breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancers, as well as leukemia and lymphoma. Also, the rapid increase in the incidence of cancer worldwide, together with advances in specific cancer-focused therapies, is driving significant demand for the company's molecular diagnostic products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The global demand for cancer-profiling products and services is predicted to grow from $15 billion in 2009 to an estimated $47 billion by 2015. Between 2005 and 2010, Clarient's revenues grew at a 68% compounded annual growth rate.
