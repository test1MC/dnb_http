   Revenue increased by 2% to ¥289.7 billion in 2014 as sales of domestic prescription drugs rose -- particularly of its eight strategic products, which include Crestor, Irbetan, and Cymbalta. Sales from exports and overseas units also saw growth that year; the launch of Osphena (for the treatment of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy) in the US also contributed to the increase.

  <p>
   Net income declined 37% to ¥41.8 billion on higher litigation expenses and loss on disposal of fixed assets, as well as a loss on devaluation of inventories. Cash flow from operations increased 34% to ¥79.5 billion due to changes in notes and accounts receivable.

   Shionogi is focused on infectious diseases, pain, and neurology as its core therapeutic areas. It intends to create a strong pipeline that will produce a steady stream of new drugs in these areas. With the aging population, other areas of focus include obesity, geriatric metabolic diseases, cancer, and immunological diseases. Finally, the company plans to boost its applied research using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), molecular imaging, and biomarkers.

  <p>
   As the company looks to expand geographically, it launched operations in Italy in 2015. The previous year, it opened a new ASEAN headquarters in Singapore.

  <p>
   To further increase sales and prepare for the eventual patent losses on its core drug offerings, Shionogi is also focused on expanding its product lines through internal and collaborative R&amp;D efforts. The company is moving forward with phase 3 trials for S-297995 (its first ever global study conducted independently). And in 2013, it signed a deal with Mundipharma to co-develop abuse deterrents of opioid analgesics. The company is also developing treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with
