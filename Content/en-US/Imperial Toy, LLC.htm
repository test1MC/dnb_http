   Even the imperials need their fun. Imperial Toy, founded in 1969, is a leading toy manufacturer whose products include bubbles, bubble toys, girls' role-play toys, steel trucks, and assorted novelty items. Fred Kort, the company's founder and a holocaust survivor, came to the US after WWII and created Imperial Toy to bring fun to kids everywhere and to recreate the lost years of his own tumultuous childhood. Imperial Toys' about 900 products are sold through a global network of distributors, including well-known retailers such as
