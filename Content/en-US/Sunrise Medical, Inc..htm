        <p>
   Sunrise Medical conducts research and development efforts to expand its product offerings. In 2012 it launched a new, lightweight folding wheelchair, the Quickie QXi, as well as several new rigid chair, powered chair, and cushioning products. The company hopes to continue to grow with its new financial backing from Equistone.
  </p>
        <p>
   Between 2005 and 2010, former owner Vestar Capital split off a number of former Sunrise Medical units to focus the company's operations on core mobility offerings. Previously, Sunrise Medical expanded through regular acquisitions.

   Richard Chandler, formerly with a home health care firm, founded Sunrise Medical in 1983 to acquire small medical suppliers. Chandler started off with a bang, acquiring A-BEC Mobility, BEC Mobility, Guardian products, Joerns Healthcare, and Trans-Aid. He took the company public the same year to take advantage of a change in government health care reimbursement policies that increased at-home and nursing home care.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the 1980s home care products boomed in the absence of insurance and Medicare constraints. Sunrise's rapid expansion (almost 50 acquisitions) left the company bloated and decentralized. By the early 1990s the rise of managed care and industry consolidation drove prices down; Sunrise began to streamline operations.
  </p>
        <p>
   Heads rolled in 1996 following the revelation that Sunrise overstated its 1995 net income by $11.2 million. (Employees of its Bio Clinic subsidiary allegedly tried to mask poor performance.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1997 increased competition hurt sales, and the passing of the Balanced Budget Act cut Medicare funding; Sunrise reacted by restructuring its operations based on distribution segments. The next year the company bought Sentient Systems (now Dynavox), a maker of speech devices for the disabled. Sunrise announced losses and layoffs that year due to weak sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 the company tried to stem lost sales by introducing new products; it also launched online sales operations. Chandler left the company that year; Sunrise director Murray Hutchison stepped in as interim chairman and CEO. Sunrise continued to emphasize research and development during 2000, introducing more than 30 new products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The same year Michael Hammes took the helm as chairman and CEO. Under Hammes, Sunrise Medical went private in a takeover involving Vestar Capital, Park Avenue Equity, and company management.
  </p>
        <p>
   In an expansion wave of 2004, Sunrise acquired Adaptive Equipment Systems (AES), RehabiliTech, and Whitmyer Biomechanix, three wheelchair manufacturers addressing three needs niches. The trio formed a separate division of Sunrise called Artistry in Rehab Technology Group, or A.R.T.
  </p>
        <p>
   Vestar made some sweeping changes to the company over the next few years, stripping of most of its business units by 2008 to focus Sunrise Medical almost exclusively on mobility and seating aids. Vestar split off former business units

   ,
   <company id="106889">
    DynaVox

   (speech-output machines), and DeVilbiss Healthcare; all three of the companies remained Vestar investments, but were no longer part of Sunrise Medical anymore. (Vestar divested Joerns and DynaVox in 2010.) Sunrise Medical sold its Guardian living aids product line in 2008 to

    Medline Industries
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2009 Thomas Rossnagel became CEO of Sunrise Medical, replacing Michael Cannizzaro, who stayed on as chairman. Rossnagel has been with the company for more than 10 years and was promoted from the post of managing director for Sunrise Europe.
