   With roots reaching back to the 1960's, Cybex has built a name for itself supplying the commercial fitness industry with its products. Indeed, its Cybex Research Institute in 2014 partnered with Atlantic Health System, one of New Jersey's largest non-profit health care organizations, as an official research and education partner. The pair is collaborating on outcome-driven research and educational programs.

   The company has been pumping out new products. In 2014 it launched CybexGO, a platform that provides users with personalized entertainment, such as on-demand options the likes of TV shows, movie trailers, music videos, sports, and video game trailers. It has also rolled out new treadmills that list from nearly $5,000 to $8,000. Cybex has also introduced a multigym station, which makes use of limited spaces, and it began selling Big Iron free weights, which are geared to professional and college-level athletes. Cybex's product launches are a result of its research and development efforts. The company dedicates a portion of its revenue to R&amp;D to improve existing products and to look for innovative and competitive products to develop. To this end, Cybex in 2014 inked a deal to buy Columbus Holding GmbH, which specializes in making and marketing juvenile products under the Cybex and CBX brands, in a deal valued at about $89.7 million.
