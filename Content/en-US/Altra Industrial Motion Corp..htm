  <p>
   Altra reached a historic revenue milestone of $732 million in 2012 followed by marginal decline of 1% to $722 million in 2013. The slight revenue decline for 2013 was due to lower sales levels across all operating segments fueled by weak demand in all geographies as well as a decline in the mining, energy, and metals industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing a steep drop in profits during 2012, Altra posted a 66% surge in profits to peak at a record-setting $40 million in 2013. The profit growth was primarily due to a decline in interest expenses due to its debt refinancing efforts in November 2012. In addition, Altra has experienced four straight years of steady growth from its operating cash flow.

  <p>
   Altra's long-term strategy is to increase its sales through organic growth, expand its geographic reach and product offerings through strategic acquisitions, and improve its profitability through cost reduction initiatives. In 2013 it acquired Svendborg Brakes and S.B. Patent Holding ApS (together Svendborg) for $110 million. Svendborg has a major presence in Denmark, in addition to a sales network in seven additional countries in Western Europe, China, South America, Australia, and the US. In 2012 Altra expanded its manufacturing presence in Asia beyond its current plant in Shenzhen, China, with the addition of its new manufacturing facility in Changzhou, China.
