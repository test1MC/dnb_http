   . TOTAL is one of the world's largest integrated international oil and gas companies and operates in more than 130 countries. Total Petrochemicals manufactures base and petrochemicals from facilities in Texas and Louisiana and also operates a refinery in Texas. It produces olefins (ethylene and propylene), polyolefins (polypropylene and polyethylene), aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene), and transportation fuels.

  <p>
   The Port Arthur refinery produces transportation fuels, propylene, benzene, toluene, xylene, and other products; the Carville, Louisiana plant -- polystyrene and styrene; the La Porte, Texas plant -- polypropylene; and the Bayport, Texas facility -- polyethylene. It also has a research and development facility in La Porte, Texas.

   's strategy is to tightly integrate its subsidiaries with the parent company's operations in order to improve cost and operating efficiencies, and Total Petrochemicals operates directly in coordination with TOTAL's US plants. (TOTAL has operating subsidiaries with more than 70 sites in 24 US states).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Total Petrochemicals launched two new polystyrene grades that contain recycled polystyrene: Total rePS-5 (a high heat crystal product containing 25% recycled polystyrene) for use in making foam meat trays, clamshell containers, injection molded cups, and dinnerware including cutlery; and Total rePS-8 (containing 20% recycled polystyrene) for producing thermoformed containers, cups, and lids.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citing poor market conditions and an aging facility, in 2011 the company shut down a 200 million pound per year polystyrene unit at its Carville, Louisiana styrenics facility which had been idled since 2010. Total Petrochemicals is focusing on improving the efficiency and output of its other North American units (which collectively produce about 1.5 billion pounds per year).

   With the start up of a 50,000 barrels-per-day coker unit, that year the company completed the conversion of its plant in Port Arthur to a deep conversion refinery. This unit, along with a desulfurization unit, a vacuum distillation unit, and other related assets, increased the facility's capacity to process heavy and sour crude oil and produce cleaner transportation fuels (including ultra low sulfur diesel). The conversion allows the refinery to process Canadian oil sands' crude and Venezuelan heavy oil.

  <p>
   Total Petrochemical's Research and Technology Center was consolidated at the La Porte, Texas, site (near Houston) in 1988 in order to combine the expertise of three locations, create an environment of technical innovation, and maximize synergies between various business lines. The R&amp;T Center follows new products through conception, development and testing of polymers, catalysts, and production processes.
