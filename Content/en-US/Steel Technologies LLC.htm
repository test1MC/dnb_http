   If you need sheets for a bed, try a white sale; if you need sheets to make a car, try Steel Technologies. Founded in 1971 Steel Technologies' lineup includes close-tolerance cold- and hot-rolled strip and sheet, high-carbon, hot-rolled pickle strip and sheet, and alloy strip and sheet metal. The company purchases steel coils from steel mills and produces flat-rolled steel used by the agricultural, appliance, automotive, HVAC, lawn and garden, machinery, and office equipment industries. Automotive customers represent about half of Steel Technologies' sales. In 2010 the company's ownership changed to a 50/50 joint venture between

   and former parent Mitsui &amp; Co. (U.S.A.), a subsidiary of Japan's

   The company and its various joint ventures operate some two dozen facilities in Canada, Mexico, and the US, with an annual capacity in excess of 3.5 million tons of processed steel.

   Steel Technologies is a formidable competitor within its industry. It processes steel, utilizing such methods as annealing, cut-to-length, pickling and leveling, and slitting.

   Merwin Ray worked his way up from salesman to EVP during 15 years at Worthington Steel. He left in 1971 to form Southern Strip Steel, which had a processing facility in Eminence, Kentucky. IBM was among its early customers, using the steel to make typewriters. A tough market tempered the company in the 1970s and early 1980s. Southern Strip changed its name to Steel Technologies and went public in 1985. Two years later the firm formed Mi-Tech Steel, a joint venture with Mitsui Steel Development, to own and operate US processing plants for auto and appliance parts makers. Between 1989 and 1992 Steel Technologies opened three plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand by buying an 80% interest (later raised to 90%) in Mexico-based Transformadora y Comercializadora de Metales (steel processing) in 1994. The next year it opened a plant in Ghent, Kentucky -- its first with pickling (steel cleaning) capability. In 1996 Steel Technologies began making steel blanks for car and appliance makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Steel Technologies increased its presence in the fast-growing Southeastern steel market with its 1997 acquisition of Atlantic Coil Processing. The next year it bought Roberts Steel, an Ohio-based flat-steel processor. Fueling its expansion in the midwestern and eastern US, Steel Technologies bought privately held Custom Steel and its two steel-processing plants in Missouri and Kentucky in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company idled its Mi-Tech Steel plant in Decatur, Alabama, as business slumped in the Decatur area. Later that year Steel Technologies took a 49% stake in Michigan-based steel processor Ferrolux Metals.
  </p>
  <p>
   By improving sales volumes and productivity throughout its units, Steel Technologies' increased its net sales in 2002. The following year, Steel Technologies acquired some of Cold Metal Products' land, building, and steel processing equipment from its Ottawa, Ohio and Indianapolis, Indiana facilities for about $10 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company acquired
   <company id="46458">
    Kasle Steel Corp.
   </company>
   and almost half of Ferrolux Metals. The latter investment enabled Steel Technologies to specialize in exposed automotive products. Kasle's steel-processing services increased the Kentucky company's capacity in blanking, slitting, and pickling, primarily for the automotive industry.
