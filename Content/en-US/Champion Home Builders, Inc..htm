   Champion Home Builders works to win in the manufactured home-building business. The modular homebuilder, which has produced more than 1.7 million factory-built homes in North America, offers single-family ranch-style homes, as well as townhouses, duplexes, and steel-framed modular buildings for commercial use. Champion's homes and buildings are sold in Canada under the Moduline and SRI Homes names. Its Caledonian Building Systems arm sells pre-engineered buildings in the UK. Champion operates more than 30 plants in North America and Europe. Champion's homes are sold in the US through a network of independent and company-owned retailers. Champion Home Builders was founded in 1953.

  <p>
   Champion Home Builders exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2010 with help from a group of investors (Centerbridge Partners, MAK Capital, and Sankaty Advisors) that injected some $50 million in capital into the company. The modular homebuilder filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2009 as its slumping revenues (due to a sour  economy and weak housing market) left it unable to keep up with debt payments.

   From its headquarters in Michigan, Champion serves customers throughout the US, Western Canada, and the UK. The company maintains 30-plus manufacturing plants in North America and Europe.

   The company's Champion Commercial Structures (CCS) unit specializes in multifamily, commercial, and industrial modular construction serving developers, builders, and large-value institutional clients. CCS does business in the UK as Caledonian Building Systems, and in Canada as Gibraltar Industries.

   Champion is banking on the growing acceptance of modular construction by the hotel and apartment industries in North America and the UK to spur growth. Indeed, CSS in April 2013 began construction of an 83-room hotel for Jay Peak Resort, in northern Vermont. The Jay Peak project was the seventh hotel project undertaken by CSS in the prior 12 months, including projects in Louisiana, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania.

   Following its stint in bankruptcy, Champion resumed expanding in 2012, when it bought Texas-based Athens Park Homes. Athens specializes in manufacturing HUD-code and park model homes. In November 2013, the company opened a second plant in Florida to meet growing housing demand in the Sunshine State, and nearby Georgia, and South Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   The manufacturer also remains focused on delivering new products to market as a way to attract new customer sets. The company's Genesis Homes brand introduced the GO House -- a modular home built with environmentally-friendly features.

  <p>
   Champion Home Builders started in 1953, just in time to take advantage of the burgeoning postwar American economy and the passage of a 1956 law allowing mobile homes to be up to 10 feet wide. The enlargement made mobile homes increasingly popular -- by 1960 a majority were "10-wides." The change shifted the main benefit of mobile homes from mobility to affordability. Champion prospered, and it went public in 1962. By the mid-1960s it was one of the leaders in its market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Part of Champion's success could be attributed to its vertically integrated manufacturing process. Champion made and installed all the components in a home, from plumbing to drapes. This policy increased efficiency, and productivity was twice that of most of its rivals. Despite these advantages, the mid-1970s recession hit the company hard. Industry sales fell about a third from their 1972 peak. Champion felt the recession's brunt in its mobile-home sales, but sales of recreational vehicles (RVs) and low-priced motor homes helped temper the losses. The increase of prices for site-built housing helped Champion and other mobile-home makers out of the slump.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the start of the 1980s, Champion recovered briefly, but by the mid-1980s the company was again struggling. By 1990 the firm had lost $30 million over the previous five years and was considering bankruptcy proceedings. Walter Young took over that year and quickly revamped the company. To stave off bankruptcy, Young sold some businesses (RV making and component manufacturing) for much-needed cash. Young also gutted the central office and eliminated 248 of 260 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Champion settled on a growth strategy involving both internal sales and acquisitions. The company soon acted on its plan by purchasing Dutch Housing in 1994 and Chandeleur Homes and Crest Ridge Homes a year later. The company opened a plant to make midsize buses in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company seemed to experience its greatest growth in 1996. Champion acquired
   <company id="16554">
    Redman Industries
   </company>
   , the #3 US manufactured-housing builder at the time (Champion was #2). The acquisition pushed Champion to the top spot in terms of sales that year. In addition, Champion opened five new plants that combined with the Redman purchase increased the number of plants Champion operated from 23 to 50. Champion also became vertically integrated from manufacturing to delivery by acquiring a company to provide in-house freight-haul services of its home components to retail and home-building sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Champion sold its midsize-bus business to narrow its focus on housing. That year the company bought manufactured-housing seller The ICA Group, operator of 23 retail outlets. In 1999 Champion bought Care Free Homes (Utah), Central Mississippi Manufactured Housing, Homes of Merit (Florida), and Heartland Homes (Texas). That year the company created Champion Development Corporation and acquired Phoenix Land Development for developing manufactured-housing communities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although sales increased, Champion's profits nearly halved in 1999 because of bad inventory control, excess retail sites, and tighter consumer financing requirements. In response, the company closed or consolidated eight manufacturing plants and streamlined and upgraded inventory-control processes. Slowing demand and increased competition forced the company to close more than 60 retail outlets and seven of its factories in 2000. The company idled two additional factories and 30 more retail centers in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Champion closed 12 manufacturing facilities and 126 of its retail sales centers, with a reduction of jobs estimated at 1,500, or 15% of its total workforce. Champion acquired the manufactured housing consumer loan origination business of CIT Group/Sales Financing, Inc., to operate as HomePride Finance Corp.; it also formed a joint venture, in which it held a 49% stake, with loan originator
   <company id="111494">
    National City Mortgage Co.
   </company>
   to provide real estate financing under the name HomePride Mortgage, LP.
  </p>
  <p>
   Champion closed five manufacturing plants (in Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Texas) in 2003 and moved production at a facility in Alabama to an idle plant. The company cut its workforce by 13% (about 1,000 jobs) and shuttered 35 retail centers. Champion also discontinued its loan origination operations in 2003 in an effort to return to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year Champion sold its western retail region, which included eight retail sales operations in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Washington, to Blaser Holding, Inc., for about $4 million. Champion also sold three retail sales centers in Kentucky and one in Texas in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Champion completed the sale of its traditional retail locations in 2005. The same year, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Champion received a $60 million order from the
   <company id="150322">
    Federal Emergency Management Agency
   </company>
   (FEMA) to build some 2,000 homes for displaced storm victims. Late in the year Champion acquired New Era Building Systems and its Castle Housing of Pennsylvania and Carolina Building Solutions affiliates. The companies manufacture modular housing in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
   Champion Enterprises diversified itself (but also added to its debt load) by making a string of international acquisitions in 2006 and 2007. The company expanded into the Canadian market with the purchase of SRI Homes, which operates manufacturing facilities and sells homes in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Champion also made its overseas debut with the acquisition of Caledonian Building Systems, which operates four manufacturing plants in the UK, and competes in the custom modular industry. Its steel-framed modular buildings are used in prisons, military buildings, and multi-story hotels and residences.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisitions were a double-edged sword. Although they heaped debt onto Champion, they also provided valuable diversity and entry into new markets. By diversifying its product line and geographic reach Champion was able to cope with the major housing slowdown in the US. While Champion saw a leveling off in some of its markets (especially in the US where it was forced to shut plants), sales in Canada remained strong. The credit crisis in the UK meant project delays and a lack of project financing for the business, but demand for its product remained high.
  </p>
  <p>
   Champion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 and exited as a private company in 2010.
