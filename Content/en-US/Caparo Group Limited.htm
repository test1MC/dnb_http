   Caparo Group is so diverse it could supply the steel needed to construct a hotel and then run the hotel, too. The holding company has operations in specialty steels, materials engineering, mill products, services and distribution, leisure, and innovation and investment. Its steel products include precision tubes, spiral weld tubes, structural steels, cold rolled steel strip, and spring steel strip. Its materials engineering division was formed by merging its engineering and vehicle products units. The group also has two regional divisions, North America and India. The group is controlled by the founding Paul family, including Lord (Swraj) Paul of Marylebone.

  <p>
   Until 2007, the company experienced strong growth with its operations in India and the US. However, like other steel companies, it was hit hard by the recession in 2008 and 2009. After suffering considerable losses for both years, the company restructured. Its US and Indian businesses became standalone operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Caparo was established in 1968.
