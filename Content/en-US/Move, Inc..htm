   For Move, real estate is more about location on the Web. The company provides real estate and move-related information and services through its flagship Move.com, REALTOR.com, and Moving.com websites. Its REALTOR.com lists some 4 million homes for sale. In addition, its Top Producer produce is a customer relationship management application for real estate agents. Revenue primarily comes from advertising (cost-per-click, text link, and display ads) and software sales. The company attracts visitors via agreements with partners such as the

   The company provides services for both real estate professionals and providers of moving services, as well as consumers. Its online advertising products and lead generation tools target professional moving, truck rental, and self-storage businesses on its Moving.com site. However, the bulk of the company's sales come from its real estate offerings, which include REALTOR.com, Top Producer, and the new homes and rentals listings information on Move.com.
