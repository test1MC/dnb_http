   Whether at work or play, TriMas fits the niche. The company makes a diverse mix of products through several segments. Its Energy division makes seals, bolts, and gaskets used primarily in the oil and gas industry. TriMas' Packaging segment makes closures and dispensing systems for industrial and consumer packaging for customers in North America and Europe. Aerospace produces aerospace fasteners and military munitions components including shell casings. Engineered Components manufactures compressed gas pressure cylinders and precision tools. It operates through 50 manufacturing plants in 13 countries.

   TriMas makes 85% of its total sales from the US. However, it takes advantage of the lower-costs of production in other countries. It has about 50 manufacturing plants in 13 countries.

  <p>
   TriMas' balance sheet took a hit in 2015 as it spun off its Cequent division. Revenues fell by 42% from $1.5 billion in 2014 to $864 million in 2015. The revenue decease was due to the Cequent spin-off coupled with a decrease in engineered components revenue. This was fueled by lower demand for its speed and compressor engine products attributed to lower oil and gas drilling completions in the US and Canada in response to lower oil prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a net loss of $33 million in 2015, its first unprofitable year in about five years. The loss was was driven by mounting impairment of goodwill charges and losses from its discontinued operations.

  <p>
   The company has been streamlining its operating structure recently to achieve future growth. In 2015 TriMas spun off its former Cequent division, which made trailer hitches, towing systems, and accessories for cars and RVs as well as agricultural, military, and industrial vehicles. Cequent became a newly formed company named Horizon Global Corporation. TriMas made the deal in order to focus solely on its remaining four segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   TriMas in 2014 also closed and consolidated several facilities within its Energy segment. This included the closure of its Hangzhou, China; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Houston manufacturing facilities.
