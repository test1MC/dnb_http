   Mitel Networks believes a company's legacy shouldn't include outdated communications technology. Mitel specializes in network systems used by small and medium-sized businesses primarily in the US to migrate from legacy voice phone systems to Internet-protocol (IP) equipment that handles both voice and data. Mitel also offers software for contact centers, remote access, and messaging. It sells directly and through telecom services providers, distributors, and system integrators. In 2016 Mitel agreed to by
   <company id="51591">
    Polycom
   </company>
   for $1.8 billion. The deal combines Mitel's network capabilities with Polycom's tele- and video conferencing products. Both companies had revenue of about $1 billion in 2015.

   Mitel Networks was formed in 2001 when Mitel Corporation sold its communications equipment division -- and the Mitel name -- to company co-founder Terry Matthews. (The remaining semiconductor business of Mitel Corporation continues to operate as a separate company called
   <company id="53112">
    Zarlink Semiconductor
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   Mitel acquired fellow IP networking specialist
   <company id="17003">
    Inter-Tel
   </company>
   for $723 million in 2007. The purchase almost doubled Mitel's revenues while strengthening its position with Inter-Tel's primary customer base, small and medium-sized businesses.
