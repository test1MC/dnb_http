   Delphi has taken the long and winding road alone, after being spun off from
   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   in 1999. Delphi makes just about everything mechanical and electrical/electronic that goes into a car or commercial vehicle. Business divisions include Electrical/Electronic Architecture (vehicle electrical systems), Powertrain Systems (engine, fuel, emissions systems), Electronics and Safety (operation controls and infotainment), and Thermal Systems (climate control, radiators, heat exchangers). Delphi operates in 30 countries. Major customers include

  <p>
   Delphi Corporation traces its roots to the 1908 birth of
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   , originally formed as a consortium among Buick, Oldsmobile, and Cadillac. During WWI 90% of GM's trucks were targeted for the war effort. Chevrolet joined the group in 1918, and by 1920 GM had bought more than 30 companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   GM expanded its product line in 1936 to include radios by buying Delco Electronics (transferred to Delphi in 1997). GM spent WWII turning out defense materials, including some 1,300 airplanes and one-fourth of all US aircraft engines. In the 1950s GM introduced the V-8 engine, power steering and brakes, front-seat safety belts, and the first car air-conditioning system. GM, like other carmakers, made most of the parts for its cars.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the mid-1960s GM diversified into home appliances, insurance, locomotives, electronics, ball bearings, and financing. Delco began to produce AM/FM car stereos. In 1961 J. T. Battenberg (Delphi's future CEO) joined the carmaker as a GM Institute student.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1970s oil crisis contributed to a drop in sales for GM. Additionally, new pollution control standards forced the company to spend billions on compliance. In the early 1980s GM spent more than $60 billion on new model designs and plant updates. It bought Hughes Electronics (now
   <company id="42070">
    The DIRECTV Group, Inc
   </company>
   .) and placed Delco under the Hughes umbrella. GM failed to keep up with competing technological developments in the 1980s. Lagging behind, it began venturing out of its own backyard to buy cheaper car components.
  </p>
  <p>
   Devastating losses in the early 1990s forced GM to restructure. In 1991 it began organizing its parts operations into a separate business group. The next year Battenberg took control of the parts division and began streamlining and exiting noncore operations. During 1993 and 1994 the company shed some 40 parts operations. GM formed Automotive Components Group Worldwide in 1994. The next year GM changed the group's name to Delphi. As a step toward spinning Delphi off, GM began reporting the group's earnings separately in 1997. That year GM transferred its Delco operations to Delphi.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="56122">
    UAW
   </company>
   union members at a Delphi plant in Flint, Michigan, joined those from GM's metal stamping plant across town in a crippling strike in 1998 that lasted almost two months and reduced the company's income by about $726 million. Also that year Delphi recorded a $430 million loss related to the sale of its coil spring, lighting, and seating businesses. In 1999 GM offered 18% of Delphi in an IPO and spun off the rest of Delphi's stock to GM shareholders. Also, Delphi agreed to buy the auto parts operations of Daewoo Group (South Korea).
  </p>
  <p>
   Delphi bought Lucas Diesel Systems (the diesel engine unit of TRW) for $871 million in 2000 and renamed it Delphi Diesel Systems. In an effort to expand its non-automotive business by more than $700 million within three to five years, in 2000 Delphi teamed up with
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   to make in-vehicle communications systems and acquired an 18% stake in
   <company id="61119">
    InPlay Technologies
   </company>
   (formerly Duraswitch Industries).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Delphi bought
   <company id="10501">
    Eaton
   </company>
   's automotive switch and electronics unit for $300 million. The company also cut 5% of its workforce -- 11,500 jobs -- and closed or consolidated nine plants due to slowing vehicle production in Europe and North America. Later in 2001 Delphi acquired Automotive Technical Resources, Inc. (ATRi) for $15 million and integrated it into the Delphi Integrated Service Solutions business unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2002 Delphi shortened its name from Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. to Delphi Corporation in hopes of reflecting its efforts to expand outside the automotive industry. Later that year, amid pricing pressures and increasing operating costs, Delphi laid off an additional 6,100 workers at 25 locations in the US and Europe. After a $353 million third-quarter loss in 2003, Delphi cut 5,500 more jobs in the US. Delphi also cut 3,000 international jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2004 Delphi announced that it planned to invest $40.5 million to expand its manufacturing operations in China by building two new plants for its Delphi Electronics &amp; Safety Division in Suzhou. In late 2004 Delphi purchased Dynamit Automotive Ignition Systems GmbH (maker of initiators, propellants, micro-gas generators and other automotive parts) from mg technologies AG for around $18 million. Late in 2004, citing production cuts at GM and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   , as well as increased commodity prices, Delphi announced another 8,500 job cuts for 2005 and predicted a 2005 net loss of $350 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Steve Miller succeeded chairman and CEO J. T. Battenberg, who retired after 44 years in the industry. Delphi filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors later that year. In the immediate wake of its Chapter 11 filing, Delphi sought drastic concessions from UAW-represented workers. It wanted to cut wages from $27 an hour to as low as $9.50 an hour. The announcement triggered talk of a strike.
  </p>
  <p>
   To head such a possibility off at the pass, GM in 2006 brokered a deal with the UAW and Delphi that would reduce the hourly UAW-represented workers at Delphi and hourly workers at GM by offering early retirement buyouts. The program also allowed UAW workers to return to work at GM. UAW-represented Delphi employees would either retire from Delphi or return to GM, then retire. GM footed the bill for the scheme.
  </p>
  <p>
   Days after the buyout proposal, in a move that was not unexpected, Delphi asked the bankruptcy court to throw out its labor contracts. The move, raising again the possibility of a UAW strike, was viewed as a bargaining chip to force a deal with GM and the UAW. Delphi also asked the court to throw out some unfavorable supply contracts with GM and said it would sell or shutter 21 of its 29 US plants. Nearly 13,000 UAW employees of Delphi opted to take the buyout offer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2006, 6,300 workers represented by the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communications Workers of America agreed to the GM-proposed early-retirement buyout scheme, further reducing the chances of a Delphi strike. Possibility of a strike diminished further in mid-2007 when hourly UAW members agreed to plant closures and wage cuts. Top production wages were to drop from $27 per hour to $18.50. The plan would also close 10 US plants. Also in 2006 the company completed the sale of its car battery business to
   <company id="10825">
    Johnson Controls
   </company>
   for about $202 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing to clean up the consequences of its financial woes, Delphi reached settlement agreements with the lead plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits brought by participants in its employee retirement plans and purchasers of its debt and equity securities from 2000 to 2005. In 2006 the company reached a settlement with the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   regarding its 2005 restatement of financial results, which triggered the class-action lawsuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 a buyer for Delphi's interiors and closures business emerged when Ira Rennert's
   <company id="40389">
    Renco Group
   </company>
   began negotiating for the division, which made instrument panels, cockpits, door modules, and latches. Delphi signed a non-binding term sheet with Renco. The interiors and closures business generated about $1.3 billion in annual sales. With a selling price reported to be about $106 million, the deal closed in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing to sell off parts of the business, in 2007 Delphi sold its brake components business, including a factory in Mexico, to
   <company id="43932">
    Robert Bosch LLC
   </company>
   for about $15 million. Later the same year the bankruptcy court approved Delphi's sale of its original equipment and aftermarket catalyst business to
   <company id="90605">
    Umicore
   </company>
   for $75 million. The business posted 2006 sales of $162 million, with an operating loss of $2 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007 Delphi had agreed to sell its steering systems operations to private equity firm
   <company id="60168">
    Platinum Equity LLC
   </company>
   . Although the US Bankruptcy Court approved the deal, the transaction was unwound by Delphi in 2009, with the company agreeing to sell its steering business back to GM. The Obama administration's auto task force, however, did not approve of the terms for that proposed transaction, leaving the government, GM, and Delphi to negotiate further on refining the terms before presenting the deal to the bankruptcy court. In August 2009 the European Union approved GM's acquisition of Delphi's steering business, saying that it caused no antitrust problems in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delphi then agreed to sell most of its global operations to Platinum Equity and certain assets of the steering systems business to GM, which itself went through a brief Chapter 11 reorganization in mid-2009. The US Bankruptcy Court held up those transactions, however, ruling that Delphi must conduct a court-supervised auction for the assets in question, after hearing objections to the GM/Platinum deal from Delphi's debtor-in-possession lenders. The court's decision once again delayed Delphi's possible exit from bankruptcy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Delphi sold its wheel bearings business to Hephaestus Holdings, a unit of
   <company id="108940">
    KPS Capital Partners
   </company>
   that owns some small automotive suppliers. The same year Delphi also sold the assets and inventory of its ride control business to
   <company id="11455">
    Tenneco
   </company>
   for about $19 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2009 Delphi managed to sell most of its assets to a group of lenders led by
   <company id="110749">
    Elliott Management
   </company>
   and Silver Point Capital; the lenders forgave more than $3 billion in debt and agreed to invest an additional $900 million in the company. As part of the deal, GM agreed to provide additional loans to Delphi to finance the restructuring and offered to buy back four factories from Delphi, along with Delphi's global steering systems business. The debt-for-equity transaction paved the way for Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy as a private company in October 2009; it changed its name to Delphi Automotive LLP.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010
   <company id="53694">
    Autoliv
   </company>
   bought Delphi's seatbelt and airbag operations in China and South Korea, after buying its Occupant Protection Systems (OPS) activities in Europe and North America and a steering wheel manufacturing plant in Mexico, the year before. In mid-2010 it acquired Delphi's safety switch assets in Europe, serving Daimler, AUDI, and
   <company id="91295">
    Porsche
   </company>
   . BeijingWest Industries Co. Ltd. (an entity owned in part by the Chinese government, steel maker
   <company id="57085">
    Shougang
   </company>
   , and auto parts supplier Tempo Group) bought Delphi's global business in vehicle brakes and suspensions, including the MagneRide suspension system, in early 2009 for about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 UK-based Delphi Automotive PLC was created to acquire all outstanding units of Delphi Automotive LLP. Delphi Automotive PLC filed for an IPO in mid-2011. Earlier that same year Delphi Automotive LLP paid $3.8 billion to GM to acquire the remaining stake in Delphi; it also purchased the
   <company id="40361">
    Pension Benefit Guaranty
   </company>
   's stake for $594 million.
