   Whether man or man's best friend, 4Life Research wants to protect the health of bipeds and quadrupeds alike. The multilevel marketing company manufactures more than 60 different nutritional supplements for humans and animals and sells them through its global network of independent distributors. 4Life Research's flagship product is Transfer Factor, a supplement made from egg yolks and cow colostrum that is meant to enhance the body's immune system. The firm makes Transfer Factor formulations for humans, dogs, cats, horses, and livestock. The privately held company was founded in 1998 by CEO David Lisonbee, who had previous experience with multilevel marketing organizations.

   4Life offers more than 60 different products (general health and wellness lines, personal skincare, and weight management products) and multiple delivery choices.
  </p>
        <p>
   4Life's other (human) products include weight management supplements, nutritionals to support various systems of the body for general health, and body care products. Its products are based on a form of research invented by the company and coined "transferceutical science," or the idea that molecules contain information that can be transferred from one immune system to another, which, the company says, means that the body can borrow the immune education it needs to recognize, respond to, and remember unwanted threats.
