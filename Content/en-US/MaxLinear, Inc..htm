   MaxLinear has produced steady revenue growth over the years. Overall sales increased 11% to $133 million in 2014 due to higher sales for DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems and hybrid TV tuner applications. Still, with high cost of sales and operating expenses, the company has been in the red for the past four years. In 2014 it recorded a narrower net loss of about $7 million compared to a $12.7 million loss in 2013. Its cash flow decreased 5% from about $13 million in 2013 to about $12.2 million in 2014.

        <p>
   MaxLinear intends to bolster its global presence, particularly in the US, Asia, and Europe by capitalizing on the fast-growing and evolving digital television and mobile devices markets. The company hopes that its expansion efforts will broaden its customer base.
  </p>
        <p>
   With its acquisition of Entropic Communications, MaxLinear broadened its product base and increased its scale, which should wring better deals from manufacturers. The $287 million purchase also nets Entropic's 1,500 patents, bolstering MaxLinear's intellectual property portfolio. Entropic makes multimedia over coaxial cable (MoCa) chips, which expand the capabilities of the coax cable that enters the house from a cable provider.
  </p>
        <p>
   Previously, MaxLinear teamed up with Peregrine Semiconductor to produce a dual-RF-input digital TV (DTV) front-end reference design that would support both digital terrestrial TV and cable TV reception.

        <p>MaxLinear agreed to buy Exar for about $660 million in 2017. In making the latest deal in the continuing consolidation of the chip industry, MaxLinear is growing by adding products and revenue to diversify its portfolio as well as its customer base. Exar brings a lineup of analog and mixed-signal products for power management and interface technologies for applications in communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise networking, and automotive. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.</p>
        <p>In 2015, MaxLinear bought Entropic Communications , another chip design company, for $287 million.</p>
