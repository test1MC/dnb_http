   BioVest International is invested in biotechnology. BioVest offers cell culture products, instruments, and related contract services to research institutions, biotech firms, and pharmaceutical companies. The company is also developing a therapeutic cancer vaccine for follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is customized for individual patient use. The candidate, dubbed BiovaxID, is in late stages of development. Its AutovaxID product is a cell culture instrument designed to ease use of BiovaxID. BioVest was established in 1981.

  <p>
   BioVest filed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection in March 2013 to eliminate some $44 million in debt and to unearth about $6 million in new operational funding to support its efforts to commercialize BiovaxID. During the restructuring, the company will continue to pursue regulatory approval of BiovaxID in Canada and the European Union. BioVest also aims to pursue new licensing and partnership opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 2013 bankruptcy filing is not its first restructuring effort. Both BioVest and parent Accentia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged about two years later in late 2010.
