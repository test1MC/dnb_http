   Collegium Pharmaceutical's wisdom is in developing over-the-counter and prescription drugs for a variety of conditions affecting the skin and central nervous and respiratory systems. Typically the company starts with existing drugs and works to improve them through new delivery systems that modify their release, or prevent abuse. It is working with drugs to treat such conditions as pain and sleep apnea. Its lead candidate, Xtampza, is an abuse-deterrent form of oxycodone for the management of severe pain; it is tentatively approved by the FDA. Collegium dedicates nearly all of its resources to advancing its DETERx platform technology and its product candidates, as well as creating related intellectual property.

  <p>
   Collegium intends to market Xtampza and its other candidates in the US through its own sales force. It plans to hire about 120 sales representatives to market the drug to pain specialists and other physicians who prescribe the majority of opioid prescriptions. Abroad, it is looking to establish licensing partnerships for Xtampza.

   As a development firm, Collegium has not generated revenue since 2011. In addition to product sales, the company may in the future make revenue from marketing and distribution partnerships and other collaborations.

  <p>
   The company has operated at a loss since its founding as it conducts research and development activities and covers operating costs. In fiscal 2015, the company had a net loss of $27.3 million, a 52% increase from the prior year. As of December 31, 2015, it had an accumulated deficit of $129 million.

   The opioid abuse epidemic in the US has caused an increase in demand for abuse-deterrent forms of pain relievers. The

    FDA
   </company>
   had made it a priority to address prescription pain killer abuse. A number of methods to prevent opioid dependency are being developed; Collegium's DETERx platform is designed to provide extended-release (12 hours) pain relief while preventing abuse by oral, injection, or nasal intake.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the Xtampza form of oxycodone, Collegium has abuse-deterrent forms of hydrocodone, oxymorphone, and morphine under development.
