  <p>
   After enjoying significant revenue growth in 2014, Textron saw its revenues decline by 3% in 2015 mainly due to a 19% dip in Bell Helicopter segment sales. This was due to a decline in V-22 program revenues as a result of lower aircraft deliveries. The segment was also affected by lower commercial revenues related to a change in mix of commercial aircraft sold as a result of lower sales across the commercial helicopter market in addition to lower aftermarket volume sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Textron's profits, however, peaked at $697 million in 2015, its highest total in at least eight years. This was mainly due to a decrease in selling and administrative expenses, attributable to favorable impacts from ongoing cost reduction activities within its Bell segment. In addition, the company experienced an absence of acquisition and restructuring costs in 2015, which was recognized in 2014 related to restructuring activities.

   In addition to acquisitions, Textron is focused on launching new products to expand its customer base. The company in 2015 introduced the delivery of the new Citation Latitude, a midsize jet for which
   <company id="54066">
    NetJets

   has placed a firm order for the first 25 of 150 Citation Latitudes. In addition, Textron is developing the Citation Longitude, a super-midsize jet expected to enter into service in 2017, and recently announced the Citation Hemisphere, a large-cabin jet for which the first flight is targeted in 2019.

  <p>
   The company occasionally beefs up its segments through acquisitions. In March 2014 Textron expanded rapidly through the $1.5 billion purchase of plane maker
   <company id="103890">
    Beechcraft
   </company>
   . It combined Beechcraft and Cessna into its newest segment: Textron Aviation. The deal added significantly to Textron's revenues during 2014.

   Pioneer conglomerate builder Royal Little founded Special Yarns Corporation, a Boston textile business, in 1923 and merged it with the Franklin Rayon Dyeing Company in 1928. The result, Franklin Rayon Corporation, moved its headquarters to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1930 and changed its name to Atlantic Rayon in 1938.

  <p>
   The company expanded during WWII to make parachutes, and in 1944 adopted the name Textron to reflect the use of synthetics in its textiles. Between 1953 and 1960 Textron bought more than 40 businesses, including
   <company id="105872">
    Bell Helicopter

   , before banker Rupe Thompson took over in 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thompson sold weak businesses, such as Amerotron, Textron's last textile business (1963), but also bought 20 companies between 1960 and 1965. By 1968, when former Wall Street attorney William Miller replaced Thompson as CEO, Textron made products ranging from chain saws to watchbands. Miller sold several companies and bought Jacobsen Manufacturers (lawn care equipment, 1978) before leaving Textron in 1978 to head the
