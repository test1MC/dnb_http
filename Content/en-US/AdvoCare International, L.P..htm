   AdvoCare has more than 225,000 independent distributors who get their products for distribution through

    FedEx
   </company>
   or pick up the products on-site.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is in the early stages of a real estate search for a large distribution center for its products. The new distribution center plans follow AdvoCare's recent adding of a second production line in its current distribution facility in Plano. The facility packages products for fulfillment six days a week.

  <p>
   AdvoCare's strategy lies in helping its distributors succeed by providing professional training, education, and support programs.

   It also seeks to add new, innovative products to its offerings, and by adding new celebrity spokespersons. AdvoCare became the sponsor for Shreveport, Louisiana's Independence Bowl title football game in 2009 and more recently AdvoCare signed a jersey sponsorship deal with
