   Atlas Holdings isn't holding the weight of the world on its shoulders, but it does take on a number of fixer-uppers. The holding company, formerly Atlas Industries, plans to acquire and turn around underperforming businesses, in addition to bolstering the operations of the companies it has previously acquired. Atlas Holdings' business portfolio includes Forest Resources (a producer of recycled paper and specialty packaging products), Detroit Renewable Energy (renewable-energy generation and distribution), and Pangborn (designing and marketing surface preparation equipment and aftermarket parts used in metal manufacturing).

  <p>
   Other companies in Atlas Holdings' portfolio include AGI-Shorewood (packaging); Bridgewell Resources (wholesale distribution and supply chain management of wood, food, agricultural, mat, utility, renewable energy and construction products); Erickson (turnkey framing services, framing packages); Finch Paper (premium uncoated printing paper for advertising materials); Phoenix Services (metal recovery, steel mill services, slag products); RedBuilt (joists, beams and wood trusses); Soundview Paper (towels and tissues); Susquehanna Partnerships (drilling); Twin Rivers Paper Company (paper, pulp and lumber); and Wood Resources, LLC (wood panels).
  </p>

  <p>
   The company has more than 90 locations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and North America.

  <p>
   Atlas Holdings serves customer in eight industrial segments: building materials; capital equipment; energy; industrial services; packaging; pulp, paper, and tissue; steel; and logistics, supply chain management, and distribution.

  <p>
   The company's strategy is focused on investing in underperforming businesses in industry sectors segments where it has expertise (with a criteria of up to $100 million of equity capital in any individual transaction) and selling the improved companies for a profit. Its acquisition targets are often struggling divisions of a larger corporate parent, which Atlas Holdings seeks to turn into strong, independent companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013, its Wood Resources unit sold its Southeast operations including Chester Wood Products and Moncure Plywood, to Boise Cascade for $102 million; AGI-Shorewood sold its gravure assets in the US, Mexico, and Asia to
   <company id="42329">
    Amcor Limited
   </company>
   , in order to focus on customers in its core North America and Europe specialty-packaging markets and its fast growing markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.

  <p>
   In 2013, Atlas Holdings bought major assets of PDM Bridge, LLC, a steel fabricator that makes steel components for complex bridge structures. The new entity, Veritas Steel, operates three fabrication plants in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Wausau, Wisconsin and Palatka, Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to increase its manufacturing capability in lightweight papers, expand into specialty markets, and grow its sawmill operations, that year Atlas Holdings and Blue Wolf Capital Partners bought Twin Rivers Paper Company, a provider of specialty packaging, label and publishing papers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012, Atlas Holdings acquired Erickson Framing, a construction services and pre-fabricated building products company, from Masco Corporation. Erickson's primary market includes Arizona, Northern California and the greater Reno, NV area.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Atlas Holdings merged its specialty packaging business, AGI World, with
   <company id="10800">
    International Paper
   </company>
   's (IP) consumer packaging subsidiary,
   <company id="14709">
    Shorewood Packaging
   </company>
   , to create a new company, AGI-Shorewood. Atlas Holdings owns 100% of AGI-Shorewood in the US and 60% of it outside the US. IP holds the remaining 40% of the new company outside the US. Shorewood was part of IP's consumer packaging segment, which -- despite an uptick in sales in 2010 -- suffered heavy losses that year due to high raw material, shipping, and other costs. The deal fit the bill for Atlas, an investment firm that routinely acquires underperforming subsidiaries from larger companies.
