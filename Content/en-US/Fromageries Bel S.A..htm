   Maybe this company thinks laughing cows make the best cheese. Fromageries Bel, maker of La Vache Qui Rit (The Laughing Cow) is one of the leading cheese producers in France, boasting about 30 brands of processed, fresh processed, hard, semi-hard, and soft cheeses. The firm also markets products under the BabyBel, Kiri, Boursin and Leerdammer names. In addition to domestic markets, Fromageries Bel peddles its products in more than 130 countries, including in the US through

   . The cheese maker also supplies foodservice operators and wholesalers. The Bel/Fievet family owns more than two-thirds of the company; competitor

   owns some 24%.

   Sales in 2015 were €2.9 billion, 6% higher than prior year. Much of the growth in sales was down to the favorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Sales increased in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and Greater Africa regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose €61 million to €184 million, up 50% on prior year due to increased sales, partially offset by a higher income tax expense.

  <p>
   The company's growth strategy is based on geographic expansion, and thus the company is strengthening its presence in regions with high organic growth potential. For instance, it opened a new cheese production site in Cote d'Ivoire, its first in Sub-Saharan Africa; the African continent saw sales growth of 8% in 2015. The site is expected to produce 20 million portions a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the company bought a majority share in Safilait, a dairy producer in Morocco.

   In 2015, the Bel Group acquired 70% of Safilait, Morocco's third largest dairy company specializing in the processing, packaging and sale of fresh milk, UHT milk and fresh dairy products. Safilait products are marketed through its Jibal brand.

  <p>
   Jules Bel founded a cheese-curing business in Orgelet, France, in 1865. The company eventually matured into the production of cheese under the leadership and innovation of Jules' son Léon Bel. Léon created a new type of cheese by experimenting with the mixture of Comté and Emmenthal, which he gave the name La Vache Qui Rit (The Laughing Cow) in 1921.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1922 Léon commissioned graphic designer Benjamin Rabier to create a marketable symbol for the new cheese and incorporated the company under the name Fromageries Bel. As La Vache Qui Rit gained popularity with French children, Léon added a separate publicity department in 1926 to conduct consumer research and develop unique advertising campaigns for the product.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fromageries Bel opened its first foreign production plant in Belgium in 1933. As the cheese gained popularity in foreign markets, the company changed the name to reflect the language of the country, beginning with "The Laughing Cow" in England.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced new brands of cheese in 1938, under the leadership of Léon's son-in-law Robert Fiévet. The company moved its headquarters to Paris and went public in the 1950s, preparing to expand its brands into new product categories. Production moved into Germany in 1959, with the formation of subsidiary Belco, and later into Spain. Expansion continued in France with the acquisition of cheese producers Graf (1960), Rentz (1962), and Fromageries Picon (1968).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 Fromageries Bel acquired Albany Cheese, entering the US market. Further expansion efforts resulted in new varieties of cheese being added to the product line (Roquefort, Brie, and Camembert) and a number of international facilities emerging throughout Europe. In 1976 Bel acquired Société Anonyme des Fermiers Reúnis (SAFR), along with its subsidiaries in Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bel began to acquire the cheese-making divisions of Nestlé in 1985, adding the US brands Price's and Wispride. The company continued to expand, capturing more than 75% of France's soft cheese market. In 1993 Bel competitor Besnier (now
   <company id="54346">
    Groupe Lactalis
   </company>
   ) gained a 20% stake in the company, hoping for a takeover as Bel's leadership passed on to another family member. The family-owned holding company La Carbonique owned 60% of Fromageries Bel and protected the company while leadership passed on from Fiévet to his son-in-law, Bertrand Dufort, in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Bel increased its US presence with the acquisition of Kaukauna Cheese of Wisconsin (renamed
   <company id="135733">
    Bel Brands USA
   </company>
   ). Polska (Poland) and Sabel (Egypt) were acquired in 1998. Fromageries Bel changed the name of its holding company in 1999 from La Carbonique to Unibel. The year 2000 brought further cheese conquests: Bel acquired 30% of Slovakia's largest cheese producer, Zempmilk, and it purchased outright the Czech cheese company Zeletavska Syrarny.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Bel branched out into India when it introduced The Laughing Cow brand cheese in New Delhi and other metro areas of the country. Later that same year, it completed the acquisition of the Leerdammer Company (which makes Europe's leading brand of hard cheese) from
   <company id="93546">
    Wessanen
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To concentrate on its major brands, in 2003 Bel's Queserias Iberica unit sold off its Manchego cheese operations but kept its fondue cheese production facility in Spain.
