   Ener1 is on a quest to energize the world. The company develops and manufactures lithium-ion batteries and battery packs, primarily for grid energy storage, transportation, and small electronics applications. Its EnerDel unit makes lithium-ion batteries and battery cells in the US and South Korea. The subsidiary has an agreement with Norway-based Think Global to supply batteries for its Think City electric vehicle (EV). It is also developing batteries for the
   <company id="137886">
    Volvo
   </company>
   C30 EVs. Ener1's EnerFuel unit develops fuel cell components and its NanoEner subsidiary develops technology for depositing materials onto battery electrodes. Ener1 manufactures in the US and South Korea; more than half of sales come from its US operations.

  <p>
   Ener1 began as Boca Research, a business founded by Timothy Farris in 1985. With just a small office and a production room in the back, the company produced a memory board the next year, offering it at half the price of a similar model made by
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the late 1980s the company expanded its memory board selection and added video boards, and in the early 1990s it unveiled its first data communications product, a 2,400 bps modem. Boca went public in 1993. That year it entered the networking market with Ethernet adapters and purchased peripherals and software producer Complete PC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Motorola executive Anthony Zalenski was named president and CEO of Boca in 1994. He increased retail distribution, and by 1997 Boca was shipping to major retailers such as
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   , Computer City, and
   <company id="17060">
    Costco
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To combat harsh price wars and a weakening market for Boca's slower modems, in 1997 Zalenski streamlined operations, cut 10% of the workforce, and diversified the product mix with Internet appliances. Despite these moves, Boca suffered a loss that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company bought the modem business and brand name of Global Village Communications. The purchase contributed to another loss. A financial boost came in 1999 when
   <company id="43106">
    National Instruments
   </company>
   and
   <company id="102908">
    Infomatec Integrated Information Systems
   </company>
   made significant investments in Boca. That year the company began offering thin-client/server computing devices and information appliances.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Zalenski resigned as president and CEO; chairman Robert Ferguson stepped in to replace him. Later that year, the company sold its modem business and changed its name to Inprimis. It also ended a brief foray into the application service provider market, ceasing development of its AppsCom subsidiary. Ferguson later announced he would resign as CEO and Eduard Will was brought in to take his place in 2001. The next year Florida-based Ener1 Holdings took an 80% stake in the company. Will resigned from Inprimis shortly afterward (COO Larry Light was tapped as interim chief) and the company changed its name to EnerNow. Later in 2002 the company announced the formation of EnerLook Healthcare Solutions, its 51%-owned joint venture to develop interactive TV systems for hospitals; it also made another name change, this time to Ener1.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ener1 discontinued business through EnerLook Solutions in 2003. Also that year, Ener1 and Japan's
   <company id="41870">
    ITOCHU
   </company>
   formed EnerStruct to develop rechargeable batteries and fuel cells for such applications as hybrid automobiles. Ener1 held a 49% stake in EnerStruct. Kevin Fitzgerald, a former CEO of
   <company id="56450">
    Neff Corp.
   </company>
   , was named chairman and CEO of Ener1 in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2004, the company merged one of its non-active subsidiaries into Splinex Technology Inc., a visual computing technology provider.
  </p>
  <p>
   The assets of EnerLook Healthcare Solutions were transferred to TVRC Communications in late 2004 in exchange for an equity stake in TVRC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ener1 in 2005 said it was considering spinning off three subsidiaries -- EnerDel, EnerFuel, and NanoEner -- as separate companies. Later that year, the company started restructuring EnerDel to focus on developing lithium ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles. EnerDel discontinued work on Bellcore technology it had received from Delphi, saying it could not profitably manufacture the technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Victor Mendes was named chairman and CEO in late 2006. Just weeks later, he resigned from those posts. Before the end of the year, CTO Peter Novak was promoted to CEO. Novak added the title of president in late 2007, following the resignation of Subhash Dhar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novak resigned as CEO in 2008; he remained with the company as president and resumed the title of CTO. Chairman Charles Gassenheimer added the post of CEO to his responsibilities, succeeding Novak.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ener1 added South Korean manufacturing operations with its 2008 purchase of a majority interest in Enertech International, a South Korea-based maker of lithium-ion battery cells, from TVG Capital Partners.
