   This Lee commands an army of newspapers. Lee Enterprises owns or has stakes in about 50 daily newspapers and nearly 300 weekly papers and niche publications. Its papers serve primarily small and midsized markets in some 20 states. Its portfolio is anchored by the
   <em>
    St. Louis Post Dispatch
   </em>
   ; it also owns 50% of Madison Newspapers, publisher of the
   <em>
    Wisconsin State Journal
   </em>
   . The eighth-largest newspaper publisher in the US,  Lee serves a daily circulation of more than 1.3 million readers. It additionally operates several websites in conjunction with its newspapers, and it has commercial printing facilities.

  <p>
   In 2011 Lee reached an agreement with most its lenders to refinance $769.5 million of its loans. However, the plan required unanimous approval and 6% of its lenders did not consent; thus, a couple of months later Lee was forced to file for Chapter 11. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 under new financing terms.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Lee operates in 23 states concentrated mostly in the Midwest US.

  <p>
   Lee operates in a single operating segment: newspapers. The company generates revenue through circulation, advertising (print and digital), and commercial printing services.

  <p>
   In light of the new media landscape, Lee has been focusing on its digital operations. These efforts include mobile and tablet apps, digital couponing, banner ads, and social networking services. Lee's websites and mobile products attracted 21.8 million unique visitors in December 2011.

  <p>
   About 71% of the company's 2011 revenue came from advertising. In 2011, advertising revenue decreased $23,326,000, or 4.2%. One bright spot for the company: digital advertising revenue increased 27% in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's bankruptcy filing came days after its annual financial results, when it reported a loss of more than $146 million for the fiscal year ended September 2011. In its bankruptcy documents, Lee listed liabilities of $994.5 million and assets of $1.15 billion. Under its plan, the company is extending loan repayments, once due in 2012, to 2015 and 2017 -- with higher interest rates. Also as part of the reorganization, current shareholders will be diluted to about 13%, while new shares will be issued to creditors.

   In 2012 Lee agreed to sell the North County Times newspaper and digital media operations to Manchester Freedom, LLC for $11.95 million. Proceeds of the divestiture will be used to pay down the company's debt.

  <p>
   Alfred Lee began buying up newspapers in the Midwest in 1890, beginning with the
   <i>
    Ottumwa Daily Courier
   </i>
   (Iowa). His strategy was simple: Find a newspaper with potential and let a good manager run it without interference. Lee died in 1907, leaving one of those managers, E. P. Adler, to run the company. Adler continued building the company and in 1937 bought a radio station in Iowa (later sold). The company formed Madison Newspapers, a jointly owned venture with The Capital Times Co., in 1948. Adler died in 1949, and Lee Loomis, a nephew of Alfred Lee, took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   Loomis expanded the company into TV broadcasting in 1953 and bought six Montana newspapers in 1960. That year the company was consolidated as Lee Enterprises, Incorporated. Loomis later retired and Philip Adler (son of E. P.) took charge. He brought Lee public in 1969, raising money for acquisitions. When Adler retired the next year, David Gottlieb (a distant relative) took control. The company had newspapers and radio and TV stations in 10 states.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1972 Lee began to produce advanced printing plates through a joint venture, NAPP Systems. (It bought out its partner in 1990 and sold the business in 1997.) Gottlieb died of a heart attack in 1973, and Lloyd Schermer (related to Gottlieb by marriage) became president. Under his leadership, the company acquired TV stations in western states during the 1980s. Schermer was elevated to chairman in 1986. By 1990 Lee had 19 newspapers and six stations in 13 states. Schermer stepped down as CEO in 1991, and was replaced by Richard Gottlieb, son of David Gottlieb. (Richard Gottlieb took the chairman title in 2000.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Lee acquired Pacific Northwest Publishing Group from Walt Disney, which gave it 24 publications mainly in the Northwest. In 1999 the company bought the
   <i>
    Ravalli Republic
   </i>
   , a daily in Montana. It also traded the
   <i>
    Daily Sun
   </i>
   in Nebraska and some cash for two dailies and two weeklies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 it bought three more dailies --
   <i>
    Columbus Telegram
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Fremont Tribune
   </i>
   in Nebraska and
   <i>
    Chippewa Herald
   </i>
   in Wisconsin -- as well as 15 other publications. To focus on its core operations, the company sold its TV stations to
   <company id="17118">
    Emmis Communications
   </company>
   for about $560 million. Gottlieb stepped down as CEO in 2001 and was replaced by Mary Junck. She added chairman to her title in 2002, when Gottlieb retired. Also in 2002, the company sold off five specialty publications in the western US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee purchased 16 daily newspaper titles from Howard Publications for $694 million in 2002. Its 50%-owned Madison Newspapers unit bought several publications in 2002, including a daily newspaper in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. The company picked up Iowa's
   <i>
    Sioux City Journal
   </i>
   daily newspaper later that year. It also sold two publications to Ottaway Newspapers (later
   <company id="108784">
    Dow Jones Local Media Group
   </company>
   ), a subsidiary of
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones &amp; Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004, the company exchanged its daily newspapers in Freeport, Illinois and Corning, New York and about $2 million in cash for Liberty Group Publishing's two daily newspapers in Burley, Idaho and Elko, Nevada and eight weekly and specialty publications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee took a major step to expand its business the following year when it acquired newspaper rival
   <company id="14507">
    Pulitzer
   </company>
   for about $1.4 billion. The deal included such papers as the
   <em>
    St. Louis Post Dispatch
   </em>
   and boosted the company's overall circulation by more than 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee agreed to sell its Wisconsin daily,
   <em>
    The Daily News
   </em>
   , in Rhinelander as well as jointly-owned paper
   <em>
    Shawano Leader
   </em>
   to BlueLine Media Holdings for $2.2 million in 2006. That same year, it inked a pact with
   <company id="48043">
    Yahoo!
   </company>
   to sell job listings on the online giant's
   <company id="59893">
    HotJobs
   </company>
   employment portal. (HotJobs was eventually sold to industry leader
   <company id="41617">
    Monster.com
   </company>
   in 2010.)
  </p>
  <p>
   As readership and advertising revenue continued to decline, the company began reducing staff at many of its papers in an effort to cut costs. It also shuttered the print edition of
   <em>
    The Capital Times
   </em>
   , owned by Madison Newspapers, during 2008 due to increasing losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lee also worked to boost revenue through new technologies and investments in its online operations. The company launched a system of targeting online ads based on audience behavior during 2009 in an effort to attract new advertisers to its Internet properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011.
