        <p>
   In fiscal 2015, DuPont's net sales decreased by 12% (to $25.1 billion) compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower sales from the agriculture segment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Agriculture segment sales dropped as the result of the negative impact of currency and lower seed and crop protection volumes, primarily in Brazil and North America, partly offset by higher local corn seed prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income decreased by 46% (to $1.95 billion) due to lower sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2015 net cash provided by the operating activities declined by 38% compared to fiscal 2014, to $2.2 billion.

        <p>
   DuPont's general strategy for growth is to use its expertise in science and technology to launch products that address global needs for food, and cleaner energy (mainly reducing dependence on fossil fuels).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is looking to build and leverage leading positions in three highly attractive strategic focus areas -- Agriculture &amp; Nutrition, BIO-Based Industrials, and Advance Materials -- where the company has robust opportunities and strong, well established competitive advantages.
  </p>
        <p>
   DuPont's near term focus is to deliver earnings growth while positioning the businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow.
  </p>
        <p>
   As part of its portfolio reorganization, in 2015 DuPont spun off its Performance Chemicals unit as the

    Chemours Company
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2014 DuPont Protection Technologies announced the new DuPont Kevlar brand platform, Dare Bigger, and a sponsorship of ESPN X Games through 2015.

        <p>In order to gain approval for the Dow Chemical deal from European regulators, DuPont traded businesses with FMC. DuPont sold part of its crop protection business to FMC and FMC sold its health and nutrition business to DuPont. DuPont is to gain about $1.6 billion on the deal because of the difference in the valuations of the assets. FMC's Health &amp; Nutrition business generated more than $700 million in revenue in 2016 from food ingredients and pharmaceuticals. DuPont expects that the additional products will complement its nutrition and health business.</p>

   Eleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours fled to America in 1800 after the French Revolution. Two years later he founded a gunpowder plant in Delaware. Within a decade the DuPont plant was the largest of its kind in the US. After Irénée's death in 1834, his sons Alfred and Henry took over. DuPont added dynamite and nitroglycerine in 1880, guncotton in 1892, and smokeless powder in 1894.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1902 three du Pont cousins bought DuPont. By 1906 the company controlled most of the US explosives market, but a 1912 antitrust decision forced it to sell part of the powder business. WWI profits were used to diversify into paints, plastics, and dyes.
  </p>
        <p>
   DuPont acquired an interest in
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   in 1917; the stake increased to 37% by 1922 (the company surrendered its stake in 1962 due to antitrust regulations). In the 1920s the firm bought and improved French cellophane technology and began producing rayon. DuPont's inventions include neoprene synthetic rubber (1931), Lucite (1937), nylon (1938), Teflon (1938), and Dacron. The last du Pont to head the company resigned as chairman in 1972. DuPont got into the energy business by acquiring Conoco for $7.6 billion in 1981.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1991 DuPont and
   <company id="10986">
    Merck
   </company>
   created DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical to focus on non-US markets. After record earnings in 1994, DuPont spent $8.8 billion the next year to buy back shares of the corporation from Seagram. In 1997 DuPont purchased Protein Technologies International (soy proteins) from Ralston Purina and
   <company id="41791">
    Imperial Chemical
   </company>
   's polyester-resins and intermediates operations (1997) and polyester-film business (1998).
  </p>
        <p>
   DuPont president Chad Holliday became CEO in early 1998. That year DuPont purchased a 20% stake in
   <company id="14440">
    Pioneer Hi-Bred International
   </company>
   (corn seed) for $1.7 billion and Merck's 50% stake in DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical for $2.6 billion. DuPont's public offering of Conoco in 1998 raised $4.4 billion, the largest US IPO at the time.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 DuPont bought the Herberts paints and coatings unit from
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   . It also bought the remaining 80% of Pioneer Hi-Bred for $7.7 billion and biotechnology research firm CombiChem for $95 million. Making a clean break with its oil business, DuPont sold its remaining 70% stake in Conoco.
  </p>
        <p>
   To raise cash to pay down debt and focus on its core businesses, in 2013 DuPont sold one of its larger units, Performance Coatings, to The Carlyle Group for $4.9 billion.
