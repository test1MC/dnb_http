   Cool Beans! National Frozen Foods has made a name for itself as one of the nation's largest private-label frozen vegetable producers. The family-owned company's products, which include peas, sweet corn, carrots, squash, and beans (green, Italian, lima, and wax), as well as vegetable blends, organic veggies, and pureed items, are available in grocery stores worldwide. National Frozen Foods also provides bulk and custom-packaging services. The company operates four processing plants in Washington and Oregon that offer a combined cold storage capacity for nearly 200 million pounds of frozen vegetables.

   The company has four plants -- in Albany, Oregon, and Chehalis, Moses Lake, and Quincy in Washington -- which altogether freeze more than 400 million pounds of vegetables per year. National Frozen Foods uses technology to optimize productivity and ensure product quality. All of its plants use equipment and information technology systems, including metal detection and electronic optical defect sorting equipment and warehouse management and electronic data interchange systems.

   The Pacific Northwest tolerated a damp, chilly spring in 2011, driving farmers to delay planting that year. This move, in turn, made crop harvesting in the region late. In addition to the wet weather, farmers had to decide how to apportion their limited acreage -- from lower-priced, lower-margin vegetables (such as sweet corn and peas -- National's core products) to more expensive, higher-margin vegetables (like field corn and wheat). Taken together, these conditions left National Frozen Foods with a tight inventory for the year, like other vegetable processing companies.

  <p>
   National Frozen Foods was founded in 1912 by William McCaffray. It was originally named National Fruit Canning Company, but the firm discontinued its canning operations in 1974 and later renamed itself.
