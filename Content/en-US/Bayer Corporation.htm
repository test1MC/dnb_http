   For when you can't "bayer" the pain, Bayer Corporation makes your medicine. The US headquarters of pharmaceuticals and materials giant
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer AG
   </company>
   (or Bayer Group), the company oversees the US subsidiaries of Bayer's three global divisions:
   <company id="116564">
    Bayer HealthCare
   </company>
   (pharmaceuticals, animal health, and over-the-counter medicines),
   <company id="122181">
    MaterialScience
   </company>
   (plastics, coatings, and polyurethanes), and
   <company id="106053">
    Bayer CropScience
   </company>
   (herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides). Bayer Corp.'s internal services unit, Bayer Business and Technology Services, handles administrative, technology, human resources, legal, and procurement functions for the Bayer Group's US operations. Bayer Corp. has around 50 sales and manufacturing locations in the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company has offices in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia, as well as Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico.

   As with the parent company's global business, in North America Bayer's largest segment is HealthCare, led especially by prescription pharmaceuticals (including neurological, women's health, cardiology, and cancer drugs) and consumer care products (including Aspirin, Alka-Seltzer, and Aleve). Second to HealthCare is MaterialScience, followed by CropScience.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The Bayer Group is focused on growing all three of its core segments, both organically and through acquisitions. The HealthCare division became Bayer's largest through a couple of major acquisitions, including Germany's Schering AG (now
   <company id="57526">
    Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ). The unit also forms collaborative and licensing agreements with other device and drug manufacturers. It also spends a good deal of money on research and development programs for new drugs in areas including women's health, cardiovascular care, various types of cancer, and neurological ailments. Bayer has launched several new birth control products in the US market in recent years, and in 2011 it introduced a new clot prevention drug called Xarelto.
  </p>
        <p>
   The MaterialScience division in 2011 expanded its polycarbonate film production at its South Deerfield, Massachusetts facility. The films are used in a variety of applications, such as instrument panels, displays, membrane switches, and decals. Also, in 2011 and 2012 the company invested about $120 million to upgrade its Baytown, Texas site, its largest US plant.
  </p>
        <p>
   While Bayer is focused on expansion, it's also cutting costs and improving efficiencies to counteract dips in some profit areas due to tough economic conditions, increased generic competition, and other factors. In 2011 Bayer HealthCare announced plans to consolidate a number of facilities in the US.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   On June 5, 2013 The Bayer Group acquired California-based
   <company id="47807">
    Conceptus, Inc.
   </company>
   (the developer of the Essure procedure, the leading non-surgical permanent birth control method) for $1.1 billion. With this acquisition, Bayer can offer a complete range of short-term, long-term and permanent contraceptive choices for women through its HealthCare division.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 the CropScience unit acquired Arkansas-based Hornbeck Seed Co., which supplies soybean, rice, and wheat seed varieties to the southern US market.

        <p>
   Friedrich Bayer founded Bayer in Germany in 1863 to make synthetic dyes. Bayer's first operations in the US began in 1865 when the company bought a stake in a coal tar dye plant in Albany, New York. Prolific research labs fueled Bayer's growth beyond its synthetic-dye business and led to such breakthrough compounds as Antinonin (first synthetic pesticide, 1892), aspirin (1899), and synthetic rubber (1915).
  </p>
        <p>
   During WWI the US government seized Bayer's American operations and trademark rights and sold them to Sterling Drug. It also banned the company from using the Bayer name in the US, in part in retaliation for the German company's refusal to share its formula for sulfa drugs (a cure for then-endemic pneumonia) and other medicines with Allied countries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bayer's researchers discovered polyurethane chemistry in the 1930s. The company sided with the Nazis during this era. As part of I.G. Farben (formed when Bayer merged with other major German chemical companies in 1925), the company forced American affiliate Sterling Drugs to cancel ads in magazines critical of Germany. As part of the Nazi war machine, I.G. Farben built plants at Maidanek and Auschwitz to take advantage of slave labor, and developed the gas used to kill prisoners at Auschwitz.
  </p>
        <p>
   At the end of WWII, Bayer lost its 50% interest in Winthrop Laboratories (US) and Bayer of Canada (to Sterling Drug). After rebuilding in West Germany, Bayer was attracted to the prospect of shifting some of its production to the US by the twin realities of high US tariffs and expensive German labor. It entered a US chemicals joint venture with
   <company id="100932">
    Monsanto
   </company>
   (Mobay, 1954) to develop pesticides, polyurethane, plastics, and dyestuffs. Bayer bought Monsanto's share in 1967.
  </p>
        <p>
   Bayer grew in the US over the next decades through such acquisitions as Cutter Laboratories (nutritional products and drugs; 1974), Miles Labs (Alka-Seltzer, One-A-Day vitamins; 1978), Compugraphic (electronic imaging; 1989), and Technicon (1989). Bayer integrated its US holdings under the name Miles Inc. in 1992. The next year it introduced its first genetically engineered product, the hemophilia treatment Kogenate. The company was renamed Bayer Corporation in 1995 after it purchased the North American over-the-counter pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop, the former Sterling Drug, from SmithKline Beecham (now
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   ) for $1 billion. It regained the Bayer Aspirin product line and the rights to the Bayer brand name and trademark in North America.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline launched Baycol (cerivastatin sodium tablets), a new cholesterol-lowering pharmaceutical. Bayer also announced a five-year increased investment plan that included $6 billion for life sciences R&amp;D. In 2000 Bayer acquired the polyols business of
   <company id="10924">
    Lyondell Chemical
   </company>
   for $2.5 billion. Later that year Bayer added
   <company id="130200">
    Sybron Chemicals
   </company>
   (resins, textile chemicals) for $325 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the company restructured its seven units, condensing them into four divisions, enabling its health care, agrochemical, chemical, and polymer operations to operate with greater autonomy from one another. In July 2002 board member Attila Molnar succeeded Helge H. Wehmeier as President and CEO.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2002, in an effort to boost its agricultural operations, Bayer purchased
   <company id="41833">
    Aventis
   </company>
   ' CropScience unit and combined it with its own agricultural operations, creating the #2 agricultural products firm behind
   <company id="102664">
    Syngenta
   </company>
   . In 2004 Bayer acquired
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   's consumer health unit for around $3 billion, creating a top non-prescription drugmaker.
  </p>
        <p>
   Parent company Bayer spun off its chemicals subsidiary as a public company called
   <company id="122096">
    LANXESS
   </company>
   in 2005. The remaining Bayer Group, and thus also Bayer Corporation, then consisted of the health care, crop protection, and specialty materials units.
  </p>
        <p>
   In late 2008 Greg Babe became the new CEO of Bayer Corporation, the first non-German to do so. In Babe's favor was the fact that the 51-year old had worked at one of the company's predecessor's since college and moved up through the ranks to eventually head the MaterialScience division.
