   Autobytel puts cars on the information superhighway. Using the company's websites, a potential car buyer can research make, model, fuel efficiency, and more then complete an online request form for the desired new or used car. The form is forwarded to local auto dealers and manufacturers, who contact the shopper within 24 hours. Car buyers can also research insurance, financing, and other related services. Autobytel generates most of its revenue through lead referral fees it charges dealers and manufacturers (car buyers pay no fees). However, the company also operates advertising-driven consumer website Car.com, which offers many of the same services.

  <p>
   The company generates traffic to its website through search engine optimization or "SEO", paid search (search engine marketing or "SEM"), direct marketing, and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to its websites. During fiscal 2012 Autobytel spent some $1.2 million on advertising, marketing, and promotion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autobytel counts AutoNation, General Motors, Volkswagen, and Volvo among its customers.

  <p>
   The company's revenue increased by about 5% in fiscal 2012 compared with 2011. Revenue increased primarily due to an increase in lead fees. Lead revenues increased 6% in fiscal 2012 compared to the previous year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autobytel's net income also increased in fiscal 2012 (up to $1.4 million from $.4 million in fiscal 2011) mainly because of increased revenue paired with decreased operating expenses. The company's sales and marketing expenses decreased 4% during the year while the company's technology spend decreased 3% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower computer software and maintenance costs along with decreased data, content, and licensing charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bump in revenue and improved net income helped the company's net cash inflow increase by approximately $2 million in fiscal 2012 compared with the prior year.

   In 2012 the company launched the mobile version of Autobytel.com which gives consumers the opportunity to view photographs and videos, read car reviews, and check pricing from their mobile devices while on the go or when they are at dealerships shopping for vehicles. The mobile optimized website also has shopping tools that allow a consumer to find a local dealer, browse inventory, and request free dealer price quotes.

  <p>
   After his Southern California car dealership went under during an industry slump in the early 1990s, Peter Ellis decided to work car sales from another angle. He teamed with John Bedrosian (co-founder of National Medical Enterprises, which later became
   <company id="11055">
    Tenet Healthcare
   </company>
   , the nation's #2 hospital chain) and founded Auto-By-Tel in 1995. The company launched its Web site for new car sales the same year, and by the end of 1995, it had signed up more than 350 car dealers. Investors in an early round of private financing included
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   unit GE Capital Services, auto insurance company
   <company id="10095">
    American International Group
   </company>
   (AIG), and former
   <company id="104038">

   and
   <company id="103153">
    Warner Music Group
   </company>
   head Michael Fuchs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Auto-By-Tel formed an agreement with Chase Manhattan's Chase Auto Finance unit in 1996 to provide car loan services. It also introduced Internet-based insurance services through an online link with AIG. In 1996 the company's services became available in Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added used cars to its service in 1997. Poor market conditions for Internet stocks forced Auto-By-Tel to withdraw its IPO, originally planned for April 1997. By the close of 1997, more than 1,600 car dealers had signed up with the Auto-By-Tel service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to autobytel.com in 1998, and Mark Lorimer replaced Ellis as CEO. The next year, with market conditions improving, autobytel.com went public. The same year the company launched its car auction service and expanded into Japan, the UK, and Sweden. autobytel.com later teamed with LendingTree (now
   <company id="99287">
    Tree.com
   </company>
   ) to add a banking center to its Web site and launched an online automotive superstore. In early 2000 the company acquired A.I.N. Corporation, owner of the CarSmart.com vehicle buying service.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also laid the groundwork for expansion into Australia and Europe and later purchased rival Autoweb.com. Jeffrey Schwartz joined Autobytel in 2001 as vice chairman after its purchase of Autoweb.com, where he was president and CEO. He was elected Director and appointed President and CEO that year. Also that year the dot-com crash worsened, and the company put an end to its buying spree. A sign of the times, Autobytel.com ditched the suffix and changed its name to Autobytel Inc. In 2002 the company scaled back its international presence, closing its Australian operations and reducing its stake in Autobytel.Europe to 49%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Autobytel acquired
   <company id="61639">
    Stoneage Corporation
   </company>
   , operator of rival online auto site Car.com, for about $50 million. That same year the company bought iDriveonline, adding heft to its customer loyalty and retention marketing business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Autobytel.Europe was dissolved in 2005. Also in 2005 Richard (Rick) Post replaced Schwartz as President and CEO. The following year James Riesenbach agreed to become President and CEO. The company sold its price and specification business, Automotive Information Center, to
   <company id="46414">
    R. L. Polk &amp; Co
   </company>
   in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   After pursuing a sale in 2008, Autobytel instead decided to continue to shed non-core assets. Later that year the company sold its AVV data extraction and customer relationship management software product to
   <company id="112621">
    Dominion Enterprises
   </company>
   for $22.75 million in cash plus a working capital payment. Also that year it cut about 35% of its workforce, or some 75 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Riesnback left the company in 2008; he was replaced by Jeffrey Coats. The next year Autobytel implemented a second round of layoffs representing about 25% of its employees. In 2010 Autobytel bought proprietary content and search marketing firms Cyber Ventures and Autotropolis for nearly $17 million.
