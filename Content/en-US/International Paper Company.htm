   For International Paper (IP), business is a global paper chase. It is one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing papers. Products include uncoated paper used in printers, market pulp for making towels and tissues, and coated paper and uncoated bristols (heavyweight art paper). In the US, IP is #1 in containerboard production, 80% of which is used in industrial corrugated boxes. A consumer packaging arm makes board to box cosmetics and food. IP owns recycling plants, mainly in the US, and a pulp and paper business in Russia, via a 50/50 venture with Ilim Holding.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   IP has manufacturing operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, North Africa, and Russia. In the US it operates nearly 25 pulp, paper and packaging mills, roughly 170 converting and packaging plants, some 15 recycling plants and three bag facilities. In Europe, Asia, Latin America and South America, the company operates 16 pulp, paper, and packaging mills, 67 converting and packaging plants, and two recycling plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US is by far its largest market, representing nearly 75% of its total sales each year. EMEA is its second-largest market, generating around 12%, followed by the Asia/Pacific, 7%.

   IP divides its operations into three segments: industrial packaging (62% of total sales in 2014), printing papers (24%), and consumer packaging (11%). It divested its former distribution segment (the remaining 19% of sales) in 2014.

   IP sells packaging products, paper products, and other products directly to end users and converters, as well as through agents, resellers and paper distributors.

  <p>
   Over the last five years, the company has maintained steady revenue growth -- until fiscal 2014 and 2015. Revenue decreased by 5% to $22.3 billion in 2015 due to declines across all its segments. Printing papers sales dipped by 12% due to fewer sales from North America fueled by the closure of its Courtland mill and declines in average sales price. The segment was also affected by declines in sales volumes in Europe and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, its net income skyrocketed by 69% to $938 million in 2015 due to equity earnings in 2015 over losses in 2014. A decline in selling and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization and cost of timber harvested and restructuring and other charges also contributed to the growth in net income. In addition, the company's operating cash flows declined 6% in 2015 due to favorable inventories and dips in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

   IP has grown over the years through selective acquisitions and divestitures. In a major move to adjust its cost structure, in mid-2014 IP merged its
   <company id="144460">
    xpedx
   </company>
   operations with
   <company id="52849">
    Unisource
   </company>
   and created a new publicly traded company called
   <company id="163315">
    Veritiv Corporation
   </company>
   . Both xpedx and Unisource were business-to-business distributors of printing, packaging and facility supplies.

   In 1898, nearly 20 northeastern pulp and paper firms consolidated to lower costs. The resulting International Paper had 20 mills in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. The mills relied on forests in New England and Canada for wood pulp. When Canada enacted legislation to stop the export of pulpwood in 1919, International Paper formed Canadian International Paper.

   During the 1940s and 1950s, the company bought Agar Manufacturing (shipping containers, 1940), Single Service Containers (Pure-Pak milk containers, 1946), and Lord Baltimore Press (folding cartons, 1958). It diversified in the 1960s and 1970s, buying Davol (hospital products, 1968; sold to C. R. Bard, 1980), American Central (land development, 1968; sold to developers, 1974), and General Crude Oil (gas and oil, 1975; sold to Mobil Oil, 1979).

  <p>
   Decades later, International Paper picked up
   <company id="14709">
    Shorewood Packaging
   </company>
   for $850 million in 2000. That year it made an unsolicited $6.2 billion bid for
   <company id="10317">
    Champion International
   </company>
   -- which had previously agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="91040">
    UPM-Kymmene
   </company>
   -- igniting a bidding war. UPM withdrew its offer, however, and International Paper acquired Champion for about $9.6 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   After surviving the Great Recession, IP made one of its most significant acquisitions to date in 2012, when it acquired
   <company id="11451">
    Temple-Inland
   </company>
   , one of North America's top producers of corrugated packaging, in a transaction valued at $4.5 billion.
