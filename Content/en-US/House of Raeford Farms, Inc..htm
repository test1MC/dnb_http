   At House of Raeford Farms, a turkey can become a meatloaf, a pot roast, or a ham; a chicken can be transformed into fajitas, lunch meat, or a dog-on-a-stick. The family-owned and led poultry processor supplies fresh, frozen, and ready-to-serve chicken and turkey products to retail supermarkets, in-store delis, and foodservice providers. It offers a full lineup of whole, cut-up, ground, and boneless and bone-in meat products, as well as smoked and breaded cutlets, and packaged entrees. Its House of Raeford and Lakewood Plantation brands are sold throughout the US and in certain international markets. Among the largest poultry processors in the US, Raeford operates from facilities in the southeastern US.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company began to exit the commodity turkey growing and slaughter business as it increases its focus on chicken production volumes and fully cooked turkey and chicken product lines over the next several years. The restructuring resulted in the closure of a turkey hatchery in Rose Hill, North Carolina, and a turkey slaughter plant that employed nearly 1,000 in Raeford, North Carolina, among other operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to support its focus on chicken, Raeford in 2014 bought the Speedy Bird trademark and opened a 64,000-sq.-ft. processing plant in Mocksville, North Carolina, that produces fully-cooked chicken products, such as fully-cooked chicken sausage and burgers, grill-marked fajita strips and filets, and whole muscle and formed chicken tenders, filet wings, nuggets, and patties.
