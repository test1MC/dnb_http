Havells Sylvania electrical equipment lineup features switchgear, cables, and wires.

  <p>
   Xenell Corp., a maker of neon bulbs used in irons, toasters, and such, was founded in 1976. Electrical engineer Frank Ward acquired Xenell's distributor and in 1985 bought Xenell itself. In 1992 he bought competitor Chicago Miniature Lamp (CML) and merged the two companies under the CML name in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ward expanded CML by acquiring companies that made closely related products (light-socket molds, bulb-making equipment, and fiber optics). He took CML public in 1995. CML entered the fixtures, ballasts, and lamp markets in 1997 by adding more companies, including its biggest deal ever, its $161.5 million purchase of Switzerland-based Sylvania Lighting International (Europe's #3 lighting manufacturer at the time).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Sylvania name dates back to 1901, when Frank Poor of the US founded a company to refill burned-out light bulbs. A phone company, GTE, bought Sylvania in 1959 and expanded its operations throughout the world. GTE split the business in 1993 by selling Sylvania's North American operations to Germany's Siemens; the trade name "Sylvania" attached to SLI in all countries of the world except in North America, where Siemens' Osram GmbH lighting business owns the rights to the name. The rest of Sylvania became Sylvania Lighting International (acquired by CML in 1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   CML changed its name to SLI in 1998. In 1999 SLI increased its US presence by acquiring Supreme Corporation (light bulbs) and Parke Industries (lighting services). The next year SLI acquired four product lines from UK-based EMESS, a maker of high-end lighting fixtures.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to reduce debt, the company sold parts of its subsidiary, SLI Lighting Solutions, to Amtech Lighting Services and its 40% interest in Schott-Fostec back to Schott Corporation in 2001. Facing default on loans, SLI filed Chapter 11 in September 2002. In 2003 the company sold its general lighting division to former chairman and CEO Frank Ward for a reported $123 million and its miniature lighting division to an investment group for $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Full control of the company, including its brands, was acquired by Havells India in 2007. Under the terms of the acquisition, the SLI Sylvania group was renamed Havells Sylvania.
