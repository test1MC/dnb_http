   Landec's products don't turn into pumpkins at midnight, but the changes are nearly as sudden and much more practical. The company has developed a technology that allows polymers to change physical characteristics when exposed to temperature changes. Its BreatheWay permeable membrane packaging allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to enter and escape from sealed fresh-cut produce packages to keep produce fresh. It's used primarily by subsidiary Apio, which grows and packages fresh vegetables. Landec's Lifecore Biomedical subsidiary is a leading supplier of premium hyaluronan-based biomaterials for the ophthalmic and orthopedic markets. Landec has licensing deals with

   and

  <p>
   Landec's revenues peaked at a record-setting $539 million in 2015.The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by a 19% spike in Food Products Technology segment sales. This was driven by an increase in unit volume sales resulting primarily from new salad kit products which typically have a higher price per unit than historical offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income, however, has declined the last few years, dropping 29% to $14 million in 2015. The decline was attributed to a spike in selling, general, and administrative expenses associated with the promotion of its new salad kit products and the addition of incremental headcount.
