   United Technologies (UTC) has the worldwide industrial expertise to lift you up and cool you down. Its
   <company id="56332">

   ,
   <company id="146923">
    UTC Climate Controls &amp; Security
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="99062">
    Pratt &amp; Whitney
   </company>
   segments develop technologies, systems, and services for the aerospace, construction, and security industries. Climate Controls &amp; Security makes alarms, monitoring equipment, surveillance and access control systems, and fire and hazard detection products. Otis is the world's largest elevator and escalator manufacturing company, while Pratt &amp; Whitney makes commercial and military engines. UTC Aerospace Systems produces engine controls and flight systems for military and commercial clients.

  <p>
   UTC operates through 4,000 locations in more than 70 countries. The US generates around 55% of its total sales; Europe and the Asia/Pacific follow, contributing 20% and 15%, respectively.

  <p>
   After a wave of massive acquisitions and divestitures over the last few years, UTC has realigned under four well-diversified business segments. UTC's core Climate Controls &amp; Security segment makes security products and firefighting equipment for commercial, governmental, and residential applications. This segment represented nearly 30% of UTC's total sales for 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other remaining segments include Pratt &amp; Whitney (25% of sales), Otis (21%), and UTC Aerospace Systems (25%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves customers residing in the commercial and industrial (contributing 52% revenue), commercial aerospace (36%), and military aerospace and space (12%) sectors. The US government contributed 21%.
  </p>

  <p>
   After achieving historic growth in 2014, with revenues peaking at $65.1 billion, UTC saw its revenues decrease 15% to 15.1 billion in 2015. Profits, however, surged 8% from $6.2 billion in 2014 to a record-setting $7.6 billion in 2015. (Note: the company restated its annual report for 2014 due to the selling of its
   <company id="99064">
    Sikorsky
   </company>
   segment.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The dip in revenue for 2015 was fueled by decreased sales form its Otis and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments. Otis was negatively affected by volume declines in China and Europe, while Pratt &amp; Whitney suffered from lower commercial and military engine sales.

  <p>
   UTC strives to maintain a balance between its private and military sectors, its commercial and aerospace operations, and its original equipment (OE) and aftermarket products and services. It also juggles fluctuations in the market that may impact one or more of its businesses. These fluctuations include changing fuel costs and contracts from the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   (DoD), which are subject to policies set by the White House and Congress.
  </p>
  <p>
   This strategy of product balance is combined with geographic balance, which has the company investing in emerging markets that show great growth potential, such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, and South Africa. UTC is champing at the bit to acquire aerospace and commercial companies with operations in India, looking to achieve $2.5 billion in revenues from the country by 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   As it focuses on its core aerospace and building systems operations, UTC in early 2013 sold its
   <company id="106428">
    UTC Power

   unit to Oregon-based ClearEdge Power. In late 2015, it also sold its former

  <p>
   In 1925 Frederick Rentschler and George Mead founded Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft (P&amp;W) to develop aircraft engines. P&amp;W merged with Seattle-based Boeing Airplane Company and Chance Vought Corporation in 1929 to form United Aircraft &amp; Transport. United Aircraft soon bought aviation companies Hamilton Aero, Standard Steel Propeller, and
   <company id="99064">
    Sikorsky
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After congressional investigations led to new antitrust laws, United Aircraft split in 1934 into three independent entities: United Airlines, Boeing Airplane Company, and United Aircraft. United Aircraft retained P&amp;W and several other manufacturing interests.
  </p>
  <p>
   A design flaw in engines produced for Boeing 747s sent P&amp;W on an expensive trip back to the drawing board in the late 1960s. A concerned board of directors appointed Harry Gray, a 17-year veteran of Litton Industries, as president in 1971. Gray transformed the company into a conglomerate; it adopted its present name in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company entered into a new stage of development with the milestone 2012 acquisitions of Goodrich and Rolls-Royce's share in the International Aero Engines (IAE) joint venture. The $16.5 billion acquisition of Goodrich, an aircraft components manufacturer, was one of UTC's largest. Through the transaction, UTC absorbed $1.9 billion in assumed debt, but it also sizably boosted its services to the commercial aerospace/defense industry and increased its revenues. Goodrich was combined with the former Hamilton Sundstrand operations and now form its UTC Aerospace Systems segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   UTC in early 2013 sold its UTC Power unit to Oregon-based ClearEdge Power. In late 2015, it also sold its former
