   Despite its name, selling steak is only one part of the company's business. Omaha Steaks also offers appetizers, sides, snacks, complete meals, desserts, and pet treats.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company continues to count on the home gourmand for sales, Omaha Steaks has benefited from a growing trend of giving food as gifts, especially around the end-of-the-year holiday season. It has a growing business providing gourmet food products to companies with employee-incentive programs, as well as an affiliate program that pays customer/affiliates for referrals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also regularly extends its reach. In 2016, the company opened a new store at the West Hartford Center in West Hartford, Connecticut.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep longtime customers interested, Omaha Steaks introduces new products, such as its new line of gourmet cook-in-the-package products, which debuted in 2014.
