   Oregon Scientific faces increased competition in the tablet category for young customers. Its expertise, however, is in its Time &amp; Weather niche, which is a key contributor to sales revenue. To this end, Oregon Scientific is investing in Time &amp; Weather product development and in the potentially lucrative Wellness &amp; Beauty sector by strengthening its Asian market and launching a new series of SmartGlobe products.
