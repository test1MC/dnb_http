   For Siemens, one of the largest electronics and industrial engineering companies in the galaxy, everything comes down to seven segments: Power and Gas; Wind Power and Renewables; Energy Management; Building Technologies; Mobility; Digital Factory; and Process Industries and Drives. Siemens makes everything from automation equipment and building technologies for manufacturers and construction companies to diagnostic and imaging systems for hospitals and clinics. Other products include power generation and distribution equipment for the oil and gas and renewable energy sectors.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   All in all, the company operates through more than 290 major production and manufacturing plants in 200 countries worldwide. The EMEA region accounted for 54% of its net sales in 2014. Other major markets include the Americas (26%) and Asia and Australia (20%).

        <p>
   Siemens in late 2014 restructured its operations from four segments to seven: Power and Gas (PG); Wind Power and Renewables (WP); Energy Management (EM); Building Technologies (BT); Mobility (MO); Digital Factory (DF); and Process Industries and Drives (PD).
  </p>
        <p>
   PG offers products for generating electricity from fossil and renewable fuels and for transporting oil and natural gas, and WP offers products and services for on- and offshore wind power. EM is a supplier of products, systems, equipment, and services for transmission and distribution of electrical energy, while BT manufactures and supplies energy-efficient buildings and infrastructure systems. MO is a provider of passenger and freight transportation systems and services; DF offers automation technology, industrial switchgear, industry software, and services primarily to the manufacturing industry; and PD offers process products, systems, and services to industry sectors.
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition to its main segments, Siemens operates a
   <company id="139750">
    financial services
   </company>
   division that offers corporate financing, fund management, insurance, and risk management services. It also makes hardware and software for the communications industry through its
   <company id="160880">
    enterprise communications
   </company>
   business.
  </p>
        <p>
   While its operations are diverse, Siemens' long-term strategy focuses on developing and producing products that are attuned to global trends. Addressing climate, environmental, and energy concerns, the company makes wind turbines for the renewable energy industry and energy-efficient building technologies for the construction industry. Siemens' products are also used to build transit systems, water and wastewater facilities, and other systems that, in effect, facilitate population growth in mature and emerging urban markets.

        <p>
   After experiencing two straight years of revenue growth, Siemens saw its revenue dip 11% from $103 billion in 2013 to $91 billion in 2014. Profits jumped 17% from nearly $5.8 billion in 2013 to $6.8 billion in 2014 driven by a decrease in expenses. (Note the company's 2013 annual revenue was restated due to discontinued operations.)
  </p>
        <p>
   Siemens' declines for 2014 primarily reflected weaker orders in power generation and fewer orders from power transmission products. Its former health care segment experienced declines due to reduced orders in Asia, Australia, and the Americas in addition to a decline in the company's diagnostics business.

        <p>
   Siemens' focus on urbanization in emerging markets has been growing particularly more intense in recent years, especially in China, India, and Russia, where economies and urban populations have been exploding. The company has been bolstering its presence in these markets by entering into joint ventures and partnerships with native companies. The company also has a growing presence in emerging markets in South America through subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and other countries.
  </p>
        <p>
   Siemens has been selling various operations in an effort to weather the turbulence in the global economy and refocus its operations on its core business segments. In 2015 it sold its hospital information system business to
   <company id="12940">
    Cerner
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion. The business was focused on administrative hospital IT and electronic patient records, not the lab and medical equipment-based IT software that is more aligned with Siemens' business. The divestiture included 6,000 employees in the US, Europe (particularly Germany), and Asia.
  </p>
        <p>
   To bolster its railroad operations, Siemens in 2013 bought
   <company id="110316">
    Invensys Rail
   </company>
   , the rail signaling business of British engineering firm
   <company id="90103">
    Invensys
   </company>
   . Shelling out $2.8 billion for the purchase, Siemens enhanced its market share in the rail automation sector and merged Invensys Rail with its Siemens Infrastructure &amp; Cities segment.

   In 2017 Siemens closed its $4.5 billion acquisition of 
   <company id="14078">
    Mentor Graphics
   </company>
  .  Siemens is looking for Mentor's design software products to complement and extend its product line for its digital business initiative.
Siemens made Mentor a part of its product life cycle management software business.</p>

        <p>
   In 1847 electrical engineer Werner von Siemens and craftsman Johann Halske formed Siemens &amp; Halske. The firm's first major project linked Berlin and Frankfurt with the first long-distance telegraph system in Europe (1848). In 1870 it completed a 6,600-mile telegraph line from London to Calcutta, India, and in 1874 it made the first transatlantic cable, linking Ireland to the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's history of firsts includes Europe's first electric power transmission system (1876), the world's first electrified railway (1879), and one of the first elevators (1880). In 1896 it patented the world's first X-ray tube and completed the first European subway, in Budapest, Hungary.
  </p>
        <p>
   By the next century it had formed light-bulb cartel
   <company id="92225">
    OSRAM
   </company>
   with German rivals AEG and Auer (1919) and created a venture with
   <company id="56899">
    Furukawa Electric
   </company>
   called
   <company id="52514">
    Fuji Electric
   </company>
   (1923). It developed radios and traffic lights in the 1920s and began producing electron microscopes in 1939.
  </p>
        <p>
   Siemens &amp; Halske played a critical role in Germany's war effort in WWII and suffered heavy losses. During the 1950s it recovered by developing data processing equipment, silicates for semiconductors, and the first implantable pacemaker. It moved into the nuclear industry in 1959 when its first reactor went into service at Munich-Garching. In 1966 the company reincorporated as Siemens AG.
