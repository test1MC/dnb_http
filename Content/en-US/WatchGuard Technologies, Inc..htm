   Product innovation is key to building the WatchGuard brand. The company regularly rolls out new versions of key products to meet customer demand for additional features. In 2013 it launched two new products to provide security for mobile devices by strengthening the WLAN (wireless local area network). This is particularly important as more companies embrace BYOD (bring-your-own-device) policies. The prior year, WatchGuard introduced a virtual version of its XCS security appliance.

   In 2013, the company added seven new models to its line of Extensible Threat Management products. The new enterprise-class XTM products-primarily suited to headquarters, data centers, and managed security services-are the 1520, 1525, 2520 models.

   WatchGuard  has developed partnerships to extend its products into new areas. In 2014, the company teamed up with Fujitsu Fsas Inc. to deliver managed network security solutions in Japan. Under terms of the agreement, Fujitsu Fsas will add WatchGuard's Next Generation Firewall and Unified Threat Management appliances to its managed service offering and will distribute standalone versions of WatchGuard products.
