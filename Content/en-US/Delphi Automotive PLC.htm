   Delphi Automotive PLC predicts a profitable future. The UK-based company is one of the world's largest automotive parts makers, churning out a vast array of parts for the automotive and commercial vehicle industries. Product lines include connection systems, fuel cells, electric vehicle parts, infotainment, displays, safety mechanisms, and powertrain systems, among others. Spread across the globe, it has operations in 44 countries and a list of customers comprising some of the biggest names in automotive. Delphi Automotive PLC was formed as the holding company of US-based

  <p>
   Delphi's business is organized into three divisions: Electrical/Electronic Architecture, Powertrain Systems, and Electronics and Safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Electrical/Electronic Architecture segment, which brings in more than 50% of net revenue, designs electrical architecture including connectors, wiring assemblies and harnesses, electrical centers and hybrid high voltage and safety distribution systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Powertrain systems makes parts for gasoline and diesel engines, including fuel handling and injection, combustion, electronic controls, aftermarket, and original equipment services. It accounts for around 30% of net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Electronics and Safety segment makes parts, systems, and software for purposes including passenger safety, security, comfort, and infotainment. It also works in body controls, hybrid vehicle power technologies, displays, and mechatronics. It brings in about 20%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Headquartered in Gillingham, UK, the company has operations in 44 countries. It has 126 manufacturing facilities, and 14 major technical centers. The US represents around 37% of revenue, Europe, the Middle East and Africa brings in around 35%, and the Asia-Pacific region 25%. Latin America brings in 2%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's customer base includes all 25 of the largest automotive OEMs in the world; GM accounts for 14% of sales. Customers include Volkswagen Group, Ford Motor Company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Daimler, Peugeot Citroen, Shanghai General Motors Company, and others.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015, revenue fell 2% to $15.2 billion as unfavorable currency movements impacted on sales in Powertrain Systems and Electronics and Safety. The divestiture of the company's Reception systems business also brought down revenue. Profitability was up for the year, climbing 7% to $1.5 billion due to the gain on the sale of the company's Thermal Systems business, while cash from operations fell around 20% due to changes in accounts receivable.

  <p>
   The company is expanding in Asia, and has set up six new manufacturing facilities in China since 2012. The difficulties the company endured for a six year spell from in the mid-2000s prompted a streamlining process, and relocated a significant chunk of its US operations to Asia, where labor costs are lower. Sales to the US market have also shrunk as a proportion of the whole.
  </p>
  <p>
   Delphi has been busy selling off its underperforming units, which in 2015 included its Electronics and Electrical Wiring businesses in Argentina, its wholly owned Thermal Systems business, and its Korean joint venture. In 2016 it sold off its Chinese automotive air conditioning joint venture.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In March 2016, Delphi acquired PureDepth Inc., a maker of 3D display technology, for around $15 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, it acquired HellermannTyton, a maker of cable-management products, for $1.5 billion. In 2015 it also bought Control-Tec LLC, a cloud-hosted data analytics provider, and Ottomatika, Inc., an automated vehicle developer, for $104 million and $32 million respectively.

  <p>
   The company's return to the public markets and eventual profitability hasn't been easy. Delphi has struggled financially for years; it was only sporadically profitable for after being spun off in 1999. Delphi filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and emerged four years later as a heavily indebted private company owned by its investors, Elliot Management, GM, and Silver Point Capital. By that time it had laid off more than 75,000 workers, closed more than 70 sites, reduced its products lines from 119 to 33, exited 11 businesses, and had its pension (primarily for
   <company id="56122">
    UAW
   </company>
   workers) frozen and taken over by federal
   <company id="40361">
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
   </company>
   (PBGC). (In the end, the union workers' pension was kept afloat by taxpayers as part of the 2009 auto industry bailout).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011, Delphi was finally able to pay off GM for its $3.8 billion stake and PBGC for the $594 million it owed. The two transactions were funded with cash and $2.5 billion of new bank debt as part of a $3 billion credit facility from by investment bank
   <company id="121104">
    J.P. Morgan Securities
   </company>
   . The company makes about half of what it made five years ago, and plans the use the proceeds from its IPO to fund operations, buy equipment, and repay more debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paying off GM helped pave the way for the company's return to health, and a new business strategy to show investors doesn't hurt, either. Admittedly, Delphi has much leaner operations after its restructuring and moved the bulk of its operations outside the US to emerging markets where overall costs, especially labor costs, are lower. Delphi no longer has any UAW employees on its payroll; outside the US, it relies on non-salary and temporary workers to manage a flexible workforce.
