   Toppan Photomasks is one of the world's top suppliers of photomasks. Photomasks are customized etched plates of high-purity quartz or glass used by semiconductor manufacturers to transfer circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. The company supplies most major chip makers, including

   ,
   <company id="104903">
    IBM Microelectronics

    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics
   </company>
   . It also makes photomasks used to produce other computing products such as flat-panel displays, disk-drive heads, microelectromechanical products, and biochips. Toppan Photomasks became part of the largest photomask supplier in the world when it was acquired by

   .

  <p>
   The company sells its products globally. It has primary offices in China, France, Germany, South Korea, the UK, and the US (California and Texas), with sales and service centers across Asia, Europe, and North America.

  <p>
   Photomask manufacturing is an extremely capital-intensive business, dependent upon sophisticated fabrication and inspection equipment that costs millions of dollars, and merchant mask makers typically operate on small profit margins. Some of the biggest chip makers still make their own photomasks, but most have contracted out mask manufacturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the cost of making masks has soared (and the number of masks needed to make an advanced semiconductor part has increased, as well), the ranks of the merchant mask makers have dwindled through consolidation, leaving most of the global market to Toppan Photomask and its two biggest competitors,
   <company id="42903">
    Dai Nippon Printing
   </company>
   and
   <company id="14426">
    Photronics
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Toppan Photomasks has grown over the last two-plus decades by acquiring the photomask operations of major semiconductor manufacturers, including IBM and
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , then signing them up for long-term deals as customers. It has also emphasized long-term development alliances with major chip suppliers, such as
   <company id="10428">
    Cypress Semiconductor
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="58590">
    Infineon
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="15245">
    Xilinx
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company renewed through 2017 a joint venture with
   <company id="160901">
    GLOBALFOUNDRIES
   </company>
   though which it combined its Dresden manufacturing facility and GLOBALFOUNDRIES' Advanced Mask Technology Center into a single facility operated by Toppan. The venture supplies photomasks to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and to Toppan's European and global customer network. While the venture gives GLOBALFOUNDRIES a reliable source for photomasks and gives Toppan a firm customer base, it also allows the two companies to collaborate on development of next generation products.

   DuPont Photomasks, Inc. (DPI) began as a subsidiary of chemical giant
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   . It entered the photomask market in 1986 with the purchase of mask maker Tau Laboratories. Under the direction of longtime DuPont executive Michael Hardinger, DPI expanded globally by buying a number of in-house (Motorola, Inc.,
   <company id="11058">
    National Semiconductor
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ) and merchant (Master Images, Nanomask, and Perkin-Elmer) photomask operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company moved its headquarters to Central Texas, where it already had a plant. DuPont spun the company off in 1996. The next year DPI began its Reticle Technology Center R&amp;D joint venture with
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   , and Motorola Semiconductor Products (which later became
   <company id="114089">
    Freescale Semiconductor
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 DPI bought the photomask operations of Hyundai Electronics (now
   <company id="57841">
    Hynix Semiconductor
   </company>
   ) and
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   . As the chip industry entered a major downturn in 1998, DPI cut its workforce and slashed salaries. The following year it established a joint venture in Taiwan with big chip foundry
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Hardinger resigned in 1999; tech industry veteran Marshall Turner stepped in as DPI's interim head. That year DPI purchased
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   's photomask operations in France, agreeing to supply photomasks to IBM as part of the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Peter Kirlin, an executive from chip equipment maker
   <company id="16681">
    ATMI
   </company>
   , was named chairman and CEO. Also in 2000 DPI completed a new mask shop in Singapore. While surging growth in the worldwide chip market helped the company achieve record sales in 2000, a subsequent sharp drop in market conditions led the company to reorganize some operations in 2001. It shuttered and sold a factory in Scotland, reduced its workforce by about 6%, and reconfigured its manufacturing facilities throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 DPI sold its photoblank business (including a New York factory) to a subsidiary of Germany-based
   <company id="57436">
    Schott Glas
   </company>
   for $42 million; the deal established a joint development alliance between the companies, as well as a supply agreement under which Schott was to provide photoblanks to DPI for several years. Also in 2002 DPI branched out beyond the photomask business when it bought privately held BindKey Technologies, a maker of electronic design automation (EDA) software used to forestall design glitches before chips are manufactured.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2002 the company joined
   <company id="58590">
    Infineon
   </company>
   and AMD in a Germany-based mask-making joint venture, called Advanced Mask Technology Center (AMTC).
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2003 Kirlin resigned as chairman and CEO; board member and former interim CEO Marshall Turner succeeded him in both roles.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the eve of merging with Toppan in early 2005, DPI shut down the BindKey business, citing slower-than-expected growth in the EDA market. About 35 employees of the unit were given severance packages to stay on through a transition to support existing customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   gave its antitrust clearance on the Toppan acquisition, the $650 million purchase was completed in April 2005, and DPI changed its name to Toppan Photomasks, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company expanded its photomask shop in Shanghai, its fourth expansion since opening the Chinese facility in 1996. A year earlier, Toppan Photomasks expanded its facilities in Singapore and Ichon, South Korea.
