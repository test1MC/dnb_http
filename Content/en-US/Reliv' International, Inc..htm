   Reliv' International is offering its customers more than a beverage, it's offering a way of life. Reliv' develops, manufactures, and sells powdered nutritional supplements, weight-management products, sports nutrition drinks, and skin care products. Top seller Reliv' Classic and Reliv NOW are vegetarian beverage powders that contains vitamins, minerals, and soy protein. Other products include Innergize! sports drink and high-fiber supplement FibRestore. The company uses a multi-level marketing system, selling its products through more than 57,000 independent distributors primarily in the US, but also in Canada, Mexico, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.

        <p>
   The company has organized its international operations through wholly owned subsidiary Reliv' World, which boasts a number of market-specific entities. Reliv' World includes offices in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Indonesia. While the company manufactures its powdered products at a single facility in the US, Reliv' relies on third-party manufacturers for its food and skin care products.

   More than half of sales come from the company's four best-selling products -- Reliv Classic, Reliv NOW, Innergize!, and FibRestore. To broaden its customer base as it looks to the future, Reliv' is looking to active adults and children to breathe new life into its products.

        <p>
   The company expects the US, which accounts for 82% of sales, to continue to be its primary market. However, the general US economic downturn has temporarily weakened the appeal of the company's products among both consumers and new distributors in recent years. To entice distributors to purchase, the company in 2010 cut its enrollment fees and touted distributorship as a means of earning additional income in times of economic uncertainty.
  </p>
        <p>
   Reliv' is counting on an aging US population, rising health care costs, and increased focus on weight management to help boost the company's domestic sales. Although Reliv's typical customer base has been older adults seeking rejuvenation and weight loss, Reliv' is expanding its customer base to include active adults and children through sales of products such as the 24K Healthy Energy Shot and Reliv Now for Kids nutritional powder.
  </p>
        <p>
   Along with growing its customer base, international expansion is also a key item on the company's agenda. Reliv' has operations in Canada and Mexico, as well as a number of Pacific Rim countries. Because sales to distributors outside the US are made in the local currency, the company's income fluctuates based on currency changes.

        <p>
   Sales in the US, where the company generates most of its revenue, slipped 6% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Revenue remains negatively impacted by the decline in distributor activity spurred by uncertainty in the nation's economic recovery. Reliv's results were helped by its international operations, particularly a boost in sales in Europe. It didn't help Reliv's turnaround efforts that the company's number of active distributors slipped in 2011 vs. 2010. Net income decreased some 38% in 2011, as well, due to a dip in net sales and a decline in interest income from lower interest rates during the year.

        <p>
   Established in 1985, Reliv' International grew out of founder and CEO Robert Montgomery's belief that nutritional supplements enabled his quick recovery from brain surgery.
