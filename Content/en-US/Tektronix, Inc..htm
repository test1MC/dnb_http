   Tektronix measures up as a leader in the testing industry. The company, widely known as Tek, is one of the world's largest makers of test and measurement instruments, such as digital multimeters, logic analyzers, and signal generators. In particular, Tektronix is the world's largest maker of oscilloscopes (instruments used to check electrical and electronic equipment); it offers scopes in all shapes and sizes, from handheld units to large laboratory models. Tek, which is a subsidiary of
   <company id="10434">
    Danaher
   </company>
   , does business worldwide, serving clients in the communications, aerospace/defense, consumer electronics, education, and semiconductor industries, among others.

  <p>
   The company is part of Test &amp; Measurement segment of Danaher Corp. Tek offers network diagnostics and management solutions for fixed, mobile, IP, and converged multi-service networks. The company's products support a range of architectures and applications such as LTE, fixed mobile convergence, IMS, broadband wireless access, WiMAX, VoIP and triple play, including IPTV.

  <p>
   The company has sales offices and contacts worldwide; its regional headquarters are located in China, Japan, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   While traditional instrument markets, such as logic analyzers and oscilloscopes, stagnated in growth, Tek found new life in network management and diagnostics products, due to increasing numbers of computer and communications networks throughout the world. Video/audio signal analyzers are also a hot market, as video spreads beyond broadcast and cable channels to the Internet, mobile devices, and other electronics.

  <p>
   Following its acquisition by Danaher, Tek continued to acquire other firms to augment its primary product lines in targeted markets. In early 2014, Tektronix acquired Picosecond Pulse Labs, which offers products that include ultra-high-speed pattern generators, fast pulse generators, and high bandwidth sampler modules. The acquisition is to strengthen Tektronix in the growing market for test equipment to support 100G/400G optical data communications research and development.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tektronix bought TrueCall, a monitoring and diagnostic tool, from Newfield Wireless in 2013. TrueCall works on the radio access portion of a cellular network.

  <p>
   Tektronix was founded as Tekrad in 1946 by WWII veterans Melvin (Jack) Murdock, Glenn Leland, Miles Tippery, and Charles Howard Vollum. Their initial plan was to make, install, and repair electronic equipment. When another firm registered a name similar to Tekrad, they renamed their firm Tektronix, drawn from "technology" and "electronics." The vets set up in Portland, Oregon, where Howard Vollum had attended college.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company built its first oscilloscope out of electronic parts purchased from government surplus sales. When released in 1946, the device was superior to any oscilloscope on the market, and within two years the company was selling to major electronics firms, including
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , RCA, and
   <company id="107464">
    Bell Laboratories
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1950s Tektronix began developing "Tek culture," a casual workplace environment in which all employees communicated on a first-name basis. The company provided excellent benefits, encouraged the pursuit of individual interests, and kept rules to a minimum.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1963. By the end of that decade it controlled 75% of the world's oscilloscope market. Co-founder Jack Murdock, who served as chairman of the board from 1960 on, was killed in a floatplane crash on the Columbia River in 1971.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company created Tektronix Laboratories (Tek Labs) in 1972, providing basic research that would later form the basis for commercial products. The R&amp;D organization was shuttered in the 1990s, as it conducted too much research and not enough development, from the perspective of the executive suite.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tek's 1974 acquisition of the Grass Valley Group, a video special-effects electronic systems company, began to decrease its reliance on oscilloscopes. Tektronix passed the $1 billion sales mark in 1981, but fell behind its competition because of its slow transition from analog to digital technology. In the early 1980s earnings fell more than 40%, leading to layoffs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983 Tek set up its Circuit Board Division as a separate business, taking orders from external customers, as well as filling internal needs. The business was spun off as Merix (now
   <company id="53572">
    Viasystems
   </company>
   ), going public in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1985 Tektronix started making color printers. It also purchased CAE Systems, whose computer-aided engineering workstation later flopped; Tektronix sold the company to Mentor Graphics for $5 million in 1988, after losing about $200 million on CAE Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing another loss in 1990, Tektronix's board seized control. Turnaround specialist Jerome Meyer slashed jobs, sold off non-core businesses, and focused on new products, particularly test and measurement equipment, terminals, and printers. Financier George Soros, who bought 14% of the company in 1992, sold it off after Meyer ignored his appeals to cut up Tektronix.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 the company began broadening its video and networking business with the purchase of editing systems designer Lightworks Editing Systems. By 1996 Meyer had turned Tektronix around. In 1998, though, the company was forced to recall about 60,000 oscilloscopes because of a potential danger from misuse. With the Asian economic crisis hammering sales, and its video division diminishing in value, Tektronix in 1999 sold its Network Displays unit to competitor Network Computing Devices, sold Grass Valley Group to a private investor, and once more began cutting its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Restructuring and reduced equipment orders led to red ink for fiscal 1999. That year the company announced plans to divide its test and measurement and color printer divisions into separate publicly traded companies. In 2000, though, Tektronix sold its color printing and imaging division to
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   for $925 million. Meyer turned over the CEO duties of the smaller but more focused Tektronix to division president Rick Wills (who became chairman in 2001).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company edged back into the black for fiscal 2000, then garnered record sales and earnings in 2001 as high-tech markets soared and then sank. That year the company acquired a line of Bluetooth wireless testing devices from Motorola, Inc., and bought UK-based Adherent Systems, a maker of MPEG video test products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tektronix was acquired by Danaher in 2007. Even as part of Danaher, Tektronix has continued to buy companies to extend its capabilities into target markets.
