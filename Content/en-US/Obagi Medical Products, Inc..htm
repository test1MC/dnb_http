   Obagi Medical Products is dedicated to the body's largest organ. The company develops and sells topical, mainly prescription, skin care products designed to treat acne, discoloration, rosacea, sun damage, and wrinkles. Its leading Nu-Derm product line combines prescription and OTC drugs that, when applied, correct damage below the surface of the skin. It also makes vitamin C serums for the face and a generic version of acne drug Retin-A. Obagi, a subsidiary of

   , mainly sells its products to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and other physicians, who then dispense them to their patients.

        <p>
   In 2013 Valeant purchased Obagi Medical Products for about $418 million. The deal strengthens Valeant's position in the physician dispensed market and expands its presence with dermatologists and plastic surgeons.

        <p>
   While sales in the US market account for more than 80% of Obagi's annual revenues, the company operates in more than 40 countries and is working to increase its presence in international markets.

        <p>
   About 95% of Obagi's revenues come from its physician-dispensed products, with Nu-Derm accounting for more than half of annual sales. Other physician products include post-surgery skin enhancer Obagi Condition &amp; Enhance, as well as the ELASTIderm line, which helps restore elasticity and reduce discoloration (hyperpigmentation), and ELASTILash, works to give the appearance of thicker lashes. The company's smaller licensing segment brings in revenues through arrangements with international distributors who market Obagi's OTC products to drug stores and other retail channels.

        <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force in the US and markets products through distributors in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
  </p>
        <p>
   Obagi focuses much of its sales efforts directly at US physician offices, using a variety of methods (including telemarketing, periodical advertising, educational videos, and trade show presentations) to increase awareness of its products among health professionals. It also targets patients by placing brochures at medical practice locations and by conducting PR and social media campaigns.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company partners with about 20 overseas distribution firms who mirror its US sales and distribution model. In parts of the world where physician-dispensed skin care is underdeveloped (such as Japan), Obagi partners with distributors who sell to high-end drug and variety stores.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Obagi's product development strategy focuses on taking already
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved therapeutic agents, combining them with other agents and cosmetic ingredients, and using its technology to enable penetration of the agents into deeper layers of the skin. By incorporating already widely prescribed dermatology agents with proven efficacy, the company is able to side step the expensive and lengthy clinical development process.
  </p>
        <p>
   One newly developed product, Obagi Hydrate, was launched in 2012 to add a moisturizer that compliments the company's Nu-Derm offerings. Obagi also regularly expands its existing product lines; for instance, in 2012 it introduced the ELASTIderm Eye Complete complex serum and the CLENZIderm M.D. normal to oily system.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also regularly seeks to add new physician relationships and distribution partners, while strengthening relations with existing customers.
