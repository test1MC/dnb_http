   Bridgestone is one rolling stone that gathers no moss. Vying with
   <company id="41240">
    Michelin
   </company>
   to be the world's largest tire maker, Bridgestone makes tires for a variety of vehicle types. In addition to passenger and commercial vehicle tires, the company makes tires for construction and mining vehicles, agricultural machinery, and aircraft. It also manufactures a range of non-tire products, including consumer products like golf balls and bicycles, polyurethane foam for industrial applications, and adhesive film for the solar industry. Bridgestone operates some 180 manufacturing plants in 25 countries and sells its products worldwide.

   Bridgestone is looking to its diversified products business segment to fuel its long-term growth. It is investing in the research and development of eco-friendly products, such as adhesive films for solar cells, which hold promise for growth as the renewable energy sector expands. The company is also rolling out an eco-friendly tire as well, the ECOPIA, which it markets in China, India, and other countries. In addition, it continues to manufacture peripheral consumer products for Japan and elsewhere, such as Bridgestone-branded golf balls and clubs, as well as bicycles and related accessories.

   In late 2015 the company announced it was buying US auto parts chain
   <company id="11472">
    Pep Boys
   </company>
   for about $835 million. The move will expand Bridgestone's US auto care and tire store retail operations by a third.

  <p>
   In 2014 Bridgestone acquired Masthead Industries, a maker of hose products and services with 34 locations located throughout the US and one in Mexico. The deal allowed Bridgestone to gain access to a wider range of customers while also offering support through specialized services.

   In 1906 Shojiro Ishibashi and his brother Tokujiro assumed control of the family's clothing business. They focused on making

   traditional Japanese footwear, and in 1923 began working with rubber for soles. In 1931 Shojiro formed Bridgestone (Ishibashi means "stone bridge" in Japanese) to make tires, and during that decade the company began producing auto tires, airplane tires, and golf balls. Bridgestone followed the Japanese military to occupied territories, where it built plants. The company's headquarters moved to Tokyo in 1937.

  <p>
   Although Bridgestone lost all of its overseas factories during WWII, its Japanese plants escaped damage. The company began making bicycles in 1946 and signed a technical assistance pact with Goodyear five years later, enabling Bridgestone to import badly needed technology. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bridgestone started making nylon tires and radials and again set up facilities overseas, mostly elsewhere in Asia. The company benefited from the rapid growth in Japanese auto sales in the 1970s. Shojiro died at age 87 in 1976.
