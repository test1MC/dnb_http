  <p>
   In 2007 the company sought to buy 17 packaged gas facilities from Airgas, which had just bought a large portion of
   <company id="91155">
    Linde
   </company>
   's US packaged gas operations and decided to sell those locations in the Carolinas and parts of Virginia and Georgia to National Welders. The facilities generated about $50 million in sales. Airgas decided it made more sense to take full control of National Welders and did so through a share exchange.
  </p>
  <p>
   Airgas National Welders (as National Welders Supply Company) was founded in 1941 by James A. Turner. It operated as a joint-venture between the Turner family and from 1996 until 2007.
