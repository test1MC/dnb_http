   Cephas Holding (formerly Legend Mobile) would like you to see its face when you pick up the phone. The company designs and markets accessories for wireless phones such as personalized faceplate covers. It also offers text-messaging services and mobile software. Several of Cephas' products feature branded themes representing such organizations as

    NASCAR
   </company>
   . The company's 50%-owned Legend Credit unit markets promotional stored-value gift cards. Neither of the company's business lines has generated significant revenue, however, and its auditor has questioned the financial viability of the company. CEO Peter Klamka controls a majority of voting stock of Cephas, which changed its name from Legend Mobile in 2009.

   Peter Klamka and brothers Chris and Michael Giordano started Interactive Entertainment Studio in 1997. It was not Klamka's first business: In 1994, while in his mid-20s, he created the Wilson Fragrance College Collection, a line of colognes each designed to capture the essence of a particular US university (at $24 for a two-ounce bottle, the venture was successful).

   Interactive Entertainment signed its first agreement with model Niki Taylor in 1997, followed by a contract with Victoria's Secret and

   swimsuit model Tyra Banks (Banks sued PTN Media the following year over a contract dispute; the case is still in court). The company also changed its name to PTN Media in 1998, launched its first Web site (Fashion House with Niki Taylor), and reached an agreement with Claudia Schiffer to run her Web site as well.

   PTN Media went public in 1999. It ended its contract with Taylor and struck a new deal with model Estella Warren that year to feature her on a series of electronic calendars. It also launched a new Web site, fashionwindow.com, a fashion and beauty portal. The following year PTN Media launched claudiaschiffer.com and FragranceDirect.com, a perfume retail Web site. Also in 2000, model Daisy Fuentes was tapped to host the company's syndicated radio program
