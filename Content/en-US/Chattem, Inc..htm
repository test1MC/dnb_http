   If it's a well known cream, oil, paste, pill, or powder it's likely that Chattem owns that brand name. The
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   subsidiary markets some two dozen over-the-counter branded personal care products and dietary supplements, including skin care and pain treatments such as Aspercreme, Cortizone-10, Icy Hot muscle pain reliever, and Pamprin menstrual symptom reliever. The company also makes the Unisom sleep aid, medicated powder Gold Bond, Bullfrog sunscreen, Mudd clay-based facial masks, and Selsun Blue dandruff shampoo. Chattem sells its products to wholesalers and retail merchandisers. The company was formed in 1879 as the Chattanooga Medicine Company.

   Chattem products are focused on niche markets neglected by larger consumer product and pharmaceutical companies. Primary brands include Allegra OTC, Gold Bond, Icy Hot, Cortizone-10, Selsun Blue, and Unisom.

  <p>
   As part of the French drug-making giant
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi
   </company>
   , Chattem has access to markets around the world, especially emerging markets. Chattem has become the main consumer health unit for the French company in the US, where Sanofi had lacked a strong direct presence in the OTC market. Chattem also provides a platform for converting prescription medications into OTC products, such as Sanofi's popular Allegra allergy drug.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pre-acquisition, almost all of Chattem's sales (about 95%) came from inside the US, but it sold some product lines in Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Being owned by Sanofi helps the company with its effort to increase marketing in international markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the UK.

  <p>
   Chattem began as the Chattanooga Medicine Company in 1879, when salesmen peddled Black Draught laxative from horse-drawn carriages. (Adolph Ochs, who would later become the famed publisher of The New York Times, led the company in the late 1880s.) By the mid-1950s the firm adopted its current name and was making more than 20 consumer products and specialty chemicals. It went public in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales and income rose dramatically from 1989 to 1992 as Chattem kept buying undermarketed consumer brands and expanding sales of its existing ones. Chattem stumbled in 1993, mostly from flat sales and the loss of Warner-Lambert's Rolaids business. It borrowed heavily to finance a one-time dividend. Chattem intensified its strategy in 1994, buying such new brands as pHisoderm (skin cleanser) and Benzodent (dental analgesic) and selling products that lacked growth potential, such as Black Draught.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid 1990's, the company began to boost its number of niche leaders, acquiring dietary supplement company Sunsource International (maker of Garlique and Melatonex), and product lines Gold Bond, the Herpecin-L line of medicated lip products, Dexatrim, Aspercreme, and Selsun Blue.
