   The Amalgamated Sugar Company, with roots reaching back to 1915, turns beets into sweets. It's the second-largest US sugar producer, processing sugar beets grown on about 180,000 acres in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The company manufactures granulated, coarse, powdered, and brown consumer sugar products marketed under the brand White Satin. It also makes products for retail grocery chains under private labels. The sugar company produces beet pulp, molasses, and other beet by-products for use by food and animal-feed manufacturers. Since 1997 Amalgamated Sugar has been owned by the Snake River Sugar Company, a cooperative that comprises sugar beet growers in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

        <p>
   The Idaho-based company's sugar beets, which are grown in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, are processed through the three sugar processing facilities it operates in Idaho. The Amalgamated Sugar Company's warehouses and bulk transfer stations are strategically located from the Midwest to the West Coast.

        <p>
   The Amalgamated Sugar Company processes up to 1.6 billion pounds of sugar each year. Along with processing the cooperative's crops, the company provides its owner-farmers with agronomy advice and services, runs workshops and seminars, operates a co-op store, and sells used equipment.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's key management team is employed on a contract basis. A seven-member Management Committee oversees the management team. The committee comprises members of the cooperative's board of directors.

   The industry's return to the use of real sugar in soft drinks and other beverages has become a boon for The Amalgamated Sugar Company. To this end,
   <company id="60877">
    Pepsi Bottling Ventures
   </company>
   has tapped the sugar beet processor to supply the bottler with granulated sugar. During the past few decades, more beverage makers have moved to using lesser-expensive high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to sweeten their beverages as a way to cut costs and boost profits, but the shift spurred by consumers to return to sugar-sweetened drinks has become profitable for sugar processors the likes of The Amalgamated Sugar Company.

        <p>
   The Amalgamated Sugar Company markets its sugar primarily in the nation's North Central, Intermountain, and Northwest regions. The company competes with not only cane sugar refiners, but also manufacturers of other forms of sweeteners, such as regular and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and non-nutritive, high intensity sweeteners the likes of aspartame.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The Amalgamated Sugar Company generates some 90% of its annual sales through the sale of refined sugar. The balance of its revenue comes from animal feed derived from beet pulp and molasses and other by-products as a result of sugar beet processing.
