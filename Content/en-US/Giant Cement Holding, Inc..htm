   Giant Cement Holding thinks big. The group and its subsidiaries make up the fourth-largest cement producer on the east coast of the US. It produces a variety of cements (including grey, white, special, and fast-setting cements) and aggregates through Giant Cement Company in South Carolina, Keystone Cement in Pennsylvania, and Dragon Products Company in Maine. Its products are used in the construction of buildings, bridges, and highways. The group's Giant Resource Recovery (also called Grr!) unit processes industrial waste for use as fuel in the company's cement kilns. Coastal Cement, an affiliate of Dragon Products, maintains two deep-water shipping terminals in New England. Elementia took a 55% stake of Giant Cement in 2016.

   As of early 2016, Giant Cement Holdings had three cement plants, nine ready-mix concrete plants, and two aggregate plants. Its Grr! unit had six recycling plants, which converted waste into fuel. Giant's cement products include grey cement, white cement, special cement, and fast-setting cement. It also quarries and sells aggregates.
