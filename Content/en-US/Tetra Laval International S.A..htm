   Tetra Laval continues to pursue a course for each of its subsidiaries that includes coordination, acquisition, technology, and geographic growth. The company hopes to improve each of the subsidiary's value chains, not just their manufacturing, by homogenizing the operations within its subsidiaries to coordinate with each other as part of a larger operational process. Tetra Laval has encouraged these changes as a response to larger competitors in the market, resulting from recent industry consolidation.

   Along with R&amp;D, the company has strengthened its global presence through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it obtained Switzerland-based Miteco, a provider of production systems used to make soft drinks, fruit juices, and liquid food, with a particular strength in carbonated soft drinks. The acquisition strengthened its production capabilities for carbonated soft drinks.
