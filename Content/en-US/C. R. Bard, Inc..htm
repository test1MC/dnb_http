   C. R. Bard has been in the medical device business for more than a century -- it introduced the Foley urological catheter (still one of its top sellers) in 1934. Its products fall into four general therapeutic categories: vascular, oncology, urology, and surgical specialties. Among other things, the company makes stents, catheters, and guidewires used in angioplasties and other vascular procedures; catheters for delivering chemotherapy treatments; and urology catheters and products used to treat urinary incontinence. Its line of specialty surgical tools, made by subsidiary
   <company id="126923">
    Davol
   </company>
   , includes devices used in laparoscopic and orthopedic procedures and for hernia repair.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates through a single segment focusing on the manufacture and sale of medical devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of Bard's more than 8,000 products are one-time-use items and are primarily disposable or implantable. The majority of the company's product sales come from its vascular, oncology, and urology divisions, each accounting for between 25% and 30% of sales. For many years urology products made up the largest product segment; however, the vascular and oncology segments now outsell urology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The vascular product division makes angioplasty catheters, peripheral vascular stents, and biopsy devices. In addition to catheters used in vascular procedures, Bard's oncology product division makes catheters and ports used to deliver chemotherapy in cancer patients. The company holds a leading market position with its specialty oncology vascular access products. Its oncology segment also includes ultrasound devices and enteral feeding tubes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with its core line of Foley catheters, the urology product division includes sales of surgical slings used to treat incontinence, brachytherapy (radioactive) seeds for prostate cancer treatment, and urine monitoring and collection systems. Bard's urology catheter portfolio includes an infection-control catheter (the Bardex IC) that uses a silver coating technology to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="126923">
    Davol's
   </company>
   surgical specialty products division includes medical instruments, implants, and other supplies including hernia repair patches, grafting tissue, and fixation devices. It also makes hemostat products that stop bleeding during surgery along with suction and irrigation equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   While the US accounts for more than two-thirds of sales, Bard sells its products in more than 100 countries (primarily in the Americas, Europe, and Asia) through numerous subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliated representatives. Its largest non-US markets are Europe, China, and Japan. Bard has manufacturing facilities in the US (including Puerto Rico) and Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has international plants or office locations in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK.

  <p>
   Bard markets its products directly in the US market, as well as through distributors and supply companies in the US and international markets. (Its five largest distributors together account for around 60% of distributors' sales.) Customers include hospitals, doctors' offices, and extended-care, alternate site, and other health care facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses were about $4.8 million in 2015, up from some $4.4 million in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Bard has seen steady revenue growth over the past few years. In 2015 revenues increased by 3% to $3.4 billion, due to a rise in revenues across all product lines, mainly from Vascular products (up 5% thanks to higher sales of PTA balloon catheters and biopsy products) offset by a decrease in sales from its peripheral vascular grafts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surgical Specialties' sales increased by 3% resulting from growth in sales of synthetic and natural tissue hernia repair products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rest of the divisions also grew through organic revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the growth in revenue, Bard's net income has fallen in the past couple of years. It decreased 54% in 2015 due to a rise in operating expenses from litigation expenses, followed by marketing, selling, and administrative expenses resulting from continued targeted investment spending in marketing and selling in emerging markets. The decrease was offset by higher revenues and lower research and development expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations, which has fluctuated over the past five years, increased 21% to $798 million in 2015, largely due to lower tax payments that year, as well as proceeds received from rival medical device maker Gore.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Seeking to provide a diverse and cutting-edge line of offerings, Bard regularly conducts research and development and acquisition activities in all segments of its business, with the goal of providing products that produce superior clinical outcomes, serve a broader customer base, and drive growth in underserved markets, especially those in growth areas in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Bard entered into an agreement with Boston Scientific Corporation for distribution of Bard's recently approved Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon for patients suffering from peripheral artery disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company registered 192 new products internationally. That year it also launched Xenmatrix, the first antibacterial-coated biological mesh; a DigniShield stool management system with medication delivery capabilities; the Site-Rite Vision  II ultrasound system with integrated tip tracking and tip confirmation for PICCs; new cooling pad configurations for our Arctic Sun  targeted temperature management system for use with neonates and pediatric patients; new sizes of our Fluency Plus endovascular stent graft; the LifeStream balloon expandable vascular covered stent; and the SureStep Foley tray system.

  <p>
   In 2015, Bard acquired Irish firm Embo Medical Limited, which specializes in developing peripheral embolization devices, for $21 million. It also purchased Florida-based Vascular Pathways, which makes vascular access devices, for $81.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year, the company acquired Florida-based
   <company id="180541">
    Liberator Medical Holdings
   </company>
   for $181 million. Liberator distributes urological catheters, ostomy supplies, mastectomy attire, and diabetic supplies; that deal boosted Bard's position in the US home health care market.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   When visiting Europe at the turn of the century, silk importer Charles Russell Bard discovered that gomenol, a mixture of olive oil with a eucalyptus extract, offered him relief from urinary problems caused by tuberculosis. He brought gomenol to America and began distributing it.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1907 C. R. Bard began selling a ureteral catheter developed by French firm J. Eynard. The company incorporated in 1923 with its present name. When Charles Bard's health declined in 1926, he sold the business to John Willits and Edson Outwin (his sales manager and accountant, respectively).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1934 Bard became the sole agent for Davol Rubber's new Foley catheter, which helped the company achieve $1 million in sales by 1948. During the 1950s, sales increased more than 400% when the firm introduced its first pre-sterilized packaged product and expanded its product line to include disposable drainage tubes and an intravenous feeding device.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bard went public in 1963. During the 1960s the firm expanded both vertically, boosting its manufacturing capabilities (it began making its own plastic tubing), and through acquisitions. It also established joint ventures with Davol to manufacture and distribute hospital and surgical supplies internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company diversified into the cardiovascular, respiratory therapy, home care products, and kidney dialysis fields in the 1970s and manufactured the first angioplasty catheter, a nonsurgical device to clear blocked arteries, in 1979.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 Bard watched its urological business go limp. In response, the company began a buying spree to gain market share in a consolidating hospital products industry. It swallowed up around a dozen companies, including Davol (maker of its best-selling Foley catheter), garnering such products as catheters and other products for angioplasty, diagnostics, and urinary incontinence. In 1988 it faced increasing competition in the coronary catheter market from such giants as Eli Lilly and Pfizer. Bard struck back with innovative products, but it was too little too late -- even though the company continued to struggle for 10 more years, it finally pulled out of the cardiovascular market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bard agreed in 1993 to pay a then-record $61 million for mislabeling and improperly testing angioplasty catheters blamed for the deaths of two people (and later taken off the market). However, a year later Bard's sales topped $1 billion for the first time, and it purchased catheter-related companies in Canada, France, and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Purchases in 1995 and 1996 included medical device manufacturers MedChem Products and the Cardiac Assist Division of St. Jude Medical. In 1996 Bard bought a majority stake in Italy-based X-Trode and acquired IMPRA, a leading supplier of vascular grafts (its largest deal ever). That year the ongoing catheter litigation snared three former Bard executives, who received 18-month prison sentences for conspiring to hide potentially fatal flaws in the products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Bard reorganized along disease-state management lines. Over the next two years, it sold its cardiovascular line after deciding it was going to cost too much time and money to re-establish dominance in that field. Bard built its other fields through purchases, including ProSeed (radiation seed therapy, 1998) and Dymax (ultrasound catheter guidance systems, 1999). The next year Bard partnered with medical device distributor Owens &amp; Minor to launch an online purchasing site.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the new century, Bard continued to make acquisitions to expand its product lines and its technology base. In 2000 it obtained the Kugel Patch product line with the acquisition of Surgical Sense. In 2003 and 2004 it made several purchases, including a brachytherapy seeds business, a biopsy device, and several hernia repair products. And it acquired some assets of GENYX Medical in 2005, including products for treating female urinary incontinence.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added the StatLock line of catheter stabilization products to the urology division with the 2006 acquisition of
   <company id="138417">
    Venetec International
   </company>
   . In 2007 the company introduced a breathing tube (the Agento IC) using a silver coating technology to reduce the risk of infection. Bard also launched the Dorado angioplasty catheter that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bard bought the LifeStent line of peripheral vascular stents from
   <company id="100589">
    Edwards Lifesciences
   </company>
   to expand the vascular division in 2008. The same year, Bard acquired
   <company id="47007">
    Specialized Health Products International
   </company>
   , which already supplied subsidiary
   <company id="114953">
    Bard Access Systems
   </company>
   with infusion sets for its vascular access lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2008 the company's urology division launched its Dignicare fecal incontinence line of products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company launched a new breast biopsy sample tool, the Finesse, which can take multiple samples at one time. To further expand the unit, in 2009 it purchased Y-Med, maker of the VascuTrack specialty angioplasty catheters, for $35 million. In 2010 Bard purchased breast cancer device manufacturer
   <company id="150372">
    SenoRx
   </company>
   for about $200 million. The purchase added products including Contura, a brachytherapy catheter that delivers radiation to eliminate cancerous tumors and EnCor, which lets physicians collect multiple breast biopsy samples with a single probe insertion. SenoRx was integrated into the Bard Biopsy Systems division.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bard expanded its smallest segment, the surgical specialty products division by acquiring Brennen Medical's hernia products business for $17 million (2009). The purchase added xenografting devices (XenMatrix) to Bard's line of hernia repair items, which also includes hernia patches and plugs. To widen the segment's product offerings, Bard also launched a new laparoscopic device (the SorbaFix) that year, and it acquired rights to the Allomax breast reconstruction patch. In 2010 the SorbaFix technology was extended to a new PermaFix permanent anchor fixation device.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bard expanded its surgical specialties division in 2012 with the $134 million purchase of Neomend, which develops and sells surgical sealant products.
