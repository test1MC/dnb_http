  <p>
   Falcon Pharmaceuticals was formed by eye care products company
   <company id="89515">
    Alcon
   </company>
   in 1994 to develop and market generic versions of Alcon and other drugmakers' products. Alcon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis in 2011. Following the transaction, Novartis began to transition the Falcon operations under the Sandoz organization, leaving Alcon to focus on branded product offerings.
