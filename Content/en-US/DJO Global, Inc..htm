   DJO Global makes orthopedic devices that may be music to your joints. One of the world's largest orthopedic medical device makers, the company develops and manufactures products that are used in rehabilitation, pain management, and physical therapy. They range from ankle braces and traction systems to electrotherapy and bone growth stimulation devices. DJO Global also makes and distributes surgically implanted joint replacement products for the knees, hips, and shoulders. Its products are sold globally under a host of market-leading brands, including Aircast, Compex, DonJoy, Empi, and ProCare. The company is primarily owned by affiliates of private equity giant

  <p>
   DJO Global markets its products directly and through dealers and distributors mainly in the US (75% of sales), although it does operate in Europe and other areas.

  <p>
   With lean, low-cost manufacturing capabilities, its largest facility in Mexico primarily serves the US market, DJO Global's biggest money maker geographically. Additional US manufacturing facilities are based in California (rigid knee braces and bone stimulation products), South Dakota (home electrotherapy devices), and Texas (surgical implants). Meanwhile, an overseas facility in Tunisia makes products for certain European markets.

  <p>
   DJO Global focuses on offering a diverse and comprehensive set of rehabilitation and regenerative products that are marketed to and used by orthopedic specialists, pain management specialists, physical therapists, podiatrists, primary care physicians, chiropractors, and athletic trainers to treat patients suffering from degenerative diseases, deformities, trauma, and sports-related injuries. Some of its non-surgical devices are used by athletes for injury prevention and at-home physical therapy treatment. Due to the scale of its business, DJO Global regularly contracts with managed care companies and group purchasing organizations to provide orthopedic rehabilitation products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its growth is driven by internal development of new products and product enhancements, as well as acquisitions of select businesses or complementary products. Product R&amp;D is largely geared towards non-surgical devices, a trend within the industry to offer patients less invasive alternatives.

  <p>
   In 2011 the company acquired Elastic Therapy, a North Carolina-based provider of medical compression therapy products such as anti-embolism and surgical weight stockings, compression socks, and other items meant to help treat and prevent venous disorders of the legs. The purchase gave DJO Global an extensive line of private label products that are distributed throughout the US and internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having developed an appetite for local businesses, that same year the firm purchased Wisconsin-based Rikco International, which does business as Dr. Comfort, a major provider of diabetic footwear to podiatrists, orthotic centers, pharmacies, and home equipment suppliers. The $255 million acquisition expanded DJO Global's position in the diabetes care market.

  <p>
   In 2011 DJO Global changed its name from DJO Incorporated to reflect its expanded international presence and streamlined organization.
