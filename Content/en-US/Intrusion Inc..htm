  <p>
   sWard Paxton and Joe Head, both veterans of Honeywell's optoelectronics division, formed Optical Data Systems in 1983 to make modems, multiplexers, and fiber-optic data links. The company introduced a non-modular hub for Ethernet applications in 1987 and two years later initiated a program to add token ring and fiber-distributed data interface products. Optical Data went public in 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
   It expanded its products in 1993, partnering with FORE Systems (bought by General Electric Company, now Marconi plc) for ATM switches and with Cisco for high-end routers. The next year Optical Data installed the world's largest ATM backbone, for the US Army.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded into Asia and Latin America in 1995. In 1996 Optical Data began redirecting its operations away from hubs and introduced the InfiniteSwitch. The next year it changed its name to ODS Networks and took a loss due to the sputtering start of its switching equipment line. ODS slashed 30% of its workforce in 1998 and consolidated operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   ODS began offering stand-alone network security appliances in 1999 and in early 2000 formed subsidiary Intrusion.com to pursue opportunities in network security. It also discontinued its non-security business lines. That summer ODS changed its name to Intrusion.com. Tim Kinnear, head of the subsidiary, was named CEO of the renamed company; Paxton remains chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intrusion.com acquired intrusion detection software specialist MimeStar in 2000. In 2001 the company formed a joint venture with Shanghai Video and Audio Electronics to manufacture and sell Intrusion.com's security products in China. Later that year the company dropped the dot-com from its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intrusion signed a worldwide distribution deal with Ingram Micro in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company raised $5 million in a private placement in 2004; another $2.7 million was raised in a private placement in early 2005.
