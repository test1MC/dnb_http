   Buying the company from J.T. Walker Industries in 2013, MI's management team, with the support of Pete DeSoto and ShoreView Industries, implemented a transition plan though which Pete DeSoto became Chairman of the reorganized entity while Matt DeSoto became president and CEO.

  <p>
   Products made by MI are sold to distributors, architects, professional builders, and homeowners. In the professional builder category, MI markets its products to both new home builders and, to a growing degree, remodelers. Remodelers use MI's replacement windows and doors on older homes that are often energy deficient and need upgrading to meet increasingly stringent building code mandates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products and services through distributors, dealers, and online. Kansas City Building Supply supplies MI products to Summit Custom Homes. International distributors are located in Canada (Burron Lumber) and Republic of Korea (Youngwoo Company).

  <p>
   MI saw demand for its products drop due to the housing industry's nationwide slump. The company was forced to shutter at least one production center in order to adjust to lower demand, but demand has bounced back in the last few years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 MI launched a new energy efficient window line, the HomeMaker3 Series. It also launched two vinyl replacement window lines in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2008 MI has worked with business partners like Kansas City Building Supply and Summit Custom Homes to dominate the market in the Kansas City area.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company's Southern Division began making 1500 and 1600 Series vinyl replacement windows in Carrollton, Texas.

   In 2008 the company boosted its business geographically with the purchase of
   <company id="43943">
    CertainTeed
   </company>
   's vinyl extrusion manufacturing operations in the eastern half of the US. Ply Gem Industries kept the western half of CertainTeed's vinyl window and patio door business. As part of the transaction, MI entered into a 10-year agreement that allows the company to license the CertainTeed brand for windows and patio doors in the eastern US and eastern Canada.

   J. T. Walker and Robert Word established the company making screens in the back of a Florida airplane hangar in 1947.
