  <p>
   Kennametal reports through two segments, Industrial and Infrastructure. Kennametal's Industrial segment, 60% of sales, serves the aerospace, defense, transportation, and general engineering sectors by focusing on products needed for the manufacturing of engines, airframes, cars, trucks, ships, and other industrial goods.
  </p>
  <p>
   A diverse range of products and customization services create valuable synergies for the segment's customers. Kennametal's Infrastructure segment (40% of sales) addresses the needs of energy and earthworks companies who serve such sectors as oil and gas, power generation, food and beverages, highway construction, and road maintenance.

  <p>
   Kennametal operates facilities in the US, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, and South Africa. The US accounts for 43% of total sales; Germany is its second largest market, representing 16%.

   Kennametal sells its products through sales channels, a direct sales force, and a network of independent distributors and sales agents in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific and other regions around the world. It also utilizes integrated supply channels and the internet. It maintains the two premium brands of Kennametal and WIDIA.

  <p>
   Kennametal's revenues have declined over the years. From 2015 to 2016, revenues fell 21% from $2.7 billion to $2.1 billion. The company also posted net losses of $374 million in 2015 and $226 million in 2016. Its operating cash flow has also fluctuated; after rising sharply in 2015, cash flow dropped by $132 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue dip for 2016 was due to organic sales declines and the impacts of divestitures and unfavorable currency exchanges. This was fueled by an organic Infrastructure decline of 30%, coupled with decreases across the markets of earthworks (15%), energy (28%), transportation (4%), and general engineering (11%), while aerospace and defense sales remained flat.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kennametal's recent net losses have been the result of rising restructuring and asset impairment charges and operating expenses over the years as the company deals with lower customer demand within the oil and gas markets. The company recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of about $143 million in 2016 compared to $582 million the previous year.

  <p>
   The company in 2015 experienced an abrupt change in customer demand within the oil and gas markets. It expects lower demand within these markets to continue at least through the first half of fiscal year 2016, coupled with a persistent decline in the earthworks markets. This resulted in significantly lower demand for its products within these sectors across all major geographic regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to the impact of the decline in demand for these end markets, Kennametal has implemented restructuring and other actions, which include consolidating operations, reducing administrative overhead, leveraging the supply chain, rationalizing certain manufacturing facilities, and implementing enterprise-wide and employment-related cost reduction programs. (As a result, these programs significantly ate into its profits for 2015 and contributed to its most recent net loss.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Rather than evaluating potential acquisitions in the near term, Kennametal expects to continue to grow its business and further enhance its market position through investment opportunities that exist within its core businesses.

  <p>
   In 1832 Irish immigrant and copper-smith Robert McKenna came to Pittsburgh and opened a copper works. His three sons took over the business after he died in 1852. In 1900 Robert's grandson, A. G. McKenna, developed a revolutionary cutting tool made of steel and tungsten (and, later, of vanadium). The family set up Vanadium Alloys Steel Co. in 1910.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1938 Philip McKenna, A. G.'s son, formed a new business called Kennametal, based on a tungsten-titanium carbide alloy for cutting tools. The family incorporated the company as Kennametal in 1943. WWII and the Korean War brought strong US military demand for the company's products. Kennametal expanded overseas during the 1960s and 1970s and went public in 1977.
