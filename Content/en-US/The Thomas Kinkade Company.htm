   Thomas Kinkade's light-infused landscapes are big business. As the sole licenser of Kinkade's paintings, The Thomas Kinkade Company oversees the reproduction and sale of photolithographs, collectibles, and decorative accessories inspired by the works of Kinkade. His name adorns items as diverse as books and furniture and the company boasts partnerships with more than 70 licensees. Paintings and other products are sold in limited and open editions through about 4,000 retailers, 280 licensed Signature Galleries, and 400 Showcase Galleries. The company also operates three company-owned stores and peddles its products online. The Thomas Kinkade Company merged with Media Arts Group in 2004.

  <p>
   Thomas Kinkade and Ken Raasch founded Media Arts Group in 1990. Three years later the company opened Thomas Kinkade Stores to sell Kinkade's art. Also in 1993 it acquired John Hine Ltd., broadening its product range to David Winter's sculptures. Media Arts went public in 1994 and the next year began licensing Kinkade images to Hallmark Cards. In 1996 it began licensing independent retailers to sell Kinkade products in Signature Galleries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Media Arts signed a licensing deal with Kinkade for 150 paintings over the next 15 years. The following year it opened over 100 new galleries and announced licensing deals with

   Publishers (gift books), and

   (home accents, including rugs, sheets, and pillows). In 1998 the company's listing moved from Nasdaq to the NYSE. The next year Media Arts opened its first gallery overseas in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Media Arts launched a Web site and Kinkade tendered an offer to buy the rest of the company he didn't already own. The company also signed contemporary expressionist Howard Behrens and two other artists to diversify its product offering. In 2001 director Tony Thomopoulos was appointed chairman and interim CEO after Craig Fleming resigned from those positions. Also that year Kinkade withdrew his offer to buy the rest of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The economic downturn convinced Media Arts to once again focus its resources exclusively on the Thomas Kinkade brand, and in December 2001 the company made the strategic decision to discontinue the sales, distribution, and marketing of art products of the three artists that the company represented other than Thomas Kinkade. In early 2002 Ron Ford was named as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2002 Ford was fired (no public explanation given), and chairman Anthony Thomopoulous was named CEO. In January 2004 The Thomas Kinkade Company merged with Media Arts Group, taking The Thomas Kinkade Company name.
