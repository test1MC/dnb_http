   Genomic Health believes the genome is key to good health. The company conducts genomic research to develop molecular diagnostics and assays that can predict the likelihood of disease recurrence and response to therapy and treatments. Genomic Health's Onco
   <em>
    type
   </em>
   DX breast cancer test predicts the likelihood of chemotherapy effectiveness and cancer recurrence in women with newly diagnosed, early stage invasive breast cancer. Genomic Health's research efforts are targeted at providing a wider base of cancer-related tests, and in 2010 it launched a new Onco
   <em>
    type
   </em>
   DX colon cancer test to predict recurrence rates for stage II colon cancer patients. The company generates more than 85% of sales in the US.

   Although most of its sales come from the US, Genomic Health is widening its distribution network into international markets by establishing partnerships with regional drug representatives. International sales, which have been rising steadily, accounted for 15% of revenue in 2013. The company is focused on the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and has a European headquarters in Geneva.

  <p>
   Genomic Health uses a direct sales force to market its products in the US; internationally, it operates through a network of nearly 20 distributors covering some 90 countries. The company relies heavily on reimbursements from health plans and managed care companies to pay for its products and services, and as such, is dependent on insurance companies' reimbursement approvals of its products. Its largest customer is
   <company id="103380">
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
   </company>
   (CMS), which accounts for more than 20% of sales.

   Genomic Health has a solid history of revenue growth and 2013 was no exception. Revenue rose 11%, from $235 million to $262 million, due to increased volume of test purchases. Net income of $8.2 million became a $12.7 million net loss, however, as R&amp;D, tissue processing, and sales and marketing costs increased. Cash from operations also dropped, by $17 million to $8 million, due to increased cash used in accounts receivable.

  <p>
   In early 2012 the company created a new subsidiary focused on commercializing human genome applications. Now that DNA sequencing has grown faster and cheaper, the new subsidiary's commercial efforts will emphasize the clinical use of bioinformatics for diagnosing and making treatment plans for both common and rare genetic conditions. Genomic Health intends to invest up to $20 million into the subsidiary, which will draw upon its internal research and development efforts as well as that of third parties.

   The company is working to apply its breast cancer product to late-stage breast cancer patients, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of other treatment methods besides chemotherapy. It also plans to expand the patient applications for its colon cancer test, and it is developing additional tests for lung, renal cell cancer, and melanoma patients. In 2013 Genomic launched its Oncotype DX test for prostate cancer.

   Research partnerships also play an important role in Genomic Health's strategy. Major partnerships include an agreement with
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   and
   <company id="15468">
    ImClone Systems
   </company>
   to develop a test evaluating the effectiveness of the companies' Erbitux colorectal treatment and an affiliation with
   <company id="139873">
    Sanofi-Aventis
   </company>
   to predict the likelihood of benefit for Aventis' Taxotere breast cancer treatment. In 2012 it entered into a strategic alliance with
   <company id="162810">
    OncoMed Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   that calls for OncoMed to provide tumor samples to Genomic Health so that its Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology can be used in OncoMed's clinical development of novel anti-cancer stem cell therapeutics.
