  </p>
  <p>
   Among Lite-On's many LED products, photo-couplers occupy a 14% market share globally.

  <p>
   Lite-On's revenue increased 8% from 2013 to 2014. However, its net income decreased 26% during that same time period due to higher operating costs and selling and marketing expenses in addition to a spike in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue growth for 2014 was fueled by a 30% spike from optoelectronic products due to a surge in market demand for lighting, consumer, and portable devices. It was also driven by higher global demand for energy-saving devices and successful deliveries to Taiwanese and US customers. Lite-On's revenue from server management systems also rose to a record-high in 2014 due to an increase in demand for cloud application server power management systems and portable devices.
