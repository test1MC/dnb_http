   Alexion Pharmaceuticals can't suppress its enthusiasm for treating immune functions gone awry. The firm develops drugs that inhibit certain immune system functions that cause rare hematology, nephrology, neurology, inflammatory, and metabolic disorders. Its first marketed antibody product, Soliris, is used to treat two rare genetic blood disorders -- paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Soliris is also being tested as a treatment for other conditions. The firm's newer products include enzyme replacement therapies Strensiq (the first approved treatment for hypophosphatasia, or HPP, in children) and Kanuma (a treatment for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, or LAL-D).
  </p>

  <p>
   Soliris, which still accounts for virtually all of the company's revenue, is the first and only drug approved for the treatment of PNH, a rare disorder in which the death of red blood cells can bring on conditions including blood clotting and organ damage. Strensiq and Kanuma were first launched in late 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexion has a pipeline of clinical-stage products targeting ultra-rare autoimmune diseases, kidney and other organ failure, and metabolic disorders.

  <p>
   Alexion has manufacturing facilities in Georgia and Rhode Island where it makes a portion of its supply of biopharmaceuticals; it also relies on contract manufacturers (primarily
   <company id="99236">
    Lonza
   </company>
   ) to make some of its Soliris supply. The company has service, administration, and research facilities in the US (Massachusetts and Connecticut), supply chain and quality operations in Dublin, and sales offices in Switzerland.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has international headquarters in Latin America, Japan, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soliris is approved in about 50 countries for the treatment of PHN; it is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of aHUS.

  <p>
   Alexion markets its products through a specialized direct sales force, who target customers including hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, and other health care facilities. The company also sells to distributors and hospital buying groups.

  <p>
   Revenues have been on the rise since Soliris hit the market, gaining traction as the drug is introduced into new territories. In 2015 revenue rose 17% to $2.6 billion, thanks to a 29% increase in Soliris unit sales. Sales of Strensiq and Kanuma began in late 2015; they contributed some $12 million in earnings that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which had also been on the rise, peaked in 2014 but fell 78% to $144 million the following year. That decline was due to a number of factors including acquisition-related expenses, amortization of assets expenses related to Strensiq and Kanuma, and higher income tax provisions. Cash flow from operations rose 5% to $675 million that year.

  <p>
   In addition to growing the market for its existing products, Alexion is focused on growth through acquisitions and the expansion of its development pipeline. The company has 10 clinical programs and 30 pre-clinical programs.

   In 2015, Alexion acquired clinical-stage biotech firm
   <company id="54054">
    Synageva BioPharma
   </company>
   for $9.5 million. The deal furthered the company's efforts in treating devastating and rare diseases.
