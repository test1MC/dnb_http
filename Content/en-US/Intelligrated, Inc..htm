   The firm plans to extend its customer base further into North America and introduce additional product offerings and global capabilities through investment and strategic acquisitions. It also plans to penetrate select markets it believes are ripe for growth. More specifically, it is focused on the advanced light-to-medium unit segment of the market, which is defined as case conveyor and sortation systems that function at more than 150 cases per minute and are the most technologically sophisticated systems available.

   Intelligrated has its eye specifically fixed on Brazil, an emerging market it believes is experiencing a rising demand for handling automation in the manufacturing and retail sectors. It notes a surging uptick for advanced sortation and palletizing systems within the country. Intelligrated launched its operations in Brazil in 2012, through a joint venture with SDI Group USA, a material handling equipment provider that has operated in South America since 1992.
