   While the company is known for its aromatic rice products, RiceTec has built a business with seeds. The company has been researching, developing, and marketing hybrid rice seed for use in North and South America since 1988. Farmers have become familiar with its CLEARFIELD brand of hybrid rice seed. RiceTec also markets grain-based side dishes and specialty rice through grocery stores nationwide under the RiceSelect name. RiceSelect consumer products include Texmati, Jasmati, and Kasmati aromatic rices, as well as couscous, orzo, risotto, and sushi rice. The company is owned by the royal family of Liechtenstein, a small European country located between Austria and Switzerland.

   RiceTec in 2013 launched a new $150-million research initiative that involves developing new hybrids, new varieties, and new herbicide-tolerant rice. To support this effort, the company has added more scientists and technical service representatives to its field staff. To this end, RiceTec is rolling out two new hybrids in 2014.
