   Women's apparel is one of Fila U.S.A.'s growth engines. In late 2011 the company expanded its Body Toning System (BTS) of workout wear, adding color and new styles. First debuted to the women's fitness industry in fall 2010, BTS boasts up to a 50% improvement in workout effectiveness. To achieve this, BTS tops and bottoms are designed with Lycra fabric that compresses active muscles. The elasticized fabric was supplied by textile maker

   Fila U.S.A. has also gained a significant share of the golf market. In 2011 it acquired global golf equipment maker
   <company id="104294">
    Acushnet
   </company>
   from
   <company id="10075">
    Beam
   </company>
   , formerly known as Fortune Brands, for $1.2 billion. The new owner snapped up #1 US golf brands Titleist (golf balls and clubs) and FootJoy (golf shoes).

        <p>
   Other introductions included a colorful tennis collection for both women and men. Fila U.S.A. has targeted the yoga market by rolling out capri-cut exercise pants with knee pads, ideal for strenuous poses. The pants' design was inspired by customer requests for more comfort-yielding bottoms, as yoga mats and towels can run thin.

        <p>
   Two Fila brothers founded the predecessor to Fila Holding in 1923. Its primary product for about 50 years was underwear until 1974 when Enrico Frachey came on board as managing director. Frachey steered the company into athletic apparel, where it penetrated the ski and tennis markets with high-profile endorsements by athletes such as tennis pro Bjorn Borg. Frachey left in 1979.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the 1980s Italian fiber company SNIA BPD acquired control of the company. Under SNIA's direction Fila rehired Frachey in 1987. The next year SNIA sold its controlling interest in Fila to Gemina (which became first
   <company id="56744">
    Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali
   </company>
   , or HdP, and then
   <company id="56744">
    RCS Media Group
   </company>
   ). The company perpetuated its high-fashion image by selling shoes only through high-end retailers and specialty stores. However, in 1988 that image was tarnished when $15 million in overstocked items sold to a British liquidator ended up on off-price shelves in the US.

        <p>
   In the early 1990s Fila began focusing more on athletic shoes -- especially basketball shoes -- and Grant Hill signed on to endorse the brand in 1994. With US sales making up more than half of its revenues, the company soon moved its global operations office to Sparks, Maryland. By 1996 Fila had become the third-largest athletic shoemaker in the world; but sales of athletic shoes began dropping in the US during the late 1990s, and in 1998 Fila laid off 10% of its workforce. Also that year the company laid off an additional 70 sales reps in favor of independent contractors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Late in 1998 Michele Scannavini succeeded Frachey as CEO. Scannavini moved quickly in 1999 to cut costs: a design center in Portland was closed, the company's Maryland headquarters were sold, and its entire internal sales force was replaced by independent agencies. Fila also refocused on tennis by sponsoring several tournaments and by signing an endorsement agreement with Jennifer Capriati. Also in 1999 the company opened the first of its UK stores. With sales of apparel and footwear on the rise, Fila devoted 10% of its revenues to a new advertising campaign in early 2000. Also that year the company enhanced its UK presence with its purchase of the 40% of Fila UK owned by Blacks Leisure; the move made Fila UK a wholly owned subsidiary.

   In June 2001 HdP began looking for a buyer for its stake in Fila; in early 2003 it found one in Sport Brands International. HdP sold off all of its Fila operating divisions with a view towards focusing itself on the media business. Sport Brands International, which was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring Fila, then bought up all of Fila's international affiliates.
  </p>

   With a history of high design in athletic shoes and sportswear, Fila had run down its image in lieu of a hodgepodge of athletic endorsements. Ready to throw in the towel, Fila's owner, RCS Media Group, inked a deal with
   <company id="108268">
    Sport Brands International
   </company>
   (SBI was also associated with private investment fund manager
   <company id="112328">
    Cerberus
   </company>
   ). The resulting Fila remained intact until early 2007, when
   <company id="156440">
    Fila Korea
   </company>
   acquired the global Fila footwear and apparel business from SBI. Fila also sold the subsidiaries for its European, Middle East, African, and Indian businesses in 2008 and now licenses the Fila brand for the region.
