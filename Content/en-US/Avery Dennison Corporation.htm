   Avery Dennison is easy to label: It's a global leader in the making of adhesive labels used on packaging, mailers, and other items. Pressure-sensitive adhesives and materials account for almost three-quarters of its sales. Its Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM) unit is split into two other units: Label and Packaging Materials (LPM) and Graphics and Reflective Solutions (GRS). Under the Avery Dennison and Fasson brands, it makes papers, films, and foils coated with adhesive and sold in rolls to printers. Its most widely used products are the self-adhesive stamps used by the

    US Postal Service
   </company>
   . It also makes retail branding and security tags, printer systems, and fasteners, as well as medical adhesive products.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates about 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities in more than 50 countries. Asia is its largest market, accounting for 32% of Avery Dennison's total revenues in 2015; Europe (29%); the US (26%); Latin America (8%); and other countries (5%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's reportable segments are Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM); Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS); and Vancive Medical Technologies (Vancive).
  </p>
  <p>
   The PSM segment makes and sells Fasson, JAC, and Avery Dennison-brand pressure-sensitive label and packaging materials, Avery Dennison-brand graphics, Avery Dennison-brand reflective products, Avery Dennison-brand tapes, and performance polymers (largely used to manufacture pressure-sensitive materials). Pressure-sensitive materials consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and fabrics, which are coated with company-developed and purchased adhesives, and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and films.
  </p>
  <p>
   LPM, its larger unit, has differentiated products, but its film products have the fastest growth. Avery plans to continue the unit's growth with more new products in targeted markets, such as its Avery Dennison Shrink PS for food labeling and Global MDO film for home and personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) unit provides global branding and supply chain services and products for the retail apparel industry. RBIS operates facilities in more than 40 countries to check the quality of branding on apparel. It also offers labeling technology to check inventory and pricing accuracy. It is a leader in RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tagging for retailers with more than 800 patents and applications, and global manufacturing capabilities that have produced more than 3 billion RFID tags and labels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avery also holds specialty converting businesses that use its expertise in one market to develop products for other markets. These businesses make and sell specialty tapes, highly engineered films, pressure-sensitive postage stamps, and other converted products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Vancive segment makes an array of pressure-sensitive adhesive products for surgical, wound care, ostomy, and electromedical applications. These products are sold primarily to medical supply and device manufacturers and healthcare providers. Vancive's recent advances include the development of Metria wearable sensors and Benehold proprietary adhesive technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the PSM and RBIS segments contributed 73% and 26% of Avery's total sales, respectively.

  <p>
   The company's major customers include advertising agencies, distributors, designers, government agencies, graphic vendors, label converters, architecture &amp; building, electronics &amp; electrical, OEMs, package designers, packaging engineers and manufacturers, printers, and sign manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The RBIS segment sells a variety of branding and information solutions to retailers, brand owners, apparel manufacturers, distributors and industrial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avery Dennison also sells durable cast and reflective films to the construction, automotive, and fleet transportation market segments; and reflective films for traffic and safety applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products directly and via third-party distributors and retailers.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 Avery Dennison's net revenues decreased by 6% due to the impact of currency translation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net sales increased 5% on an organic basis. Pressure-sensitive Materials sales increased at mid-single digit rates in both emerging markets and Western Europe and at a low-single digit rate in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income has been increasing over the last five years. In fiscal 2016 Avery Dennison's net income increased by 12% due to a decrease in marketing, general, and administrative expenses, reflecting the impact of currency and benefits from productivity initiatives (including savings from restructuring) and decreased interest expense related to a drop in foreign short-term debt, the extra week in 2014 fiscal year, and the maturation of a medium-term note.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 the company's operating cash inflows increased by 33% due to higher net income, the timing of vendor payments, and lower incentive compensation paid in 2015 for the 2014, partially offset by the timing of collections from customers and higher payments for taxes.

  <p>
   The company follows a strategy of trying to obtain leading share positions in global markets. Avery attempts to leverage its global reach and scale and its product expertise to sustain competitive advantages in its core businesses. It focuses on increased productivity, cost reductions, and pricing to counteract market downturns.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 2025 goals include new targets for energy efficiency, responsible sourcing, waste reduction, safety levels, community investment and gender diversity. The company continues to invest in innovation and new capability in PSM and is adding new coating capacity in Asia for all product lines, and has a major restructuring program in Europe to enable Graphics Solutions to compete more effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses on emerging markets, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe; and continued to pursue acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company introduced two bio-based polyethylene label films. These new products are the first self-adhesive PE filmic labels with a face stock that includes more than 80% renewable content while providing the functionality and performance of a regular polyethylene label.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Avery Dennison and Belgian-based Seliplast AG launched a first-of-its-kind recycling option for label matrix waste made of polypropylene and polyethylene. The option eliminates the need for waste material to be shipped outside of the region for manual sorting and recycling, which had previously been required due to the sticky nature of the residue.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company teamed up with China-based Ningbo Shenzhou Knitting Co., Ltd., forming a joint venture to facilitate heat transfer innovations in order to better serve leading global brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Avery Dennison Retail Branding and Information Solutions also announced a newly expanded RFID portfolio that brings dramatically improved inventory accuracy and visibility to retail categories, including jewelry, cosmetics, healthcare, housewares and footwear.

  <p>
   Avery Dennison was created in 1990 by the merger of Avery International and Dennison Manufacturing. In 1935 Stanton Avery founded Kum-Kleen Products, which would become Avery International. After a fire destroyed the plant's equipment in 1938, Avery, who had renamed the company Avery Adhesives, improved the machinery used in making the labels.
  </p>
  <p>
   During and after WWII, Avery Adhesives shifted toward the industrial market for self-adhesives. The company incorporated in 1946. At that time Avery Adhesives sold 80% of its production, consisting of industrial labels, to manufacturers that labeled their own products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company lost its patent rights for self-adhesive labels in 1952, transforming the firm and the entire industry. As a result, a new division was created -- the Avery Paper Company (later renamed Fasson) -- to produce and market self-adhesive base materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avery Adhesives went public in 1961. Three years later it had four divisions: label products, base materials, Rotex (hand-operated embossing machines), and Metal-Cal (anodized and etched aluminum foil for nameplates). Renamed Avery International in 1976, the company closed some manufacturing facilities and cut 8% of its workforce in the late 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing. Dennison was started in 1844 by the father-and-son team of Andrew and Aaron Dennison to produce jewelry boxes. By 1849 Aaron's younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf (E.W.), was running the business and expanding it into tags, labels, and tissue paper. Dennison was incorporated in 1878 with $150,000 in capital.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1911 Dennison sold tags, gummed labels, paper boxes, greeting cards, sealing wax, and tissue paper, and it had stores in Boston, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and London. Henry Dennison, E.W.'s grandson, was president from 1917 to 1952.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the 1960s to the 1980s, Dennison spent heavily on research and development and helped to develop such products as electronic printers and pregnancy test supplies. In the mid-1980s the firm reorganized its operations, selling seven businesses, closing four others, and focusing on stationery, systems, and packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to office products and product identification and control systems, the 1990 merger combined Dennison's office products operations in France (Doret and Cheval Ordex) with Avery International's sizable self-adhesive base materials business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Avery Dennison sold its 50% interest in a Japanese label converting company, Toppan, in 1996, clearing the way to develop its own businesses in Asia. In 1997 an alliance with Taiwanese rival Four Pillars turned sour when Avery Dennison accused the company of stealing trade secrets. (Two executives at Four Pillars were convicted of corporate espionage in 1999.)
  </p>
  <p>
   President and COO Philip Neal was promoted to CEO in 1998. (He became chairman in 2000.) In 1999, adhering to its goal of global expansion, Avery Dennison formed office products joint ventures in Germany with Zweckform Buro-Produkte and in Japan with
   <company id="119631">
    Hitachi Maxell
   </company>
   . Record 1998 sales and earnings were dampened by the news of slowing growth, and in 1999 Avery Dennison closed five plants and began laying off workers. Later that year the company bought
   <company id="41972">
    Stimsonite
   </company>
   , a maker of reflective highway safety products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Avery Dennison began a $40 million expansion of its Chinese manufacturing operations, while eliminating 1,500 jobs worldwide. Later in the year the company agreed to jointly package instant imaging and labeling products with
   <company id="11198">
    Polaroid
   </company>
   . Several acquisitions in 2001 included CD Stomper (CD and DVD labels and software). Avery Dennison continued its acquisitive ways in 2002, acquiring Jackstadt (German maker of pressure-sensitive adhesive materials), RVL Packaging (maker of woven and printed labels and other tags for the apparel and retail industries), and L&amp;E Packaging (key supplier and printer for RVL).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company sold its European package label converting business (including plants in Denmark and France) to label and packaging company
   <company id="54171">
    CCL Industries
   </company>
   . As part of the deal, Avery Dennison began to supply pressure-sensitive base materials to CCL Industries. The divestiture was part of the company's strategy to concentrate its efforts in adhesive materials, office products, and retail information services.
  </p>
  <p>
   Phillip Neal retired as chairman and CEO in 2005 and was replaced by director Kent Kresa as chairman and by Dean Scarborough as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company completed a restructuring program in 2010 it began in 2008 that generated a total of $180 million in cost savings. It also paid down some $300 million in debt during that same period.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Avery also decided to divest its Metalure pigments business, which it sold to the Eckart Effect Pigments division of ALTANA. Eckart had been the distributor of the PVD-type aluminum pigments for more than 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 a subsidiary of Avery Dennison entered into a licensing agreement for RFID tags, labels, and readers with Round Rock Research LLC to facilitate further adoption of item-level RFID by US-based apparel retailers and brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Avery Dennison sold its OCP and DES segments to CCL Industries for $500 million. The OCP segment makes school and office products (Avery, Marks-A-Lot, HI-LITER). It planned to use the proceeds from the deal to invest in its two core businesses and reduce debt and pension liability. (Avery had originally signed up 3M to buy OCP in 2011 but the deal fell through in 2012).
