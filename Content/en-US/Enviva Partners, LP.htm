   Enviva Partners is wild about wood pellets. The company produces and supplies utility-grade wood pellets to major power customers. Its wood pellets are used as a substitute for coal in both converted and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. They enable major power generators to generate electricity in a way that reduces the overall cost of compliance with mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions limits while also allowing them to diversify their sources of electricity supply. Enviva operates through roughly a half-dozen plants located within the Southern US. The company was established in 2010 and launched an IPO in 2015.

  <p>
   Enviva launched an IPO in mid-2015 and raised $200 million in proceeds. It is primarily using the bulk of this amount to pay off debt.

  <p>
   Enviva operates through five production plants in the Southeastern US that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of approximately 1.7 million metric tons per year. It also owns a dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake.

  <p>
   The company's revenues climbed from nearly $180 million in 2013 to $290 million in 2014. It posted $185,000 in net income in 2014 after posted a net loss of nearly $5.5 million in 2013.

  <p>
   As its energy customers must abide to environmentally friendly restrictions and practices, Enviva expects demand for its wood pellets to grow exponentially over the next few years. It plans to acquire wood pellets in the Pacific Northwest for sale in Asian markets, and it expects to expand its geographic reach to serve South Korean and Japanese demand. In addition, the wood pellets produced from its Cottondale, Florida, plant are suitable for uses other than industrial power generation, including commercial and residential heating.
