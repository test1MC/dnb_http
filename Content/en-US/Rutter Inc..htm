   Rutter makes radar technologies for seacraft that offer real-time data management and can be used in harsh environment. The company's radar products help captains deal with ice, track the flow of oil spills, monitor currents and waves, and identify small objects that might interfere with operations. Rutter takes its name from "rutters," the small books in which sailors log navigational information, which reflected its former business of making voyage data recorders.
