   Just about everything has a bearing on the business of Kaydon Corporation. The company custom designs, engineers, and manufactures bearings and bearing systems, slip rings, filtration products, and seals. Kaydon operates through three segments: Friction Control Products (anti-friction and split roller bearings, and specialty balls), Velocity Control Products (industrial shock absorbers, velocity controls, gas springs, and rotary dampers), and Other Industrial Products, including metal alloys, machine tool parts, presses, dies, and benders. Kaydon was acquired by Sweden-based bearings maker

    AB SKF
   </company>
   in late 2013.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In October 2013 Kaydon ceased trading publicly after it was purchased by bearings maker
   <company id="42976">
    AB SKF
   </company>
   for around $1.25 billion.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Kayson is stationed in Michigan and has other locations in South Carolina. International locations reside in the UK, Mexico, and Germany. The US accounts for 58% of its total revenue; Germany is its second-largest geographical segment, representing 12% of sales.

        <p>
   Kaydon has seen its revenues remain stable over the last few years. Revenues were up 3% from $460 million in 2011 to $475 million in 2012. The growth for 2012 was driven by a 19% surge in sales from its Velocity Control Products segment due to acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, Kaydon saw its profits nosedive nearly 99% from $49 million in 2011 to a paltry $550,000 in 2012. This was the result of a $43 million impairment charge related to wind energy restructuring and higher interest expenses related to $50 million in borrowings to fund an acquisition.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To boost its Velocity Control Products segment (about a quarter of consolidated sales), Kaydon in mid-2012 acquired Fabreeka Group Holdings for about $54 million. Massachusetts-based Fabreeka supplied engineered vibration-isolation and shock-control products, such as isolation pads, isolation mounts, and highly engineered vibration products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Markets serviced by Fabreeka included test and measurement, industrial machinery, manufacturing, precision equipment, aerospace, and defense. This segment previously received a boost with the 2011 acquisition of HAHN-Gasfedern, a Germany-based manufacturer of industrial gas and tension springs and dampers.

        <p>
   The Kaydon Engineering Company was formed in 1941 to supply bearings for the war effort. Its product line grew to include difficult-to-make non-military products that required custom design and special engineering. Such challenging production jobs became the company's hallmark.
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisition specialist Glen Bailey bought the company in 1969. Over the next decade Bailey upgraded the company's plants, added specialty filtration products to its offerings, and included robotic and medical applications. In 1981 Bailey formed Bairnco as a holding company for his various businesses and prepared to spin them off. Kaydon's sales dropped in the early 1980s, but it was spun off anyway in 1984. New president Richard Shantz, like Bailey, began growing and diversifying through acquisitions. Acquired businesses included Koppers Company (1986, rings and seals), Spirolox (1987, retaining rings), and Electro-Tec (1989, slip rings). The company also went international, building a bearing plant in Mexico in 1988 and acquiring the UK's I.D.M. Electronics (1989, slip rings).
  </p>
        <p>
   The acquisitions continued in the 1990s with another UK company, Cooper Bearings (1991, split bearings) and firms that made pulley and drive components and specialty balls. In 1995 Kaydon added large hydraulic cylinders and alloy steel castings to its product line with the acquisition of Seabee; the next year it bought two similar businesses, Victor Fluid Power and Benton Harbor Engineering. Kaydon pumped up its fluid power line in 1997 with the purchases of Great Bend Industries and Gold Star Manufacturing.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 Kaydon's board authorized the repurchase of 1.1 million shares of the company's stock, and the next year authorized the repurchase of an additional 4 million common shares. Also in 1999 President and CEO Brian Campbell succeeded Lawrence Cawley as chairman. Later in the year the company picked up two acquisitions: Fiterdyne Filtration Systems and Focal Technologies (fiber optic electronic data and fluid transfer devices).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2000 Kaydon acquired the Tridan Group of companies which included Tridan International (air conditioning equipment), Indiana Precision (tooling for the plastic packaging industry), and Canfield Technologies (lead-free solder). Early the next year Kaydon added deceleration devices such as industrial shock absorbers and directional control valves to its product line with the $70 million acquisition of ACE Controls. On the last day of 2001 Kaydon sold its fluid power products division to a group of private investors.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 Kaydon sued Stephen Clough, Kaydon's former president and CEO, and six other former Kaydon employees for breach of contract and misappropriation of corporate secrets. The following year, the company completed its restructuring plan to strengthen its operating performance and manufacturing utilization in the Specialty Bearings Group, a unit of the Friction and Motion Controls Product segment. In 2005 the company sold its Power and Data Transmission business to
   <company id="12159">
    Moog Inc.
   </company>
   for nearly $43 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   As with most companies working within the manufacturing sphere, Kaydon saw its revenues and profits decline during the Global Recession during and after 2008. After weathering the storm and keeping a lid on costs, it finally generated increases in revenue and net income for the fiscal year ended 2010.
