   This company came clean. The first certified organic dairy operation in the UK, Rachel's Organic Dairy is committed to treating cows nicely, as well as the consumers of the products of its well-looked-after cows. The company produces yogurts, dairy desserts, butter, cultured dairy products, and fluid milk, all of which are sourced from certified organic dairy farmers. Rachel and Gareth Rowland (organic farmers themselves) founded the company and now act as consultants. Rachel's Organic Dairy was owned by
   <company id="56974">
    Horizon Organic
   </company>
   and was part of the acquisition when
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   purchased the Horizon company in 2004. Dean is now a subsidiary of France's
   <company id="54346">
    Groupe Lactalis
   </company>
   .
