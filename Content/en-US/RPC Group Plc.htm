   RPC Group may or may not be able to contain itself, but it's quite handy at containing other things in all sorts of shapes, colors, and sizes. The company makes rigid plastic packaging, including blow-molded, injection blow-molded, and thermoformed containers. Its products include bottles for motor oil, food, and beauty and personal care products; tubs, pots, and lids for food; and packaging for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Other products include vending and drinking cups, coffee capsules, and disposable products. RPC also offers printing, labeling, and color options for its products.

Major markets include the UK (26% of net sales), Germany (26%), and France (13%). Other countries account for the remaining 35%.

  <p>
   RPC has experienced steady revenue growth the last two years, with revenues jumping 17% from 2014 to 2015. The growth was driven by acquisitions and a 28% surge from its blow molding segment. In addition, injection molding sales climbed by 11% in 2015. (Note: the company's 2014 annual statement was restated due to discontinued operations.)

  <p>
   The company has achieved growth through divestitures and acquisitions. Throughout 2014 the company sold its disposables trading business at Offenburg, Germany, and its Cobelplast extruded sheet business at Lokeren, Belgium; and Montonate, Italy.

  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired Bosnia- and Herzegovina- based, Helioplast, a supplier of injection moulded rigid plastic packaging for the consumer food sector. The acquisition extended the company's Superfos segment into the Balkan region, providing a further sales growth into the south eastern European region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, RPC also acquired ACE Corporation Holdings, one of the Far East's industry leaders in the manufacture of plastic injection moulded components. ACE also supplies injection moulding tools for niche segments within the packaging, lifestyle, medical, power and automotive end markets. RPC paid a total of $430 million for ACE.
