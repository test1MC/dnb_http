    Occidental Petroleum
   </company>
   reported that its Chemicals segment's revenues grew by 2% in 2013 In The basic chemical business saw lackluster domestic demand and pricing for basic chemical products. However, exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain remained competitive as a result of the North American feedstock cost advantages (driven by natural gas prices). In the US, anticipation of additional capacity coming online 2014 from the commissioning of three additional chlor-alkali plants, (including OxyChem's plant in Tennessee), put downward pressure on liquid caustic soda prices. Calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide segments improved in 2013 as US demand grew and margins remained stable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Vinyls business improved in 2013 thanks to a 4% growth in US demand due to strengthening housing and commercial construction markets. This was offset by lower exports, resulting in no change in industry operating rates in 2013.

   The company, which grows organically and through joint ventures and acquisitions, focuses on being a low-cost producer in order to maximize cash flow. It concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties. Chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC.
