   , Colomer USA operated under Barcelona's hair and beauty products concern The Colomer Group (owned by former Revlon exec Carlos Colomer and investors) until 2013, when Revlon bought the business for $665 million.

  <p>
   In late 2013 Revlon's wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation, acquired The Colomer Group and its Revlon Professional business. Colomer sells to salons and other professional channels not currently served by Revlon. As part of the transaction, Revlon gained Revlon Professional, Intercosmo, Orofluido, and UniqOne hair care brands; CND nail polishes and enhancements, including the Shellac innovation; and American Crew men's grooming products. New parent Revlon also took control of certain brands, such as Natural Honey body lotions and Llongueras hair care, that Colomer sells directly into retail channels, and the multi-cultural haircare brand Cr√®me of Nature. Buying Colomer expands Revlon's geographic reach, as Colomer earns about 50% of its net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and approximately 40% in the US.
