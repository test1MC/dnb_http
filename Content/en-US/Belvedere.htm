   Marie Brizard Wine &amp; Spirits makes a mean 'Bloody Marie'. The company, formerly Belvédère, was founded after the fall of the Berlin Wall to promote the virtues of premium vodka made in Eastern European countries. After the sale of the Belvédère name, the company took the name of its oldest brand, Marie Brizard, which was founded in 1755. Marie Brizard's flagship vodka is the rye-based Sobieski, which it makes and sells alongside other spirits, including William Peel whiskey, Krupnik vodka, San José tequila, Porto Pitters, Old Lady's Gin, Pastis Berger, and Cognac Gautier. It distributes wine and spirits in the US, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe.

  <p>
   Marie Brizard operates in eight countries: Brazil, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Lithuania, Poland and the US. Its products can be found in over 100 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   France accounts for around 40% of revenue, followed by Poland at 37% and the remainder by other countries.

   In fiscal 2015, revenue fell 3% on prior year to €451 million due to a decline in Poland and France. Sales in France fell as a result of a fall in the 'on-trade' (cafés, restaurants, hotels), while sales in Poland were hit by the divestment of Galerie Alkoholi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income turned positive in 2015 to €6 million due to a reduction in non-recurring expenses. Cash flow from operating activities rose 95% to €40 million.

  <p>
   Marie Brizard aims to push its brands' market penetration through increased advertising and promotional investments, and improving sales in both on- and off-trade segments. The company promoted its 'World Martini Day', which encouraged consumers to share martini recipes. It recruited several influential food bloggers to further the cause.
