   Unlike the Eygptian god,

   Osiris seeks to keep people out of the afterlife. The biotech company researches, develops, and markets cellular regenerative drug candidates. It engages in stem cell research, bioengineering, and the development of tissue-based products. Its marketed products include treatments in the areas of orthopedics, sports medicine, and wound care, Bone repair and regeneration allograft Bio4 is a viable bone matrix and alternative to autografts (the transfer of tissue from one part of the body to another). Other products include allograft Cartiform, placental membrane Grafix, skin allograft TruSkin, and placental allograft Stravix.

  <p>
   Osiris focuses on developing products that promote the body's natural healing. The company's drugs are based upon human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Harvested from adult donors, MSCs can be grafted onto various human tissue. They then can differentiate themselves to become bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon, or other types of tissue. The company can produce up to 10,000 treatments from one bone marrow donation, and because the material is universally compatible, it does not have to be matched for individual patients.

   The company utilizes a direct distribution and marketing team, as well as a network of specialty distributors for certain markets. It partners with

    Stryker Corporation
   </company>
   to distribute its orthopedics products and with
   <company id="122345">
    Arthrex

   to distribute its sports medicine products.

   Revenue has been up and down for the past few years. After declines in 2011 and 2012, revenue increased in 2013 and 2014. In the latter year, it more than doubled, rising 146% to $60 million on sales of its biosurgery products (largely driven by the expansion of Osiris' sales and marketing departments).

  <p>
   However, the company had a net loss of $1.8 million in 2015 as general, administrative, and selling expenses rose. This was the second net loss for Osiris since 2011. That loss led to a $3 million operating cash outflow (but this was an improvement over 2013, then the company had an outflow of $13.3 million).
