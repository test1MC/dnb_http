   Rexnord's products help to give machines motion and manage the flow of water. The company does business through two divisions: process and motion control (PMC; 57% of sales) and water management (43%). PMC makes gears, couplings, bearings, industrial chains, and other highly engineered mechanical components with brand names such as Rex, Falk, FlatTop, and Link-Belt. Water management makes products used in commercial plumbing, water control and treatment, and wastewater markets with names such as Fontaine, Rodney Hunt, Wilkins, VAG, GA, and Zurn.

  <p>
   Rexnord operates through nearly 70 offices located around the globe. The US generates 68% of its total sales, while Europe accounts for nearly 20%.

  <p>
   Distributors represent more than 50% of the process and motion control sales. End markets include aerospace, air handling, mining, agriculture, construction, aggregates and cement, chemicals and energy, as well as beverage and container, and forest and wood.
  </p>
  <p>
   Infrastructure construction, commercial construction, and residential construction projects account for a large portion of water management's net sales. This segment also sells its products through a network of 1,000 independent sales agents and 240 sales agencies in North America and 200 direct sales representatives in some 50 countries.

  <p>
   Rexnord's revenue declined 6% from $2.05 billion in 2015 to $1.92 billion in 2016. This was due to a 11% decrease from its process and motion control segment while revenue from water management remained flat. The previous segment was negatively affected by foreign currency translations in 2016 along with demand across several process industry end markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits have fluctuated wildly over the years; after surging in 2015, profits plunged by 19% to $68 million in 2016. This was attributed to the lower revenues coupled with a spike in interest expenses. In addition, after steadily increasing over the years, Rexnord's operating cash flow declined by 11% from 2015 to 2016.

  <p>
   Rexnord uses acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2016 it acquired Cambridge International Holdings Corp., a Maryland-based supplier of metal conveying and woven metal systems used primarily in food and packaging applications, for $210 million. The acquisition will be integrated into Rexnord's process and motion control division, which designs and manufactures highly engineered mechanical components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired Euroflex Transmissions (India) Private Limited, a Hyderabad, India-based supplier of high performance disc couplings used in power generation, gas compression and industrial process machinery applications. The purchase price was $77 million, and the deal added complementary product lines to Rexnord's existing process and motion control platform.
