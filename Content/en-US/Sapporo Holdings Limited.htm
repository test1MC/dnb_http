   Sapporo Holdings supplies the beer and a place to drink it. The company is one of Japan's oldest brewers, but occupies the #4 seat in that country's beer market (behind #1

   ) with brews ranging from its flagship Sapporo Black Label to the pricier premium Yebisu. It also makes the low-malt

   (beer-like) brew and is licensed to sell Guinness beer in Japan. The company operates about 200 beer halls and restaurants and owns a beverage company that makes canned coffee, bottled water, and soft drinks. In addition to beverages and restaurants, Sapporo has operations in real estate. To offset declining demand in Japan, Sapporo is looking to North America and Vietnam.

   Tokyo-based Sapporo Holdings rings up about 90% of its sales in Japan. North America and other Asian countries (mainly Vietnam) account for the rest.

   Saporro's revenue increased 10% (before adjustment for currency translation) in 2012 compared with 2011, driven by double-digit growth in food and soft drinks and international sales, as well as single-digit growth in Japanese alcoholic beverages, restaurants, and real estate. Indeed, Sapporo's international business (a focus for the company) posted a 40% year-over-year increase in net sales on continuing growth in North America and Vietnam. The recent purchases of Silver Spring Citrus and Pokka Group also helped to boost sales. Sapporo's restaurants business reported a 6% increase in sales in 2012, mainly due to the rebound from the massive earthquake in Sendai that stuck in 2011.

   Riding the robust increase in sales, Sapporo's profits increased 70% in 2012 versus 2011.

   To compensate for declining demand at home, the Japanese brewer is accelerating its international expansion, with a focus on North America and Asia. To that end, in early 2012 Sapporo purchased a 51% stake in the largest US private-label producer of chilled beverages, Silver Spring Citrus, spurring the company's full-scale entry into the North American beverage market. Focusing on the North American market as well as the Singaporean market -- a stronghold of the Pokka brand -- Sapporo will accelerate its efforts to grow its international business, which is expanding beyond the alcoholic beverage category. Sapporo also bought Canada's third-ranked

   (in 2006.)

   Sapporo also has its eye on Vietnam, where it hopes to eventually capture more than 10% of the beer market. To that end, Sapporo build a new beer brewery in 2011 and began selling beer there in 2012. Sapporo entered the Vietnamese beer market by acquiring a majority stake in Kronenbourg Vietnam for about $25 million in 2009. Sapporo intends to use Vietnam as a launch pad in its push into southeast Asian markets, including Indonesia and Thailand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2013, the company merged Sapporo Beverage and Pokka Corp. (acquired in 2011) to form Pokka Sapporo Food &amp; Beverage, a new company that makes soft drinks, lemon-based seasonings, soup, and other food products.
