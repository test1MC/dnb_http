   Old World Industries operates in the relatively new world of automotive chemicals and parts, selling its products to the automotive aftermarket. Old World's antifreezes include Peak and Sierra (the latter marketed as a safer alternative to other antifreezes), as well as private-label products. Old World also makes de-icers, pickup bed liners (Herculiner), diesel exhaust fluid (BlueDEF), heavy duty coolant (Final Charge) and wiper blades (Blue Mountain Professional). A pure aftermarket consumer, commercial, and heavy duty products organization, the company has distribution operations in more than 60 countries.

   The company began distributing its BlueDEF brand of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) to commercial diesel vehicle customers in 2010. Old World Industries maintains a supply network of some 4,500 distribution centers to serve an array of commercial customers, including truck stops, fleet operators, and dealerships. The company is marketing the brand on a national level in response to an Environmental Protection Agency mandate to reduce harmful NOX emissions from diesel engines by 90%. The DEF market is expected to reach 1 billion gallons by the year 2020. Agrium entered into an exclusive agreement with Old World Industries to supply DEF, made from urea, in 2010.

   It also operates an online automotive parts store, 24-7Autoparts.com, where it sells its products as well as auto parts from other manufacturers. The site caters primarily to do-it-yourselfers.

  <p>
   In a strategic move to focus on expanding the PEAK family of products in the automotive and heavy duty marketplaces worldwide and to raise cash to pay down debt, in 2012 the company exited the chemical production business. It sold its US-based ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol oxide plant to Thailand's Indorama Ventures for $795 million. (Indorama is Thailand's largest producer of polyester, and the purchase gives the company control of the largest US plant, in Clear Lake, Texas, producing ethylene glycol, a key component in the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate and polyester fibers and yarns. The Clear Lake plant has the capacity to produce 435,000 metric tons of ethylene products a year).
