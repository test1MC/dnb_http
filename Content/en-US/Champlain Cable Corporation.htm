   Champlain Cable manufactures cable to carry power, signals, and data for the industrial, automotive, and data transmission manufacturing industries. The company's products include cable that has been braided, twisted, wrapped, and jacketed for insulation. Champlain Cable's products are designed to accommodate tight spaces, extreme temperatures, and harsh chemicals, characteristics which have led Champlain Cable to make several products tailored to the needs of the US military. The company was founded in 1955.
