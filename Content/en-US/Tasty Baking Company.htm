   Tasty Baking's name says it all. In addition to its popular Krimpet, the baker is known for its Tastykake single-serve cupcakes, snack-sized cakes, and fruit pies. It also makes cookies, brownies, pastries, honey buns, and doughnuts. Tasty Baking sells its goodies through convenience stores, supermarkets, mass merchants, and other retail food outlets in the US, primarily on the East Coast, but also as far west as Arizona and Nevada. (

   <company id="40525">

   New marketing efforts to strengthen the Tastykake brand include a new platform called milk media featuring branded milk gallons with Tastykake messaging and instant redeemable coupons, a mobile snaptag campaign, as well as a targeted sampling box program. Tastykake advertising also included outdoor billboards, free-standing insert drops in 30 markets.

   Flowers Foods has expanded Tasty Baking's product line and added delivery routes from Maine to Florida and as far west as Nevada. (Prior to its acquisition, Tasty Baking was a regional brand sold in about 16,700 retail outlets in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.) The sale also expanded Flowers Foods' reach to the densely-populated Northeast.

   In 2013, Flowers added about a half a dozen new items to Tastykake's lineup:
   <i>
    Tastykake
   </i>
   Dreamies, Swirly Cupcakes, Bag Cinnamon Donuts, Six Count Cinnamon Rolls, Glazed Pies and
   <i>
    Tastykake Almond Joy
   </i><i>
    Kandy Bar Kakes
   </i>
   . Tastykake continued expansion efforts into the west during 2013 and entered the Arizona and Nevada markets. Flowers Foods expects to extend the Tastykake brand to additional markets over the next several years.
