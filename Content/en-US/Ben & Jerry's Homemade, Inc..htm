   Not yet ready for a scoop of Dulce Delish? Don't worry, Ben &amp; Jerry's is still Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade: a top maker of super-premium ice cream (along with rival

   more than a decade ago, but it still marches to the beat of its own ice cream scoops on its drums of ice cream. The company sells its colorfully named ice cream, ice-cream novelties, and frozen yogurt ("FroYo") under such monikers as Chunky Monkey, Karamel Sutra, and Cherry Garcia. It also franchises some 750 Ben &amp; Jerry's SCOOP SHOPS worldwide. Ben &amp; Jerry's is among Unilever's top brands.

   Unilever's global reach extends Vermont-based Ben &amp; Jerry's market to 35 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America.

   Unilever, whose other ice cream brands include Breyers, Good Humor, Klondike, and Magnum (in Europe), among others, doesn't breakout Ben &amp; Jerry's sales. The brand is included in Unilever's Refreshment segment, which also includes tea and weight-management products, and accounted for 19% of Unilever's total sales in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   2013 was a soft year for ice cream sales both in the US and Italy (two of Unilever's biggest markets). Overall, the Refreshment segment's sales declined by almost 4% in 2013 versus 2012.

   Ben &amp; Jerry's corporate culture runs deep. Co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield created the company in 1978 in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont. As the merry prankster of the food industry, Ben &amp; Jerry's is known for pulling off playful PR events and taking stands on social and environmental issues -- its products are packed in unbleached cardboard containers and the company boasts a three-part social, product, and economic mission. Today, Ben &amp; Jerry's works to maintain its culture and image even under Unilever's umbrella.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aptly named Walt Freese resigned as CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry's in early 2010 to pursue other interests. Freese, who had led the ice cream maker since 2004, was succeeded by Jostein Solheim, a 14-year veteran at Unilever. Solheim spent most of that time running Unilever's ice cream division in five countries and had completed a rejuvenation plan for its North American operations, focusing on rolling out new products. He promises to keep Ben &amp; Jerry's firmly anchored in Vermont.
  </p>
  <p>
   In response to concerns from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based public health watchdog, Ben &amp; Jerry's removed the term "All Natural" from its ice creams and frozen yogurts that contain processed or artificial ingredients. The move included the ice cream maker's Cherry Garcia ice cream, which contains cocoa processed with alkali and nutrition-boosting flavanols. Additionally, Ben &amp; Jerry's in 2010 announced its commitment to go Fairtrade across its entire global portfolio. To this end, Ben &amp; Jerry's committed to going fully Fairtrade across its entire global flavor portfolio by 2013. Also in 2013, the ice cream maker committed to transitioning all of its ingredients to be fully sourced non-GMO (genetically modified organisms).

  <p>
   As the two slowest kids around the track, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield met in their seventh-grade gym class back in 1963 and became friends. Cohen first worked in the ice-cream business driving an ice-cream truck in 1968. His friendship with Greenfield didn't turn entrepreneurial until 1978 when the two completed a $5 correspondence course in ice-cream making; with a $12,000 investment, the two opened Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade ice-cream parlor in a renovated gas station in the college town of Burlington, Vermont.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cohen and Greenfield began packing the ice cream in pints for sale in local grocery stores in 1980. The first franchise followed in 1981. The company earned national exposure that year when
   <i>
    Time
   </i>
   magazine hailed their product as "the best ice cream in the world." After opening its first out-of-state franchise in Maine in 1983, Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade first went public in a Vermont-only stock offering (to keep ownership local) in 1984. Sales that year surpassed $4 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1985 the company formed The Ben &amp; Jerry Foundation to give 7.5% of annual pretax profits to community building projects. The next year it signed an agreement with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream to distribute its products nationally. By 1988 Ben &amp; Jerry's had 80 stores in 18 states and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fat-free mania of the 1990s prompted the ice-cream producer to introduce frozen yogurt nationally in 1992 and nonfat frozen yogurt in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stiff competition and plant expansion in 1994 caused Ben &amp; Jerry's to suffer its first-ever loss, and Cohen decided to step down as CEO. Ever quirky, the company hired a search firm but also conducted a 100-word essay contest entitled "YO! I want to be CEO!" First prize was the job; second prize was a lifetime supply of ice cream. The search firm found Robert Holland, who good-naturedly also submitted a poem to the contest. He was named CEO and president in 1995 but resigned in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ironically, given the company's earlier advocacy for gun control, Holland's replacement was Perry Odak, former CEO of U.S. Repeating Arms (maker of Winchester rifles); Odak took a pay cut to join Ben &amp; Jerry's in early 1997. He brought a more straight-laced business approach along with new managers who cut some product lines, redesigned the packaging, and stepped up openings of new "scoop shop" retail outlets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Relations chilled in 1998 between Ben &amp; Jerry's and Dreyer's. After rejecting a buyout offer from Dreyer's, Ben &amp; Jerry's surprised the industry by announcing it would boost its own sales force and turn to archrival Häagen-Dazs -- which it had sued in the 1980s for restricting distribution (settling out of court) -- to assist with delivering its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   After mulling various buyout overtures -- and amid loyalists' worries that a conglomerate parent would undermine the do-good funk of its brand -- the company was bought by Unilever in 2000 for about $326 million. The deal was structured to allow the ice-cream maker to continue its social missions and keep both co-founders involved. That year Unilever also signed a long-term agreement to have Dreyer's significantly expand its distribution of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice creams. In November 2000 Odak resigned and was replaced by Unilever's Yves Couette.
  </p>
  <p>
   Couette made no major changes in his first year, but in late 2002 it was announced that the company would trim its workforce and streamline some operations. Couette returned to Unilever in 2004 and was replaced as "Chief Euphoria Officer" by chief marketing officer Walt Freese.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006, former CFO Stuart Wiles was convicted of embezzling some $300,000 from the company during his tenure at Ben &amp; Jerry's, which ran from May 2000 to May 2004.

  </p>
  <p>
