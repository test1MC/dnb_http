   In 2013 the company completed the acquisition of the Visionix Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) and InterSense motion tracking businesses formerly owned by Gentex Corporation. The new company, Thales Visionix, Inc., is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thales. This acquisition is a strategic fit that complements Thales' global portfolio of Helmet Mounted Sight and Display systems for rotary and fixed wing platforms. It gives Thales the ability to offer highly capable HMD technology amidst rigorous budget constraints within the market.

   Thales Communications moved to expand its wideband technology capabilities in 2012 when it bought privately-held Tampa Microwave, based in its namesake's city in Florida. Tampa designs, develops, and manufactures tactical satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals and satellite simulator test equipment. The company operates as a subsidiary of Thales Communications and brings improved capabilities in delivering wideband communications between parties that are visually obstructed.
