   If camels have taught us anything, it's the need for a backpack to carry water. CamelBak, however, is the one credited with inventing the hands-free hydration system. First sold to outdoorsmen in the 1990s, the company's products target two markets: sports-recreation (which include mountain bikers, skiers, snowboarders, runners, hikers) and government-military (soldiers, construction workers, airport tarmac workers). CamelBak is a major supplier of hydration products to the US and foreign-armed forces. In addition to hydration packs, it also peddles BPA-free water bottles, gloves, and electrolyte-rich drink mixes. CamelBak is owned by investment firm

   .

   In 2014 the company introduced Relay, a water filtration pitcher to filter water at the speed of your faucet. In 2012 the company launched an e-commerce site to sell water bottles and accessories directly to consumers. It plans to expand those offerings to include hydration packs.
