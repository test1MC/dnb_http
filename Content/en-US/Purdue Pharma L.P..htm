   Purdue Pharma helps bring patients relief from pain. The company researches, develops, makes, and markets prescription and over-the-counter medicines and healthcare products for pain relief. They include sustained-release and long-acting treatments for chronic and severe pain. Purdue has an exclusive US licensing and co-promotion agreement with Labopharm Inc. of Laval, Canada for Ryzolt (tramadol HCl extended-release tablets), an extended release formulation of tramadol. Its other opioid drugs for pain relief include controlled-release analgesic OxyContin (a version of oxycodone), and morphine drug MS Contin.

Purdue also sells a number of non-prescription products including topical antiseptic Betadine and the Colace and Senokot lines of laxatives.

   While Purdue's OxyContin was hailed as a breakthrough pain therapy in the 1990s when it was approved, it has since generated much controversy. OxyContin pills are meant to be swallowed whole, with a time-release mechanism slowly delivering a potent opiate over twelve hours. However, illegal abusers of the highly-addictive drug found ways of crushing and then ingesting the powder to get a heroin-like high. As a result, it gained popularity as a street drug.

  <p>
   Purdue has taken steps to curb abuse of the painkiller, implementing a risk management program that included greater education efforts and collaboration with pharmacists and law enforcement. It also reformulated packaging of the drug to make it harder to abuse.
