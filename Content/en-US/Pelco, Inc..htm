   Pelco has moved to develop a more global organization (using parent

   's infrastructure) that can capitalize on the growth in developing regions and elsewhere. It is also growing through the launch of innovative products, developed both organically and through partnerships.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Pelco announced a new technology partnership with UK-based icomply and the integration of its V-TAS Pro platform into their product range. The Physical Security Information Management integration platform id used in a wide range of markets, from government and retail to transportation.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year March Networks and Pelco announced the integration of the March Networks Command video management system with Sarix Series IP cameras, Spectra HD Dome PTZ and Sarix TI Thermal Imaging camera systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Pelco and HuXinHuTong (Megaeyes) integrated Pelco's network cameras, including Sarix Mega-Performance Cameras, Spectra IP high-definition cameras, and multi-channel network encoders with the full range of HuXinHuTong's video management platform.
  </p>

   That year, the company released its new Pelco Sarix IL10 Series mini box and micro dome cameras, the first of more than 50 new Sarix fixed IP camera products to be released in 2013. It also launched its Pelco Infrared and White Light LED Illumination products for security camera installations.

   The company expanded its sales operations in Asia and Latin America via a 2009 acquisition of Crockett International. Crocket had previously served as a provider of sales and service support for Pelco customers in those regions.
  </p>

   Pelco was acquired by Schneider Electric in 2008 in a deal worth some $1.5 billion. Schneider Electric purchased Pelco in order to strengthen Schneider's Buildings business, which includes power and HVAC control, and electronic security.
