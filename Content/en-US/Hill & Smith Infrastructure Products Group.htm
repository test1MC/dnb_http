  <p>
   IPG has been expanding internationally, especially in Scandinavia, a region where highway construction has been robust, to compensate for lower demand in the UK. The Brifen unit gained more business when the parent company bought out the business of licensed representatives in Australia and Sweden. IPG's utilities businesses have been focusing on the development of new power generation facilities in emerging markets and the upgrading of old facilities in developed markets. These businesses have recorded strong orders for power plants in India; LNG terminals in Australia, Singapore, and Papua New Guinea; and a nuclear reprocessing plant in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 IPG acquired Sweden-based ATA Bygg-och Markproduckter, which supplies road safety barriers and signage, and a US-based company, The Paterson Group, which provides pipe supports and hangers for the power generation, commercial, and industrial sectors.
