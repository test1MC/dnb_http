It sells to architects and contractors, and to the general public through distributors and retailers. The company also produces indoor and outdoor sports surfaces through Canada-based

   In 1885 Anders Martensson opened a woodworking workshop in Malmö, Sweden. He soon expanded, incorporating it as Malmö Woodworking Factory (creating furniture and other products) in 1886. By 1887 the company had 19 employees, and in 1890 cement factory director R. F. Berg took over.
  </p>
  <p>
   Berg built a second factory in Limhamns producing oak and beech wood parquet flooring. He also offered customers flooring installation. Berg died in 1907; Ernst Wehtje replaced him.
  </p>
  <p>
   After 1917, flooring materials became the core business of renamed Limhamns Snickerifabrik. A 1919 strike and unfortunate financial decisions led the company into bankruptcy in 1924.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm became Limhamns Golvindustri in 1925, exclusively manufacturing wood flooring products. After a fire destroyed the Limhamn factory, the company moved production to Liljeholm (near Stockholm). Between 1928 and 1938 sales and production doubled. In 1938 the company launched the first industrially manufactured, pre-finished floorboard -- the successful Lindemann board, which was cheaper than its predecessors.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1940s the company introduced laminated floorboards. Although these still had expensive, high-quality wood (beech or oak) on the surface, less expensive pine was used for the bottom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Limhamns continued adding products and built factories in the 1950s. In the 1960s it established a raw plastics materials subsidiary, and entered various international markets -- partly through opening Austria, Denmark, and Germany subsidiaries. Also that decade, Limhamns sold a 50% stake of its business to AB Custos subsidiary Företagsfinans. Renamed Tarkett, the company went public to acquire expansion funds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1970 Tarkett, Sweden's #1 flooring manufacturer, was acquired by the conglomerate Swedish Match. In the 1970s the company moved into industrial flooring and by 1979 Tarkett was the world's #6 flooring manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tarkett acquired New York-based GAF's flooring products division -- including three US plants -- in 1981 for $56 million. By the mid-1980s, the US accounted for 50% of Tarkett's sales while other countries as a whole contributed 80%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1986 Tarkett joined German flooring and carpeting manufacturer Pegulan to form Tarkett-Pegulan, headquartered in Frankenthal, Germany. The 1990s were a time of major restructuring, and Pegulan's merger into Tarkett was complete in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tarkett merged with the flooring division of France's Sommer Allibert (including Canadian vinyl producer Domco) in 1997 and became Tarkett Sommer AG. US-based Armstrong World Industries unsuccessfully tried to stop the merger, claiming Sommer Allibert violated an agreement with Armstrong -- which had bid to take over Domco.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1999 Tarkett was the world's #2 hardwood and vinyl flooring producer, with sales of $1.5 billion. But it also had enormous debt. To focus on its core product -- flooring manufacturing -- Tarkett sold LMS (two French flooring distribution subsidiaries, DFA and Arvial) to British group Headlam in 1999 and sold its vinyl foils production unit to plastic film producer Renolit AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   Domco acquired Tarkett North America and the companies merged into Domco Tarkett Inc. in 1999. The Pennsylvania vinyl flooring plant was closed, laying off 42% of Tarkett's North American staff (280 employees). That year Tarkett formed a laminated flooring production joint venture with Austrian group Egger. In 2000 Sommer Allibert was sold to Faurecia, an Italian maker of automotive components; the former controlling shareholders of Sommer Allibert then used the proceeds to buy Tarkett Sommer. Later, the company changed its name to Tarkett AG.
