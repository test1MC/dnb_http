   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) designs, engineers, and makes passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, components and production systems worldwide. Its automotive brands include Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram, SRT, and Maserati, as well as Mopar, its parts and service brand. FCA's businesses also include Comau (production systems), Magneti Marelli (components) and Teksid (iron and castings). It spun off its Ferrari business in January 2016, which established
   <company id="59581">
    Ferrari N.V.
   </company>
   as the new holding company of the Ferrari group. FCA was formed in 2014 through the merger of two world-renowned car manufacturers, Fiat (founded in 1899) and Chrysler (1925).

  <p>
   Fiat Chrysler is the seventh largest automaker in the world. In 2015 it shipped 4.7 million vehicles, of which 2.6 million sales were rung up in the NAFTA region and 1.2 in EMEA. Activities are carried out through six reportable segments: four regional vehicle segments - NAFTA (North America and the Caribbean); LATAM (Latin America); APAC (the Asia-Pacific region including India); and EMEA (Western Europe, the Middle East and Africa) - Maserati, the company's global luxury brand segment; and a global Components segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The NAFTA region, the largest segment by sales at around 58% of total, comprises the North American countries (including the Caribbean). The Components segment produces lighting components, suspension, electronic systems and cast-iron components for engines and gearboxes, to list just a few.

  <p>
   FCA has operations in about 40 countries and generates sales in more than 150. It has nearly 160 plants and 80 research and development centers around the globe. The NAFTA region is the company's largest by sales numbers at around 58% of total (of which the US makes up 85%). In Europe, FCA makes around 45% of vehicle sales in Italy.

  <p>
   Total sales climbed to €110.6 billion in 2015 from €93.6 billion the prior year, an 18% rise - despite the sale of Ferrari, which was counted as a discontinued operation. Sales growth for the year was uneven and weighted heavily towards the North America segment, which grew €17 billion. €10 billion of this sales growth was attributable to favorable exchange rate effects, but €5 billion came from an increase in vehicle sales, with the Jeep and Ram brands showing high demand. The new Jeep Renegade also proved popular in the EMEA segment, and along with the new Fiat 500X helped the region to €1.9 billion sales growth. The APAC, LATAM and Maserati segments all recorded falls in revenue due to a decline in sales volume, while Components was up by around €1 billion
  </p>
  <p>
   Net profit has fallen dramatically in the last two years despite solid sales growth, from €2.0 billion in 2013 to just €400 million in 2015, mostly due to a fall in net profit from continuing operations but also due to an exceptional item in 2013. Against 2014, net profit still fell by 40%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow was up by around €2 billion in 2015 on the back of an increase in numbers of vehicle sales, as well as the sale of 10% of Ferrari common shares, which brought in €900 million.

  <p>
   FCA spun off its Ferrari business in the beginning of January 2016 in an effort to strengthen FCA's capital base and fund its ambitious expansion plans; there are no current plans to sell the company's other luxury car like Alfa Romeo and Maserati.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward, FCA is targeting growth in North America through increased momentum from its newer brands, including Jeep Renegade and Jeep Cherokee. The Jeep brand has grown in all regions for six consecutive years. To make the most of the shift in consumer preference towards utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the NAFTA region, FCA is shaking up its manufacturing capacity in the region to better meet demand for Ram pickup trucks and Jeep vehicles, and is discontinuing production of the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart passenger cars. This incurred a cost of €834 million. FCA is also looking to expand the Jeep brand in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, and to that end is setting up localized production plants.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reduced demand from China for premium and imported vehicles has necessitated a slowing of investment in the Alfa Romeo brand, but FCA still aims to invest in expansion of Alfa Romeo in North and Latin America, and Europe.
