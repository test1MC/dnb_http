  <p>
   WMG reported $3.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016. That was an increase of about $300 million compared to the $2.9 billion the company reported for revenue the prior fiscal year. However, the extremely high cost of doing business means that WMG has either suffered a net loss or claimed a very modest net income in recent fiscal years.

  <p>
   Like all companies in the music business, WMG struggles in the face of plummeting CD sales and slow growth in paid digital downloading. The company has responded to the difficulties in the market by embracing new technologies such as ringtones, videos, and downloaded songs and albums.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016, WMG acquired Stockholm, Sweden based X5 Music Group. X5 specializes in licensing deep catalog and specific genres of music to create playlists, streaming and download products.
