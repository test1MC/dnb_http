   Britvic gives thirst a healthy swift kick. Founded in the 1930s as British Vitamin Products, the company has grown to manufacture and market a range of bottled juices, carbonated and still beverages, sports drinks, and water. It is second only to

    Coca-Cola
   </company>
   in volume sales in the UK. Britvic's brands, including Robinsons, drench, J2O, Tango, and MiWadi and Ballygowan in Ireland, are distributed mainly across the UK, Ireland, and France. In Brazil, the company's popular drinks are Maguaray and DaFruta. The company produces juices under the Teisseire, Fruité, and other labels, as well as syrups, through French subsidiary Britvic France.

  <p>
   Britvic pours its liquid assets into five segments: still drinks, carbonated drinks, and three geographic segments. The company gets much of its fizz from its carbonated business, which generated 44% of revenue in 2015 (ended September). Still beverages accounted for 25% of revenue. On either side of the Sceptered Isle, France bought 25% of Britvic's product and the company did about 9% of its business in Ireland. The international segment accounted for 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The operations in the international segment include Britvic interests in the US, Europe (beyond France), and Asia, including India and Singapore. Production and distribution of Britvic products in the US is done through the company's agreements with a number of Pepsi bottlers and the Pepsi distribution network. Britvic packages and distributes Pepsi products in the UK.

  <p>
   About three quarters of Britvic's revenue pours on from the UK with France accounting for some 19% and Ireland and other markets topping it off with about 8%.

  <p>
   Britvic sold more than 2.1 billion liters of soft drinks in 2015 (ended September), which was about a 1% increase from 2014. The average realized price, however, was 1.5% lower in 2015 leading to a 0.6% revenue decrease for the year. The company had revenue declines across all major business and geographic segments in 2015 compared to 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profit rose 14% as it reduced administrative costs and expenses for sales and distribution.

  <p>
   Britvic introduces new products in many of its categories including a no-sugar-added version of its Robinsons drinks. The lack of sugar took some of the buzz out of Robinsons sales in 2015, but the company maintains that the brand is positioned to grow with an increasing consumer preference for "better for you" products. Some of its new products were in the Teisseire and J2 O Spritz labels. Brtivic tries to make products in their markets to reduce distribution costs. That's what it did with the Tessiere Fruit Shoot drink by moving production to France.

  <p>
   Britvic remains committed to international expansion although one foreign market isn't growing as robustly as expected and another faces economic headwinds of its own. The company is disappointed in its US sales, but increasing is presence and revenue there is a priority. Its acquisition of Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos SA (EBBA) puts Britvic squarely in the Brazilian market. Brazil faces difficult economic issues, but the funding structure for the deal keeps half of the consideration deferred until 2017.

  <p>
   Britvic made the deal for EBBA in 2015 for £120.8 million. Brazil is the sixth largest soft drink market and the largest concentrate market in the world. The company intends to infuse its business and distribution practices into the acquisition, building on the EBBA brand. It will, of course, introduce Britvic brands to the Brazilian market.
