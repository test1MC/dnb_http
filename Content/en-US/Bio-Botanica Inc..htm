   Bio-Botanica can help extract all sorts of goodness out of life. The company develops and manufactures a variety of botanical extracts used by customers  throughout the US and internationally, in the nutraceutical, food and beverage, and cosmetics industries. Bio-Botanica's more than 500 extracts come in solid, semi-solid, powdered, and liquid forms and are used as both active ingredients and preservatives in products ranging from teas to soaps and homeopathic remedies. The company also produces its own line of consumer products, including extracts and blended nutritional supplements, which are sold through retailers under the Nature's Answer brand. The family-owned Bio-Botanica was founded in 1972 by CEO Frank D'Amelio.
