   Xaar has three business segments:
  </p>
  <p>
   -- The industrial, which includes ceramic tile decoration, decorative laminate, and advanced/additive manufacturing processes. It accounted for two-thirds of revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   -- The packing segment includes coding and marking, primary labels, and Direct-to-Shape printing, and it accounted for 17% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   -- The Graphic Arts segment includes big-format graphics. It accounted for 10% of revenue in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also has revenue from royalties, which bring the last 7% of revenue.

  <p>
   Xaar makes half its sales to customers in the EMEA region and another third goes to customers in China. Japan and the Americas each account for 7% of revenue with other countries providing 2%.

  <p>
   Sales and profit dropped in 2015 while cash flow rose.
  </p>
  <p>
   Xaar's revenue stumbled some 18% with a slowdown in the Chinese market resulting in lower industrial sales. Graphics revenue also slowed with some products reaching their maturation points.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sales drop and higher cost for administrative and research and development costs resulted in a 36% fall in profits in 2015 from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow, however, rose in 2015 from 2014 on an increase in depreciation and changes in inventories.

   Xaar is moving into new areas of printing to prime the pump for growth. The company added an academic researcher to lead its efforts in 3D printing, an area that Xaar believes will deliver significant returns in the coming years. The company also seeks to build on its ceramic tile decoration business and add textiles and wide-format printing to the Thin Film printhead the company is bringing to market. The company has a healthy research and development budget, which represents some 20% of revenue. Its R&amp;D staff accounts for about a quarter of its work force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Xaar also intends to use its trove of cash for acquisitions.
