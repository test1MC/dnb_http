   For more than a century, beers from Asahi Breweries have been quenching the thirst of the Japanese public. Asahi Breweries is a leading beer company in Japan, commanding some 50% of the country's beer market. Asahi's portfolio of beer products is anchored by its Asahi Super Dry brand, but it also includes low-malt and no-malt beers (sold under the Asahi Honnama and Asahi Shinnama brands) and other beverages such as whiskey and
   <em>

   </em>
   . In addition to alcoholic beverages, Asahi makes coffee drinks, soft drinks, teas, and water, along with food products, baby food, and nutritional supplements. It owns about 20% of China's
   <company id="43060">
    Tsingtao Brewery
   </company>
   . In 2016 Asahi made two key acquisitions from beer giant
   <company id="43712">
    AB InBev
   </company>
   : the company's Eastern European business, including assets in Poland and the Czech Republic, for $7.8 billion, and its Grolsch, Peroni, and Meantime beer brands, for $2.85 billion.

   Under the leadership of president Naoki Izumiya, who took the reins in early 2010, the Japanese brewer has been working to lessen its dependence on beer. Asahi has increased its presence across all liquor categories and turned its attention to acquiring manufacturers of soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages in the Asia-Oceania region. (Alcoholic drinks contribute substantially to Asahi's revenues; in addition to having brewing and distribution deals with

   .) The firm has also set its sights on becoming a heavyweight in food sales worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Asahi's strategy to increase its focus beyond brew is the logical culmination of a slew of deals the company has made over the past several years. Notable deals have included 2005's purchase of the former Kanebo's (now
   <company id="55035">
    Kracie Holdings
   </company>
   ) majority stake in drink producer LB Ltd., maker of oolong, green, and other teas, as well as yogurt-based chilled drinks. Continuing its diversification, in subsequent years Asahi acquired baby-food maker Wakodo Co. and 80% of Amano Jitsugyo, a maker of freeze-dried foods and powdered seasonings. One of its more recent deals was the 2010 purchase of the mineral water business of House Foods, Oi Shii Mizu, for 짜5.3 billion ($57 million). Also that year it acquired Australian soft drink maker P&amp;N Beverages for A$364 million (US$322 million) and the Rokujo Mugicha barley tea brand from Japan's
   <company id="105264">
    Kagome
   </company>
   . Asahi is also spending 짜3 billion ($36 million) to acquire the shares it does not already own in processed foods company Amamo Jitsugyo, chilled beverage producer LB Co., and soft drink maker Elbee Co., which will make the firms wholly owned subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2011 Asahi formed a stock holding company for its food and beverage subsidiaries. The holding company intends to ease the integration of acquired businesses into Asahi's corporate structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   To counter declining domestic demand for beer, the company is working to expand its international presence, exporting its Asahi Super Dry brand to markets in North America, Europe, South Korea, and other Asian countries. The Japanese brewer, which already has a partnership with South Korea's Lotte Group to distribute its Super Dry beer brand, is believed to be looking to deepen its ties to Lotte in the soft drinks market. In China Asahi has a distribution agreement with
   <company id="41870">
    ITOCHU
   </company>
   to sell beverages there through Tingyi-Asahi-Itochu Beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
   Focused on the bottom line, the firm has also been offloading holdings that have been unprofitable. This was the case when Asahi in late 2010 sold its 58% stake in South Korea's Haitai Beverage to LG Household and Healthcare for a paltry 짜757 (equivalent to $9). LG Household and Healthcare also took over Haitai's roughly 짜9 billion (about $110 million) in debt.
