   Salix Pharmaceuticals is a finishing school for drugs. With a focus on treating gastrointestinal ailments, the company prefers to acquire drug candidates nearing commercial viability. It then takes them through the final development stages and brings them to market. The company's marketed products include Xifaxan (an antibiotic for gastrointestinal troubles), Pepcid (gastric ulcers and acid reflux), and Apriso and Colazal (for ulcerative colitis). Other products include colonoscopy preparatory bowel purgatives MoviPrep, OsmoPrep, and Visicol. Its late-stage candidates include both new drugs and new uses for existing drugs.

    Valeant Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   bought Salix in a $10.1 billion transaction in 2015.

        <p>
   In 2015 Salix agreed to be acquired by Canadian pharmaceutical Valeant for some $10.1 billion. The deal -- the largest yet for Valeant -- combines Salix's gastrointestinal franchise with Valeant's growing portfolio of specialty treatments and is expected to yield more than $500 million in cost savings annually.

        <p>
   The company's biggest seller is Xifaxan (rifaximin), an antibiotic that has the ability to get into the gut but not into the bloodstream. The drug is approved as a treatment for travelers' diarrhea and other disorders, and Salix is looking to expand its indications. Other medicines include fecal incontinence medication Solesta and Deflux, a treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (a malformation of the bladder in children). The company launched a new proprietary product in 2012 after receiving
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval for Fulyzaq, which treats diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients.
  </p>
        <p>
   Salix's Colazal, Anusol, Pepcid, and Proctocort brands are mature with no patent protection, but enjoy name brand recognition.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the drug development realm, Salix avoids the riskier, capital intensive process of early-stage research by sticking strictly to late stage trials and commercialization activities. It holds the development and marketing rights to many of its products through long-standing licensing agreements with other drug companies. It also sidesteps the expense of maintaining manufacturing facilities by relying on third-party manufacturers to produce its materials.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Salix primarily conducts sales in the US market, though it has limited commercial drug operations in Europe and about 20 countries in other global regions.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Salix's direct sales and marketing teams primarily targets US gastroenterologists, as well as colorectal surgeons, hepatologists, and other medical professionals. The company has a small direct sales force in Europe, and it uses independent distributors in Europe and other regions. Advertising expenses totaled about $21 million in 2012, up from $11 million the previous year.

        <p>
   Salix has truly enjoyed the payoff of drug development and other growth efforts in recent years. Revenues increased 36% to $735 million in 2012 due to higher sales of Xifaxan, Apriso, Deflux, and Relistor. Revenues jumped 60% in 2011 due, in part, to expanded indications for Xifaxan, strong sales of purgatives, and new products from acquisitions.
  </p>
        <p>
   The revenue jump in 2011 also helped to give the company its first positive net income report since 2007; another profit of $36 million was reported in 2012, down 26% from the prior year due to increased expenses from sales force expansion and acquisition efforts.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Salix is investing heavily in developing the Xifaxan antibiotic for additional uses, including irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease. It also aims to license or develop new late-stage pharmaceuticals and bring development-stage candidates to market.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   To keep its operations nimble in the face of future additional patent expirations, Salix depends on regular shopping trips to keep its pipeline well stocked. Sometimes it buys the rights to develop a candidate, and sometimes it buys whole portfolios that include approved and marketed drugs.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 it paid $10 million for the licensing rights to an extended-release version of rifaximin, with plans to use it as a treatment for Crohn's disease. Its 2011 purchase of US drugmaker Oceana Therapeutics added gastroenterology and urology therapeutics, including Solesta and Deflux; the buy also added international operations, as both drugs are sold overseas. The company also licensed rights to another drug, Relistor, which was launched in the US later that year.
