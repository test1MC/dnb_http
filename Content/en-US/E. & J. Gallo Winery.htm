   E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery brings merlot to the masses. The company is the world's largest family-owned winemaker, thanks in part to value-jug and -box labels Carlo Rossi and Peter Vella. The vintner owns nine wineries and some 16,000 acres of California vineyards; it also contracts with other growers statewide to meet its supply needs. It is the leading US exporter of California wine, selling some 60 brands, including table and sparkling wines, and imports 14 of its name brands from countries dotting the globe. Gallo Family Vineyards Sonoma Reserve and the Italian wine Ecco Domani are among its premium wines and imports. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery was established in 1933 and is still owned and run by the family.

   For a stiffer drink, Gallo offers several distilled spirits, including gin and tequila. The two brands of distilled spirits include New Amsterdam Gin and Familia Camarena Tequila. The vintner also imports and sells wine from Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Africa, and New Zealand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the vintner makes its own labels and bottles through subsidiary Gallo Glass Company.

   The company aims to fuel growth through an expansion of its international presence. In 2014 the company earned the exclusive rights to distribute Italy's Allegrini wines in the US. Nestled in the Valpolicella region, Allegrini Estates produces several noteworthy wines. In 2012 it inked a distribution deal to distribute Italy's Brancaia wines in the US. As part of the distribution deal, E. &amp; J. Gallo sells Brancaia's portfolio of wines, which include Brancaia Chianti Classico, Brancaia Tre (Sangiovese, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon), Brancaia Ilatraia (Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Petite Verdot), Brancaia Il Blu (Sangiovese, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon).
  </p>
  <p>
   Gallo's dominance in the US market has grown from a focus on popularly priced wines. Pursuing a broader domestic base, it has extended its range of prices and products, from alcohol-added wines and wine coolers to mid-priced and imported varietals that fetch more than $50 a bottle. A number of premium wines, including Whitehaven and Frei Brothers, debuted with the Gallo name omitted to keep the company's reputation for ubiquity from tarnishing the tony brands.

   Amid a competitive lower-end market, the company is targeting consumer niches through sponsoring pro volleyball tournaments and other events. Concurrently, it has buffed the image of certain California wines with genteel names (Gallo Family Vineyards) and removed the Ernest &amp; Julio tag from packaging and advertising for those labels. The changes reflect Gallo's strong research and development capacity both in wine processing and positioning. A Research Winery facility produces between 400- to 700-pilot wines a year based on reams of data gathered at wine tastings as well as from retailers, distributors, and social media listening programs.

  <p>
   Giuseppe Gallo, the father of Ernest and Julio Gallo, was born in 1882 in the wine country of northwest Italy. Around 1900 he and his brother, Michelo (they called themselves Joe and Mike), traveled to America seeking fame and fortune in San Francisco. Both brothers became wealthy growing grapes and anticipating the growth of the market during Prohibition (homemade wine was legal and popular).
  </p>
  <p>
   Giuseppe's eldest sons, Ernest and Julio, worked with their father from the beginning, but their relationship was strained. The father was reluctant to help his sons, particularly Ernest, in business. However, the mysterious murder-suicide that ended the lives of Giuseppe and his wife in 1933 eliminated that problem: The sons inherited the business their father had been unwilling to share.
  </p>
  <p>
   From then on, Ernest ran the business end, assembling a large distribution network and building a national brand, while Julio made the wine and Joe Jr., the third, much younger, brother, worked for them. In the early 1940s Gallo opened bottling plants in Los Angeles and New Orleans, using screw-cap bottles, which then seemed more hygienic and modern than corks. Gallo lagged during WWII, when alcohol was diverted for the military. Under Julio's supervision, it upgraded its planting stock and refined its technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an attempt to capitalize on the sweet wines popular in the 1950s, Gallo introduced Thunderbird, a fortified wine (its alcohol content boosted to 20%), in 1957. In the 1960s Gallo spurred its growth by heavily advertising and keeping prices low. It introduced Hearty Burgundy, a jug wine, in 1964, along with Ripple. Gallo introduced the carbonated, fruit-flavored Boone's Farm Apple Wine in 1969, creating short-term interest in "pop" wines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Julio Gallo died in 1993 at the age of 83. His brother Ernest lived to be 97 before passing away in 2007.
