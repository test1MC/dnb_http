The company, which is the US arm of Germany-based STIHL International, makes chain saws, edgers, leaf blowers, saw chains, trimmers, and other landscaping tools and components. STIHL Incorporated markets its products, which are protected by more than 1,000 patents, through a dozen corporate distribution centers and independent wholesalers. Its tools are sold by some 8,000 independent tool and hardware retailers (you won't find them at big box home stores) throughout the US and exported to more than 90 countries. The US-based marketing and manufacturing unit was established in 1974.

   STIHL, which sells its products through independent service dealers, is seeing rising demand for electric lawn and garden equipment as consumers shift away from traditional gas-powered products. Electric equipment is generally perceived as more environmentally friendly and typically carries a smaller price tag than its gas-driven counterparts. To service this growing consumer group, STIHL is working to lower the emissions of its gas-powered gear while adding more corded electric products to its lineup.
