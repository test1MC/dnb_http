   R.C. Bigelow is happiest when it's in hot water. It blends and sells black, green, white, herbal, decaffeinated, iced, loose teas, and coconut water with its teas under the Bigelow brand name. Constant Comment -- a blend of black tea, orange peel, and spices -- is its original and still popular product among the company's more than 120 tea varieties. Bigelow teas are produced at plants in Connecticut, Idaho, and Kentucky and are available nationwide through grocery retailers, mass merchandisers, and the foodservice industry. Bigelow sells tea and tea accessories directly to consumers through its website and catalog. Founded by Ruth Campbell Bigelow in 1945, it's still owned and operated by the Bigelow family.

   Setting itself apart from rivals, such as

    Celestial Seasonings
   </company>
   , which tends to source its herbs and teas abroad, Bigelow operates the Charleston Tea Plantation. The facility was acquired and restored to operation and is the only tea plantation in the US. Its several hundred thousand tea bushes are descended from those brought to this country from China and India in the 1800s.

   The tea maker has begun to benefit from the return of tea parties as more mainstream activities. As more consumers chose staycations over taking trips abroad during the economic downturn, tea drinkers -- young and old -- shared their love of tea through home parties with friends and family.
