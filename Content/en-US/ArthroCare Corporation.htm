   With the wave of a wand, ArthroCare can make tissue disappear. The company's proprietary Coblation technology (one of several of its technologies) uses bipolar radiofrequency energy to remove and shape cartilage and tendons and other soft tissues. Its specialized wands focus the energy and minimize damage to nearby healthy tissue, simultaneously sealing small bleeding vessels. First used in arthroscopic procedures to repair joints, the electrosurgery system line now includes equipment used in a wide range of minimally invasive surgeries. The company also makes ligament repair, spinal stabilization, and wound-care products. ArthroCare was acquired by

   in 2014.

  <p>
   While the US accounts for about 65% of ArthroCare's annual product sales, the company also sells its medical equipment in other parts of the Americas and in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. It has an operating presence in countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   The company has two core product segments: sports medicine, which generates more than 60% of its total sales, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT), which brings in about 30% of sales. Each product segment features ArthroCare's Coblation-based systems, which comprise a radiofrequency controller and single-use devices designed for various applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also makes limited spine and wound care products, and it earns royalties by licensing its technologies to other entities. Additionally, ArthroCare provides contract manufacturing services, using its technologies to make disposable surgical devices and implants for other companies.

  <p>
   The company uses a direct sales force in markets including the US, Western Europe, Australia, and Singapore, as well as through third-party and independent distributors in other markets. Customers include surgeons and other specialized medical professionals.

  <p>
   ArthroCare has seen but steady growth in sales over the past decade as it has expanded its product lines and geographic reach, with the exception of flat revenue returns in 2008 and 2011. Revenues increased by 4% to some $368 million in 2012 due to growth in the sports medicine (4%) and ENT (5%) product lines. Sports medicine showed growth from sales of new and existing Coblation and fixation products in the US and abroad, while the ENT increase reflected stabilized backorders of certain products in the US, as well as increased sales in the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite having several commercialized products, the firm is largely a development-stage company and as such struggles to balance earnings with operating, sales, and R&amp;D expenses.

  <p>
   The company is working to leverage its technologies -- especially the core Coblation system -- towards providing comprehensive surgical device offerings in fields including sports medicine, ENT, spine, wound care, urology, and gynecology. Other R&amp;D projects focus on the development of reusable surgical instruments, as well as the OPUS technology for fixation devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   ArthroCare is also working to widen the geographic availability of its products, as well as its distribution capabilities in the domestic market. For instance in 2012 the firm transferred some US sports medicine distribution operations from stocking distributors to sales agency territories, which resulted in an increase in revenues that year. It also pursues selected acquisition and partnership opportunities.
