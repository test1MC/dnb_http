   TV Guide Magazine is glued to the tube. The company publishes the weekly TV-focused print publication
   <em>
    TV Guide
   </em>
   . Formerly an iconic pocket-sized digest, the publication was re-formatted to a standard-sized, full-color magazine in 2005.
   <em>
    TV Guide
   </em>
   earns money through subscriptions and advertising, and has a circulation of about 2 million readers. TV Guide Magazine is owned by private-equity firm OpenGate Capital, which purchased the company from Macrovision Solutions Corporation (later renamed
   <company id="52934">
    Rovi Corporation
   </company>
   ) for $1 in 2008. Macrovision loaned OpenGate $9.5 million to finance the magazine. (Other TV Guide holdings, including Internet and cable TV assets, were sold to movie and TV studio
   <company id="57849">
    Lionsgate
   </company>
   .)

   United Video Satellite Group (UVSG) was founded in 1965 to develop a microwave network to provide programming to cable systems. Lawrence Flinn Jr. acquired a majority interest in 1976, and two years later the company entered the satellite market when it began transmitting WGN. UVSG introduced its first satellite-delivered program-promotion and guide service in 1981. It formed Superstar Connection in 1986 to market satellite services to consumers. The company went public in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced Prevue Express Plus Video (program listings and on-demand previews) in 1995. TCI (now AT&amp;T Broadband) acquired a controlling interest in UVSG in 1996. That year UVSG merged Superstar with (then) TCI unit Liberty Media's Netlink to create the #1 US provider of programming for C-band satellite receivers. Flinn resigned as CEO in 1997 and was replaced by TCI executive Gary Howard. In 1999 UVSG bought
   <i>
    TV Guide
   </i>
   from News Corp. for $800 million and a 44% interest. It changed its name to TV Guide, Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    TV Guide
   </i>
   was launched in 1953 by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg's Triangle Publications. Annenberg had bought out several regional publications including
   <i>
    TV Forecast
   </i>
   (Chicago) and
   <i>
    TeleVision Guide
   </i>
   (New York) to start the magazine. With its mix of listings, celebrity gossip, and industry news, and its lack of competition,
   <i>
    TV Guide
   </i>
   grew to a circulation of 17 million by 1988. That year News Corp. paid $3.2 billion for
   <i>
    TV Guide
   </i>
   and other Triangle holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the acquisition by UVSG, News Corp. executive Anthea Disney took over for Howard as chairman and CEO of TV Guide. She quit four months later and was replaced by former president Joe Kiener. Later in 1999 the company expanded into Europe through its purchase of a majority stake in Infomedia. In 2000 the company was acquired by Gemstar International for an eye-popping $14 billion, becoming a subsidiary of the new company Gemstar-TV Guide International. In 2001 TV Guide Online launched a Web guide, which highlights various Internet events. The company named a new head in 2002, former PRIMEDIA executive John Loughlin. That year Annenberg, the original publisher of
   <i>
    TV Guide
   </i>
   , died following a bout of pneumonia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold off most of its satellite holdings in 2004. In 2005, shortly after the company announced it would revamp
   <em>
    TV Guide
   </em>
   as a full-size entertainment magazine, Loughlin resigned to take a post with Hearst Magazines. Gemstar-TV Guide chairman Anthea Disney replaced him on an interim basis; she was replaced by Scott Crystal.
  </p>
  <p>
   The magazine was acquired by private equity firm Open Gate Capital in 2008, operating under the corporate entity TV Guide Magazine. (TVGuide.com and the interactive/cable TV assets of Gemstar-TV Guide were eventually sold to Lionsgate and One Equity Partners.) Unhappy with the new owners, in 2009 Crystal resigned. He was replaced by Jack Kliger, who oversaw major cost-cutting efforts at the magazine.
