   Stabilizer and additives are needed to make a thermoplastic material like PVC stronger for use in window and door profiles. The three main stabilizer technologies used in the UK and Europe for PVC-U and PVC-UE extrusions are lead, tin, and calcium organic. Kestrel makes environmentally-friendly PVC-U products that use 100% calcium organic stabilizers, with no lead and no tin.
