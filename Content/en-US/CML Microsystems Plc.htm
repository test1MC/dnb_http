   CML Microsystems designs, manufactures, and markets mixed-signal (analog plus digital) microchips for various industries through subsidiaries in the UK, US, Germany, and Singapore. CML designs its products to fill specialized functional niches in wireless (military communications and radio), storage (solid-state drives and removable memory), wireline telecom (traditional telephony and converged communications), and networking (industrial networking and automation, security, building automation) applications. CML gets 96% of sales from outside the UK.

  <p>
   Customers in the Asia-Pacific region generate nearly 50% of CML's sales. Sales from Europe and the Americas run fairly even at around 23% of the company's revenue. Home country UK customers buy about 4% of the company's products.
  </p>
  <p>
   CML operates sales and technical support offices in Essex, UK, Konstanz, Germany, Winston-Salem (North Carolina), US, Singapore, Taipei, and Shanghai and is supported by a global network of distributors and manufacturer's representatives.

  <p>
   Revenue fell 11% in 2015 (ended March) from 2013 with declines in all its product lines. The 9% drop in storage sales in 2014 was blamed on disruption at a customer. Revenue in the second half of the year offered expectations of higher sales in 2016. In wireless, slower government purchases cut sales by about 10%.
  </p>
  <p>
   CML's profit fell 43% in 2015 compared to 2014 because of amortization charges associated with increased development spending.
