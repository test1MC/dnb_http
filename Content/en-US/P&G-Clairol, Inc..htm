   Based in Connecticut, P&amp;G-Clairol serves consumers in North America, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.

   Clairol offers several hair-coloring options, including permanent, demi-permanent, and semi-permanent hair colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates as part of P&amp;G's Beauty segment, which generated some 24% of its parent's fiscal 2013 revenue. P&amp;G's hair care and color business accounted for 11% of sales.

  <p>
   To cater to more customers, P&amp;G-Clairol has been working to broaden and deepen its products portfolio, such as creating a brand extension for its Nice 'n Easy line called Perfect 10. The company continues to expand its hair-care items to target a more diverse customer base.
  </p>
  <p>
   Banking on its existing brands and morphing them to attract new audiences also allows P&amp;G to sidestep pricey research and development costs, which it already incurs for several of its other brands. Additionally, P&amp;G-Clairol is not one of P&amp;G's billion-dollar brands, so investing further in a second-tier brand is not prudent.

  <p>
   While its parent does not report separate financials for P&amp;G-Clairol, the consumer products company reports that its Beauty segment's net sales dropped some 2% in fiscal 2013 to $20 billion. It lost more than half a point in global market share of the hair care and color category. The company logged continued low single-digit increases in developing regions thanks to innovation and market growth, despite low single-digit drops in developed regions from reduced shipments.
