  <p>
   East Penn has operations in US, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Bahamas, and in Central and South America. It has more than 90 warehouses and distribution centers in North America.

  <p>
   East Penn's growth strategy involves expanding its line of batteries and adding space in order to enhance its manufacturing and warehousing capacities to meet the rising demand for its battery products. In 2013 the company invested more than $50 million to construct a 458,000 sq. ft. battery manufacturing plant in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The move allows East Penn to produce batteries that will accommodate the company's growth in strategic areas and markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The expansion of wireless telecommunications and data storage companies and their need for battery backup systems has been a boon for the battery industry, and batteries for uninterruptible power supply systems are expected to be a growth area. (The company's wide range of customers helped during a time of sluggish demand within the automotive industry; as a result, the loss of business for East Penn was minimal compared with companies that were heavily dependent on US automotive manufacturers).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 East Penn launched Deka Fahrenheit, a revolutionary heat-tolerant valve-regulated lead acid monobloc battery.
