   Grupo Industrial Lala (dba Lala) loves lactation (and making a living by selling the products of lactation). The company is the largest dairy producer in Mexico, and the second largest in the US, through its holdings in
   <company id="104464">
    National Dairy
   </company>
   and
   <company id="113861">
    Farmland Dairies
   </company>
   . Lala makes milk (pasteurized and ultra high temperature), cheese, yogurt, cream, butter, juice, and packaged desserts such as gelatin and flan under about a dozen brands in Mexico. Ultra high temperature milk does not need to be refrigerated and can last for about three months. In the US, operating as Lala Foods Inc., it offers milk, cheese, sour cream, and yogurt under the Lala and Vive brands, as well as a kids' line called Yomi.

   Lala operates more than 36 manufacturing plants and 239 distribution centers in Mexico, Central America (Guatemala), and the US. More than half of its distribution centers are located in Mexico.

   Lala has grown through acquisitions paired with investments in current operations. Lala reportedly made a bid for a controlling stake in Yoplait (owned by PAI Partners and Sodiaal) in 2011, but was beaten out by
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   ' $1.2 billion offer.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also relies on product innovations and refreshing its brands to gain or maintain market share. In 2012 the company launched eight new products to market, including Drinkable Yoghurt flavor Fruggis Mora (Captain America), Drinkable Yoghurt flavor LALA Moras (Black Widow), Drinkable Yoghurt Lemon Fruggis Apple flavor (Hulk), Drinkable Yoghurt Pineapple - Mango flavor LALA (Thor), and Drinkable Yoghurt Berries flavor LALA (Iron Man).

   Lala gained access to more than 25 states following its acquisition of two of the biggest dairy producers in the US in 2009. In addition to increasing its footprint, LaLa added brands with established appeal for more affluent North American consumers. Farmland Dairies continues to operate under its own name brands, while National Dairy (whose products are sold under the Borden, Dairy Fresh, Velda Farms, Coburg Dairy, and Promised Land labels) does business as Borden Dairy Company, a subsidiary of Lala.

   Lala entered the US market in 2005, investing $220 million to set up shop in Hispanic markets in Arizona, California, and Texas, at regional stores such as
   <company id="40210">

   . In 2008 it bought

   yogurt operations in Omaha, Nebraska. Operating as Gilsa Dairy, the Omaha plant produces Lala, Frusion (no longer a

   <company id="53912">

   -branded yogurts.

   Lala was founded in 1949 as a dairy collective in Mexico. The company's name comes from the area in Mexico where it's located, Comarca Lagunera, known as La Lagunera. The region around Torreon is home to hundreds of dairy farms that supply Lala.
