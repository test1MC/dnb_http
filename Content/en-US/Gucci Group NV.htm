   Gucci Group, an Italian company with a Dutch address that sells French fashion, does quite well in Japan, too. The fashion house makes and markets upscale handbags and other leather goods, shoes, ready-to-wear clothing, cosmetics, fragrances, skin care, jewelry, and watches. In addition to the Gucci brand, the company sells products under such major premium brands as Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent. Gucci operates more than 680 boutiques worldwide and wholesales its products through franchisees and high-end department stores. French retailer PPR (later renamed

   ) purchased almost all of the remaining shares in the company, taking its interest up to 99.9% in 2010.

  <p>
   Guccio Gucci began his leather goods business in Florence, Italy, in 1923, later fabricating a pedigree that said the family had been saddlemakers to Florence's aristocrats. In 1935 Gucci Group's leather supply was cut off when the League of Nations sanctioned Italy after Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. Gucci turned to making canvas bags trimmed with Italian leather.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1950s such luminaries as Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, and Queen Elizabeth patronized Gucci shops. The first American Gucci shop opened in New York in 1953. With Guccio's death that year, the company's reins passed to son Aldo, who turned the Gucci name into a global fashion brand. Through licensing, Aldo put his family's name on thousands of items. In 1974 the company launched its men's and women's ready-to-wear lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1980s Gucci was struggling. Family tensions had arisen when Aldo's son Paolo set out to sell products under the Paolo Gucci name. In 1983 Aldo's brother Rodolfo died, leaving his 50% stake in Gucci to son Maurizio, setting up a feud worthy of Italian opera. Paolo charged his father with tax evasion, and Aldo was forced out in 1984 and later sentenced to prison. Aldo and son Roberto accused Maurizio of forgery, but his one-year jail sentence on fraud charges was overturned.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Aldo faction sold its half of Gucci in 1987 to Investcorp, which had backed the buyout of Tiffany &amp; Co. Maurizio took Gucci's helm in 1989. To give Gucci goods more cachet, he reined in the rampant licensing of the Gucci name -- it had appeared on everything from key chains to scotch -- and reduced the number of outlets selling Gucci items. As a result, cash flow dwindled, and amid a global recession, Gucci lost money.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Investcorp bought out Maurizio, the last remaining Gucci involved in the company. (Maurizio was murdered in 1995; his ex-wife and four others were convicted in the slaying.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Investcorp named Gucci America chief Domenico De Sole president in 1994. De Sole turned Gucci around with the help of Tom Ford, a Gucci designer since 1990. Ford's early 1995 collections struck runway gold as he combined Italian quality with an American-inspired look. Investcorp took Gucci public in 1995 and sold the rest of its stake in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Italian fashion house Prada revealed in 1998 that it had acquired a 9.5% stake in Gucci. Prada sold its stake to LVMH in 1999. Gucci issued millions of new shares, diluting LVMH's stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 French retailer PPR (then named Pinault-Printemps-Redoute) paid $2.9 billion for more than 40% of Gucci. (Gucci again issued new shares, diluting LVMH's stake.) In addition, Artemis -- the company that controls PPR -- bought the beauty business of French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Beauté and sold it to Gucci for about $960 million. It was renamed YSL Beauté. The deal included Yves Saint Laurent's (YSL) non-couture business and such fragrances as Oscar de la Renta. Gucci also bought 70% of Italian shoemaker Calzaturificio Sergio Rossi.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Gucci appointed Ford creative director of YSL, replacing YSL co-founder Pierre Berge. Ford remained creative director for Gucci Group. Gucci also upped the ante in its rivalry with LVMH when it bought Swiss luxury firm Boucheron (jewelry, watches, and fragrances) for $144.8 million. The company also bought back its YSL licenses and the factory that makes its womenswear. As LVMH continued to fight PPR and Gucci in court, Gucci took the catfight to the catwalk and bought 51% of Alexander McQueen, the eponymous label of LVMH's Givenchy designer. Gucci then bought 85% of Swiss luxury watchmaker Bedat &amp; Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001 it bought about 67% of Bottega Veneta, an Italian luxury leather goods company, and agreed to acquire Di Modolo, a watch production facility, and Di Modolo Associates, its design studio. Also in 2001 Gucci snagged Chloe designer Stella McCartney (daughter of Beatles co-founder Paul McCartney) from Richemont. PPR paid $806.5 million for LVMH's stake in Gucci in October, which resulted in PPR owning 53.2% of Gucci.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2003 Gucci purchased a 70% stake in Italian footwear company Pigini SRL. And in 2004 the company took control of the remaining stake in Calzaturificio Sergio Rossi.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 PPR made a tender offer in order to complete the buyout for close to $9 billion. Robert Polet was named CEO of Gucci Group in July 2004. Patrizio Di Marco took over as CEO in 2009.
