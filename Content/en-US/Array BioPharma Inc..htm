   Array BioPharma wants to offer cancer sufferers a multitude of treatment options. The development-stage biopharmaceutical company has a handful of programs in its development pipeline, including three late-stage cancer candidates. Clinical trials in progress include cancer drugs binimetinib, encorafenib, and selumetinib, as well as hematology drug filanesib (for multiple myeloma) and ARRY-797 for Lamin A/C-related dilated cardiomyopathy. Commercial partners include
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10628">
    Genentech
   </company>
   . The company also has R&amp;D or commercialization agreements with ASLAN, Cascadian Therapeutics, Loxo, Pierre Fabre VentiRx, and
   <company id="41787">
    Roche
   </company>
   . Array grants distribution rights when it partners with other companies.

  <p>
   Array focuses on discovering, developing, and commercializing cancer drugs. It does this by inventing targeted small molecule drugs that have little or no competition or are superior to existing drugs on the market. As the company nears commercializing its first products, it plans to establish a sales force to promote its offerings.

  <p>
   Europe is Array BioPharma's largest market, bringing in more than 80% of total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has offices in Colorado, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.

  <p>
   Array is dependent on collaborations, out-licensing agreements, and up-front fees to fund its operations. These transactions bring in substantially all of the company's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended June), revenue grew 166% to $137.9 million, up from $51.9 million in 2015. More than $100 million in reimbursement revenue led that dramatic rise; this revenue comes from a 2015 agreement whereby Array regained or obtained development and commercialization rights to binimetinib and encorafenib from
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ; it substantially covers expenses for those candidates' clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 the company entered the black for the first time with a net income of $9.4 million, but the following year it lost a net $92.8 million. This was largely due to increased R&amp;D spending, plus the absence of realized net gain from marketable securities.

  <p>
   Over the past few years, the company has undergone a transformation from a strictly R&amp;D services provider to full-fledged drug development firm. Array now spends its energy and money on developing its own pipeline of potential therapies. Though it out-licenses some of its internally developed candidates to other firms, it intends to retain a greater financial stake in those licensed candidates than it has in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
   Down the road, Array intends to develop a specialty sales force for any drugs it gets approved. To speed up its transformation, it is keeping an eye out for late-stage candidates or already approved drugs that it could in-license or acquire.
