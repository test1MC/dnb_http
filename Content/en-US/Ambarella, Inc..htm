   Ambarella's technology helps capture crisp, clear digital images in cameras designed for sports, autos, drones, and security. The company designs and markets video processing semiconductors for taking high-definition video and still images. It combines its system-on-a-chip semiconductor designs with proprietary software to create both industry and consumer products. The hardware/software combo helps cameras compensate for motion as a skier swoops downhill or a drone sweeps over a mountain. In security applications, Amabarella's video chips can gather high-def images in low light. The company designs its chips, which are made by contractors, for small form factors and to run on low power.

   Ambarella's chips and software allow for greater compression of the HD video signal, which translates to broadcasters being able to offer more channels in fixed bandwidths and consumer products that capture higher quality video in smaller devices.

   A snapshot of Ambarella's financials for 2016 (ended January) shows revenue, profit, and cash flow headed up. The company's revenue shot up 55% in 2016 to $316 million. The increase came from strong demand for its A9, A7L, S2L, and A12 SoCs for the IP security, drone, automotive aftermarket, and wearable sports camera markets. In the second half of the year, however, Ambarella saw a decline in wearables because of high inventory levels at GoPro, a major end customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue increase helped Ambarella post a 51% increase in net income to $77 million in 2016, despite spending more for research and development and other expenses. The company has been profitable since 2012. Cash flow from operations increased to $124 million in 2016 from $52 million in 2015 on higher net income, decreased accounts receivable, and decreased inventory.

   In 2011, Ambarella lost a good chunk of its business when Kodak stopped making cameras. Ambarella rebounded, finding new customers in wearable sports cameras, security cameras, and aerial drones. But, once again, it ran into problems when sales stalled at one its major customers, GoPro. Ambarella had to work through a load of inventory of its chips held by GoPro, which held up new sales to the camera company.
  </p>
  <p>
   But Ambarella increased its supply of chips for drones and security and added automotive applications to its arsenal with virtual reality applications on the horizon. To maintain the pipeline of new products, Ambarella increased R&amp;D spending to $83 million in 2016 from $58 million in 2015. The company has concentrated more technology on its systems-on-a-chip, which has enables camera manufacturers to reduce the size of their products. A new automotive application is cameras for sideview mirrors, which provide wider views for tasks such as parking.

   Camera makers like Ambarella's chips for their capability of capturing high resolution video.

   became a first time customer, using the A9AC SOC for 4K ultra-HD video in a new underwater camera. Home security customer Bosch incorporated Ambarella's HD chip into cameras that capture a 360-degree view. For virtual reality headsets, Ambarella released a line of SoCs that capture HD video at high rates of speed at 360 degrees.

   In 2015, Ambarella acquired VisLab, a privately held company based in Italy, for $30 million. VisLab is a pioneer in perception systems and autonomous vehicle research. The acquisition provides expertise for research into computer vision for the automotive, IP security, wearable, and drone markets.
