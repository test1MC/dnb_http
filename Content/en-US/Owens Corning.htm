  <p>
   Owens Corning is organized in three business segments: Composites, which generated 34% of the company's total revenue in 2015 and includes reinforcements and downstream businesses; Insulation (34% of revenues); and Roofing (32% of revenues).Within the Composites segment, the company's reinforcements business manufactures, fabricates and sells glass reinforcements in the form of fiber. Its downstream business manufactures and sells glass fiber products in the form of fabrics, mat, veil, and other specialized products.
  </p>

  <p>
   Ohio-based Owens Corning has about 88 manufacturing facilities in some 25 countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region. The US generates about 69% of its sales, while Europe, the Asia/Pacific, and Canada and other countries contribute 12%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.

  <p>
   Owens Corning sells shingles and roofing accessories primarily through home centers, lumberyards, retailers, distributors, and contractors in the US. Other asphalt products are sold internally to manufacture residential roofing products and externally to other roofing manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has decreased its advertising spend in recent years. It spent $98 million on marketing and advertising in 2015, down from $100 million in 2014, $105 million in 2013, and $109 million in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Owens Corning's revenue rose 2% to $5.35 billion in 2015 from $5.26 billion in 2014, primarily on a 6% sales increase in the insulation business. Insulation benefited from higher sales volumes of about 5% and higher selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income continued a string of increases with a whopping 46% jump to $330 million in 2015 from 2014. Added to the higher revenue, OC gained from extinguishment of debt related to its purchase of its headquarters facility; the building had been leased.
  </p>
  <p>
   OC's operating cash flow leaped $742 million n 2015, compared to $452 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Owens Corning's insulation business remains as the business' main strength, and has been growing with the strengthening housing, commercial and industrial construction markets, and as more homeowners have been able to spend on remodeling.The company reports that it is North America's largest producer of residential, commercial, and industrial insulation, and the second-largest producer of extruded polystyrene foam insulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growing global demand has motivated the company to make investments in its composites business, which supplies the industrial, energy, and residential markets. Its OCV Reinforcements and OCV Technical Fabrics units provide lightweight alternatives for steel, wool, and aluminum.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet growing demand for bio-based products, Owens Corning in late 2014 broke ground on a new advanced-technology facility in Gastonia, North Carolina. It would offer manufacturing flexibility to produce different widths of the company's Sustaina non-woven glass fiber fabric.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the past, Owens Corning has also made acquisitions of companies in similar markets to fortify its service offerings at home and abroad.

  <p>
   In 2016 Owens Corning acquired InterWrap, a leading manufacturer of roofing underlayment and packaging materials, for US$450 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016 the company agreed to buy the glass non-wovens and fabrics businesses of Ahlstrom, the fiber-based materials company based in Helsinki, Finland, for US$79.5 million (â‚¬73 million).

  <p>
   In the 1930s Corning Glass Works and Owens-Illinois Glass independently found that glass fiber has special resilience and strength. Realizing the potential market, they formed joint venture Owens-Corning Fiberglas in 1938. The companies expanded rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s, establishing several US plants and one in Canada. Their products included fine fibers, thermal wool, textiles, and continuous filaments.
  </p>
  <p>
   A US antitrust decree in 1949 denied the two founding firms any control over Owens-Corning. Each retained one-third ownership when the company went public in 1952. During the 1950s Owens-Corning developed new uses for fiberglass in automobile bodies, shingles, and insulation. In the 1960s the company expanded overseas. Fiberglass uses multiplied as applications developed in aerospace, tires, and underground tanks.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1980 the company had invested more than $700 million in acquisitions and made the Pink Panther its mascot. Owens-Corning introduced a rolled insulation in 1982.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company successfully fended off a takeover attempt by Wickes Companies in 1986, but the effort left Owens-Corning with $2.6 billion in debt. It sold 10 businesses, halved its research budget, and laid off or lost to divestitures 46% of its workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Fiberglas Canada, that country's largest fiberglass-insulation maker, in 1989. To expand globally, Owens-Corning formed alliances in 1990 with
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   , Lucky-Goldstar, and
   <company id="57096">
    Siam Cement
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Owens-Corning spent $65 million in 1991 on restructuring and took an $800 million charge to cover its liability to asbestos-exposure lawsuits (the company stopped making asbestos in 1972). That year it exchanged its commercial roofing business for the residential roofing business of Schuller International.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Owens-Corning acquired UC Industries, a maker of foam board insulation, and bought
   <company id="42956">
    Pilkington
   </company>
   's insulation and industrial supply business. It also formed joint venture Alpha/Owens-Corning, the largest producer of polyester resin in North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Western Fiberglass Group in 1995. That year Owens-Corning Fiberglas changed its name to Owens Corning and recouped part of its asbestos-related charge when it received a $330 million arbitration settlement from one of its insurers. Owens Corning formed a joint venture in India in 1995. Asbestos-litigation charges led to another loss in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Owens Corning made several acquisitions, including vinyl-siding maker Fibreboard and Amerimark Building Products, a maker of vinyl and aluminum materials. In 1998 falling insulation prices led the company to announce layoffs and a restructuring plan that included plant closures. To pay off debt, the company sold its half of Alpha/Owens-Corning to Alpha Corporation, marking its exit from polyester-resin manufacturing. The company also agreed to take $550 million in a deal with France's
   <company id="106304">
    Groupe Porcher Industries
   </company>
   to form a joint venture for its fiberglass yarns and specialty materials businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to end a liability issue that had dogged the company for a quarter of a century, Owens Corning agreed in 1998 to pay out $1.2 billion to settle 176,000 asbestos-related lawsuits. However, the deal dissolved in 1999 when the US Supreme Court disallowed the settlement. Owens Corning then set up a $2.6 billion reserve fund to settle the claims. Also that year the company formed a joint venture (Decillion) with Geon to make fiberglass and PVC composites. In 2000 Owens Corning added to its acoustic panel business with the acquisition of Conwed Designscape. Still dogged by lawsuits that could eventually cost the company billions, the company filed for bankruptcy protection late in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Owens Corning sold its engineered pipe systems business to joint venture partner Saudi Arabian Amiantit Company. Seeking a foothold in the growing acoustic ceiling market, the restructured company bought Wall Technology later that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Owens Corning increased its loose fill and thermacube insulation products line and capacity in 2002 in response to growing demand. It also acquired Woodbridge, Virginia-based Certified Basements, a basement finishing systems franchise, and strengthened its position in Europe through a distribution contract with an
   <company id="10135">
    Ashland Inc.
   </company>
   subsidiary, Ashland Finland OY, to distribute its composite products through Ashland Specialty Chemical Company. Also that year Owens Corning's HOMExperts Home Repair and Improvements business expanded its service to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento by acquiring assets of California-based Home Finishes, LLC. (HOMExperts also operates in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Indianapolis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Washington, DC.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Following a period of falling stock prices for the company, the New York Stock Exchange suspended its trading in December 2002. In early 2003 the company filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan to settle asbestos litigation. Under the plan, Owens Corning provided partial payments to its creditors (mainly through distributing common stock and notes of the new reorganized company) and its existing common stock was canceled.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Owens Corning Automotive (UK) Ltd. acquired the automotive assets of long-time customer Lancaster Fibre Technology Ltd. (UK). Lancaster Fibre Technology bases its automotive solutions on Owens Corning's Silentex Noise Control automotive silencer technology. It also purchased full ownership of Vitro Fibras (Mexico), a venture it had begun with Vitro (glass products, Mexico) in 1957 to make light-density, fiberglass products; molded pipe; board; and composite reinforcements. Owens Corning paid $71.5 million for Vitro's 60% stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2006. As part of the bankruptcy reorganization the company's paid some $5 billion in asbestos claims, along with an additional $2.4 billion earmarked for debt holders.
  </p>
  <p>
   After shedding the ponderous weight of bankruptcy, the company didn't stand still. Owens Corning strengthened its composite operations in late 2007 when it acquired the reinforcements and composite fabrics business of materials giant
   <company id="40729">
    Saint-Gobain
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company focused growth on its composites business, it began trimming off other operations. Saint-Gobain acquired Owens Corning's vinyl siding business, Norandex, in 2007. Also that year, it sold its continuous filament mat business to
   <company id="106043">
    AGY
   </company>
   and its Fabwel composite panels business to
   <company id="10415">
    Crane
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2013 Owens Corning acquired Thermafiber Inc. a manufacturer of mineral wool commercial and industrial insulation products. The purchase included a 145,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Wabash, Indiana.
