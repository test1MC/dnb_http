  <p>
   Gerdau has about a 50% market share of the long steel market in Brazil. Gerdau Acominas, the third largest maker of crude steel in Brazil, is an integrated mill, which manufactures semi-finished products (billets, blooms, and slabs), long steel (merchant bar, rebar, and shapes), and heavy structural shapes. Acominas is one of the largest exporters of billets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerdau offers a wide range of products for the construction industry. it special steel products have specific physical and metallurgical features for applications with high mechanical requirements. It is an essential feedstock in the automotive chain, with applications in car parts, heavy and light vehicle systems and agricultural machines. Gerdau's special steel also supplies other markets such as oil and gas, wind power, machinery and equipment, mining and railroads. It has 64 steel mills, 148 downstream operations, four iron ore extraction areas, 70 scrap collection and processing facilities, four power plants, 158 retail facilities, and three private port terminals.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 75% of the steel produced by Gerdau in the world is made from the recycling of scrap.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products to automotive industry (more than 13,000 customers around the world). In countries where Gerdau has plants, its products are sold directly to customers and through Gerdau's own or independent distribution channels. Gerdau steel is also exported from these plants to other countries where the company has no facilities.

  <p>
   Gerdau's revenues increased by 7% in 2014 due to the expansion of sales in North America market positive foreign exchange impacts obtained from its operations outside of Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decrease by 12% mainly due to higher financial expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash rose from R$ 4.2 billion in 2013 to R$ 5.8 billion in 2014 mainly due to receiving resources from selling Gallatin Steel. In 2014 some  40.7% of the of the company's cash was held by the Gerdau companies abroad, mainly in US dollars.

  <p>
   Gerdau's business strategy is fourfold: to have relevance in all markets, to make its businesses competitive, to have a presence in all segments, and to seek geographic diversification. The company has decentralized its management, allowing local managers to operate within its strategic vision and adjust their operations to local market situations and conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Brazil, the company plans to continue to invest in the installation of a rolling mill of heavy plates in the Ouro Branco mill, which is scheduled to start up in 2016. It also invested to open new melt shop in Argentina. Gerdau continued investing to expand the production capacity, quality, and productivity of its special steel plants in the region. Its mill in Monroe (Michigan), for example, began operating a new special steel rolling mill in 2015, expanding the mill's production capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, Gerdau has made some divestments in the US in line with the strategy to concentrate efforts on the long steel and special bar quality markets. In 2014, Gerdau and ArcelorMittal sold their jointly owned Gallatin Steel facility to Nucor for $770 Million.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Gerdau joined its Dominican Republic operations with the Metaldom in order to reduce costs and enhance productivity and the Company's competitiveness in the Caribbean and Central American markets. The Gerdau Metaldom joint venture will focus on the needs of the civil construction and agribusiness sectors, as well as maintain metallics and PVC operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the US economy saw increased demand by the steel consuming sectors, such as industry and non-residential construction, and continued to be a major importer of steel, helping to maintain Gerdau's steel export growth.

   , and now controls the company. AmeriSteel specializes in manufacturing concrete-reinforcing rod, flat-rolled steel, merchant bar, and structural forms which are utilized in the automotive, appliance, construction, machinery, and equipment industries. That same year, Gerdau Ameristeel purchased
   <company id="118220">
    TAMCO
   </company>
   , a California-based mini-mill, to expand its rebar manufacturing capability in the Western US.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, Gerdau acquired Colombian coke maker Cleary Holdings, buying the balance of shares it did not already control for $57 million. Cleary controls coke-production units, with an annual capacity of 1 million metric tons and coking coal reserves in the upper Amazon basin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerdau entered the Central American market in 2008 with strategic alliance with Corporación Centroamericana del Acero, the region's largest steel manufacturer, with operations in Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Gerdau took a 30% stake and invested some $180 million in the company's operations. Gerdau's other operations in the region include Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
