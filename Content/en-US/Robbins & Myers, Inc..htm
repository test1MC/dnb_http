   Robbins &amp; Myers specializes in critical industrial equipment used in specific applications by the oil and gas, chemical, and pharmaceutical markets worldwide. The company operates through two business segments: Energy Services and Process &amp; Flow Control. These units offer a variety of equipment, including downhole pumps, pipeline closures, and well control systems, as well as glass-lined reactors, thermal fluid systems, grinders, and mixing equipment. Brands in its Energy Services segment include T-3 and Robbins &amp; Myers Energy Systems, while brands within Process &amp; Flow Control include Chemineer, Edlon, Moyno, and Pfaudler. In 2013 Robbins &amp; Myers was acquired by

  <p>
   Formerly a publicly traded company, Robbins &amp; Myers became a wholly owned subsidiary of National Oilwell Varco (NOV) after being acquired for about $2.5 billion in February 2013 and undergoing a merger. Strengthened by combined manufacturing infrastructure and technology portfolios, NOV is using the deal to advance its presence in the oil and gas market.

  <p>
   Robbins &amp; Myers has primary facilities in about 15 countries. The company derives almost 70% of its annual sales from the North American market; however, it has been strengthening its customer base in South America, especially in oil and gas exploration, and in Asian countries, particularly China and India. With Asia and South America, combined, accounting for over 15% of sales, the company focuses on these regions for growth in the coming years.

  <p>
   Robbins &amp; Myers' Energy Services segment makes parts and systems used to make drilling motors, blow-out preventers, cavity pumps, and drive systems under brand names such as T-3 and Robbins &amp; Myers Energy Services. These products are used in oil and gas exploration and other industrial applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Process &amp; Flow Control business designs and manufactures reactors and storage vessels for industrial applications. The company's largest end-market is oil and gas exploration, for which it provides hydraulic drilling equipment. Its trademarked Moyno ERT technology (Even Rubber Thickness) is an oil and gas drilling application that allows for increased drilling depth by providing more power and torque to conventional power sections. Other brands within this segment include Pfaudler, Chemineer, and Edlon.

  <p>
   After seeing its revenue and profits sink in 2010, Robbins &amp; Myers has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the years. From 2011 to 2012 its revenues surged by 26%, and its profits increased by roughly 12%. It posted revenues of more than $1 billion in 2012 for the first time in its history; it also generated $150 million in profit that year, another milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy Services sales increased by 39% in 2012, largely because of a previous acquisition (T-3 Energy Services). Process &amp; Flow Control segment sales increased by 8% in 2012 compared with 2011. The surge in profits was driven by the contribution of the T-3 acquisition for the full year, increased sales volumes, favorable product mixes, lower merger-related charges, and a lower effective tax rate.

  <p>
   In early 2011 Robbins &amp; Myers acquired T-3 Energy Services, a Texas-based oil and gas field equipment supplier. T-3 expanded Robbins &amp; Myers' opportunities in the energy marketplace, extending the global reach of its fluid management business. Hard on its heels, the company realigned its product offerings and moved its Chemineer brand (replacement parts) from the process solutions segment to fluid management. Other end markets for fluid management include wastewater treatment and chemical processing.

  <p>
   Robbins &amp; Myers traces its origins to 1878, when soldier and surveyor Chandler Robbins and businessman and educator James Myers bought Lever Wringer and began making industrial castings. Early in the 1900s their enterprise made electrical motors and cranes. It went public in 1928. In 1936 the company added industrial pumps to its product list. Forty years later its electric motor-manufacturing segment and ceiling-fan operations were its major focus.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983 Robbins &amp; Myers sold its ceiling-fan operations and suffered a loss from the sale. The company then sold its electric-motors business to focus on fluid-management products. It expanded that segment through acquisitions during the first half of the 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robbins &amp; Myers expanded internationally in 1996 through a joint venture in the Pacific Rim. Companies purchased in 1997, including Italian specialists Technoglass and TYCON, boosted its glass-lined storage operations. The company broadened its service to the oil and gas industry in 1998 with the purchase of Flow Control Equipment, a maker of pipeline closures, rod guides, and wellhead equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   When low oil prices and weakness in the specialty chemicals market dragged down fiscal 1999 sales, the company combined its Flow Control Equipment and its Moyno Oilfield Products into R&amp;M Energy Systems. It further secured a Latin American foothold that year by purchasing majority stakes in Chemineer de México (industrial mixing equipment) and Moyno de México (distribution).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Robbins &amp; Myers expanded its energy operations by acquiring Campbell Industries and Alberta Oil Tool. Later that year the company enlarged its global presence when it bought Netherlands-based Romaco N.V. (processing and packaging equipment for pharmaceuticals, health care products, and cosmetics) for about $115 million. The company strengthened its place as a pump manufacturer with the 2003 acquisition of Tarby, Inc. for a reported $13.1 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Romaco operations (packaging and secondary processing) to Deutsche Beteiligungs, a Germany-based private equity investment firm, in 2011.
