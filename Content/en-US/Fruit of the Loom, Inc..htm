   Headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky, alongside other Berkshire Hathaway brands
   <company id="11297">
    Russell

   and Vanity Fair, vertically integrated manufacturer and distributor Fruit of the Loom produces most of its products in Latin America. In general it maintains its own spinning, knitting, cloth finishing, cutting, sewing, and packaging functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cater to its large North American market, its spinning operations are located in the US; cloth manufacturing is conducted in the US and overseas. Sewing and finishing are performed in low-cost countries Central America and the Caribbean. To serve its European market, Fruit of the Loom's products are either outsourced to third-party contractors in Europe or Asia or sewn in Morocco using the country's textiles.

  <p>
   With some 82% of its sales coming from the North American market, Fruit of the Loom primarily sells its products through discount and mass merchandisers, department stores, wholesale clubs, and screen printers. In 2013, Wal-Mart was responsible for 33% of Fruit of the Loom's sales. Selling products online is a growing part of its business.

   Fruit of the Loom is part of Berkshire Hathaway's "other manufacturing" sector, which accounted for more than 30% of the parent company's 2013 revenue. The sector's apparel business, which includes Russell Athletic apparel and Vanity Fair women's intimate apparel, logged 4% sales increases to some $4 billion in fiscal 2013.

   As part of its strategy Fruit of the Loom works to diversify its portfolio. Other than undershirts, the company outfits its customers in many ways. The manufacturer markets and sells sports equipment and balls to team dealers. It caters to college bookstores with college licensed T-shirts and fleecewear, and peddles athletic apparel, equipment, and balls to sporting goods stores under the Russell Athletic and Spalding brands. Fruit of the Loom also operates the

   running shoe business.
  </p>
  <p>
   To support the company's growing e-commerce business, it's more than doubling the size of its Berkeley County distribution center -- from 350,000 sq. ft. to more than 750,000 sq. ft. -- by 2015.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Fruit of the Loom began as a brand name used by Robert Knight's textile company, which he established in 1851. Knight's company adopted the Fruit of the Loom name in 1856. The brand, whose logo (an apple, grapes, gooseberries, and a cluster of leaves) was adopted in 1893, was first licensed to finished-garment makers in 1928.
  </p>
  <p>
   Polish immigrant Jacob Goldfarb founded Union Underwear in 1926 and began making one-piece "unionsuits." In 1938 Goldfarb acquired a 25-year license to the Fruit of the Loom trademark. Newly outfitted with the license, Union introduced boxer shorts and knit underwear in the 1940s. By the mid-1950s Union was the biggest US maker of men's briefs. In 1955 Goldfarb, then 60 and worried Union might be liquidated after he died, accepted a cash offer for his company from holding company Philadelphia &amp; Reading, which in turn was purchased by Northwest Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition by Northwest funded Union's growth. Commercials featuring the "Fruit of the Loom Guys" (men dressed as fruit) debuted in 1975, and the next year the company acquired the BVD trademark for a separate line of underwear. The Underoos line (decorated underwear for children) was launched in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deal maker William Farley bought Northwest in 1985 for $1.4 billion (most of it from junk bond specialist Drexel Burnham Lambert). Farley changed the company's name to Fruit of the Loom in 1987. It went public that year, but Farley's own holding company, Farley, Inc., kept control. Under his ownership, the firm diversified into socks, sweatshirts, and broader offerings in women's underwear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1990s Fruit of the Loom became a leader in children's underwear, and in 1994 it acquired the Gitano fashion brand. The company lost nearly $230 million in 1995, partly because of charges incurred from closing six US plants and laying off more than 3,000 workers. That year, in an effort to reduce costs and streamline operations, it moved production to the Caribbean and Central America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fruit of the Loom sold its hosiery division in 1996 to sock maker Renfro and paid $22 million to rename Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium after its Pro Player line. The next year it initiated another massive round of layoffs and closed nine plants at a cost of $250 million. In June 1997 Farley sold more than 800,000 shares of his own stock in Fruit of the Loom just weeks before the company announced a disastrous second quarter.
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs further, in 1999 Fruit of the Loom created a new parent company (Fruit of the Loom, Ltd.) in the Cayman Islands, seeking lower corporate taxes. That year CEO Farley stepped down amid projections of continued poor earnings. The company then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and decided to liquidate its Sports &amp; Licensing (Pro Player) division.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Fruit of the Loom sought legal action against Farley for defaulting on $65 million in company-guaranteed loans (in August 2002 Farley settled with the company and agreed to pay back about 35% of the loan). Acting CEO and retail-turnaround specialist Dennis Bookshester became CEO. The company sold Gitano to jeanswear umbrella

   (Wrangler, Lee, Chic). Nearly down to its skivvies, but before the elastic finally gave out, in April 2002 Warren Buffett's
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   completed its $835 million purchase of Fruit of the Loom. John Holland (previously COO) replaced Bookshester as president and CEO. Chairman Sir Brian Wolfson and the board of the directors departed then, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed its Northern Ireland operations in 2004 as part of a larger European restructuring in light of competitive low-wage economies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Fruit of the Loom acquired the athletic apparel and sporting goods company Russell Corporation for about $600 million. Russell brands include Russell Athletic, JERZEES, and Spalding, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired the intimate apparel business of VF Corporation for about $350 million in 2007.
