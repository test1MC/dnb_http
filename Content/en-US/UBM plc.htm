   When UBM puts on an event, business booms. The world's #2 events firm (after
   <company id="117026">
    Reed
   </company>
   ) produces industry events, publications, and databases for business-to-business communities. Its events include award ceremonies, conferences, expos, and exhibitions. The London-based company has significant operations in Asia, and EMEA, and is the #1 events company in North America. It oils the wheels of business in the fashion, technology, automotive, healthcare, veterinary and pharmaceutical industries, among others. As well as events, UBM operates a marketing services division, which publishes trade press to specialist markets, and does website banner advertising. UBM was founded in 1918 as United Newspapers Limited.

  <p>
   UBM has three distinct geographic businesses: UBM Americas, UBM Asia and UBM EMEA, which together pull in over 80% of revenue.

  <p>
   UBM Americas works in the fashion, technology, licensing, automotive and powersports, healthcare, veterinary and pharmaceutical industries. The segment includes a Brazil operation, which puts on events for the construction, cargo transportation, logistics, and agriculture. A Mexico division puts on events for construction, advanced manufacturing and hospitality services.
  </p>
  <p>
   UBM Asia has 270 products -- trade fairs, conferences, trade publications and vertical portals -- and is the market leader in China, India and Malaysia.
  </p>

   In 2015, sales increased 40% on prior year to £769.9 million, due to a combination of the acquisition of
   <company id="44959">
    Advanstar
   </company>
   , a biennial 'up' year, and favorable currency effects.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell nearly a third to £107.7 million, due to an increase in operating expenses. Cash flow from operating activities increased 66% to £225.1 million, due to changes in trade and other receivables.

  <p>
   UBM has progressively reduced its non-events interest in recent years in order to the world's leading pure-play events company. In December 2015, the company disposed of media distribution platform provider PR Newswire for $841 million to
   <company id="107499">
    Cision
   </company>
   , a significant step in its pure-play drive. Additionally, in 2016 UBM reached an agreement to sell its electronics media portfolio (which includes EE Times, EDN, ESM, Embedded, EBN, TechOnline, and Datasheets) to an affiliate of
   <company id="10130">
    Arrow Electronics
   </company>
   , for $23.5 million in cash.

  <p>
   In 2016, UBM acquired Content Marketing Institute (CMI) for $17.6 million. CMI produces Content Marketing World, the leading event in the content marketing sector. The acquisition strengthens UBM's place in the US events industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In April 2016, UBM completed the $69 million acquisition of Business Journals Inc (BJI), a producer of fashion trade shows in New York and Las Vegas. The acquisition is hoped to generate synergies in areas such as event operations, property and cross-marketing opportunities.
