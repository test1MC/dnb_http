  <p>
   The company's operations are sensitive to downturns in core market segments including wind energy, construction, water, and infrastructure industries. Strong demand for onshore oilfield piping in recent years (especially in North and South America) has helped spur sales of its fiberglass products. However, sales of construction-related and wind tower products have been weak during certain periods due to lower demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite poor market conditions in some regions and sectors, Ameron is continuing to expand geographically and grow in areas that promise future increases in demand such as Brazil, China, and the Middle East. Each would serve the shipbuilding and onshore oil pipeline business.
  </p>
  <p>
   At home in the US Ameron is looking to capitalize on the country's need to update its infrastructure. The company built a new steel pole plant in Oklahoma in 2012; the facility serves the US transportation market by constructing products such as light, signage, and traffic signal poles.

  <p>
   Ameron was acquired by oilfield equipment maker National Oilwell Varco for some $777 million in 2011.The deal was one of several acquisitions National Oilwell has initiated as it prepared for an expected boom in offshore drilling activities. Ameron's fiberglass pipes and other products expanded National Oilwell's offerings for the offshore drilling industry.

  <p>
   Ameron International was founded in 1907, and it merged with another company in 1929 to form American Concrete Pipe Co. The enterprise diversified into construction products in 1942 and became known as American Pipe and Construction Co.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the 1960s American Pipe and Construction Co. had further diversified into protective coatings, ready-mix concrete, and resin piping. The company shortened its name to Ameron, Inc., in 1970, and over the next 20 years, it grew to have a worldwide presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ameron adopted its current name in 1996 to reflect its international focus. That year the company bought Imperial Chemical's Devoe marine coatings unit in a move that helped it become one of the nation's leading providers of marine and offshore coatings. In a similar move, it bought the maintenance-coatings unit of Valspar Corporation in 1997, significantly increasing its product finishes business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bargain-basement gasoline prices and Asia's economic crisis hurt results in 1998, but the acquisition of Croda Coatings later in the year enabled the company to post a sales gain. The same year Ameron sold its 50% ownership in Gifford-Hill-American (concrete pipe). In 1999 the company established Bonstrand Ltd. (fiberglass pipe), a joint venture company in Kuwait. Bonstrand began operations in 2000. In 2001 Ameron International's Performance Coatings and Finishes unit inked a deal with Duron, the third-largest paint manufacturer in the US, to distribute Ameron's products using Duron's company stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Ameron announced it would become PPG Industries' distributor of its PITT-CHAR XP fire protective coatings, primarily used in fireproofing off-shore oil rigs. The company sold its 25% stake of Amercoat Mexicana in 2003. In 2006 Ameron sold its protective coatings and finishes business to

   In 2009 the company sold its pressurized gas systems business to electronics manufacturer
