  <p>
   The company traces its roots to 1994, when CMP Publications (which was renamed CMP Media in 1996) made the leap into cyberspace and launched TechWeb, a website offering online versions of its print publications covering technical topics. CMP was itself established in 1971 by Gerard and Lilo Leeds with the publishing of their first title,
   <em>
    Electronic Buyer's News
   </em>
   (
   <em>
    EBN
   </em>
   ), a weekly newspaper targeted at buyers of electronic components, such as memory chips. In 1979 CMP Media began publishing
   <em>
    InformationWeek
   </em>
   . CMP Media went public in 1997, but the Leeds family retained a controlling interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an ironic twist, the booming popularity of the computers in the late 1990s actually led to the deterioration of CMP Media's financial health. As computer use became more widespread, hardware and software makers began shifting their advertising dollars away from technical publications to more mainstream magazines. Caught up in the middle of this shift, CMP Media was acquired in 1999 by UK-based United News &amp; Media (renamed United Business Media, or UBM, in 2000).
  </p>
  <p>
   The Leeds family shared the cash proceeds from the 1999 sale of CMP with every employee of the company they founded in 1971, and went on to pursue a number of philanthropic interests, including a $35 million commitment to the Graduate School of Business at the University of Colorado, now the Leeds School of Business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 CMP acquired several assets in order to strengthen its holdings. Deals included media company Light Reading, which specializes in telecommunications information; IT security events company Black Hat; and tech educator TechOnLine. In 2006
   <company id="148540">
    Beliefnet
   </company>
   founder Tony Uphoff, who had also served as publisher of
   <em>
    InformationWeek
   </em>
   , was appointed president of CMP Media's technology group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a corporate reorganization, in 2008 UBM phased out the CMP Media brand, with TechWeb surviving as an umbrella company for several of its technology brands. TechWeb was eventually re-named UBM TechWeb, with Uphoff continuing to lead the organization as CEO.
