   After more than six decades, Kenwal Steel is still forging ahead. The flat-rolled steel supplier and processor targets automotive, appliance, and electronics industries, and other major OEMs, concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast US, and Ontario. Through its collection of companies, Kenwal allies with steel mills to broker carbon and alloy steel products and services. Its lineup includes hot and cold rolled, pickled, aluminized, galvanized, stainless and high-strength grades, flat, and sheet steel. Processing and distribution facilities neighbor many of its partner mills, linking to customers via the company's rail and truck line. Kenwal is owned and led by descendants of Sol Eisenberg, company founder.
