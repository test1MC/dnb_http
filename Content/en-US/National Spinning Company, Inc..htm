   These days spinning is associated with political doublespeak and exercise bikes. But this company lays claim to the original meaning of the word. National Spinning is a yarn spinner and dyer, supplying outerwear, home furnishings, industrial, home crafting, and other markets. Its four US plants produce high-value yarns and services for knitters, weavers, and retailers in the Americas, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. National Spinning technologies include ring, open end, and worsted spinning, plus package dyeing. Its Caron International and Hampton Art units sell yarn, latch kits, and other accessories online and through retail stores. In business since 1921, the company has been employee-owned since 1994.

   In addition to its traditional wool, wool blend, acrylic, and dyed filament yarns, National Spinning makes specialty yarns. These include specialty yarns designed for moisture management (Coolmax and Hydrotec), durability (UltraSpun), and outdoor uses (Thermolite) as well as those made from recycled polyester (proprietary NatureSpun and Ingeo) and plant-based materials (bamboo and others). It also produces flame retardant and self extinguishing fibers.

   Besides yarn, the company also sells decorative rubber stamps, hand-knitting machines, and other craft accessories online and through retailers.
