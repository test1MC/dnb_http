   Watts Water Technologies manufactures a number of valves used to maintain the quality, conservation, and flow control of water, be it in a residential, commercial, industrial, or municipal setting. It also makes water quality products, such as backflow preventers and filtration systems, water pressure regulators, and drainage devices. The lineup is sold under brands Brae, FEBCO, Flo Safe, Orion, Powers, and Sea Tech. Watts' operations are found in North America, Europe, and, to a lesser extent, China. Almost 70% of its sales rely on plumbing, heating, and mechanical wholesale distributors. Do-it-yourself retail chains and OEMs account for the balance.

  <p>
   Watts' business activities are divided into four segments. Residential and commercial flow control is its largest, generating nearly 60% of its total sales each year. HVAC and gas generates around 30%, while the other two segments -- drains and water re-use; and water quality -- account for the remainder of revenue.

  <p>
   The company has operations in Austria, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Tunisia, the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the US. It operates more than 30 principal manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution centers throughout the world.

  <p>
   After posting record-setting revenues of $1.51 billion in 2014, Watts saw its revenues dip by 3% during 2015. The revenue decline was fueled by a decrease in sales from EMEA. This was driven by lower demand within the DIY and OEM markets, particularly the struggling end-markets in France, Germany, and Russia. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales in the Middle East and UK markets and in its electronics business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Watts suffered its first net loss in more than 10 years during 2015. Its net loss of $113 million was the result of goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges in its EMEA reporting unit and trade name impairment charges in the Americas and EMEA. In addition, its operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years; after rising in 2014, it declined by 19% during 2015.

  <p>
   Watts aims to strengthen its revenue stream by acquiring businesses that have access to new markets, offer new technology, and deliver brand name water quality and flow control products that are especially geared towards the residential and commercial segments or toward promising new environmental markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Watts improved its position in the Asia/Pacific through the $22 million purchase of New Zealand-based Apex Valves Limited. Apex specializes in the design and manufacture of control valves for low and high pressure hot water and filtration systems and produces an extensive range of float and reservoir valves for the agricultural industry. The company in 2014 picked up

   , a manufacturer of a wide range of high efficiency commercial boilers and water heaters, for approximately $265 million.

  <p>
   Joseph Watts founded Watts Regulator in 1874 to make steam pressure regulators for the New England textile industry. With the early-1900s exodus of textile mills to the South, the firm diversified into heating, boiler, and plumbing applications. In 1918 Burchard Horne and his uncle Herbert, who built textile factory roofs, took control of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1931 Watts Regulator patented the temperature and pressure relief (TP&amp;R) valve, a safety valve that became its key product in the 1930s and 1940s. Following WWII, the company diversified its valve products and built its sales network under the direction of Burchard's son George. George's son Timothy became CEO in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 Watts Regulator made its first acquisition, Spence Engineering (steam valves). The company changed its name to Watts Industries and went public in 1986. Over the next ten years it bought about 30 companies, including Contromatics and the Henry Pratt Co. (1992); Intermes Group, Rockford Controls, and Waletzko GmbH (1993); and, for about $81 million in fiscal 1995, five valve makers that included firms in Italy and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a loss fiscal 1996 after taking a restructuring charge and divesting its municipal water group. Watts added to its line of backflow-prevention valves in 1997 by acquiring Ames Company. In 1998 it bought Hoke, Inc. (industrial valves and fittings), its largest purchase to date.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Watts spun off its oil- and gas-valve unit as Circor International. With renewed focus on plumbing, heating, and water-quality markets and European markets as well, the company bought Italy-based Cazzaniga. In 2000 Watts added McCraney (seismic restraint straps for water heaters, now Spacemaker) and Chiles Power Supply and Bask (radiant heating and snow melting systems, now Watts Heatway).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Watts Industries acquired Dumser Metallbau GmbH &amp; Co. KG, a German maker of brass, steel, and stainless steel manifolds used in distribution devices and hydronic heating systems, and Fimet S.r.l., an Italy-based pressure and temperature gauge manufacturer. The company's board of directors approved a measure in early 2002 that would build a brass and bronze valve manufacturing plant in Tianjin, China. The company also acquired F&amp;R Foerster and Rothmann GmbH (Germany), a manufacturer and distributor of a line of gauges its sells mainly to OEM markets in France and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   Timothy Horne resigned as chairman in mid-2002. Later that summer the
   <company id="56705">
    Securities and Exchange Commission
   </company>
   filed a civil suit against Horne alleging insider trading regarding an unrelated company. The company changed its name to Watts Water Technologies in late 2003.
