   A pioneer in the world of recreational vehicles, Winnebago Industries makes products intended to encourage exploration and outdoor escape. Almost all of the company's sales come from its motor homes and towables, which are sold via independent dealers throughout the US and Canada under the Winnebago, Adventurer, Sightseer, Suncruiser, Sunova, and Minnie Winnie brands, among others. Winnebago Industries also sells RV parts and provides related services; in addition, the company produces OEM parts for other RV manufacturers and for use in commercial vehicles. The company traces its roots back to the 1950s.

  <p>
   Winnebago divides its motor homes portfolio across three main product lines: Class A (conventional motor homes), Class B (panel-type vans), and Class C (motor homes built on van-type chassis).

  <p>
   Winnebago is based in Forest City, Iowa. It owns facilities in Middlebury, Forest City, Lake Mills, and Charles City, Iowa; Junction City, Oregon; Middlebury, Indiana; and Burnsville, Minnesota.

  <p>
   The company markets its RVs on a wholesale basis to a diversified independent dealer network located throughout the US and, to a limited extent, in Canada. The RV dealer network in the US and Canada includes almost 300 motorized and 160 towable physical dealer locations, with roughly 75 of these locations carrying both Winnebago motorized and towable products.

   , the company's chief dealers, accounted for 17% and 13% of its total revenue in fiscal 2016, respectively.

  <p>
   Winnebago posted $976 million in revenues in 2015, its highest total in about 10 years. Revenues dropped marginally to $975 million in 2016. Profits jumped 10% from $41 million in 2015 to $46 million in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its recent growth was attributed to a 2% bump in motorized wholesale deliveries from 2015 to 2016. Towable net revenue also experienced growth of approximately 25% in 2016. Strong demand for its Class B and Class C products was partially offset by weaker demand in Class A products. Going forward, Winnebagao anticipates continued strong demand in its Class B and C categories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The modest revenue decline for 2016 was due mainly to other manufactured products revenues which decreased by $21 million. This was primarily due to the company's exit of its aluminum extrusion and bus businesses. Both of these operations have provided very low margins over the years.

  <p>
   Winnebago's motorized production facilities are located in largely rural areas of northern Iowa. Although the unemployment rate in these areas is currently low, the company has been working to extend its geographical scope to avoid depending upon labor strictly within this region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 it purchased a production facility in Junction City, Oregon, from a former motorized RV producer. It is expanding some motor home manufacturing functions to Junction City in order to diversify its geographical locations. The new site also provides a West Coast service option for customers.

  <p>
   In potentially its largest deal to date, Winnebago in late 2016 agreed to buy privately held Grand Design Recreational Vehicle Co, a maker of towable recreational vehicles. The cash-and-stock deal, valued at $500 million, will give Winnebago a bigger foothold in the growing towables market and create a company with net revenue of about $1.4 billion.

  <p>
   During a mid-1950s economic downturn, furniture store owner John Hanson convinced Forest City officials to welcome a local subsidiary of California trailer maker Modernistic Industries. The company's first trailer rolled off the line in 1958. Hanson later bought the plant and in 1960 named the business Winnebago Industries after Forest City's home county. Winnebago Industries went public in 1966. Sales took off when the company offered less-expensive RVs than its competitors.
