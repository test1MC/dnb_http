   When Fluidigm's microfluidic systems measure volume by the nanoliter, they're not using itty bitty Erlenmeyer flasks. Based on the fabrication technology that brought forth semiconductors, Fluidigm develops integrated fluidic circuits (IFCs) and strings them together as systems to automate certain tasks in life sciences research. Fluidigm's BioMark HD and EP1 systems enable genetic analyses including genotyping and high-throughput gene expression. Its Access Array system enables automated sample preparation for DNA sequencing. Customers include academic institutions, diagnostic laboratories, and pharmaceutical, biotechnology and agricultural biotechnology (Ag-Bio) companies.

   Fluidigm's biggest source of revenue is the sale of its instruments, accounting for just more than half of its revenue. Its Polaris system for conducting single-cell assays and sample prep carries a list price tag of $400,000. Other version list for less than $200,000. Its consumable products, chips and reagents used in conducting assays, bring in 38% of revenue. Services bring in 11% of the company's revenue.

  <p>
   The company makes it own products in Singapore, Canada, and the US. The Singapore facility makes genomics instruments. Fluidigm's proteomics analytical instruments are made in Canada. The company makes assays and reagents in its facilities in South San Francisco, California (site of its headquarters). The company also conducts research and development at the three locations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In geographic distribution of revenue, about 48% comes from customers in the US, followed by 32% from customers in Europe, 10% in the Asia-Pacific region, and 5% from Japan. Customers in other countries account for the remaining 5% of revenue. Overall it has customers in some 45 countries.

   Fluidigm sells through its own direct sales staff as well as through distributors. Its customers conduct research in academic institutions, Ag-Bio companies, clinical laboratories, bio-repositories, and bio-pharmaceutical companies. Researchers at Stanford University and McGill University are among those who use Fluidigm systems.

  <p>
   In 2015, Fluidigm's revenue was off 1% to $114.4 million in 2015 from $116 million in 2014. Revenue from its instruments fell 3% in 2015 with fewer unit sales of its core genomic analytical systems, including the BioMark, C1, and Access Array systems. Products that posted sales gains were Helios/CyTOF2 systems, Juno, and Polaris. Service revenue rose about 40% because of greater sales of post-warranty service contracts and increased installation and training for the Helios/CyTOF2 systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's loss rose a bit to $53 million in 2015 from $50 million in 2014. Fluidigm increased spending on selling and general expenses as it hired more people and invested in its facilities and infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated from operations rose 53% higher in 2015 from 2014 to $34.7 million.

  <p>
   Fluidigm DVS Sciences for $200 million in 2014. Fluidigm has made the DVS product, the CyTOF2 Mass Cytometer, a key part of its lineup. The CyTOF technology enables high-parameter single-cell protein analysis for biological research.
