   American Superconductor (AMSC) gets a charge out of carrying a heavy load. The company has two units: wind and grid. The wind segment licenses highly engineered wind turbine designs and supplies wind turbine makers with advanced power electronics and control systems. The grid segment offers grid interconnection systems for wind farms, solar power plants, and transmission cable systems. Austrian subsidiary AMSC Windtec designs wind turbines. Customers in the Asia/Pacific region account for about two-thirds of sales.

   professors Gregory Yurek and John Vander Sande formed AMSC in 1987.

  <p>
   AMSC is stationed in Boston and has operations in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The Asia/Pacific is AMSC's largest market, with China and India each representing 20% of sales and Korea generating 13%. Europe follows with 17% of sales and the US accounts for 15%.

  <p>
   The wind segment accounts for 51% of revenue while the grid segment represents 49%. Wind licenses wind turbine designs, including drive trains and power ratings up to 10 MW, under the Windtec Solutions brand. AMSC has licensed or designed wind turbines for more than 10 European and Asian manufacturers, including
   <company id="152801">
    Doosan Heavy Industries
   </company>
   and
   <company id="57072">
    Hyundai Heavy Industries
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating under the Gridtec Solutions brand, the grid segment offers transmission planning services that determine problems that may be solved by products that include D-VAR Systems, which supply a form of power, known as reactive power, that brings stability to the grid. The segment has served about 100 customers, including

   and

   (EDF).

  <p>
   The company sells its products through a direct sales force operating out of sales offices worldwide. Its two major customers include Inox (accounted for 19% of revenue in 2013 ) and JINGCHENG New Energy (13%).

   AMSC is attempting to rebound after a turbulent fiscal year 2012. That year the wind segment's revenue nosedived by 81% due to a situation with
   <company id="162245">
    Sinovel Wind Group
   </company>
   . In 2011 Sinovel, which accounted for about 68% of AMSC's revenue, rejected contracted shipments of wind turbine core electrical components and spare parts. AMSC has been involved in legal proceedings against Sinovel in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues, however, increased 14% from $77 million in 2012 to $87 million in 2013. This was driven by a 35% surge in grid sales and revenue spikes in Canada (36%), India (20%), and Australia (60). Europe sales also skyrocketed over 400% from 2012 to 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMSC has suffered net losses for three straight years; however, its net loss decreased 66% from $127 million in 2012 to $66 million in 2013 due to higher revenues and decreased operating expenses.

   As Asia/Pacific accounts for a significant share of the company's geographic sales, AMSC continues to focus on the region, especially in Australia, China, India, and South Korea. As another strategy AMSC has struck strategic business relationships with companies that have included

    Siemens

   , and
   <company id="121333">
    Vestas
   </company>
   . In the sphere of product development, the company has been focusing on commercializing its Amperium wire, which can allow a power cable to carry up to ten times the electrical current of copper cables of the same diameter.
  </p>
  <p>
   To become profitable once again, the company has focused on restructuring and streamlining its global organization. During 2013 it reduced its workforce by 57%. In addition, the company consolidated some of its business operations in order to reduce overall facility costs, through vacating both occupied and unoccupied spaces in some of its facilities residing in Wisconsin and internationally in Germany, Austria, and China.

  <p>
   Superconductors were first identified in 1911, but until the 1980s were mostly materials that required cooling with costly liquid helium to maintain their conductivity. In 1986
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   researchers discovered materials that could be cooled more cheaply and easily using liquid nitrogen.
   <company id="40300">

   professors Gregory Yurek (AMSC's chairman, president, and CEO until 2011) and John Vander Sande (a director) began using them to create HTS products, and in 1987 they formed AMSC to commercialize patents resulting from their research. AMSC went public in 1991. In 1994 the company produced its first HTS wire both flexible and strong enough for commercial use. Its first commercial products -- heat-reducing current leads -- were unveiled in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 AMSC's commercialization efforts got a boost when it bought Superconductivity, Inc., a maker of low-temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage (LT-SMES) devices; the next year AMSC introduced two commercial SMES products (one year ahead of schedule) and its first SMES unit went on line in a North Carolina plastics factory. Also in 1998 EDF, AMSC, and electrical power transformer maker
   <company id="40615">
    ABB
   </company>
   began a $15 million program to develop HTS wire for power transformers. In 1999 AMSC won a
   <company id="138711">
    US Department of Energy
   </company>
   contract to develop and install the first HTS transformer in the US's electric utility network.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 AMSC received funding from
   <company id="132787">
    Oak Ridge National Laboratory
   </company>
   to develop advanced manufacturing processes for making second-generation HTS wire. That same year, the company raised more than $44 million through a secondary stock offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 AMSC acquired a company that previously was a customer, Windtec Consulting, to expand into the alternative energy market. The Austrian firm develops and licenses wind turbine system designs, and sells wind turbine electrical systems. Windtec became part of AMSC Power Systems.  Later that year AMSC bought Power Quality Systems (PQS) for nearly $4 million in stock. PQS made reactive compensation products based on its proprietary thyristor switch technology that enhance the reliability of power transmission and distribution grids and improve the quality of power for manufacturing operations. The products complement what AMSC previously offered electrical utilities in the area of reactive compensation. PQS also became part of AMSC Power Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales hovered around $50 million until 2008, a year after the company reorganized. The previous year AMSC closed the SuperMachines plant in Westborough, Massachusetts, and transferred production to its facility in nearby Devens. AMSC also cut its Massachusetts workforce by 37 employees, or about 13% of its headcount. It also decided to close its headquarters building in Westborough and to relocate the remaining personnel to its facility in Devens.
