   A leading commercial printer, Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) has diversified beyond the business of spreading ink on paper. The global firm still produces books and magazines, dictionaries, catalogs, and business forms, and it has added items such as CD-ROMs, holograms, and smart cards to the mix, while subsidiary

   sells e-books. Its Lifestyle and Industrial Supplies segment makes decorative materials for use in fixtures and furniture, along with packaging for consumer products. Its Electronics segment's products include photomasks used in the manufacture of integrated circuits and color filters for LCD panels. DNP also has a Beverage unit through which it owns a majority of Hokkaido Coca-Cola Bottling.

  <p>
   In 1876 Shueisha, the predecessor to Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), was established in central Tokyo. As the only modern printing firm in Japan, it was well-positioned to attract the business of the emerging newspaper and book industries. The company originally used a movable-type hand printer, but became the first private industry to use steam power in Japan when it updated its presses in 1884.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following Japanese victories over China and Russia at the turn of the century, Japan embarked on a period of military and economic expansion. This was matched by a growing demand for printing. In 1927 Japan published 20,000 book titles and 40 million magazines. The country's first four-color gravure printing system was inaugurated the following year. In 1935 Shueisha changed its name to Dai Nippon Printing following its merger with Nisshin Printing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1930s and 1940s were lean times for printers; Japan's repressive military government suppressed publishers and banned books. WWII devastated the publishing industry, along with the rest of the Japanese economy, but the publishing industry recovered soon after the end of the war. DNP was assisted in its recovery by government contracts; in 1946 it was designated by the Ministry of Finance to print 100-yen notes. In 1949 the company entered the securities printing business, and in 1951 it expanded into packaging and decorative interiors production. DNP reemerged in 1958 as Japan's largest printing firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1963 DNP followed Toppan in setting up an office in Hong Kong. Both Hong Kong and Singapore had become havens for Shanghai printing entrepreneurs who had emigrated in the face of the Communist takeover of China in 1949. These cities became centers for low-cost, high-quality color printing for British and American book publishers. In 1973 DNP overtook R. R. Donnelley as the world's largest printer. The next year the company set up a subsidiary in the US, DNP (America), Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   DNP moved into the information processing business in the 1980s, developing a credit card-sized calculator in 1985, a digital color printer system in 1986, and a Japanese-language word processor in 1987. The company launched Hi-Vision Static Pictures in 1989 to market a process that converted data into a form used by high-definition TV. In 1990 DNP bought a controlling stake in Tien Wah Press, the #1 printer in Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year DNP completed the first construction stage of its Okayama plant, dedicated to information media supplies (mainly transfer ribbons for color printers). The second stage, specializing in interior decorative materials, was completed in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 the company launched its Let's Go to an Amusement Park! virtual reality software system. Two years later DNP produced an integrated circuit card for about a tenth of current costs, giving it a major competitive edge in the magnetic card market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company began selling CD-ROMs online through subsidiary TransArt. The following year Dai Nippon formed partnerships or joint ventures with Toshiba (to develop printed circuit boards), Microsoft (to develop Windows-based smart cards), and Numerical Technologies (to develop advanced phase-shifted photomasks). In 2002 the company joined with Toshiba and Takara to develop and promote a lightweight educational computer called an Ex-Pad.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company renamed its Industrial Supplies operation to become Lifestyle Materials, and made plans to expand that business. The following year it purchased a stake in bookstore chain Maruzen and invested in TRC Inc., a provider of library operation services. In 2008 TRC became a wholly owned subsidiary of DNP.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company ramped up efforts to revitalize Japan's ailing book market through investments and acquisitions in 2009. Aiming to boost education and publishing operations, DNP acquired a majority stake in bookseller Junkudo, which operates about 30 shops in major Japanese cities. It also invested in Shufunotomo Co., a women's magazine publisher. DNP combined its resources and influence with three other Japanese publishers, agreeing to acquire a roughly 30% stake in secondhand bookseller Bookoff. The chain operates through about 1,000 stores across Japan.
