   ImClone Systems wants to create identically successful cancer drug candidates. The company, a subsidiary of neuroscience products maker
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   , is focused on the development of oncology-related antibody therapies. The biotech research firm's only commercial product, Erbitux, is approved for treatment of colorectal cancer, as well as head and neck cancers. ImClone Systems co-promotes the drug with
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   (BMS) in North America and with
   <company id="58089">
    Merck KGaA
   </company>
   elsewhere. The company is continuing to develop Erbitux as a possible treatment for other kinds of cancer, including lung cancer. It also has other potential oncology treatments in development.

   In addition to its manufacturing facilities in Branchburg, New Jersey, ImClone has its research headquarters located in New York City, and it maintains international operations in Europe.

  <p>
   With Erbitux its only product on the market, expanding the drug's approved uses has been a top priority for ImClone, and research partner BMS continues to invest in further development of the drug. Originally approved to treat colorectal cancer, Erbitux has also won its approval as a therapy for head and neck cancer. The companies are testing Erbitux for the treatment of additional tumor types.
  </p>
  <p>
   ImClone doesn't want to be a one-drug wonder, however. The company's pipeline has several large-molecule (biologic) candidates in clinical development targeting virtually all major solid tumor types. ImClone also has several investigational monoclonal antibodies in various stages of clinical development. The potential antibody therapies are being tested for their ability to slow tumor growth by targeting tumor cell growth factors and inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). One lead drug candidate is ramucirumab, in development to treat gastric and breast cancers.

   In 2014 ImClone entered a licensing and collaboration agreement with Zymeworks Inc. to develop oncology drugs using Zymeworks' proprietary Azymetric platform.

  <p>
   Founded in 1984, ImClone was acquired by Eli Lilly in 2008 for $6.5 billion, after rejecting bids from partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Prior to being acquired by Lilly, ImClone was an object of affection for billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who initiated a board shakeup and management restructuring. Also, ImClone is known for being the subject of an insider trading scandal involving founder and former CEO Sam Waksal and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart.
