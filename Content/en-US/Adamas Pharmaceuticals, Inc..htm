   Adamas Pharmaceuticals plans to bring lasting relief to those who suffer with diseases and disorders of the central nervous system. The company has one approved product, Namenda, which is marketed in the US by fellow pharma company
   <company id="11951">
    Forest Laboratories
   </company>
   . Namenda treats dementia associated with Alzheimer's. Adamas is also developing an extended release version of the product with Forest. Adamas' lead clinical candidate treats a movement disorder caused by medication for Parkinson's disease; there is no treatment for the condition. The candidate, which it owns outright, also treats behavioral symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury. The company was formed in 2000 and went public in 2014.

  <p>
   Forest markets Namenda in the US and will have the same rights to any successful product that comes from its trials of the extended release version. For other products in development, Adamas intends to keep the rights and hire a sales and marketing team for them.

  <p>
   With only one product on the market, the company has very little revenue though the amount did nearly double from 2012 to 2013. It spent considerably less on operating expenses and wound up with a 65% increase in net income for 2013. Cash flow continued improve and the company reported a 34% uptick in 2013.

  <p>
   Going forward the company plans to continue it strategy of finding approved products that aren't being fully utilized, tweaking them a bit, and sending them out in the world to treat central nervous system problems. Specifically, it plans to get FDA approval for its lead candidate, find additional uses for it, create a sales force for it, develop additional drugs, and help Forest achieve approval and commercialization for extended-release Namenda.
