   Located in Tulare, California -- near more than 300 million dairy cows -- feed maker J. D. Heiskell &amp; Company has taken the real estate mantra to heart. But in addition to its home-base location, location, location, Heiskell also has other mills elsewhere in California, and in Idaho, and New Mexico, and a network of merchants that positions the company to be among the leading feed providers in the US. It purchases grain and other ingredients from farmers in the Midwest, markets grain nationwide, and ships feed products to customers throughout the country, though it focuses on the West Coast. The privately-owned company, founded in 1886, is still controlled by descendants of founder Jefferson Davis Heiskell.

   Heiskell acquires smaller feed and grain operations, knitting them into its networks of feed providers and storage providers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company bought Stoneham Elevator in Stoneham, Colorado. Heiskell was familiar with the property, from which it leased leased and operated  it on a seasonal basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In another 2015 deal Heiskell partnered with AMERRA Capital Management to acquire minority interests in the newly formed Norbest, a privately held turkey grower and processor, in Moroni, Utah. In 2014, Heiskell bought English Feed Yard near Wiggins, Colorado.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its feed making capabilities and capacity, in 2012 Heiskell formed a joint venture with Kent Nutrition Group to create Gold Star Feed and Grain, LLC, a provider of mixed dairy feeds, food commodities, mineral packages, and other nutrition inputs for dairy operators in the Northeast. In 2014, Heiskell bought Kent's share of the venture and became sole owner and operator of Gold Star Feed and Grain.
