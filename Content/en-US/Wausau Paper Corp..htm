   The company markets its products for away-from-home markets such as commercial and governmental office buildings, academic, and medical facilities and other users favoring the use of 'green' washroom products. Products are sold to paper and sanitary supply distributors in North America that serve factories and other commercial and industrial locations, health service facilities, office buildings, restaurants, theme parks, airports, and hotels.

  <p>
   Wausau Paper has suffered significant decreases in revenue the last two out of three years. Revenues dropped 58% from $822 million in 2012 to $349 million in 2013. The large decline was primarily the result of losses it accrued from its discontinued specialty paper and printing and writing business. In fiscal 2014, revenues remained flat at around $350 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted net losses of $97 million in 2013 and $19 million in 2014 primarily due to its losses from discontinued operations. Its bottom line has also negatively been affected by an increase in interest expenses. Wausau Paper's operating cash flow has additionally steeply declined the last few years, but it climbed by $4 million in 2014 due to additional cash affiliated with its divestitures.

  <p>
   Wausau Paper is focusing solely on its tissue business for growth as it divests underperforming and non-core segments. In mid-2013 it permanently closed its Brainerd, Minnesota, mill. It also completed the sale of its specialty paper business, ending its participation in the markets in which its former Paper segment competed. During 2012 the company sold its Premium Print and Color Brands, including Astrobrights, Astroparche, and Royal products, to fellow paper producer

   Norman Brokaw founded Wausau as a pulp mill in 1899, and in 1900 it produced its first paper. Wausau acquired Rhinelander Paper in 1980 and established export sales subsidiary Wausau Papers International in 1992. The company rebranded itself as Wausau Paper in 2004.
