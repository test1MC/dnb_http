   As one of the world's largest makers of automotive mirrors, Magna Mirrors is not scared of its own competitors' reflections. The Vision Systems unit of
   <company id="47972">
    Magna International
   </company>
   , Magna Mirrors produces interior and exterior rearview mirrors with value-added features (e.g. built-in electronic displays and auto-dimming glass), as well as actuators (motors for power mirrors) and electronic vision systems (back-up and blind spot cameras and sensors). The company also makes door handles, keyless entry devices, and overhead consoles. The company operates worldwide via facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia, and South Africa.

   Magna Mirrors maintains its competitive position against such giants as
   <company id="13558">
    Gentex
   </company>
   by focusing on electronic vision systems that support driver safety and convenience. Its mirrors display video from back-up cameras, GPS navigation system maps, compass and temperature information, and other electronic-based information. BlindZoneMirror, ReversAid, and NaviMirror are among Magna's key brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company manufactures and engineers some 55 million interior and exterior mirrors annually.

   Like most companies in the manufacturing sector, Magna Mirror grows by expanding its manufacturing capacity and by launching new products. In 2013 Magna International extended its business in Eastern Europe by opening a new Greenfield manufacturing plant in Kocaeli, Turkey. The facility primarily makes fascias and outside mirrors for the new Ford Transit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2013 Magna Mirrors invested $11 million in three US facilities in the Holland area in Michigan, some of which are used for manufacturing of a new rimless mirror that are featured in new models of the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette.

  <p>
   Donnelly was founded in 1905 to make mirrors for the furniture industry. As the automobile industry grew in the 1920s, the company added car window glass to its product line. Donnelly made specialized lenses and mirrors for use in WWII, later coming up with a number of innovations that expanded its presence in the auto market of the 1950s. These included convex exterior mirrors that extend the driver's field of vision. In 1974 Donnelly invented modular windows, which boast lower cost and greater design flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   After going public in 1988, Donnelly continued to pursue new technology. It developed an electrochromic coating to reduce mirror glare, and after years of court battles over the patent with rival Gentex, received a $6 million out-of-court settlement in 1996. As part of its strategy to enter joint ventures in emerging markets, that year and the next Donnelly set up joint ventures in Brazil, China, and Malaysia. Also in 1997, the company entered a joint venture with Lear Corporation to produce overhead automotive systems. (It sold its share in the joint venture to Lear in 1999.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company's Donnelly Optics subsidiary suffered losses after Intel canceled orders. The next year Donnelly sold the unit -- which used thermoplastic materials rather than glass to make optical lenses for lighting and imaging systems -- to Applied Image Group. To cut costs in Europe, Donnelly began consolidating two plants in Germany in 1999 and laying off about 200 workers there. The following year Donnelly bought the Ireland-based operations of IEC Electronics (electronic displays, sensors, and automotive warning systems). Late in 2000 Johnson Controls bought a 15% stake in Donnelly.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company announced a restructuring of its global operations, splitting it into two units: electronic systems and exterior systems. Donnelly also acquired full ownership of its Donnelly/Arteb, Ltda. (Brazil) joint venture from Arteb Industrias S.A. The enterprise, renamed Donnelly do Brasil, makes and supplies interior and exterior mirrors for a variety of Brazilian-built vehicles. The company also bought the remaining equity of Donnelly Electronics Inc. (circuit board assemblies), achieving full ownership of the enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
   Donnelly Corporation was purchased in 2002 by Canadian auto parts giant

   </company>
   in a stock-and-debt deal valued at $320 million.
