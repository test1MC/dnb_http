   Churning out dairy foods since 1918, Darigold is the processing and marketing subsidiary of the
   <company id="105815">
    Northwest Dairy Association
   </company>
   (NDA).&#160;The company operates a&#160;dozen&#160;processing plants and boasts more than 500 member/farmers. As part of its business, Darigold makes and distributes fluid milk, butter, cottage cheese, yogurt, and other cultured dairy products, marketing them under both private labels and the Darigold brand name. The Seattle-based&#160;dairy company&#160;offers its products to wholesale and retail food companies, as well as to foodservice operators. Most of its sales are generated from selling dairy ingredients to other food manufacturers.

   Aside from its production plants across four US states, Darigold owns and operates the largest butter churn in the US&#160;that produces more than 28,000 pounds of butter every hour.&#160;The company&#160;produces 2 million gallons of milk every day and manufactures 150 million pounds of cheese every year.

   Parent NDA expanded the Darigold operation after its purchase of Montana's Country Classic Dairies. Adding Country Classic Dairies has&#160;boosted Darigold's&#160;footprint in the Northwestern US and added&#160;30 member/farmers&#160;who altogether churn out&#160;about 160 million pounds of milk a year (more than half of Montana's milk supply). (NDA and Country Classic's union was the culmination of a longtime working relationship; years ago, Country Classic used the Darigold name to market its products.)
