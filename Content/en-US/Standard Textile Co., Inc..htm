   Meeting industry standards is not enough for Standard Textile. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes decorative and workwear textiles for health care, hospitality, and institutional use. Health care products include bedding, surgical gowns, and incontinence care items. Hospitality goods include custom towels, blankets, and woven sheeting. Standard Textile's workwear line offers coveralls and sport jackets. Bedspreads, flame-resistant drapery, and window treatments are part of its decorative products mix. The company, which has more than 70 patents, manages its own R&amp;D, manufacturing, distribution, and technical services. The privately held company is led by its founder's grandson, Gary Heiman.

   Standard Textile's emphasis on Research and Development gives it an edge in the institutional textile industry. To further accelerate innovation, in 2013 the company began construction on Phase I of an Innovation Center.

   To incorporate new innovations in terry towel finishing, in 2014 it also expanded its existing manufacturing operations in Union County, South Carolina. With an investment of $5 million, the expanded plant will facilitate new partnerships and opportunities in Standard Textile's yarn spinning, yarn preparation, and weaving processes.
