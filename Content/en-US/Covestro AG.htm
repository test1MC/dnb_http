   Covestro (formerly Bayer MaterialScience), part of the
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer Group
   </company>
   , is one of the world's largest producers of polymers and high-performance plastics.  It has three business units: polyurethanes, polycarbonates, and coatings; adhesives; and specialties. Covestro, with 30 major production sites worldwide, markets primarily to the automotive, construction, electrical and electronics, packaging and medical equipment, and sports and leisure industries. European customers makes up 40% of the unit's sales. Bayer spun off a third of Covestro in a 2015 IPO.

  <p>
   Bayer announced plans to spin off the plastics business in mid-2015, providing the unit with flexibility to independently grow (and allowing its remaining HealthCare and CropScience to better focus on life sciences). Covestro's initial public offering was the largest in Germany since 2007; it valued Covestro at â‚¬8.9 billion. Bayer plans to eventually sell off its entire stake in Covestro.

  <p>
   Covestro is divided into two segments -- Systems and Materials. The Systems segment's polyurethanes business unit alone accounts for nearly half of Covestro's annual sales. The company's next largest business unit, polycarbonates, resides within the Materials segment. The polycarbonates unit accounts for about a quarter of the company's sales; its primary product is the plastic Makrolon, an important component of CDs and DVDs, protective sportswear, and corrective lenses.
