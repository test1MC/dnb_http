   DataCard's acquisition of Entrust was a bold stroke that expanded the offerings of both companies and their geographic reach. DataCard had expanded throughout the Asia/Pacific region, primarily in China where it has five offices. It has also expanded its operations in India (via a 2012 alliance with CardPro Solutions) and the UK (via a 2011 partnership with distributor DED Limited). Entrust brought operations in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   In 2014 DataCard launched a new logistics and distribution center in Hong Kong, China. The new location allowed the company to confirm orders and respond to shipment status inquiries within local working time parameters without having to bridge the gap between time zones. (The company previously extended its reach in South America with the opening of a new office in Brazil in 2013.)

   The Entrust line includes a range of Software-as-a-Service products as more customers move to the cloud. Another growth area for Entrust has been mobile; the company is using embedded biometrics and digital certificates on smartphones to provide enhanced security using near-field communication and Bluetooth standards. To help streamline these efforts and reduce costs, in 2014 Entrust launched its cloud-based Entrust IdentityGuard Cloud Services, which consolidates the management of digital identities, SSL certificates, and credentials via a single platform.
