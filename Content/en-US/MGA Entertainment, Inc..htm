   The company is working to ink new agreements and roll out new products. In 2013 MGA inked a seven-year international licensing agreement with car seat and travel accessory company Diono to produce more than 50 new items, from car seats and strollers to travel accessories and gear. The deal follows MGA's earlier agreement with tween apparel retailer Justice (for its Novi Stars line of entertainment).

   MGA Entertainment has owned the exclusive license to sell Zapf Creation's products in American markets since 2007. In return, Zapf Creation is paid a distribution fee to sell MGA products in certain European markets.

  <p>
   MGA Entertainment ended a legal battle with rival toy maker Mattel in 2011 over the Bratz line of multi-ethnic dolls. The aptly dubbed "doll wars" took a toll on MGA's finances. The company incurred more than $137 million in legal fees associated with copyright and trade secrets issues. It also missed out on the benefits of its top-selling Bratz, whose revenues were diverted to an escrow account until all appeals were exhausted. In 2011 Mattel's claim to the dolls was denied and its rival awarded $319 million in damages and legal fees. Mattel moved to appeal the award in spring 2012, but dropped its claim that MGA infringed on its copyright.
