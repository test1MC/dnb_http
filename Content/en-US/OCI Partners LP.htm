   OCI Partners is bringing methanol production back to the good ol' US of A. The company reopened a methanol and ammonia plant in Beaumont, Texas, in 2012. (It's actually the largest methanol plant in the US; currently, most of the country's methanol is imported from Trinidad.) The plant (shut down by
   <company id="10787">
    Terra Industries
   </company>
   in 2004) has an annual production capacity of 730,000 tons of methanol and 265,000 tons of ammonia. OCI Partners sells the methanol and ammonia to customers such as
   <company id="40267">
    Koch Industries
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="44119">
    Methanex
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="40470">
    Transammonia
   </company>
   , who use it to create other chemicals. OCI Partners is affiliated with Egypt-based
   <company id="133771">
    Orascom Construction Industries
   </company>
   (OCI). It went public in 2013.

  <p>
   OCI Partners plans to use the majority of its $315 million in proceeds to repay debt. Any remainder will be used for upgrades to the plant.

   Both methanol and ammonia are global commodities used as building blocks for other chemical products. Methanol is used to make adhesives for wood products, such as plywood, particle board and laminates, resins to treat paper and plastic products, paint and varnish removers, solvents for the textile industry, and polyester fibers for clothing and carpeting. Outside the US, methanol is used as automobile fuel.

   Ammonia is mostly used as a feedstock to produce nitrogen fertilizers. It's also used in industrial applications to make plastics, synthetic fibers, resins, and numerous other chemical compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   The plant uses natural gas as its primary feedstock to make methanol and ammonia. OCI Partners buys natural gas from

   OCI Partners is hoping the reopening of a US-based methanol plant will fuel the domestic market. Using inexpensive natural gas as a feedstock, methanol is now financially viable to produce in the US, and the company expects customers to shift from imported methanol from foreign producers in Trinidad and China. OCI Partners' plant was built by
   <company id="10487">
    du Pont
   </company>
   in 1967 and produced methanol under various owners until 2004, when high natural gas prices forced most of the methanol plants to shut down in the US.

  <p>
   Organized as a limited partnership, OCI Partners is not subject to federal income tax. In turn, the company must distribute cash dividends each quarter to shareholders -- one of the benefits in investing in an energy-related limited partnership.
