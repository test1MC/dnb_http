   Tata Motors has seen significant growth over the last five years, with 2014 representing its best year to date. From 2013 to 2014 its total revenues in rupees increased by 24% (or 13% when converted into US dollar), and its net income surged by 46% (34% in US dollar).
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was fueled by a spike in sales from its Range Rover and Jaguar vehicles. The increase was also attributable to an indirect tax incentive by Jaguar Land Rover.
