   Norcros is a UK shower and flooring holding company which consists of four independently operated businesses: Triton Showers; Johnson Tiles; Vado (which manufactures taps, mixer showers, valves and bathroom accessories); and Norcros Adhesives (tile adhesive and grouts). The company's subsidiaries also make and distribute tiles and adhesives, and associated products such as sanitaryware, in South Africa under the Johnson, TAL, and Tile Africa brands. Norcos companies mainly sell products to consumers, architects, designers, retailers, and wholesalers. The firm mainly does business in the UK and South Africa, though it also has operations in Ireland, South America, India, and the Middle East.

   Norcros organizes its business based on its two largest geographic markets: the UK, which generated 67% of its sales in fiscal 2015 (ended March 31); and South Africa, which generated most of its remaining sales.

  </p>
  <p>
   Norcros' revenues and profits have steadily risen over the past few years mostly thanks to added business from its newly acquired companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's sales rose by 2% to £222 million in fiscal 2015 (ended March 31) primarily as new housing build activity picked up in the UK, though it also enjoyed some uptick from the growing retail sector as well. Sales were up for its Triton, Vado, and Norcros adhesives, which offset lower sales from Johnson Tiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite higher sales in FY2015, Norcros' net income dipped to £8.2 million mostly due to acquisition-related costs from its purchase of Vado, and an increase in taxation charges due to the geographic mix of its profits and higher non tax-deferrable expenses (such as amortization costs). Norcros' operating cash levels jumped 40% to £14.4 million on improved underlying operating cash flow, lower cash-based tax and interest payments, and lower exceptional item costs.

  <p>
   Norcros's main strategies for growth, reiterated in 2015, included: acquiring companies that expand its product offerings in "complementary markets with attractive returns on capital," which include bathroom and kitchen products for commercial and home use; and growing organically by investing in new product development and leveraging its wide variety of complementary businesses to promote cross-selling and existing-business growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also planned in 2015 to reinforce its "designed and built in Britain" credentials to promote its business in the UK, and expand its business into higher-growth markets in South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking to refocus its businesses in its key markets in the UK and South Africa, Norcros sold its Johnson Tiles Australia in mid-2014.

  <p>
   In June 2015, Norcros expanded its bathroom product range after its nearly £22 million-acquisition of Hampshire-based Croydex Group, a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of high-quality bathroom furnishings and accessories with established customer relationships in the UK trade and retail segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In March 2013, the company bought Vado, which expanded its product offerings to include taps, mixer showers, valves and bathroom accessories.
