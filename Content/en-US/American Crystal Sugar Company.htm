   Call it saccharine, but for American Crystal Sugar, business is all about sharing. This sugar beet cooperative is owned by some 2,800 growers in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota who farm more than one-half million owned and contracted acres of cropland. American Crystal, formed in 1899 and converted into a co-op in 1973, divides the 35-mile-wide valley into five districts, each served by a processing plant. The plants produce sugar, molasses, and beet pulp. American Crystal's products are sold internationally to industrial users and to retail and wholesale customers under the Crystal name, as well as under private labels through marketing co-ops

   and Midwest Agri-Commodities.

   The company has two reportable operating segments: sugar and leasing. Sugar is engaged in the production and marketing of sugar from sugar beets and also sells agri-products and sugar beet seed. Leasing is involved in the leasing of a corn wet milling plant used in the production of high-fructose corn syrup.

   American Crystal Sugar's subsidiary, Sidney Sugars, operates a processing facility in Montana, and owns a plant in Wyoming, which is leased to another sugar cooperative. American Crystal other interests include a controlling stake in the corn-sweetener joint venture ProGold. ProGold leases its wet corn milling facility to

   ; the facility produces high-fructose corn syrup -- the sweetener of choice for US food and beverage makers.

  <p>
   From 2011 to 2012 American Crystal's revenues decreased by 4%, and its net income plummeted by 32%. Revenues decreased mainly due to a decrease in volumes of sugar and pulp, which reflect the impact of less product availability due to a smaller sugar beet crop in fiscal 2012 as compared to the previous year. The decrease in net income was attributed to an increase in operating costs, which included additional costs associated with a union labor lockout.
