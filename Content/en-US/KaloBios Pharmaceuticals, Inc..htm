   KaloBios Pharmaceuticals seeks the "good life" (its meaning from the Greek) for patients afflicted with serious medical conditions, especially respiratory diseases and certain cancers. It is developing drugs containing antibodies produced via its own technology. The most advanced is in clinical trials and is engineered to fight common bacteria, found even in hospitals, that cause pneumonia in patients treated by mechanical ventilation. KaloBios has partnered with
   <company id="104346">
    Sanofi Pasteur
   </company>
   to further develop, manufacture, and market the drug. It also is working on antibodies to treat severe cases of asthma and blood disease. In July 2016 the company emerged from a six-month stint in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

  <p>
   KaloBios is using proceeds from the offering to finance the development of its products through clinical trials, for working capital, and for general corporate purposes.

   Though KaloBios increased its revenue from 2010 to 2011 by 14%, the amount was a slim $20 million, and it has yet to report a profitable year. However, losses decreased by 56% in that two-year period.

  <p>
   The main focus of the company's long-term strategy is on the clinical development of its three lead drug candidates. It is especially interested in identifying classes of patients apt to respond positively to its products in order to keep down the cost of clinical trials and enhance the possibility of regulatory approval. KaloBios also wants to bolster its relationship with Sanofi Pasteur in the development and marketing of its lead product.

  <p>
   KaloBios has patented its Humaneered antibody technology designed to develop products with a high specificity for their targets and a minimum of side effects. It has also granted
   <company id="114003">
    Novartis
   </company>
   a license to use this technology.
