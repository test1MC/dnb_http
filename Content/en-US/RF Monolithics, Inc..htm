   Three former
   <company id="11462">

   </company>
   engineers, including Darrell Ash, founded RF Monolithics (RFM) in 1979. Their goal was to explore commercial applications for the surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology used in military systems such as friend-or-foe identification transponders. RFM's first product was a UHF resonator that stabilized cable TV signals. After losing market share, partly due to Japan's expansion in the industry, RFM began making components for satellite receivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 it introduced a line of high-speed digital clocks for use as timing devices in computer microprocessors. The company refused an acquisition offer from
   <company id="13166">
    Dallas Semiconductor
   </company>
   in 1994 and went public, as planned, a few weeks later.
  </p>
  <p>
   RFM introduced its Virtual Wire low-power data transmission devices and SAW filters for cell phone base stations and modems in 1995. The next year Sam Densmore was promoted from EVP to CEO, replacing 10-year veteran Gary Anderson. As its core low-power wireless component business matured in the mid 1990s, RFM began focusing on development of other higher-margin products such as signal filters for cell phone base stations and short-range radio systems for use in wireless inventory equipment and wireless computer mice.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced SAW filters for wireless networks and cable TV infrastructure applications in 1997. The next year it expanded its wafer factory and signed a distribution agreement with Spectrum Microwave Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Densmore retired and was replaced by marketing VP David Kirk; Michael Bernique, CEO of network services firm TelOptica, was named to the newly created position of chairman. The next year, in an effort to broaden its product line and fight lagging sales, the company introduced optical networking components and new filters aimed at the third-generation wireless market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 RFM cut about a third of its workforce and outsourced much of its manufacturing. The company bought one of the two Dallas buildings it occupies in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   RFM in 2005 formed RFM Technologies, a subsidiary to invest in technology companies and providers of wireless products. Also that year the company took a charge against earnings of $135,000, following the Chapter 11 filing by
   <company id="57829">
    Delphi
   </company>
   , a leading customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 RFM acquired
   <company id="131289">
    Cirronet
   </company>
   , a developer of wireless devices and modules. Cirronet became part of RFM's Wireless Solutions Group. RFM paid about $24 million in cash and stock for Cirronet, including around $4.8 million subject to the Cirronet business attaining performance goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also acquired Caver-Morehead Systems, a supplier of computerized maintenance management system software. An RFM subsidiary, Aleier, acquired substantially all of Caver-Morehead's assets. Caver-Morehead went for approximately $4 million in cash, half of which was held aside for a future earnout payment. The Aleier software and services business was discontinued in 2008.
