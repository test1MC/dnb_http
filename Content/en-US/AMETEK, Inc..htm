   You might say that AMETEK is powerfully instrumental. Its Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) makes monitoring, calibration, and display devices for the aerospace, heavy equipment, and power generation markets, among others. Its Electromechanical Group (EMG) makes air-moving electric motors for vacuum cleaners and other floor care equipment, blowers and heat exchangers, connectors for moisture-proof applications, and specialty metals for the aerospace, mass transit, medical, and office products markets. AMETEK has some 150 manufacturing facilities throughout the world; a bit more than half of its sales are to international customers.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   About 61% of AMETEK's sales are from its EIG segment with the rest from the EMG segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The products from the power and industrial instrumentation unit include power monitoring and metering instruments, uninterruptible power supply systems, and programmable power supplies. AMETEK's aerospace products include airborne data systems, turbine engine temperature measurement products, vibration-monitoring systems, cockpit instruments and displays, fuel and fluid measurement products, and sensors and switches. It sells to the commercial and military aerospace markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among AMETEK's technical motors and systems products are motion control mechanisms, brushless motors, blowers and pumps, and heat exchangers. They find uses in aerospace and defense, semiconductor equipment, computer equipment, mass transit, medical equipment, and power industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company places it manufacturing operations in low-cost areas to reduce expenses. They also are near customers. It has plants in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has operations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America. The US is AMETEK's largest market, accounting for 48% of sales. Asia and Europe (including the UK) generate 21% and 20% of sales, respectively. The company saw sales declines in all its foreign markets in 2015.

  <p>
   AMETEK markets its products through a combination of direct sales efforts and a network of distributors and sales representatives. Well represented among its customers are companies in the oil and gas, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and factory automation industries.

  <p>
   AMETEK's revenue slipped 1% to $3.97 billion in 2015. The EIG segment was essentially flat, while the EMG segment's revenue dropped 3%. It was it by an unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and a 2% internal sales decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reduced operating expenses helped net income post a slight (1%) increase in 2015 to about $591 million. Research and development fell some $8 million to $200 million in 2015 from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, operating cash flow decreased 7% to $672 million because of an increase in inventories and other current assets and bigger contributions to the company's defined benefit pension plan.

  <p>
   One key component of AMETEK's strategy for growth is the development of new products. The company reduced R&amp;D spending 4% in 2015 from 2014, but maintained a fast pace of product releases. The company's EIG segment focuses its product development efforts on several specialized markets, including process measurement, aerospace, and dashboard instruments. Its EMG segment concentrates on targeting the aerospace and defense, medical, business machine, and other markets with specialized products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, AMETEK released Reichert Technologies' Phoropter VRx digital refraction system; ScanMaster turnkey 3-D scanner; Crystal Engineering's HPC40 handheld pressure calibrator; TMC's STACIS III vibration cancellation systems; Terra SAS standalone solar array simulator; and Zygo's Nomad portable optical profiler. In early 2016 the company had already pushed out the MINIVAP VP Vision, a portable vapor pressure tester. It can measure gasoline, jet fuel, crude oil, LPG, and solvents without attachments.
