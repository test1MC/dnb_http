   The Tao of Dow Chemical is its integrated production of plastics, chemicals, hydrocarbons, and agrochemicals. The largest chemical company in the US and #2 worldwide behind
   <company id="41755">
    BASF
   </company>
   , Dow also makes performance plastics (engineering plastics, polyurethanes, and materials) for
   <company id="107984">
    Dow Automotive
   </company>
   . It uses chlorine-based and hydrocarbon-based raw materials to make more than 6,000 finished chemical products at 179 sites in 35 countries. The maker of Styrofoam insulation also is the world's #1 producer of chlorine and caustic soda, and a top maker of ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer. Dow also owns silicone products maker
   <company id="40132">
    Dow Corning
   </company>
   . In late 2015 Dow agreed to merge with rival
   <company id="10487">
    Dupont

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dow has operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the US accounted for 35% of the company's revenues; Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India (EMEAI), 31%; and the rest of the world, 34%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dow has five operating segments: Agricultural Sciences, Consumer Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions, Performance Materials and  Chemicals, and Performance Plastics:
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Plastics (Dow Elastomers; Dow Electrical and Telecommunications; Dow Hygiene and Medical; and Dow Performance Packaging) produces polypropylene and plastic applications. This segment accounted for 38% of the company's 2015 revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Materials (24%; Chlorinated Organics; Dow Automotive Systems; Epoxy; Oxygenated Solvents; Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluids; Polyurethanes; and Propylene Oxide/Propylene Glycol) makes adhesives, aircraft and runway deicing fluids, automotive interiors and exteriors, carpeting, footwear, and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Infrastructure Solutions segment (15%) is comprised of an industry-leading portfolio of businesses using advanced technology to deliver products such as architectural and industrial coating applications, building insulation, adhesives, microbial protection for the oil and gas industry, and water technologies (Dow Building &amp; Construction, Dow Coating Materials, Energy &amp; Water Solutions).
  </p>
  <p>
   Agricultural Sciences (13%; Crop Protection and Seeds, Traits and Oils) produces crop protection and plant biotechnology products, pest control products, and healthy oils.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumer Solutions segment (9%) consists of three global businesses: Consumer Care,
   <company id="107984">
    Dow Automotive Systems
   </company>
   and Dow Electronic Materials. These global businesses develop and market customized materials using advanced technology and chemistries for specialty applications (including semiconductors and organic light-emitting diodes, adhesives, and foams).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Dow owned 4,651 active US patents and 19,541 active foreign patents.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's products and services are marketed primarily Dow's own sales force, and third party distributors. The Agricultural Sciences segment has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of Dow's direct sales and marketing team partnering with distributors, independent retailers and growers, cooperatives, and agents worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industries served by Dow include appliance; automotive; agricultural; building and construction; chemical processing; electronics; furniture; housewares; oil and gas; packaging; paints, coatings and adhesives; personal care; pharmaceutical; processed foods; pulp and paper; textile and carpet; utilities; and water treatment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015, Dow's net revenues decreased by 16%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Infrastructure Solutions sales decreased by 14% due to the unfavorable impact of currency (one-third of the price decline) and lower raw material costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Materials &amp; Chemicals sales decreased by 15% due to currency exchange and a volume drop of 6%. Lower raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of currency drove price declines in Epoxy, Polyurethanes and Industrial Solutions. Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl reported lower prices as a result of the decline in ethylene prices and increased availability of caustic soda. Volume was impacted by recent divestitures, including the divestitures of ANGUS Chemical Company and the global Sodium Borohydride business and the split-off of the chlorine value chain. Industrial Solutions reported volume declines across all geographic areas (except Asia Pacific) due to weakness in the agriculture and energy market sectors and a change in a long-term supply arrangement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue from Performance Plastics sales declined by 24% as prices decreased across all geographic areas and all businesses in response to significantly lower raw material costs coupled with the unfavorable impact of currency. Double-digit price declines were reported in Hydrocarbons as prices for monomers and ethylene by-products as the result of low crude oil prices. Volume declined in the Energy business due to reduced sales in North America, which more than offset increased volume from new supply agreements with
   <company id="11116">
    Olin
   </company>
   as a result of the split-off of the chlorine value chain. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Hydrocarbons and Energy sales decreased by 10%, with prices down by 16% and volume up by 6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer Solutions sales decreased by 6% mainly due to the unfavorable impact of currency. Dow Electronic Materials volume declined slightly due to weakened demand for Interconnect Technologies and Display Technologies, which more than offset healthy demand in Semiconductor Technologies resulting from strong silicon wafer growth in mobile device applications, notably in Asia Pacific, and Growth Technologies. Prices declined in Consumer Care and Dow Automotive Systems due to continued competitive pricing and the unfavorable impact of currency in EMEAI. Price declined in Dow Electronic Materials due to the continued competitive pricing and the unfavorable impact of currency, primarily the Japanese yen.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Agricultural Sciences also declined.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Dow's net income was $7.69 billion, up 104% on 2014 due primarily to a $2.2 billion gain on the spin-off of the company's chlorine value chain; a Performance Plastics gain of $317 million; a $723 million gain on the sale of MEGlobal; a $682 million gain on the divestiture of ANGUS Chemical Company; a $618 million gain related to the sale of the AgroFresh business; and a $361 million gain on the Univation step acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $7.51 billion, up by 16% on 2014, due to higher income and changes in accounts and notes receivable, inventories, and accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to drive growth, Dow invests heavily in research and development that leads to launching products to meet its customers' and consumers' needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company was proceeding with its plans to build several new, specialty material production plants as part of its high value Performance Plastics franchise on the US Gulf Coast in order to take advantage of the abundance of lower cost feedstocks available from North American shale gas basins. When fully operational, Dow's collective feedstock and plastics expansions on the Gulf Coast are projected to deliver an estimated $2.5 billion in EBITDA annually. The new ethylene production plant in Freeport, Texas is the largest single-company complex in North America, manufacturing 44% of Dow products sold in the US and more than 20% sold worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow also announced plans to expand capacity and enhance production technologies and equipment of its polyethylene production units in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, to support increased demand for consumer and industrial films products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it made significant progress on its strategic investments in Saudi Arabia and the US Gulf Coast, and completed a number of divestitures (including the Dow Chlorine Products transaction), raising more than $13.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company sold its AgroFresh business to
   <company id="190013">
    AgroFresh Solutions
   </company>
   for $859 million. It also sold its ownership interest in MEGlobal, a nonconsolidated affiliate, to EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C. for $1.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also sells noncore businesses to pay down debt and invest in core projects, in 2015 Dow sold its ANGUS Chemical Company to
   <company id="159576">
    Golden Gate Capital
   </company>
   for $1.2 billion. ANGUS has a business headquarters and R&amp;D facility in Buffalo Grove, Illinois; manufacturing plants in Sterlington, Louisiana, and Ibbenbueren, Germany; and a packaging facility in Niagara Falls, New York. That year the company sold its global sodium borohydride business to
   <company id="152022">
    Vertellus Specialty Materials
   </company>
   for $190 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Dow became the 100% owner (up from 50%) of
   <company id="40132">
    Dow Corning
   </company>
   's silicones business, a global company with sales of more than $4.5 billion and with 25 manufacturing sites in nine countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Univation Technologies, LLC, previously a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and
   <company id="56162">
    ExxonMobil Chemical Company
   </company>
   , became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow as a result of ExxonMobil redeeming its entire equity interest in Univation in exchange for certain assets and liabilities of Univation.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dow AgroSciences LLC acquired Cooperativa Central de Pesquisa Agrícola's seed business for $169 million, with $121 million settled in 2015. The acquisition of Coodetec's seed business is expected to advance the development of Dow AgroSciences' soybean program and strengthen Dow's position in the corn market segment.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Herbert Dow founded Dow Chemical in 1897 after developing a process to extract bromides and chlorides from underground brine deposits around Midland, Michigan. Its first product was chlorine bleach. Dow eventually overcame British and German monopolies on bleach, bromides, and other chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1920s Dow rejected a takeover by
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   . By 1930, the year of Herbert Dow's death, sales had reached $15 million. Dow started building new plants around the country in the late 1930s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow research yielded new plastics in the 1940s, such as Saran Wrap, the company's initial major consumer product. In 1952 Dow built a plant in Japan (Asahi-Dow), its first subsidiary outside North America. Plastics represented 32% of sales by 1957, compared with 2% in 1940. Strong sales of plastics and silicone products propelled the company into the top ranks of US firms. Dow entered the pharmaceutical field with the 1960 purchase of Allied Labs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow suffered earnings drops from 1981 to 1983 from falling chemical prices. To limit the cyclical effect of chemicals on profits, the company expanded its interests in pharmaceuticals and consumer goods. In 1989 it merged its pharmaceutical division with Marion Labs to create Marion Merrell Dow (it sold its 71% stake to
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   in 1995). Also in 1989 it formed DowElanco, a joint venture with Eli Lilly to produce agricultural chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following allegations that it had put a breast implant on the market without proper testing,
   <company id="40132">
    Dow Corning
   </company>
   (a joint venture with glassmaker
   <company id="10409">
    Corning Inc.
   </company>
   ), the #1 producer of silicone breast implants, stopped making the devices in 1992. In 1995 a federal judge ordered Dow to pay a Nevada woman $14 million in damages -- the first breast-implant verdict against the company as a sole defendant. Facing thousands of pending cases, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection. (In 1998 Dow Corning agreed to pay $3.2 billion to settle most breast-implant claims.) Dow Corning finally climbed out of bankruptcy in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow entered the polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate markets with the 1996 purchase of INCA International, a subsidiary of Italy's Enichem. It also bought a stake in seed developer Mycogen.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its 80% of Destec Energy in 1997 and bought
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   's 40% stake in DowElanco (renamed
   <company id="59427">
    Dow AgroSciences
   </company>
   , 1998). That year Dow bought South Africa's Sentrachem (crop-protection products), but regulators made Dow sell part of it to
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Dow sold its DowBrands unit -- maker of bathroom cleaner (Dow), plastic bags (Ziploc), and plastic wrap (Saran Wrap) -- to
   <company id="40403">
    S.C. Johnson &amp; Son
   </company>
   . It also paid $322 million for the rest of Mycogen, which became part of
   <company id="59427">
    Dow AgroSciences
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The company paid $600 million in 1999 to purchase ANGUS Chemical (specialty chemicals) from TransCanada PipeLines. Dow also announced it planned to buy rival Union Carbide for $9.3 billion; it completed the acquisition early in 2001 after agreeing to divest some polyethylene assets to satisfy regulatory concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Dow acquired Flexible Products Company (polyurethane foam) and General Latex Chemical Corporation (rigid polyurethane foam). That year Michael Parker succeeded William Stavropoulos as president and CEO (Stavropoulos remained as chairman).
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow acquired
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
   </company>
   ' agricultural chemicals (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides) business for $1 billion in 2001. That year it also acquired Celotex Corporation's rigid-foam insulation business and UK fine and specialty chemicals firm Ascot Plc.
  </p>
  <p>
   A weakened economy, high raw material costs, and falling prices took a toll on Dow's sales and profits around the turn of the century. As a result of costs related to the Union Carbide takeover -- such as the $830 million charge related to Union Carbide's exposure to asbestos claims -- and the sputtering economy, Dow recorded its first annual loss in nearly 10 years in 2001, then reported another loss in 2002. Parker was let go and William Stavropoulos returned to his post as both chairman and CEO. Stavropoulos went to work cutting jobs and closing plants in an effort to cut at least $1 billion in costs and make the company cash-flow positive in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 2002 to 2004 the company cut nearly 7,000 jobs or better than 13% of its entire workforce. By 2004 those moves, coupled with a rebounding chemicals market, had made Dow profitable again. Stavropoulos felt comfortable enough to relinquish the chief executive title and gave it to president and COO Andrew Liveris.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the latter half of the decade, the company began to switch its focus to more downstream products like performance plastics and systems. It acquired Bayer company Wolff Walsrode in 2007 and then, more grandly, specialty chemicals company
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas
   </company>
   in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow did take on significant debt during the Rohm and Haas transaction, and as part of negotiations to close the deal, Rohm and Haas sold salt-producing subsidiary
   <company id="104200">
    Morton International
   </company>
   to German company
   <company id="91229">
    K+S
   </company>
   . Dow also sold Rohm and Haas's powder coatings business to
   <company id="41855">
    Akzo Nobel
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Dow sold its
   <company id="162389">
    Trinseo SA
   </company>
   (then called Styron) unit to private investment group
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   for $1.6 billion. Trinseo is a world leader in the production of plastics, latex, and rubber. Dow also sold its half of the
   <company id="159764">
    Americas Styrenics
   </company>
   joint venture with
   <company id="100766">
    Chevron Phillips Chemical
   </company>
   as part of the Trinseo deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dow also formed a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsui to build a world-scale chlor-alkali plant at Dow's Freeport, Texas, manufacturing complex. The venture makes chlorine for feedstocks to supply Dow's downstream performance operations. Mitsui's share of the chlorine produced is converted to ethylene dichloride, used primarily to make vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). VCM in turn is used to make polymers, used in plastics and a range of both synthetic and natural materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow sold its polypropylene business to Brazil's
   <company id="95085">
    Braskem
   </company>
   in 2011 for $323 million. The deal involved two manufacturing plants in the US (Freeport and Seadrift, Texas) and two in Germany (Wesseling and Schkopau), with a total annual polypropylene production capacity of 2.3 billion pounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   To produce a new chlorocarbon for next-generation, climate-friendly refrigerants, Dow agreed to form a joint venture with
   <company id="104705">
    Occidental Chemical Corporation
   </company>
   in 2011. Known as HCC-1230xa, the chlorocarbon will be used to produce the refrigerant known as HFO-1234yf, which has low global-warming potential and zero ozone depletion potential. It will initially be used in air-conditioning systems in autos.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Dow also formed an Advanced Electrolyte Technologies joint venture with
   <company id="56871">
    Ube Industries
   </company>
   to make electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries in energy storage applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dow formed another joint venture in 2011, this time with
   <company id="56032">
    Mitsui &amp; Co.
   </company>
   to develop biopolymers, or organic plastics, in Brazil. The 50-50 operation will use Dow's sugar cane production to develop biofuels and packaging materials, offering a "green alternative" and replacement product for the flexible packaging, hygiene, and medical markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Investing in the Middle East, Dow formed a joint venture in 2011 with Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) to build and operate a $20 billion chemicals complex in Jubail. Dow grew its presence in Saudi Arabia in 2012 with an investment in a plant at Jubail to make raw materials for paint and coating manufacturers in the region and for export markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company began a restructuring program designed to accelerate cost reductions. The program will cut 2,400 positions, or 5% of the global workforce, and close down 20 manufacturing plants. Since 2009 Dow has divested non-core businesses representing $8 billion in revenues. Among other units, Dow has targeted Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business unit and its Plastics Additives business unit for divestment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 the company's Dow Electronic Materials unit acquired Lightscape Materials, a spinoff of SRI International. US-based Lightscape Materials is a research company specializing in phosphor technology, used in LED light-based systems. The acquisition enhances Dow's new LED Technologies unit (formed in 2011), because phosphors are used to enrich color quality in applications such as backlights for LCD displays.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Dow formed a joint venture through its Dow Europe unit with Turkish acrylic fiber company Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii. Called DowAksa Advanced Composites, the venture will make carbon fiber and derivatives for industries such as transportation, wind energy, and construction.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Dow agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese company Befar Group to produce perchloroethylene, or PCE, a key building block material for non-ozone depleting refrigerants used in industrial, automotive, and consumer applications. The companies will develop a PCE manufacturing facility in Shandong Province, with a target capacity of 40,000 to 80,000 tons per year by 2014 to meet the growing needs of the Chinese market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Dow Electronic Materials and Nanoco formed a global licensing agreement for Nanoco's cadmium-free quantum dot technology. The deal brings together Nanoco's world-leading technology with Dow's large-scale manufacturing capability and well-established sales, marketing, and distribution network.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Dow AgroSciences acquired California-based Cal/West Seeds, a leading supplier of alfalfa, clover, and other crops to seed companies and growers in the US, Canada, and 25 other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company sold its Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business to
   <company id="11592">
