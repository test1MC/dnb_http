  <p>
   ATS embraces proactive maintenance of equipment to extend the life of a plant's manufacturing assets, which in turn increases its production, avoids capital expenses, and improves the manufacturer's ability to deliver. To combat a decline in skilled manufacturing workforces, ATS employs an aggressive recruitment and training plan to develop skilled maintenance personnel and fill demand. The company sponsors training, certifications, continuing education, and other programs for its employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   ATS's growth is fueled by its corporate strategy -- applying the principles of lean manufacturing made famous by
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   in the 1980s for improving efficiencies and profitability -- along with the global expansion of the industrial maintenance services market, which together enable the company to create new jobs in the manufacturing sector during a critical time for employment, when the need for skilled labor is forecast to increase significantly.

  <p>
   ATS also grows its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In 2014 it acquired Learn Maintenance, a training firm specializing in technical training for complex manufacturing tasks. The acquisition bolstered ATS' training footprint and provided a broader curriculum including more advanced training for ATS' technicians.

  <p>
   ATS, which grew out of an internal organization within
   <company id="10304">
    Caterpillar
   </company>
   , was formed as an extension of Caterpillar's maintenance operation to support the then new age of automation in the 1970s. A group of 35 employees led by Richard Blaudow created a business plan which was capable of supporting Cat and other manufacturing companies around the country in 1985. The group used the opportunity to expand the delivery of its services further. Blaudow's group purchased the company from Caterpillar in an LBO, and it formally became Advanced Technology Services in 1996.
