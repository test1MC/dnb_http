  <p>
   Minnesota's leading newspaper was formed through the 1982 merger of the evening
   <em>
    Minneapolis Star
   </em>
   and the morning edition
   <em>
    Minneapolis Tribune
   </em>
   . The
   <em>
    Star
   </em>
   was itself an amalgamation of two earlier papers, the
   <em>
    Minneapolis Star
   </em>
   and the
   <em>
    Minneapolis Journal
   </em>
   (which operated as the
   <em>
    Minneapolis Star-Journal
   </em>
   until 1947); the
   <em>
    Tribune
   </em>
   was founded in 1867.

  <p>
   Country banker Gardner Cowles ventured into newspapers in 1903 and later bought Iowa's
   <i>
    Des Moines Register.
   </i>
   His son John moved to Minneapolis to buy the
   <i>
    Minneapolis Star
   </i>
   (1935), the
   <i>
    Minneapolis Journal
   </i>
   (1939), and the
   <i>
    Minneapolis Tribune
   </i>
   (1941). The Cowles family built an empire around its Minneapolis newspapers that included several other newspapers and magazines, but the business began to crumble in the early 1980s. CEO John Cowles Jr. merged the
   <i>
    Star
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Tribune
   </i>
   in 1982 and cut staff. Still unsatisfied with the company's performance, the Cowles board (mostly family members) made John's cousin David Kruidenier CEO in 1983. David Cox became president in 1984 and CEO in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's fortunes improved in the late 1980s when it branched into non-print media. Beginning in 1988 Cowles Business Media (CBM) built a niche that included magazines, online services, newsletters, and conferences. The company continued to expand its non-newspaper offerings by buying new consumer and business magazines and how-to books.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Cowles launched
   <em>
    Star Tribune Online,
   </em>
   which became Minnesota's most-visited Web site. The next year CBM bought
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones
   </company>
   ' American Demographics subsidiary.
   <company id="10971">
    The McClatchy Company
   </company>
   acquired Cowles for $1.4 billion in 1998, then sold the company's non-newspaper holdings for $208 million. Later that year the company changed its name to The Star Tribune Company and newspaper executive John Schueler took the reins as president and publisher.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced several enhancements to the
   <i>
    Star Tribune
   </i>
   in 1999, including expanded sports and food sections. Schueler left the company in early 2001. He was replaced by J. Keith Moyer, who had been publisher of the
   <i>
    Fresno Bee
   </i>
   newspaper in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 private equity firm Avista Capital Partners acquired the company from McClatchy for $530 million. The deal was part of a sell-off by the newspaper giant following its $6.5 billion acquisition of
   <company id="10859">
    Knight Ridder
   </company>
   the previous year. Star Tribune named former
   <em>
    St. Paul Pioneer Press
   </em>
   publisher Par Ridder its new CEO and publisher, but he resigned later in 2007 and was replaced by Chris Harte.
  </p>
  <p>
   Saddled with debt from the buyout from McClatchy and citing a downturn in advertising revenue, Star Tribune reorganized under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. It emerged later that year under the control of a group of lenders led by private equity firm
   <company id="109881">
    Angelo Gordon
   </company>
   . Chris Harte left the business following the reorganization and was replaced by former
   <company id="43661">
    Time Inc.
   </company>
   executive Mike Klingensmith early the following year.
