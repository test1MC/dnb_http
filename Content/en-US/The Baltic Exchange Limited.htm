   Sales don't have to get in the way of sails, thanks to The Baltic Exchange. The company offers shipping market information consisting of independently-gathered, real-time freight data such as daily fixtures, indices for the cost of shipping wet (oil) and dry (coal and iron ore) products and route rates. Members can get information on particular ports and the agents assigned to them. The Baltic Exchange also offers a global marketplace for shipbrokers, ship owners, and charterers. The exchange provides members with a venue for buying and selling ocean-going vessels and resolving disputes, as well as a hub for industry networking. The Baltic Exchange traces its roots back to 1744 and is owned by its members.
