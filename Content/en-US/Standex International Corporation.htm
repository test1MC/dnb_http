  <p>
   The company's Food Service Equipment segment, 53% of sales, covers the entire food service process -- from storage to display -- by serving both the "cold" or refrigerated and "hot" or cooking and warming segments of the industry. Besides the usual restaurants and supermarkets, customers also include convenience stores, drug stores, hotels, and casinos. The segment additionally serves customers in the health science and medical industries, such as laboratories and blood banks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engraving, about 15% of sales, provides an attractive appearance for final products. The segment's mold texturizing services are used for plastic household items, toys, computers, and electronic devices, besides automotive products. Industries served include building products, textiles and paper, housewares, and construction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electronics and Hydraulics, 20% of sales (collectively), is divided into a custom hoists group, which makes hydraulic cylinders for dump trucks and dump trailers, and Sandex Electronics, a maker of products that include reed switches, electrical connectors, and sensors for such industries as automotive manufacturing, white goods, lighting, and HVAC. Engineering Technologies, 13% of sales, includes two units, Spincraft and Metal Spinners Group, which sell their products directly.

  <p>
   Standex has achieved historic growth over the last few years, with revenues increasing 8% from $716 million in 2014 to $772 million in 2015, a company milestone. Profits also surged 28% from $43 million in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $55 million in 2015 due to the increased revenue and a decline in restructuring expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was driven by organic sales all its segments except Electronics products. Food Service Equipment and Engineering Technologies revenue increased by 8% due to organic growth and additional revenue from a previous acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Standex's operating cash flow decreased by 9% to $64 million in 2015 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued payroll, employee benefits, and other liabilities.

  <p>
   Standex strategy also includes acquiring companies that can be bolted on to its core businesses to boost sales and reduce costs. In early 2015, the company acquired Enginetics Corporation, a producer of aircraft engine components for all major aircraft platforms, for $55 million. This purchase complemented its Engineering Technologies Group and enhanced its penetration within the aviation market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company purchased Ultrafryer Systems, a manufacturer of high quality commercial deep fryers for restaurant and commercial installations. The deal complemented its Food Service Equipment Group's product line and allowed it to provide broader products and services to restaurant chains and commercial food service installations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, Standex acquired planar technology from Planar Quality Corporation, a developer of transformers for commercial, military and space applications. That investment enhanced its Electronics Production Group's capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Standex sold its American Foodservice Company business unit to AFS All-American Millwork and Fabrication LLC. The sale adhered to its Food Service Equipment Group's strategy to tighten its focus and improve its margins.

  <p>
   John Bolton sold his plastics company, Bolta Co., to General Tire and Rubber in 1954. The next year Bolton, together with his son, John Jr., his son-in-law Daniel Hogan, and Samuel Dennis, bought religious material publisher Standard Publishing (founded 1866) and established Standard International. During the 1960s the company expanded and diversified; by 1964, the year it went public, its holdings included a Coca-Cola franchise in South America. The company acquired Master-Bilt in 1971. To convey a "sexier" image, the company changed its name to Standex in 1973.
