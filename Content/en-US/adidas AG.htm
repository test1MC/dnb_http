   Germany's adidas rings up more than 40% of its sales in Europe. North America and Greater China contribute 20% and 12% of sales, respectively. It also sells and distributes its shoes and apparel in Latin America and other markets in Asia. Key growth markets for the company include North America, China, Russia, Latin America, Japan, and the UK.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Adidas produces more than 660 million products. Its brand shoes are the company's cash cow, accounting for almost half of total sales. The Reebok brand and TaylorMade-adidas Golf each represent about 10%. While the company operates its own retail stores and sells shoes online, wholesaling is the bigger business, representing nearly two-thirds of total sales. The company supplies adidas and Reebok brand shoes to retailers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Retail segment comprises all business activities relating to the sale of adidas and Reebok products directly to end consumers through own retail and own e-commerce platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment includes the four brands --TaylorMade, adidas Golf, Adams Golf and Ashworth. TaylorMade designs, develops and distributes primarily golf clubs, balls and accessories. Adidas Golf products include footwear, apparel and accessories. Adams Golf designs and distributes golf clubs and a small range of accessories. Ashworth designs and distributes men's and women's golf-inspired apparel and footwear.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reebok-CCM Hockey designs, produces and distributes ice hockey equipment such as sticks, skates and protection gear, and apparel (mainly under the brand names Reebok Hockey and CCM).
  </p>
  <p>
   Other brands include Y-3 and Porsche Design Sport by adidas as well as the business activities of the brand Five Ten in the outdoor action sports sector, and the adidas NEO label.

  <p>
   In 2014 adidas' net revenues increased by 11.4% due to the following : Wholesale revenues rose 6% driven by strong growth at adidas, while Reebok revenues remained stable; Retail revenues increased 21% as a result of double-digit sales growth at both adidas and Reebok (concept stores, factory outlets and concession corners were all up at double-digit rates); while eCommerce grew by 72% on a currency-neutral basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Offsetting these gains, revenues of Other Businesses decreased 19% due to double-digit sales declines at TaylorMade-adidas Golf, partially countered by sales growth at Reebok-CCM Hockey and other centrally managed brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income plummeted by 45% in 2014 driven by higher cost of sales and currency conversion, and depreciation and amortization increases, which strongly outpaced higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 cash from operating activities grew by 11% due to higher payables to affiliated companies.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2010 adidas unveiled its strategic business plan -- called "Route 2015" -- outlining its strategies and objectives for the next five years. The plan set ambitious total group sales growth targets of 45% to 50% (on a currency-neutral basis). Aiming to grow its bottom line faster than its top line, adidas hopes to grow annual earnings at a compound annual growth rate of 15% and reach an operating margin of 11% sustainably by 2015. (In 2014 its operating margin was 6.6%.) Three markets singled out for their growth potential are North America, Greater China, and Russia, which are expected to contribute about 50% of the total group growth under the Route 2015 plan. In the US, the company believes its brands have enormous opportunity to gain market share by focusing on improved distribution and launching more innovative products.
  </p>
  <p>
   To fulfill its goal of growth in China, adidas says it will add 2,500 stores there by the end of 2015, putting upscale outlets in the large cities and teen-targeted, casual NEO shops in smaller markets. Other moves include expanding e-commerce, through a venture with China's biggest online retailer, Taobao.com; sponsoring running competitions; and partnering with workout center chains. Growing its business in Asia, in 2014, adidas expanded its own-retail activities in Beijing/China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Going forward, one of the company's strategies for success is to continue offering products with both mass and niche appeal, allowing each of its brands to maintain a unique identity. Part of the innovation is a fashion and sport line of apparel from a deal with
   <company id="54529">
    Giorgio Armani
   </company>
   , to go with adidas' SLVR and Y-3 lines. Another example is the mi line that combines technology and gear in customizable shoes, digital coaches, online support, heart rate sensing apparel, and mobile hardwear to connect it all.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it extended its longterm partnership with
   <company id="57447">
    FIFA
   </company>
   (adidas dominates the soccer boot market) until 2030.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, due to the continued weakness in the golf market, negative economic developments in Russia/CIS as well as ongoing currency headwinds, adidas postponed the delivery of its top- and bottom-line Route 2015 targets. As a result, the Group has been undergoing a thorough review of its strategic priorities. To raise cash, that year the company announced plans to sell its Rockport brand (which designs and distributes leather footwear for men and women) to a new entity formed by
   <company id="108788">
    Berkshire Partners
   </company>
   for $280 million.

  <p>
   adidas grew out of an infamous rift between German brothers Adi and Rudi Dassler, who created athletic shoe giants adidas and Puma. As WWI was winding down, Adi scavenged for tires, rucksacks, and other refuse to create slippers, gymnastics shoes, and soccer cleats at home. His sister cut patterns out of canvas. By 1926 the shoes' success allowed the Dasslers to build a factory. At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, German athletes first showcased Dassler shoes to the world. In 1936 American Jesse Owens sprinted to Olympic gold in Dassler's double-striped shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Business boomed until the Nazis commandeered the Dassler factory to make boots for soldiers. Although both Rudi and Adi were reportedly members of the Nazi party, only Rudi was called to service. Adi remained at home to run the factory. When Allied troops occupied the area, Adi made friends with American soldiers -- even creating shoes for a soldier who wore them at the 1946 Olympics. Rudi came home from an American prison camp and joined his brother; together they scavenged the war-torn landscape for tank materials and tents to make shoes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon a dispute between the brothers split the business. Rumors circulated that Rudi resented that Adi had failed to use his American connections to help spring him from prison camp. Rudi set up his own factory, facing Adi across the River Aurach. The brothers never spoke to each other again, except in court. Rudi's company was named Puma, and Adi's became adidas. Adi added a third stripe to the Dassler's trademark shoe, while Rudi chose a cat's paw in motion. Thus began one of the most intense rivalries in Europe. The children of Puma and adidas employees attended separate elementary schools, and the employees even distinguished themselves by drinking different beers.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Adi's innovations throughout the late 1940s and 1950s (such as the replaceable-cleat soccer shoe), adidas came to dominate the world's athletic shoe market. In the late 1950s it capitalized on the booming US market, overtaking the canvas sneakers made by P.F. Flyers and
   <company id="11409">
    Stride Rite
   </company>
   (Keds). The company also initiated the practice of putting logos on sports bags and clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   adidas continued to expand globally in the 1960s and 1970s to maintain its dominant position. However, a flood of new competitors following the 1972 Munich Olympics and the death of Adi in 1978 signaled the end of an era. As NIKE and Reebok captured the North American market during the 1980s, adidas made one of its biggest missteps -- it turned down a sneaker endorsement offer from a young Michael Jordan in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   French politician and entrepreneur Bernard Tapie bought the struggling company in 1989, but he stepped down in 1992 amid personal, political, and business scandals. The next year Robert Louis-Dreyfus became CEO. He shifted production to Asia, pumped up the advertising budget, and brought in former NIKE marketing geniuses to re-establish the company's identity.
  </p>
  <p>
   adidas became adidas-Salomon in 1997 with its $1.4 billion purchase of Salomon, a French maker of skis and other sporting goods. The company also opened its first high-profile store in Portland, Oregon, that year. In a 1998 reorganization, Louis-Dreyfus sacked Jean-Francois Gautier as Salomon's president in the wake of disappointing sales, particularly from TaylorMade Golf, Salomon's golf subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid a 10% slide in revenue, several key executives decided to leave the company in 2000, including adidas America CEO Steve Wynne. Citing poor health, Louis-Dreyfus soon followed (but remained as chairman); he was replaced by the new CEO of adidas America, Ross McMullin, who soon after was diagnosed with cancer. Later that year the company announced it would consolidate its apparel under the Heritage label to reinforce its position in the burgeoning casual wear market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Louis-Dreyfus retired as chairman and in March COO Herbert Hainer became chief executive. That year adidas-Salomon opened adidas Originals retail stores in Tokyo and Berlin; that was followed with a New York City store in 2002. Despite slumping sales in the US amid deep discounting by competitors, adidas announced in 2003 that it would not offer discounts and still intended to capture 20% of the country's shoe market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Britain's
   <company id="43759">
    Barclays Bank PLC
   </company>
   became adidas' largest shareholder in 2004, raising its stake to 5.4%. The company changed its name in 2006 to adidas AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2008 adidas AG won a $305 million award from a federal jury in Oregon for trademark violation of its three-stripe design by
   <company id="47979">
    Collective Brands

   , the operator of the
   <company id="158505">

   and Stride Rite shoe-store chains.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2011 adidas acquired outdoor specialist Five Ten, a leading brand in the technical outdoor markets and outdoor action sports community, for $25 million.
