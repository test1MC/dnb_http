   <company id="41884">
    Shiseido
   </company>
   's revenues in the Americas rose 523% in 2015 compared to 2014. In the Americas, the makeup artist brand NARS and the fragrance business performed well. Other drivers of sales growth included the global brand, which scored a hit with the launch of ULTIMUNE beauty serum in 2014, and bareMinerals, which benefited from a favorable response to BARESKIN, its first liquid foundation.

   Shiseido Americas planned to reengineer the value of company's brands and will concentrate investments where they will generate potent global growth, with emphasis on ULTIMUNE (launched in 2014).

   Shiseido's effort to boost sales of cosmetics in department stores was aided by its acquisition of
   <company id="151521">
    Bare Escentuals
   </company>
   . The 2010 $1.7 billion deal for the mineral-based makeup maker gave Shiseido a needed leg up in the US cosmetics market.
