   The company's sleek and pricey chair designs have taken a front-row seat on both the big screen and the small screen. The Freedom chair, which was Humanscale's entry product into the task seating market, has been the company's first of many innovative designs to not only win awards but to be spotlighted by Hollywood. The company's chairs have received numerous design awards and have been spotlighted on such shows as
   <em>
    24, Ugly Betty,
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Heroes,
   </em>
   as well as the films
   <em>
    The Bourne Ultimatum
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Mission: Impossible III
   </em>
   . Humanscale sold its millionth Freedom chair in 2009.
