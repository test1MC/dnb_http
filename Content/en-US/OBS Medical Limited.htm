   OBS Medical is in the business of developing products for the health care monitoring and diagnostic markets. Its products include a brain wave analyzer used to detect sleep disorders in patients. Its Visensia Safety Index monitors inpatients' vital signs (including heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen, blood pressure, and temperature) to help assure their wellness or alert staff that their attention is needed. Outside the UK, the company has US sales operations in Indianapolis and North Carolina. It actively seeks collaboration with like-minded partners around the world. OBS Medical was formed from the 2009 merger of Oxford BioSignals Limited and t+ Medical Ltd (formerly e-San).
