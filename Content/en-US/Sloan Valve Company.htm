   When nature calls, Sloan Valve Company springs into action. Thanks to its flagship flushometer products (hydraulic plumbing components that feature a unique diaphragm-type valve), toilets and urinals do their jobs with greater efficiency. Sloan also makes faucets, sinks, showerheads, bedpan washers, and hand dryers, several of which are sensor-activated. Its HEALTHMINDER products include hygiene-friendly dispensers for soap, hand sanitizers, and air fresheners. Commercial and industrial clients install these products in airports, health care facilities, hotels, prisons, schools, and stadiums. Founded in 1906 by William Elvis Sloan, his fourth-generation descendants lead the company.

  <p>
   The company's products deliver predetermined, metered volumes of water through supply lines into sanitary fixtures. The company's strategy to focus on its environmental innovation and stewardship is not surprising given growing consumer demand for products that conserve both water and energy. To drive that strategy home, Sloan Valve has also taken corporate responsibility into its own hands by buying renewable energy credits from renewable energy facilities to offset its manufacturing plant's electricity use, which reduces millions of pounds of carbon dioxide pollution per year.
