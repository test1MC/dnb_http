   AVEO Pharmaceuticals' models don't pout, strut, or even turn heads -- unless you're a cancer drug researcher. Operating as AVEO Oncology, the biotech firm develops cancer models to uncover how genes mutate into tumors and how tumors progress through additional mutations. AVEO then builds genetic profiles of such tumors and applies them to antibody (protein) drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development to help predict actual human responses. In addition to its own pipeline of potential drugs, AVEO has partnered with other pharmaceutical developers to apply its Human Response Platform to their drug candidates.

  <p>
   AVEO is focused on developing and commercializing its proprietary drug compounds, as well as pharmaceutical candidates developed through collaborations with other drug companies. Development of lead candidate tivozanib, which is in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of kidney cancer and other types of tumorous cancers, is being conducted through a partnership with
   <company id="56281">
    Astellas Pharma
   </company>
   . Other partners include
   <company id="13209">
    Biogen Idec
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="12923">
    Janssen Biotech
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="14327">
    OSI Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   .
  </p>

  <p>
   In addition to funds from public share offerings, AVEO depends on financing from strategic development partners and licensees to fund clinical trials on its drug candidates, which are in various stages of development. For instance, the company received $125 million when it formed its partnership with Astellas in 2011, and the firm could be eligible for up to $1.3 billion in milestone payments in future years through the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to the nature of the development-stage company's business, AVEO's revenues and profits fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount it earns through its various agreements, as well as the amount it spends on its R&amp;D activities. For instance, in 2011 the company more than doubled its revenue and net income figures -- to $165 million and $31 million, respectively -- primarily due to the Astellas agreement.

  <p>
   AVEO plans to form new partnerships, such as its collaboration agreements with Astellas and Janssen (both formed in 2011). It also intends to further license its Human Response Platform technology to other companies for their own research programs; licensees have thus far included

    Merck
   </company>
   and OSI.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 AVEO cut about 17% of its workforce as part of a restructuring program designed to reduce early stage R&amp;D spending and allow the company to focus its resources on bringing lead candidate tivozanib to commercialization stages. In early 2015 the company announced another restructuring and leadership shift. It plans to eliminate its internal research function in order to focus on advancing its pipleline, including AV-380. The restructuring reduces AVEO's headcount by about two-thirds.

  <p>
   AVEO was founded in 2002 under the name GenPath Pharmaceuticals. The company filed an IPO in late 2009 and began trading in March 2010. Proceeds from the IPO, as well as from an additional share offering in 2011, were used to fund the company's R&amp;D programs and to finance general corporate and operational expenses.
