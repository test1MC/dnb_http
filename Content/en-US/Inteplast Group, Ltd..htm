   The Inteplast Group is best known for turning plastic into gold. Working through three divisions, Inteplast manufactures a diversity of essential plastic products. Its AmTopp division produces biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film, stretch wrap, and plastic concentrates and compounds; its World-Pak unit makes fluted boards, plastic sheets and foam, and cross-laminated film; and its Integrated Bagging Systems unit, trash can liners, produce bags, and plastic packaging. Inteplast products are used in construction materials as well as boat building, health care, food and merchandise packaging, shipping, and more.

   Inteplast has three operating units. Its AmTopp division produces three major product lines: bi-axially oriented polypropylene films, stretch films, and plastic concentrates and compounds.

   The company relies heavily on automated manufacturing systems to produce its products. Minimal staff is required to maintain equipment and oversee certain processes, enabling Inteplast to keep overhead at a minimum and remain cost-competitive in the global plastics marketplace. Though Inteplast has expanded to Asia, it still maintains a firm presence in the US. It is one of the few domestic plastic companies that do not rely on imports.

  <p>
   The company's alliances and acquisitions have also helped the plastic film and bag maker to control costs as well as expand into new markets. AmTopp holds long-term relationships with giants

   In 2015 Inteplast cornered a new market when it established a new business unit, Inteplast Healthcare, to align the wide range of healthcare industry products and services offered by its Medegen Medical Products, Minigrip, Inteplast/Pitt Plastics, and Integrated Bagging Systems businesses. Inteplast acquired Medical Action Industries' patient care business earlier in 2015 and rebranded it as Medegen Medical Products.
