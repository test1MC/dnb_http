   SK Hynix (formerly Hynix Semiconductor) may not live in the past, but its business is based on memory- computing memory, that is. SK Hynix makes DRAM and NAND flash memories for computers, mobile phones, and televisions, as well as the growing number of devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs innovated by the IT industry. The company is battling to retain its spot among the world's top makers of DRAM chips; it trails

  <p>
   Chung Ju-Yung went into business after WWII repairing trucks for the US armed forces in Korea. In 1947 Chung started Hyundai Engineering and Construction, the first Korean contractor to win overseas construction projects. Chung's shrewd business gambles helped Hyundai become a major international player in construction.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1983
   <company id="41056">
    Hyundai Group
   </company>
   took another gamble -- for a company with no electronics manufacturing experience -- and founded Hyundai Electronics Industries (HEI) to make semiconductors and microcomputer components. Chung's son, Chung Mong-Hun (who also had no high-tech experience), became HEI's chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   To overcome its lack of technical expertise, HEI manufactured chips and electronics for other companies. HEI continued to expand in the early 1990s, even as Chung Mong-Hun was charged (and eventually jailed) by the South Korean government for tax evasion and diverting money to his father's opposition political party, the Unification National Party.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 HEI acquired LG Semicon, the semiconductor unit of
   <company id="41185">
    LG Group
   </company>
   ; the combined operations enabled the company to battle
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   (and later
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   ) atop the market for DRAM chips. At the same time, though, the acquisition brought with it LG Semicon's unwieldy debts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bowing to government pressure to replace family-run conglomerates with more efficient and transparent management systems, Chung Mong-Hun resigned as chairman in 2000. Park Chong-Sup, previously chairman of subsidiary Hyundai Electronics America, was appointed chairman and CEO. Later that year the company spun off its automotive electronics division (Hyundai Autonet) and its monitors unit (Hyundai ImageQuest), and announced plans to cut its ties with Hyundai Group and become an independent company. (The company completed its disaffiliation from Hyundai Group in 2001 when it and other former members of the group dissolved their cross-ownership ties.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Chung Ju-Yung died in 2001. Soon afterward, HEI changed its name to Hynix Semiconductor. Also that year, as it faced massive maturing debts, the company announced plans to lay off 30% of its workforce and began to sell off assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the course of 2001, Hynix spun off its satellite service business (Space Broadband Corporation), its customer service operations (Hyundai Digitech Service), its telecom handset unit (Hyundai CuriTel, later sold to a consortium of Korean companies for about $125 million), its DSL Internet service unit (Hyundai Networks), and its main LCD business (Hyundai Display Technology).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hynix seemed to have found its long-term salvation in 2002 when it struck a provisional agreement to sell its memory operations to US-based rival Micron. The complex deal called for Micron to pay about $3.4 billion for all of Hynix's memory operations and a small stake in its other lines. Although the agreement was reached by Hynix's executives and approved by its leading creditors, the company's board of directors nixed the deal a week after it was announced. Most of that board of directors was replaced in mid-2002, after Hynix's creditors effectively took control of the company by exercising debt-for-equity swap rights. CEO Park Chong-sup stepped down; COO Park Sang-ho (no relation) succeeded him. A few months later director Woo Eui-je was appointed co-CEO (he subsequently became chairman, as well).
  </p>
  <p>
   Hynix stayed afloat through 2001 and 2002 thanks to multibillion-dollar bailout efforts led by the Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company,
   <company id="96725">
    Korea Exchange Bank
   </company>
   , Woori Bank (formerly Hanvit Bank and now part of
   <company id="59584">
    Woori Financial Group
   </company>
   ), and other creditors. Many of these financiers -- widely seen as the bulwark that kept Hynix from financial collapse -- were partially controlled by South Korea's government. These connections led Micron and Infineon, among others, to claim that the bailout packages amounted to trade protectionism. Both the European Commission and the
   <company id="107031">
    US Department of Commerce
   </company>
   slapped stiff duties on Hynix DRAMs produced outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 2002 Hynix sold its flat-panel LCD business (called Hydis) to China-based electronics maker
   <company id="152501">
    BOE Technology Group
   </company>
   for about $380 million. (Hynix's own creditors lent BOE half of the purchase price.) The BOE deal came about a year after Hynix announced a deal to sell most of Hydis to a Taiwanese consortium; that deal, which valued Hydis at more than $800 million, fell through a few months after it was announced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Park Sang-ho resigned as president and co-CEO in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   After on-again, off-again talks that went on for a year,
   <company id="58365">
    Citigroup
   </company>
   and
   <company id="128276">
    Francisco Partners
   </company>
   led an $830 million buyout of Hynix's non-memory chip operations in 2004. (Hynix creditors agreed to lend Citigroup $325 million to help finance the purchase.) Citigroup formed a company,
   <company id="136156">
    MagnaChip Semiconductor
   </company>
   , to receive the non-memory unit, making chips used in flat-panel displays and digital still cameras.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the World Trade Organization rejected US and EU claims that Hynix was illegally subsidized by the Korean government.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Hynix found a buyer for its 47% stake in ImageQuest, an exporter of LCDs and color display tubes. An investor consortium agreed to take over the stake for $35 million. The company also disposed of its 12% stake in Hyundai Autonet, a South Korean car audio equipment manufacturer, for $76.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In yet another move to reduce the company's debt, its creditors agreed to a debt-discounting program that, combined with proceeds from the sale to Citigroup, reduced Hynix's debt by nearly $1 billion. Some 137 creditors additionally decided to sell a total 23.7% stake by the end of 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Hynix Semi pleaded guilty to fixing prices for memory chips from 1999 to 2002, and paid a fine of $185 million to the
   <company id="150279">
    US Department of Justice
   </company>
   , which had brought a criminal complaint against Hynix and other large competitors in the memory chip market. The next year four executives of Hynix pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from the Justice Department's inquiry; they received jail sentences ranging from five to eight months apiece. Also in 2005 Hynix secured a contract to supply flash memory chips to Apple Computer (now
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   ) through 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   A US District Court jury in 2006 found that Hynix had infringed on 10 patents held by
   <company id="53167">
    Rambus
   </company>
   and ordered the Korean company to pay nearly $307 million in damages to Rambus. The judge in the case, however, lowered the award to almost $134 million, which Rambus accepted. Rambus also accused Hynix of anti-competitive business practices in a separate lawsuit in the US. Also in 2006 Hynix agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit regarding the price-fixing scandal; among the settlement terms was a payment of $73 million to the plaintiffs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Creditor banks reduced their ownership in Hynix through the sale of 43 million shares to domestic and overseas investors in 2006. The number of creditors was reduced as well, to nine from 46. The $1.5 billion share sale dropped the total equity ownership of Korea Exchange Bank and other Hynix creditors to around 37%, from just over half of the company's equity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Woo Eui-je resigned as chairman and CEO in 2007, after a year which saw Hynix post a sizable profit for 2006 and finish strongly to claim second place in the global DRAM market, widely trailing DRAM leader Samsung Electronics but comfortably ahead of competitors Qimonda, Micron Technology, and Elpida Memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year Hynix signed patent cross-licensing agreements on memory device technology with both
   <company id="44448">
    SanDisk
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   . The company also established a 50/50 joint venture with SanDisk to manufacture memory components and to develop consumer products based on flash memory devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2007, Hynix broke ground on an advanced wafer fabrication plant (or fab) in Cheongju, South Korea. The facility, dubbed M11, cost more than $4 billion to build and equip. The company used the fab, Hynix's third 300mm wafer fab, to make high-density NAND flash memories on 300mm (12-inch) wafers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Hynix agreed to work together with Taiwan's
   <company id="149935">
    ProMOS Technologies
   </company>
   . The company licenses its 50nm DRAM stack process to ProMOS, and the Taiwanese company makes DRAMs for Hynix on a contract basis. Hynix acquired an equity stake of 8% in ProMOS as part of the pact.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2008 the company ceased DRAM production at its
   <company id="112104">
    Hynix Semiconductor Manufacturing America
   </company>
   wafer fabrication facility in Eugene, Oregon -- its only plant in the US. Hynix made the move because of continuing oversupply and precipitously declining prices in the global DRAM market. The company is looking at utilization of its 200mm wafer fabrication facilities, since they are less efficient than its 300mm wafer fabs. The Eugene plant is a 200mm fab. Hynix will decide later on what to do with the facility; under market conditions, it may not be economical to change the fab to 300mm wafer fabrication, or to utilize the facility for producing devices other than DRAMs, such as photovoltaic solar cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hynix closed 200mm DRAM fabs in Cheongju and Icheon, South Korea, and in Wuxi, China, in addition to the Oregon fab. Only one 200mm fab, in Cheongju, was remaining by the end of 2008, and it is focusing on specialty devices, eschewing volume production of DRAMs or other commodity parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company sold part of its stake in the Chinese fab to
   <company id="159411">
    Numonyx
   </company>
   for $100 million. Hynix reduced its ownership in the plant from about 83% to around 72%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in the year, under pressure from plummeting chip demand and prices, the company announced restructuring efforts that included dropping executive pay by up to 30%, cutting its executive ranks by 30%, and offering employees with more than 10 years on the job an early retirement package. The moves were expected to cut labor costs by 15% at a time when Hynix was asking its bank and shareholders for financial help.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hynix started losing money in the last quarter of 2007, and was in the red throughout 2008. In 2009 the company completed two rights offerings with its creditors to raise cash and to ease its debt load. Korea Exchange Bank and other creditors agreed to convert $309 million in trade financing into longer-term debt and to extend about $148 million in new loans to the chip maker, which also plans to sell new shares worth around $520 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 Hynix agreed to settle a long-running patent infringement case with
   <company id="53167">
    Rambus
   </company>
   by taking out a license for certain memory parts and paying royalties on sales of the devices. The Korean chip maker also committed to paying $397 million in damages to Rambus.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Kim Jong Kap resigned as CEO and was succeeded by SVP Kwon Oh Chul, who was selected by Hynix's creditors to run the company. Also in 2010 Hynix reached a settlement with the European Commission on a longstanding complaint regarding price fixing on memory chips from 1998 to 2002. The commission collected a total of about $408 million from memory chip suppliers in the case; Hynix's penalty was $63 million for colluding with other memory makers, helping hike the prices consumers paid for PCs and other products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year Hynix acquired the minority stake in China-based Hynix-Numonyx Semiconductor Ltd. owned by
   <company id="159411">
    Numonyx
   </company>
   (acquired by
   <company id="14116">
    Micron Technology
   </company>
   in 2010). Hynix paid about $423 million for the 19% stake owned by its partner in the joint venture. The move came as competition between and Hynix and Micron heated up.
  </p>
  <p>
   After spinning off its non-memory semiconductor business as
   <company id="136156">
    MagnaChip Semiconductor
   </company>
   , Hynix is returning to chip markets other than DRAMs and flash memories. MagnaChip originally filed for an IPO in the US in 2007; it withdrew the registration statement in 2009, citing unfavorable market conditions for IPOs. MagnaChip filed another registration statement with the
   <company id="56705">
    SEC
   </company>
   in 2010.
