  <p>
   In 2015 the company's net revenues decreased by 5% due to lower Global Energy segment sales (other segments increased during the year).
  </p>
  <p>
   Fixed currency sales for Global Energy segment were negatively impacted by volume reductions and lower pricing primarily reflecting significant reductions in well stimulation business and slightly lower sales in production business. These more than offset growth in downstream business. Continued growth in international regions was offset by soft North America results, reflecting the reduction in North America drilling and well completion activity, customer spending, and price reductions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ecolab's net income decreased by 17% due to lower net net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 cash from operating activities increased by 10% due to Venezuela charges and changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable.

  <p>
   The company grows through acquisitions.The company's global reach and expanded line of products and services will enable it to provide total water processing management to food and beverage, hospitality, and laundry customers worldwide. It continues to target key acquisitions to complement its businesses and to focus on key growth areas. In 2015 it made five acquisitions for companies with combined revenues of $305 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ecolab's strategy for growth also includes investing organically in its businesses, including equipment used by customers to dispense its cleaning and sanitizing products, as well as in process control and monitoring equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the company also aligned itself by divesting non-core businesses. In 2015 it sold an immaterial business in Europe that was part of the company's Global Energy segment and sold a portion of its Ecovation business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Ecolab opened a new manufacturing plant on Jurong Island, Singapore. The new 106,000-square-meter site will supply chemistry products for oil and gas companies in the Eastern Hemisphere and support continued growth for Nalco Champion.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company introduced a new hand sanitizer dispenser (Nexa) and launched the 3D TRASAR Solid Cooling Water Program, which monitors building cooling water systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also invests in innovation. In 2013 Ecolab opened an R&amp;D facility in Russia and a training center in Eagan, Minnesota.

  <p>
   In 2017 Ecolab acquires Laboratoires Anios from co-owners Bertrand and Thierry Letartre and private investment company Ardian for about $800 million. Anios is a European manufacturer and marketer of hygiene and disinfection products for the healthcare, food service, and food and beverage processing industries. Based in Lille, France, Anios has a presence in more than 85 countries. Anios' innovative product line expands the solutions Ecolab can offer while also providing a complementary geographic footprint.

   In 2016 the company purchased certain assets of Keedak Limited, an oilfield chemical distributor in Nigeria.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired the US operations of Swisher Hygiene, expanding its Institutional customer base and service coverage. It also acquired the assets and operations of Ultra Fab Industries, a privately held company based in Calgary, Canada, that designs and manufactures customized solutions and specialized chemical injection systems for the oil and gas industry. This $115 million acquisition broadened Nalco Champion's offerings and market opportunity. Earlier that year, it acquired Jianghai Environmental Protection Co. Ltd., ($190 million) which increased Ecolab's total water business in China by 50%, significantly strengthening long-term growth opportunities in the water-stressed country.

  <p>
   Salesman Merritt Osborn founded Economics Laboratory in 1924 as a specialty chemical maker; its first product was a rug cleaner for hotels. It added industrial and institutional cleaners and consumer detergents in the 1950s. The company went public in 1957. By 1973 it had been organized into five divisions: industrial (cleaners and specialty chemical formulas), institutional (dishwasher products, sanitation formulas), consumer (dishwasher detergent and laundry aids, coffee filters, floor cleaners), food-processing (detergents), and international (run by future CEO Fred Lanners).
  </p>
  <p>
   At the time, household dishwasher detergent was Economics Laboratory's top seller, second to Procter &amp; Gamble in the US and #1 overseas. The company began offering services and products as packages in the early 1970s, including on-premise laundry services for hotels and hospitals and sanitation and cleaning services for the food industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   E. B. Osborn, son of the founder, retired in 1978, and Lanners became the company's first CEO outside the Osborn family. Sales of dishwashing detergent had fallen, while the institutional cleaning business had become its primary segment, quadrupling in sales between 1970 and 1980. International sales were growing rapidly. In 1979 the company bought Apollo Technologies (chemicals and pollution-control equipment) to improve its share of the industrial market.
  </p>
  <p>
   A depressed industrial sector caused Apollo's sales to drop in early 1980. The man expected to save Apollo, Richard Ashley, succeeded Lanners in 1982 but died in a car crash that year. Sandy Grieve became CEO in 1983 and shut down Apollo. Meanwhile, debt was up, the institutional market had shrunk, and the company was slipping in the dishwashing-detergent market. Grieve sold the firm's coffee-filters unit and several plants, laid off employees, and began new packaging processes. The company changed its name to Ecolab in 1986, and in 1987 it sold its dishwashing-detergent unit and bought lawn-service provider ChemLawn. (ChemLawn was sold in 1992.)
  </p>
  <p>
   As 1990 neared, Grieve introduced what's now known as "Circle the Customer -- Circle the Globe," the aim being to become a worldwide leader in core businesses and broaden product offerings. The company concentrated on building its presence in Africa, the Asia/Pacific region, Latin America, and the Middle East. In 1991 Ecolab also began a highly successful joint venture, Henkel-Ecolab, with German consumer-products company Henkel to better exploit European markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ecolab acquired Kay Chemical (cleaning and sanitation products for the fast-food industry, 1994), Monarch (cleaning and sanitation products for food processing, 1996), Huntington Laboratories (janitorial products, 1996), and Australia-based Gibson (cleaning and sanitation products, 1997). In 1995 Grieve stepped down, and president Allan Schuman became CEO. Adding a few more degrees to its circle of services, in 1998 Ecolab bought GCS Service (commercial kitchen equipment repair).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company further secured footholds in Asia and South America in 2000 by acquiring industrial and institutional cleaning firms Dong Woo Deterpan (South Korea), Spartan de Chile, and Spartan de Argentina. At home, it bought kitchen-equipment companies ARR/CRS and Southwest Sanitary Distributing. Late in 2000 Ecolab sold its Johnson dish machines unit to Endonis and announced a restructuring that was soon followed by the departure of several top executives, including president and COO Bruno Deschamps.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Ecolab purchased the 50% of Henkel-Ecolab that it didn't own from
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   for about $435 million; the move greatly expanded the company's international business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schuman stepped down as CEO in 2004 (retaining the chairman's role); president Doug Baker took over and became a director in addition to his role as president and CEO. Two years later Schuman retired as chairman, ending his 49-year tenure with Ecolab. The company named Baker to replace him.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Ecolab made an acquisition to expand its operations in the health care field, buying
   <company id="42279">
    Microtek Medical Holdings
   </company>
   , which makes infection control products for health care facilities, for about $275 million. The next year it paid $210 million for
   <company id="124390">
    Ecovation
   </company>
   , a company that treats wastewater, solid waste, and air pollution primarily for food and beverage companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Ecolab completed its acquisition of O.R. Solutions, a privately held Virginia company that makes warming and cooling systems for surgical fluids, for $260 million. The business became part of the US Cleaning and Sanitizing segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began a major financial restructuring of its European operations in 2011, expecting to save about $120 million over a three-year period. The plan includes changes to the division's supply chain, administrative operations, and other functions, as well as a 12% reduction in workforce. As a part of the restructuring, it rolled out its Ecolab Business System platform, a common set of business processes and systems, for its European operations. The EBS platform is designed to streamline the organization, improve efficiency and competitiveness, and more rapidly improve the region's profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Ecolab acquired
   <company id="11045">
    Nalco
   </company>
   in a $5.4 billion cash and stock deal. Following this purchase, Ecolab continued restructuring and cutting costs in 2012, including cutting back on its global workforce and streamlining its supply chain. With the merging of both companies' operations, Ecolab emerged as a global leader in water, hygiene, and energy technologies and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Ecolab bought Houston-based
   <company id="104863">
    Champion Technologies
   </company>
   for $2.3 billion. The acquisition of Champion Technologies and its related company Corsicana Technologies (collectively referred to as Champion Technologies) helps Ecolab to boost its technology and product strengths in North America and is very complementary to its innovative technology and services in the offshore and international energy markets. The deal is expected to yield $150 million in cost synergies by the end of 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other 2013 acquisitions included Quimiproductos (Mexico; cleaning, sanitizing, and water treatment products and services); Master Chemicals (Russia; oil field chemicals); and AkzoNobel's Purate business (Netherlands; water treatment services).
