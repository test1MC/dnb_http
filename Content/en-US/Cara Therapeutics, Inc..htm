The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focuses on developing and commercializing new chemical products designed to alleviate pain by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. Its proprietary class of product candidates target the body's peripheral nervous system. In test with patients with moderate-to-severe pain they have have demonstrated efficacy without inducing many of the undesirable side effects often associated with pain therapeutics. Cara's most advanced product candidate, is intravenous CR845. The company filed to go public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company hopes to make a breakthrough in the $18.2 billion pharmaceuticals-based pain management market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Opioid analgesics accounted for 71% of the 341 million analgesic prescriptions ($8.3 billion) written in 2012. Cara's new CR845 product is designed to produce pain relief by specifically stimulating kappa, rather than mu, opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, with the promise of avoiding the side effects (including nausea and vomiting, itching and respiratory depression) associated with activation of mu opioid receptors in the central nervous system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intravenous CR845 has demonstrated significant pain relief and a good safety and tolerability profile in three Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain. Cara plans to begin Phase 3 registration trials for CR845 in the second half of 2014. It also plans to develop an oral version of CR845.
