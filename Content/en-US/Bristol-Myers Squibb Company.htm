   Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) makes drugs for the brain, heart, and other body parts. The biopharmaceutical's blockbuster lineup includes rhemuatoid arthritis treatment Orencia and ELIQUIS for stroke prevention. BMS also makes antipsychotic medication Abilify and HIV treatments Reyataz and Sustiva. Most of its sales come from products in the therapeutic areas of cardiovascular care, hepatitis, immunology, metabolics, neuroscience, oncology, and virology. BMS has global research facilities and manufacturing plants, mainly in the US and Europe, and its products are marketed to health care practitioners, hospitals, and managed care providers in 100 countries.

  <p>
   Following the patent expirations of key products Plavix (a blood thinner) and Avapro (a hypertension medication), BMS is pinning its hopes on rising sales of newer medicines in fields including neurology, metabolism, and oncology. Products showing promising growth include its hepatitis C franchise, ELIQUIS, and Opdivo. Abilify sales represented 13% of BMS' revenues in 2014, but those sales dropped 63% in 2015 when the company lost its exclusive rights to the drug in the US and in most international markets. Sales of biologic medicines (made using live proteins such as antibodies) -- including rheumatoid arthritis medicine Orencia -- are also on the rise. In 2015, Orencia, ELIQUIS, Sprycel, and the hepatitis C franchise each represented about 10% of total revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   BMS is determined to keep pumping out new medicines from its pipeline: The company is investigating Prostvac as an anti-cancer treatment.

  <p>
   While the company serves a global customer base, the US market accounts for about half of its annual revenues. BMS' major research and development facilities are in New Jersey and Connecticut, with other sites in the US, the UK, Belgium, India, Japan, and other countries. It has about a dozen manufacturing facilities, which are located in the US and Puerto Rico, France, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, and China.

In addition to wholesalers, the company also sells some products directly to customers including hospitals, clinics, physicians and nurse practitioners, government agencies, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed-care organizations (MCOs). BMS employs a direct sales force in certain markets; it also uses independent marketing representatives. Some products are sold through partnerships with other drugmakers, including

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The biggest financial story for BMS has been the loss of patent protection on a number of its bestselling drugs, including Plavix, Avapro, and Abilify. Due to these recent losses, revenue took a hit in 2012, 2013, and 2014. However, growth of other products including Opdivo, ELIQUIS, and the hepatitis C franchise helped boost revenues in 2015. That year, revenue recovered a modest 4% to $16.6 billion; US sales rose 6% on the launches of Opdivo and Daklinza, as well as growing demand for Sprycel, while international sales rose 20% on the launch of a Daklinza/Sunvepra dual regime in Japan. Rising demand for ELIQUIS around the world also helped earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, net income continued its downward trajectory that year, falling 22% to $1.6 billion. Increased expenses related to research and development, the acquisitions of investigational compounds, and the establishment of new alliances contributed to the drop in profits. Cash flow from operations has also been slipping; in 2015 it fell 42% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to the decrease in net income as well as an increase in cash used towards accounts payable.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To remake itself into a biopharmaceutical powerhouse, the company has engaged in its string-of-pearls pharmaceutical strategy, which aims to add harder-to-copy biotech drugs and drug candidates to its pipeline. The company's R&amp;D efforts are focused on areas of significant unmet medical need, including psychiatric, neurological, cardiovascular, metabolism, oncology, bacterial and viral infections, and inflammatory or immune system disorders. Collaborations are an important part of BMS' development and marketing strategy. BMS also works to expand its offerings and fight off patent expiration losses by finding new uses of already approved drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the oncology arena, BMS has been investing in the development of Opdivo, which was approved for metastatic melanoma in the US in late 2014 and has since been approved in more than 40 countries. The company is collaborating with others to expand Opdivo's usage, and it is continuing to invest in its pipeline of additional cancer treatments. In 2014, BMS entered into an agreement with F-Star Alpha that provides the company with an exclusive option to buy F-Star and its FS102 candidate for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer. And in 2015 the company acquired biotechnology firm Flexus, which is focused on the discovery and development of novel anti-cancer treatments.
  </p>
  <p>
   In virology, the company is building on the success of its hepatitis C franchise, which brought in some $1.6 billion in revenue in 2015. That franchise has done well since the 2014 introductions of Daklinza and Sunvepra. In terms of cardiovascular treatments, an area in which the company has historically been a strong performer, ELIQUIS brought the company some $1.9 million in 2015. That year, BMS bought heart drug specialist Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals for $300 million and up to $1.8 billion in milestone payments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Approvals for new products are important for any biopharmaceutical to replace older medications facing generic competition. BMS received US
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approval of its Evotaz HIV tablet and its Opdivo injection treatment in 2015. Opdivo was also approved in Europe that year. Yervoy, a treatment for cutaneous melanoma, was approved in the US and Japan in 2015; US approvals for multiple myeloma treatment Empliciti and new indications for the hepatitis C franchise also passed.
  </p>
  <p>
   BMS divested its diabetic business in early 2014. The following year, it divested its Ixempra business. The company then sold its pipeline of investigational HIV medications to ViiV Healthcare in 2016.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions are a major piece of BMS' growth goals. In 2014 the company acquired iPierian, a biotechnology firm focused on finding new treatments for the tauopathies category of neurodegenerative disease. That deal provided BMS with full rights to IPN007, a preclinical monoclonal antibody.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired biotechnology firm Flexus, which focuses on discovering novel anti-cancer treatments. Also that year, BMS acquired heart drug specialist Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2016 BMS bought Swedish firm Cormorant Pharmaceuticals, gaining access to its HuMax-IL8 antibody program and boosting its immuno-oncology pipeline.

  <p>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb is the product of a merger of rivals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Squibb was founded by Dr. Edward Squibb in New York City in 1858. He developed techniques for making pure ether and chloroform; he turned the business over to his sons in 1891.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of $414,000 in 1904 grew to $13 million by 1928. The company supplied penicillin and morphine during WWII. In 1952 it was bought by Mathieson Chemical, which in turn was bought by Olin Industries in 1953, forming Olin Mathieson Chemical. Squibb maintained its separate identity.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 1968 to 1971 Olin Mathieson went through repeated reorganizations and adopted the Squibb name. Capoten and Corgard, two major cardiovascular drugs, were introduced in the late 1970s. Capoten was the first drug engineered to attack a specific disease-causing mechanism. Squibb formed a joint venture with Denmark's Novo (now Novo Nordisk) in 1982 to sell insulin.
  </p>
  <p>
   William Bristol and John Myers founded Clinton Pharmaceutical in Clinton, New York, in 1887 (renamed Bristol-Myers in 1900) to sell bulk pharmaceuticals. The firm made antibiotics after the 1943 purchase of Cheplin Biological Labs. It began expanding overseas in the 1950s and eventually bought Clairol (1959); Mead Johnson (drugs, infant and nutritional formula; 1967); and Zimmer (orthopedic implants, 1972). Bristol-Myers launched new drugs to treat cancer (Platinol, 1978) and anxiety (BuSpar, 1986). That year it acquired biotech companies Oncogen and Genetic Systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm bought Squibb in 1989. In 1990 the new company bought arthroscopy products and implant business lines and joined Eastman Kodak and Elf Aquitaine to develop new heart drugs in 1993. Despite these initiatives, earnings slipped. In 1994 company veteran Charles Heimbold became CEO and moved to increase profits. BMS in 1995 bought wound and skin care products firm Calgon Vestal Laboratories. Also that year the company, along with fellow silicone breast implant makers 3M and Baxter International, agreed to settle thousands of personal injury claims at an average of $26,000 per claim.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing an antitrust suit filed by independent drugstores, BMS and other major drugmakers agreed in 1996 to charge pharmacies the same prices as managed care groups for medications. That year the company formed a generic drug unit and launched Pravachol.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next two years BMS tweaked its product line, buying drug, cosmetics, and consumer products companies and brands. Having refined its product line, the firm began a series of officer reassignments that were widely interpreted as an effort to find a successor for Heimbold, who retired in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the firm pulled its backing for EntreMed after the biotech had problems duplicating results for a cancer drug candidate. BMS helped market promising diabetes drug Avandia (from GlaxoSmithKline, which ended the deal in 2002) and teamed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals to study the genetic makeup of tumors.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the company entered the 21st century, it began streamlining. It sold its Sea Breeze skin care brand (1999); Matrix Essentials hair care products unit (2000); and Clairol hair and personal care products business (2001). BMS also spun off its Zimmer orthopedic implant unit in 2001. More changes came in 2004: The firm sold its Mead Johnson Adult Nutritional business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 BMS was dealt a blow when a judge ruled that the company had illegally blocked
   <company id="11030">
    Mylan Labs
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12311">
    Watson Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   from selling generic versions of BuSpar.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm bought a 20% stake in
   <company id="15468">
    ImClone
   </company>
   to collaborate on the development of cancer drug Erbitux and to stay on top of the cancer drug market. Instead, BMS found itself embroiled in the controversy over insider information and stock deals surrounding the biotech. Persistence paid off, however; Erbitux was approved by the FDA in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2005, the company cleaned out parts of its medicine cabinet. Analgesics Excedrin and Bufferin had made the company a household name, but in 2005 the company sold its US and Canadian consumer products operations to
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   . The deal also meant saying goodbye to such brands as Comtrex (cold medications), Choice (blood sugar monitoring supplies), and Keri (lotions, skin care). Sales for the its US and Canadian consumer products operations reached about $270 million in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, BMS sold Oncology Therapeutics Network, which distributes cancer drugs to oncology doctors, to private equity firm One Equity Partners. The unit had accounted for about 13% of sales in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of an agreement with the New Jersey US Attorney's office in 2005 to settle an investigation into inventory control and accounting practices, the company split the role of chairman and CEO into two separate offices. Long-time BMS director James Robinson III was elected the company's new chairman, with Peter Dolan in the CEO role. James Cornelius took over as CEO in 2006 and became chairman in 2008, bring the two roles back together.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the patent expiration on blockbuster Plavix was still five years off, in mid-2006 Canadian generics maker
   <company id="140196">
    Apotex
   </company>
   managed to flood the market with a generic version of Plavix for several weeks. The release of the drug followed bungled attempts by BMS to negotiate a deal with Apotex that would have kept it off the market. The debacle led to federal investigations into whether that deal violated anti-trust laws (among other things) and also resulted in the ouster of CEO Peter Dolan (replaced by James Cornelius). Though a judge put a halt to the manufacturing of the generic until the courts could straighten the whole thing out, the short-term generic competition hurt Plavix sales to the tune of more than $1 billion. BMS ultimately wound up paying more than $150 million to settle lawsuits and agreed that it would report any future deals struck with generics makers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company announced a reorganizational plan in 2007 named the string-of-pearls strategy. As part of its efforts to remake itself into a purely biopharmaceutical player, BMS began jettisoning its non-pharmaceutical businesses. During 2008 the company sold its Medical Imaging unit to private equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $525 million, and Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital paid $4.1 billion to acquire BMS'
   <company id="104397">
    ConvaTec
   </company>
   ostomy and wound-care subsidiary. Then in 2009 the company divested its
   <company id="104556">
    Mead Johnson
   </company>
   subsidiary, which sold Enfamil infant formula and other nutritional products for children.
