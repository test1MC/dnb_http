   Galectin Therapeutics has a knack for inhibiting galectin proteins. The drug developer is targeting galectin proteins as they play a key role in the development of a variety of diseases. It is developing such inhibitors to treat liver fibrosis, which is currently untreatable. Its GM-CT-01 drug candidate is being investigated for use targeting certain melanomas and in combination with another drug to improve its effectiveness in treating colorectal cancer. Galectin Therapeutics is focused on diseases with serious, life-threatening consequences and on diseases for which there is little to no current treatment available.

   As a development-stage company, Galectin Therapeutics has not generated revenue yet. It has also operated at a loss since its inception, and expects to continue doing so for the foreseeable future as works to get its products on the market. Net loss rose to $15.7 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in R&amp;D expenses. As of the end of 2014, the firm's accumulated deficit totaled $119 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also rose in 2014, increasing 66% to $12.4 million.

   Galectin Therapeutics intends to establish clinical development programs and, when those programs advance, seek partnerships for additional support. It often works with outside experts (for example, specialists in carbohydrate chemistry and characterization) to help target its research activities. In 2015 the firm engaged contract research organization

    Pharmaceutical Product Development
   </company>
   to conduct trials for GR-MD-02 for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company and SBH Sciences formed the jointly owned Galectin Sciences unit to research and develop small organic molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 for oral administration.
