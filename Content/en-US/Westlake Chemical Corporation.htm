   Money matters, and vertically integrated Westlake Chemical turns matter into money. The company produces petrochemicals and plastics such as PVC. Its petrochemicals include ethylene, ethyl benzene, and styrene, which are building blocks in plastics. Its plastics offerings include PVC and polyethylene, both of which are common in packaging products and grocery bags. Westlake also produces the chlorine used in PVC, as well as caustic soda. Other Westlake operations make PVC products such as pipe (North American Pipe), fencing (Westech Fence), and windows. In 2016 Westlake acquired rival

   </company>
   in a $3.8 billion deal. The Chao Group owns 69% of Westlake.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Westlake has 21 manufacturing sites in North America, as well as a 95% interest in a joint venture in China that operates a vinyls facility, and an office in Singapore. In 2015 the US accounted for 70% of total revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in two business segments: Olefins and Vinyls. The Olefins segment makes and markets polyethylene, styrene monomer and various ethylene co-products used in the company's polyethylene, styrene and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) operations. Westlake's Vinyls segment produces PVC, VCM, chlorine, caustic soda, and ethylene. The company's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. Westlake's PVC products and fabricated into pipe, window and door profiles, and fencing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has 13.6 billion pounds per year of value-added chemicals and PVC building product capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olefins accounted for 51% of total net sales in 2015. Vinyls accounted for the rest.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Westlake's products are sold directly to polyethylene customers (some of the largest producers of film and flexible packaging in the US). It also sells ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers.The majority of olefins sales are made under long-term agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company have the capacity to use all of their chlorine internally to produce VCM and EDC, most of which, in turn, is used to produce PVC. It sells substantially all of its caustic soda production to external customers. The majority of its North American-produced PVC is used internally in the production of building products. The remainder of its PVC, including the PVC produced at their European facilities, is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   End uses are automotive sealants, cable sheathing, medical applications and other consumer applications, construction materials including pipe, siding, profiles for windows and doors, film and sheet for packaging and other consumer applications water and sewer, plumbing, irrigation, conduit; fittings; profiles and foundation building products; window and door components; fence and deck components.

  <p>
   In 2015 Westlake's net sales increased by 1% due to higher Vinyls segment sales partially offset by decreased sales from Olefins segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Vinyls segment sales increase was attributable to sales contributed by recent acquisitions (Vinnolit and, to a lesser extent, Huasu) and higher sales volumes for caustic soda and PVC resin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Olefins segment sales decreased mainly due to lower sales prices for its major products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Westlake's net income decreased by $32.5 million due to increased selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased mainly attributable to general and administrative costs incurred by Vinnolit and, to a lesser extent, Huasu; an increase in payroll and related labor costs, including incentive compensation; and an increase in consulting and professional fees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 5% due to a change in accounts payable and Inventories.

  <p>
   Westlake came into being in 1986 when T.T. Chao bought a polyethylene plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, from
   <company id="11110">
    Occidental Petroleum
   </company>
   . Over the years, the company has acquired or constructed about 20 more. The founding Chao family took Westlake Chemical public in 2004 with the hope of paying down some of the debt accumulated from those acquisitions
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, a joint venture between Westlake and Chinese chemical company INEOS began producing some 33 million pounds of PVC film each year. Westlake owns 59% of the Suzhou Huasu Plastics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Westlake made several changes to its PVC production in 2009. Early in the year, the company acquired a PVC pipe plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, and opened its new PVC plant in Yucca, Arizona to expand its operations.  However, to reduce costs, Westlake closed its facilities in Bristol, Indiana, later that year and moved that production to its other PVC operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010, Westlake purchased a 50% stake in Cypress Interstate Pipeline LLC from Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. The 104-mile pipeline supplies natural gas liquid feedstocks to Westlake's Lake Charles, Louisiana, petrochemical complex. The pipeline will continue to be operated by Kinder Morgan under a contract.
  </p>
  <p>
   Westlake also made a move in 2012 to strengthen its presence in Asia by opening a Singapore office. Its operations there will focus on serving its existing customers and seeking new opportunities for growth in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2012 the company made an all cash offer for Atlanta-based Georgia Gulf, one of North America's largest manufacturers of vinyl construction products. However, Georgia Gulf rejected the $1.03 billion takeover bid as being financially inadequate and adopted a stockholder rights plan, also called a poison pill, that allows existing shareholders to buy stock at a discount when a suitor acquires more than 10% of outstanding shares. Westlake wanted to combine its resin and pipe production with Georgia Gulf's chemicals and vinyl products, but later that year withdrew its proposal to buy the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has expanded capacity to meet growing demand. In 2013 it opened a new chlor-alkali plant in Greismar, Louisiana that doubles Westlake's chlor-alkali production capacity. It also beefed up the ethylene capacity at its Lake Charles facility in 2013 (increasing the ethane-based ethylene capacity of the unit and its conversion to 100% ethane feedstock capability). It is also upgrading ethylene production facilities at Calvert City, Kentucky.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Westlake bought
   <company id="43943">
    CertainTeed
   </company>
   's Pipe and Foundation Group, a leading producer of PVC pipe and fittings for municipal, water well, mining, agriculture and irrigation applications, for $175 million. It also acquired technologies and intellectual property for the production of a number of specialized products, including Certa-Lok restrained joint pipe and Yelomine branded products.
