   Drugs are a life-or-death business for Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. The company specializes in developing treatments for life-threatening ailments, such as cancer and kidney disease. Its lead candidates are Zerenex, a compound that may reduce high phosphate levels in patients with end-stage renal disease. The drug has been approved for sale in Japan under the name Riona to treat elevated phosphate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease. Marketing rights there have been granted to partner

    Japan Tobacco

   .  Keryx is also testing Zerenx as a treatment for elevated phosphorous levels and iron deficiency in patients with kidney disease.

  <p>
   The company has not collected any revenue since it doesn't have an approved product. At the end of 2012, the company reported a total accumulated deficit of $393 million.

  <p>
   Keryx's success depends on its ability to continue shepherding Zerenex through the regulatory process in the US and, with partners or alone, get it approved in other markets. It may also in-license or acquire additional candidates.
