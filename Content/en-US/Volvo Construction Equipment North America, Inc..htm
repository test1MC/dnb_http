   Drivers looking for the iconic boxy station wagon beware; these Volvos don't haul families. Volvo Construction Equipment North America (Volvo CE) markets a broad lineup of construction equipment, including backhoes, compact excavators, wheel loaders, and motor graders. The company pushes products through a global dealer network and through Volvo Rents, a chain of franchised rental businesses offering small to midsized construction equipment and tools. Dealers and rentals cater to construction, commercial, industrial, and homeowner use. Volvo CE operates out of North Carolina, where it has set up a technical training and product demonstration center, and Ontario. The company is a subsidiary of

   In 2014, the company opened a new North American Customer Center at Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. The center (part of the $100 million investment in Volvo's Shippensburg facilities) consolidates Volvo CE's operations in one site (including moving the Americas Sales Headquarters from North Carolina to Pennsylvania and localizing machine production in Shippensburg).

   Betting on an upswing in the construction equipment market, Volvo CE debuted a new heavy equipment production manufacturing facility in late 2010. The Shippensburg, Pennsylvania factory produces asphalt pavers, milling machines, motor graders, and soil and asphalt compactors. The company has also created a presence in current make-do and mend equipment environment, Volvo CE has introduced a refurbishment program. Offered through certified dealers in key North American markets, the program caters to the economical preference of owners for a mid-life equipment makeover. Rather than buying new, owners opt for a machine analysis; worn parts are then rebuilt or replaced. An emission reduction retrofit system is also being made available for construction equipment, allowing cleaner operation. This service traces its roots to a partnership between Volvo CE and Huss LLC, a specialist in manufacturing diesel particulate filtration after-treatment.
