   Hino Motors introduced Japan's first truck in 1918, long before Godzilla was throwing vehicles all over Tokyo. These days the company not only manufactures medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks, but it also makes buses, special-purpose vehicles, and industrial diesel engines. Hino Motors dominates Japan's domestic truck market, beating out such competitors as

    Mitsubishi Motors
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41753">
    Isuzu Motors
   </company>
   , and manufactures 150,000 Hino-brand trucks and buses each year. Toyota Motor owns more than 50% of the company.

  <p>
   In Japan, Hino Motors produces vehicles, engines, and components at four plants. Its manufacturing operations in other nations include plants for producing trucks, buses, and components in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Pakistan, Colombia, and the US. It generates nearly 65% of its total sales from Japan and 27% from other countries in Asia.

  <p>
   The company's revenue increased by 17% in 2013, primarily due to additional sales derived from Japan, Asia, and as well from other countries. The demand in the truck (heavy, light and medium-duty) and bus market in Japan was healthy, due to reconstruction demand and an eco-car tax reduction/subsidy measure, which increased the overall sales in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for overseas markets, Hino Motors experienced favorable sales in the Asian countries of Indonesia and Thailand. The company was also aided by the 2012 launch of the small model Hino 300 Series, which increased the sales volume of trucks and buses outside Japan in 2013.

  <p>
   The company has a strong brand in Southeast Asia, and it has strengthened its presence in the region by dividing the sales and production functions at its Thailand and Indonesian operations into separate companies. Meanwhile, it has grown its presence in Africa, which it expects will become an important Hino market, along with Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Latin America.

  <p>
   Hino Motors was founded in 1910 as a unit of the Tokyo Gas Industry Company. It was established to build trucks for the emerging Japanese industrial economy. By 1918 the company was mass-producing the A-Type truck. The pace of industrialization increased in Japan in the early 1930s. To survive, automotive companies had to maximize economies of scale. Finding safety in numbers, many merged their operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1937 Tokyo Gas combined its auto unit with Automobile Industry Company and Kyodo Kokusan. The new enterprise was called Tokyo Automobile Industry Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Japan's occupation of China during the late 1930s had opened new markets, but it also brought a trade embargo from the US in 1941. Japan did not back down, however. Instead the Japanese government continued a program of military buildup that greatly benefited companies such as Tokyo Automobile. Later in 1941 the company changed its name to Diesel Motor Industry Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1942 Japan was at war with the US and Britain, and Diesel Motor was split into two companies. The larger company retained the Diesel Motor name (eventually it became Isuzu Motors), and the smaller one became Hino Heavy Industry Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of Hino's Tokyo facilities escaped damage during the war until an American bomb hit a Hino factory in 1945. After the war the factory was converted into a barracks for occupying forces. A year after the end of the war, Hino introduced a new truck, the massive T10-20, that found immediate popularity. In 1947 the company launched a bus based on the T10-20 frame -- the 96-passenger T11-B-25. Hino was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   Demand for trucks by United Nations forces during the Korean War prompted Hino to open an additional production line. Taking notice of Japan's demand for foreign passenger cars, Hino began to look for a manufacturing partner, and eventually decided on Renault. Hino began producing Renault 4CV cars in Japan in 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   Struck by the fact that much of Japan was being rebuilt with pricey, foreign dump trucks, Hino resolved to build a similar truck to compete with imports. Hino introduced the 13.5 ton ZG, and it soon became Japan's leading dump truck. In 1959 the company changed its name to Hino Motors, Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hino introduced its own car, the Contessa 900, in 1961. However, the company was not yet ready to ride solo. In 1966 Hino linked its carmaking operations with those of Toyota and began making Toyotas on a large scale.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1970s Hino was ready to embark on an aggressive export campaign. It set up a sales network in Southeast Asia and opened parts depots in Latin America and Europe. Hino's products were a hit overseas, and in 1980 the company opened a new factory to meet demand. During the 1980s Hino established offices in Pakistan and an assembly plant in Taiwan. Hino entered the US market in 1984 with the introduction of a cab-over engine (COE) medium duty truck.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the US and Japanese economies in recession, the early 1990s were tough for Hino, although the company managed to continue to expand into new markets. It entered a joint venture to produce buses in China (1993) and teamed with the Vietnamese government to make trucks and buses in Vietnam (1996). Toyota turned its manufacturing of two-ton-sized trucks over to Hino and increased its stake in the company from 11% to 16% in 1997 and to 20% the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Hino made plans to combine its bus-making operations with those of Isuzu by 2002 in hopes of capturing 50% of the Japanese market (these plans were later postponed due to the worldwide drop in truck demand). Toyota increased its stake to 34% in 2000. Toyota Motor further increased its stake in Hino to more than 50% in 2001.
