   Best known for its work in weapons manufacture, Thales makes electrical systems defence, aerospace and transportation. The Defence &amp; Security segment, Thales' largest, works primarily with governments and provides security products and systems across all defensible spheres: land, air, water, space and digital. The Aerospace segments makes systems and products for the commercial aviation industry, including things in-flight entertainment, as well as flight simulators for planes and helicopters. Transport, which predominantly supports non-government markets, designs and develops rail signaling and ticketing systems. The French government owns about 26% of Thales, while UK-based
   <company id="90718">
    Dassault
   </company>
   holds about 25%.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Defence &amp; Security, which pulls in around half of revenue, is divided into three business units: Secure Communications and Information Systems, Land and Air Systems, and Defence Mission Systems. Between the three, Thales can equip militaries with communications and radar systems for use in the field, a range of missile and weapons systems for short- and medium-range land-based engagements including the RAPID line, and combat systems for air and naval warfare. Thales also owns 50% of Thales Raytheon Systems, which makes air defence radars and is the main contractor for NATO's Command and Control System.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thales is active in the US defense market via relationships with US companies on everything from missiles to radars to sonar. It makes components for Raytheon's missiles, and the company's combat management system is at the core of Northrop Grumman's Integrated Combat Management system (which is a fixture on General Dynamics' Littoral Combat Ship).
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace is divided into Avionics, which manufactures in-flight entertainment and connectivity equipment, and Space, a joint venture with Italy's Finmeccanica and which primarily serves the telecommunications market, for instance geostationary satellites.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Thales organizes its divisions across three geographical areas: France holds its own division, while the rest of the world is included in the other two divisions. The UK is Thales' second-biggest customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company manufactures its products in one of 13 sites located throughout Europe in France, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK, as well as in Australia. The company extends its global presence through acquisitions, joint ventures, and partnerships.

  </p>
  <p>
   An increase in geopolitical unrest, particularly in the Middle East, is driving an increase in government spending. Consequently, Thales saw sales grow 8.4% in 2015 to €14.1 billion, representing a return to organic growth in mature markets and 16% growth in emerging markets. Indeed, sales in emerging markets as a whole now exceed France, Thales' #1 individual market at 24% of total revenue. In terms of order growth (as a distinct metric to sales) the Middle East region saw growth of 93%, while order intake from the UK increased 68%. In 2015 the company added 24 contracts worth more than €100 million, as well as five €+500 million contracts, which include signaling on the London Underground and 1,000 Hawkei light protected vehicles for the Australian military.
  </p>
  <p>
   The London Underground contract helped the Transport segment return to growth follow a couple of difficult years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth in net income to €800 million tracked organic growth, and an increase in cash from operating activities to €1.7 billion reflected an increase in sales volume.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   As with most companies that operate in the aerospace and defence sectors, fortunes are dependent on government spending. To mitigate against fluctuations in military spending, Thales makes efforts to keep its defence and civil operations evenly weighted. To this end it signed contracts with US airline JetBlue to equip its A320 fleet with latest-generation in-seat screens, and with the European Space Agency for Sentinel 1C/1D observation and exploration satellites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Satellites and security (both digital and transport) also play into this state/private dynamic. For example, Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67% stake) and Italian aerospace group
   <company id="92969">
    Leonardo-Finmeccanica
   </company>
   (33%), seeks to snare a growing share of the global market for large commercial-communications satellites that are launched by commercial rockets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, in the civil space the ongoing rapid expansion of cities across the globe is driving the need for expanded and more efficient underground train lines for which Thales is well positioned. In 2015, the company signed contracts in the London, New York, Sydney and Doha, as well as four Chinese cities (Qingdao, Nanchang, Wuhan and Shijiazhuang).
  </p>
  <p>
   Thales' involvement in the Middle East market is growing - as well as the fastest sales growth, the region also saw the fastest increase in employee numbers. Thales' AVANT entertainment system was equipped in Qatar Air planes, and Thales was also contracted to supply signaling and ticketing systems for a new metro in Doha.

   Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston (CFTH) began as a subsidiary for US-based tramway-equipment maker Thomson-Houston Electric Corporation in 1893. French investors bought the subsidiary when Thomson-Houston and Edison General Electric merged to become
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   (GE). The fledgling company kept its founder's name and maintained a licensing agreement with GE. Early interests included power stations and the electrification of tramways. Diversification in the 1920s included the acquisition of Société des Usines du Pied-Selle (kitchen and heating equipment, 1920) and the formation of a finance company, Financiere Électricité (1925).
  </p>
  <p>
   Alsthom was created in 1928 when Thomson and Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques joined to make industrial electrical equipment. Radio and TV receivers were added in 1929 when Thomson acquired Établissements Ducretet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 1930s brought the acquisition of Établissement Kraemer (radio equipment, 1936). During WWII, however, operations not used by the German military sat idle.
  </p>
  <p>
   Postwar political conflict between France and the US, plus Thomson's involvement in defense and nuclear technology, caused it to end association with GE in 1953. A 1959 agreement with Pathé-Marconi began radio and TV production.
  </p>
  <p>
   A 1966 merger with Hotchkiss-Brandt resulted in a new name, Thomson-Brandt. In 1968 another merger and another name change,
   <company id="43964">
    Thomson-CSF
   </company>
   , occurred when Compagnie Générale de TSF joined Thomson. In 1981 the French nationalized Thomson-Brandt, and in 1982 created holding company Thomson S.A. to manage it. Opposition to the government's nationalization in 1987 forced Thomson's return to the private sector, and the company formed semiconductor unit SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. In 1989 the company acquired defense electronics businesses MBLE (Belgium) and Signaal (Denmark) from
   <company id="41823">
    Philips
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Arms sales declined in 1991 and the company began to produce consumer goods such as satellite TV dishes. A 1992 agreement introduced
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   technology to Thomson defense and space products. UK-based GEC and Thomson began making sonar and antisubmarine systems after a 1995 agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomson sold its interests in Crédit Lyonnais Securities to the French government in 1996. The company sold its semiconductor unit in 1997. Thomson strengthened its defense business by taking a majority interest in Siemens Forvarssystemer (military communications, Norway) in 1998 and striking a $500 million deal with
   <company id="11261">
    Raytheon
   </company>
   to make control systems for NATO in 1999. That year Thomson also purchased a 42% stake in Singapore-based optronics company
   <company id="56782">
    Avimo Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Late in 1999 Shorts Missile Systems Ltd. (SMS) -- Thomson's joint venture with Canada-based
   <company id="42381">
    Bombardier
   </company>
   -- won a long-term $319 million contract to make short-range Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles for the UK. In 2000 Thomson-CSF acquired UK-based
   <company id="90335">
    Racal Electronics
   </company>
   , a defense electronics firm, for $2.17 billion and bought out Bombardier's share in the SMS venture. Also in 2000 the company announced plans to sell Crouzet-Automatismes (its electro-mechanical components division) to
   <company id="42920">
    Schneider Electric
   </company>
   . In December Thomson-CSF changed its name to Thales and agreed to form a joint air-defense venture (Thales-Raytheon Systems) with Raytheon.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company acquired majority control over optronics company Avimo. The same year Thales sold its 48.8% stake in Alcatel Space to joint venture partner Alcatel for about $700 million. (That deal and another sale of Thales' stock late in the year reduced Alcatel's stake to about 16%.) Thales also agreed to buy
   <company id="13046">
    Orbital Science
   </company>
   's GPS businesses, Magellan Corporation, and Navigation Solutions LLC (NavSol), a joint venture with Hertz, for about $70 million. In November the company sold Thales Instruments (the former instruments business of Racal) to an investment firm consortium for about $120 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thales agreed to sell its computer services arm, Thales IS, to French IT company GFI Informatique in 2002. However, GFI abandoned the deal, which would have been worth more than $300 million, soon after it was announced.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Thales gained ground when BAE lost prime contractor status in building the Royal Navy's new carriers; but the two companies would ultimately work together, with US-based KBR coordinating things. The following year Thales inked a €236 million deal to supply 18 facilities with Tiger combat helicopter simulators.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Thales and Germany's
   <company id="91110">
    Diehl Stiftung &amp; Co.
   </company>
   merged their aerospace activities, specifically cockpit avionics systems and flight and engine control, to create a new joint venture company, Diehl Aerospace GmbH. The two companies teamed up again to form Junghans Microtec GmbH, a combination of the two companies' ammunition fuse and safety device operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In exchange for a near 21% stake in Thales, plus cash, Thales acquired the satellite-building and homeland security businesses of telecom-equipment maker
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   in 2006. The deal included Alcatel-Lucent's transport systems division, which makes signaling systems for railways and subway systems. As part of the acquisition, the French government's stake in Thales decreased.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thales acquired a 25% slice of shipyard concern
   <company id="139490">
    Direction des Constructions Navales
   </company>
   (DCN) in 2007, with an option to increase its stake to as much as 35%. In return Thales handed over its Naval France business to DCN and a stake in three of Thales's concerns. The tie-up pushes Thales's system capabilities to the front of the European naval market. Also that same year,
   <company id="43993">
    ITT
   </company>
   Gilfillan and Thales inked a deal that would enable ITT radar systems to have the exclusive right to market and produce the Smart SMK II radar system for the US market. Thales also has a manufacturing facility in Maryland where it works on the Joint Tactical Radio System.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Thales Computers unit to
   <company id="138768">
    Kontron Modular Computers
   </company>
   in 2008 for €11 million (over $14 million). It also divested its electronic payment business that same year;
   <company id="52676">
    American Group Hypercom
   </company>
   purchased it for over €93 million (almost $125 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its information and communications systems security business, the company pocketed
   <company id="99659">
    nCipher
   </company>
   in 2008, a supplier of encryption products for government, financial institutions, and enterprises that need to protect sensitive data. Also in 2008 Thales joined Emirates Advanced Investments subsidiary C4 Advanced Solutions (C4AS) to step up military communication systems and equipment in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Holding a 49% stake in the Abu Dhabi-based joint venture (Thales Advanced Solutions), Thales supplies tactical radio maintenance, in-service support for products and systems, and software for communications systems to UAE armed forces. The joint venture extended Thales's regional influence; the company already won a deal to integrate communications at Abu Dhabi International Airport's air traffic control center tower. India is a customer too, and operates combat aircraft built by
   <company id="90718">
    Dassault
   </company>
   and Thales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thales purchased Israel-based medical imaging company CMT Medical Technologies in 2009 for about €20 million (more than $28 million). While its medical imaging business took a giant hit during the recession, its joint venture with Philips and Siemens (Thales holds 51%) to make digital X-ray detectors offset the impact. The acquisition of CMT satisfies all the needs of OEM requirements.
