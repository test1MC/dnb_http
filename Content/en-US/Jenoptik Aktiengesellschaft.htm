   While it is still headquartered in Jena, and it does still make optics, Jenoptik now focuses on some very specific markets. With the sale of M&amp;W Zander, which made up the company's Clean Systems Technologies unit (and the majority of its sales at one time), Jenoptik reorganized into three segments -- Lasers and Optical Systems, Metrology, and Defense &amp; Civil Systems -- and five product divisions under those segments. Users of the company's offerings include chip makers, such as

    IBM
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   , as well as chip equipment manufacturers, including
   <company id="47993">

   </company>
   . Jenoptik gets more than 60% of its sales outside Germany.

   The group's core businesses are in lasers/optics, optoelectronics, and mechatronics (products combining electrical, electronic, and mechanical equipment).

   The company hopes to grow the market for its products internationally, with an emphasis on Asia, the Middle East, and North America.

  <p>
   In 1846 mechanic Carl Zeiss opened a workshop in Jena, Germany, to produce microscopes and other precision optics. Physicist Ernst Abbe joined Zeiss' operation in 1866 and made key advances in microscope optics. To ensure local availability of glass, Abbe developed a relationship with glassmaker Otto Schott, who moved his glassworks to Jena in 1882.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Zeiss died in 1888, Abbe created a foundation,
   <company id="91093">
    Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung
   </company>
   , to maintain the company's balance of research and production. The organization thrived as improved optics increased demand for products such as eyeglasses, binoculars, and telescopes. Abbe died in 1905.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII delivered a major blow to Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung. Allied troops confiscated the company's technology and equipment, and many of its surviving scientists emigrated. With the establishment of East Germany and Soviet occupation, the operation, along with the Schott glassworks, were nationalized and divided from Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reformed in 1951 as VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, it thrived under communism and became a Kombinat (combine), a holding company for related firms (a method used to create economies of scale in resource-scarce East Germany). During the mid-1980s the East German government's semiconductor and computer operations became part of the Carl Zeiss Jena Kombinat.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's survival was threatened again by the fall of the Berlin Wall, sudden competition from capitalist rivals, and the loss of government price supports and an important customer -- the East German military. Lothar Späth, former premier of the West German state of Baden-Württemberg, stepped in as executive chairman in 1991. Späth guided the company -- now Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH -- through the complex machinations of privatization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Späth won nearly $2 billion in subsidies for the company, which allowed Jenoptik to make key acquisitions. The company went public in 1996, continuing to buy businesses such as Berlin-based telecommunications company Krone (1996) and traffic control and military applications specialist ESW-Extel (1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold Krone and turned its focus on clean-room technologies and management, and on electro-optical technologies. That year subsidiary M+W Zander sold its Infofab operation to US-based
   <company id="42833">
    Brooks Automation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After a banner year in 2000, Jenoptik weathered 2001 (easily the worst year ever for the semiconductor industry) and made forays into new regions (such as China and Malaysia) and new areas of operation (such as construction of a solar cell factory).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Jenoptik divested its Asset Management unit, which invested in real estate and small high-technology companies. Späth stepped down as executive chairman in 2003 and was succeeded by longtime company executive Alexander von Witzleben.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jenoptik sold 51% of its stake in M+W Zander Building Technology in 2004 to the company's management. The company sold its remaining interest in M+W Zander in 2006 to Springwater Capital, an Anglo-Swiss private equity investment firm. The sale marked the end of Jenoptik's involvement in clean-room construction for high-tech industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the divestiture of M+W Zander, Jenoptik reorganized into three segments: Laser &amp; Optics, Sensors, and Mechatronics (electromechanical equipment, such as electrical drives, power generation equipment, and radar domes).
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2007 Jenoptik made SINAR AG a wholly owned subsidiary, buying out the 49% interest held by the founding Koch family. SINAR, a Swiss firm, specialized in professional camera equipment and camera modules.
