   Giving it a decided competitive edge, AmerCable places great importance on the safety features of its products, since they are marketed to industries impacted by intense environmental conditions, such as humidity, salt air, heat, and cold, as well as cave-ins and explosions. The company makes its CIR (crush and impact resistant) cable with no sharp metal edges and with greater flexibility, making it safer to deal with during installation. AmerCable also insulates its cable with Gexol, its branded insulating compound.
