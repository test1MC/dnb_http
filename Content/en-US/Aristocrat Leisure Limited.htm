   Gambling machines appeared in Australia around 1898 in the form of poker machines, but local production of such machines didn't begin until 1953, when a dental supply manufacturer, Leonard Ainsworth, decided there was more money to be made in mechanized card games than in crown removers. He formed Aristocrat Leisure that year and began selling his first game, The Clubman. Poker machines became legal in New South Wales in 1956, spurring production and new competition. During the 1960s overseas competitors such as US-based Bally and the UK's Cope Allman entered the game but failed to dominate the new market. Meanwhile, Aristocrat expanded through acquisitions.

   The company later became one of the first manufacturers to use computerized video screens and to move away from mechanically driven machines. It introduced its DACOM 5000 accounting and player tracking system in 1982. By 1994 it was one of the world's three largest manufacturers of slot machines. That year it distributed 5,000 used machines to Peru. Aristocrat went public on the Australian Exchange in 1996 and began using its new capital to expand overseas.

   However, in 1997 the company ran into trouble as it tried to enter US markets. It was denied a license to operate in Colorado amid allegations that the company made illegal payments to South American officials and destroyed evidence. Colorado regulators also claimed Ainsworth's son Stephen issued low purchase invoices to a company in Turkey to avoid paying high taxes. Aristocrat also was being investigated by government authorities in Mississippi and Missouri, as well as at home in New South Wales. CEO John Dougall resigned amid the allegations. The company was fined $500,000 by Colorado regulators related to the customs violations in Turkey. It agreed to sever ties to founder Ainsworth and three of his sons.

   In 1998 the company expanded into the new South African gaming market by buying Africa Leisure. As Australia experienced a local backlash against gambling, the company announced renewed plans to expand into the US. In 2000 John Ducker was named company chairman. That year Aristocrat received a license to operate in Nevada. The company acquired US-based Casino Data Systems (now

   ) for about $180 million in 2001. David Simpson was named chairman in 2003.

   Aristocrat in 2006 acquired a 50% stake in Elektroncek, a maker of multi-terminal gaming systems in Slovenia. It also purchased a minority stake in US-based casino game maker
