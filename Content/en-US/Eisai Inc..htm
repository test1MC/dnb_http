   Following the loss of US patent protection for top selling drug Aricept, Eisai Inc. has been focused on growth efforts, including R&amp;D and acquisitions. Development efforts focus on neurology, vascular ailments, inflammation, and infectious disease treatments. In 2014 it entered a new collaboration with Biogen Idec to develop and commercialize two clinical candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

   The company is also focused on cancer treatments (Halaven, Aloxi), as well as BELVIQ, an anti-obesity treatment. In 2014 it launched Fycompa, an epilepsy treatment it developed in-house.

   In 2015 parent Eisai announced realignment efforts to streamline operations. The move primarily impacted Eisai Inc., which will cut about 25% of its workforce. There are no plans to close any offices or facilities.
