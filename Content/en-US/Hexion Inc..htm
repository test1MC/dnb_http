The unit also is one of the world's largest producers of versatic acids, which are additives for finished coatings, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   Hexion's products are sold to industrial users worldwide through a direct sales force (for larger customers) and third-party distributors (that more cost-effectively serve smaller customers). In 2015 the company's top ten customers accounted for 13% of net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The diverse markets include forest products, architectural and industrial paints, packaging, consumer products and automotive coatings, as well as higher growth markets, such as composites and electrical components.

  <p>
   The company's net revenues have been fluctuating in the last five years. In 2015 Hexion's revenues decreased by 19%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenues of the epoxy, phenolic and coating resins segments decreased due to lower volumes, driven by lower volumes within the oilfield business, as well as volume decreases related to versatic acids business and certain products within thebase epoxy and dispersions businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net loss has been decreasing over the last three years (2013-15). In 2015 Hexion's net loss decreased by 73% due to the decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, related to lower compensation, and benefits expense driven by recent cost savings and productivity actions, and lower professional services costs and gain on extinguishment debt in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Hexion posted operating cash inflow of $213 million (compared to operating cash outflow of $50 million in 2014) mainly due to lower net loss and changes in working capital, driven by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory due to sales volume decreases, lower raw material prices, and increased efficiency in accounts receivable collections.
