   Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), a majority-owned subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch giant
   <company id="93845">
    Unilever
   </company>
   , has been working its way into India since 1888, when it started selling its products there. As India's largest consumer goods firm, HUL markets more than 400 brands that include beverages, food, and home and personal care goods. Some of its names include Kwality Wall's ice cream, Sunlight dish detergent, Lifebuoy and Dove soap, Lipton tea, Pepsodent toothpaste, and Surf laundry detergent. HUL markets atta (a type of meal), maize, rice, and salt, and its export division ships castor oil and fish. The company also sells bottled water and over-the-counter medications.

        <p>
   Mumbai-based HUL rings up 97% of its sales in India. The consumer goods company has 25 plants across the country and research and development centers in Mumbai and Bangalore.

        <p>
   In addition to HUL's 25 manufacturing plants across India, the consumer-goods giant also has its hands in direct selling. It operates the Hindustan Unilever Network, which peddles personal care products in even the most remote parts of the country. The network was established in 2003 to create another avenue for selling its products while also supporting women, who typically sell its products. Now spanning some 1,500 towns and cities, the unit's goal is to grow its ranks to one million consultants.

        <p>
   HUL's sales are growing along with consumers' rising incomes and appetites for its brands. Indeed, revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2013 (ended March) versus the prior year, to top $4.7 billion. Net income rose 30% over the same period to $695 million. Driving the increase were higher sales of soaps and detergents, personal care products, tea, frozen desserts, and branded staple foods.

        <p>
   The Indian market for consumer goods is huge and growing as incomes there rise. Indeed, India is one of the highest-growth economies in the world. That fact has not been lost on international consumers goods companies, including Unilever rivals
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42008">
    Reckitt Benckiser
   </company>
   , which are both making strides in India. Attractive growth markets that are seeing lots of competition include hair care. To bolster its market leadership position in hair care, HUL has added variations on the Dove line of shampoos and conditioners. HUL has the capacity to reach more than 700 million consumers throughout India. Its parent,
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   , began to keenly focus on India in recent years. The company has seen a higher product growth rate in India as compared to Europe. To tap into this trend and grow market share, Unilever plans to create local food items, partner with local retailers, and concentrate on developing health and wellness products. HUL's Pureit compact-in-home water purifier fits the bill.
  </p>
        <p>
   HUL also has partnerships with foreign firms, including a 50% interest in a joint venture company, Kimberly Clark Lever Private Limited, with
   <company id="10856">
    Kimberly-Clark Corp
   </company>
   . for infant products, including Huggies diapers. HUL licenses its Lakmé cosmetics and Lever Ayush brands.

   In 1931 Unilever began laying its foundation in India with Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, Lever Brothers India Limited, and United Traders Limited. The three companies merged into Hindustan Lever Limited in 1956.
