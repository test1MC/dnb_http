   Snap-on understands the mechanics of the automotive repair business. The company is a leading manufacturer and distributor of high-quality hand tools, as well as auto diagnostic equipment and "under-car" shop implements, such as hydraulic lifts and tire changers. Snap-on has built a business serving mechanics, car makers, and government and industrial organizations. Other products -- with brand names such as Snap-on, Blackhawk, Lindström, ShopKey, and Sun -- include collision repair equipment, management software, roll cabinets, tool chests, wheel balancers, and wrenches. Founded in 1920, Snap-on originated the mobile-van tool distribution channel in the automotive repair market.

  <p>
   Snap-on's business is divided into four operating segments: Snap-on Tools, accounting for 38% of sales, caters to vehicle repair technicians through its mobile tool distribution channel; Commercial &amp; Industrial, 28% of sales, serves industrial and commercial customers, primarily through direct and distributor channels; Repair Systems &amp; Information, 27% of sales, serves other professional vehicle repair customers, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealership service and repair shops; lastly, the company's financial services business provides credit to customers (through Snap-on Credit LLC) in the US and abroad. In fiscal 2016 (ended January 2nd) the growing finance operation contributed 7% of revenues, up from 2% in 2010.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Snap-on reaches its customers through several channels: the mobile van channel (franchisee), company-direct, distributor, and Internet. The company reported advertising and promotion expenses of $55 million in fiscal 2016, compared with $51 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from Snap-on and resell them to end users. Hand tools under the BAHCO, Fish and Hook, Irimo, Lindström, and Williams brands and trade names are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South America, Asia and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold via distributors under brands including Hofmann, John Bean, Challenger, Cartec and Blackhawk. Diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in South America and Asia, and through both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe under the Snap-on, Sun, BAHCO and Blue-Point brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the end of 2016 the company's worldwide mobile van count was 4,800, including 3,500 vans in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company markets its products for customers in industries, including aviation and aerospace, agriculture, construction, government and military, mining, natural resources, power generation and technical education.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has seen a steady revenue growth since fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2016 Snap-on's revenues grew by 3% thanks to growth across all its segments except Commercial &amp; Industrial Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on Tools grew by 8% primarily due to higher sales in both the company's US and international franchise operations; and Snap-on's Repair Systems &amp; Information revenues increased by 2% due to organic sales, especially to OEM dealership service and repair shops, as well as increased revenues (including sales of diagnostic and repair information products and of undercar equipment) to independent repair shops.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Financial Services segment's sales grew by 12% due to a strong performance by its whole financial services portfolio (especially new finance and contract receivables).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Snap-on's net income increased by 13% due to higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow has followed the net income trend over last five years. In 2016 the company's operating cash inflow increased to $496.5 million (from $398 million in fiscal 2015).

  <p>
   Snap-on originated the mobile-van tool distribution channel in the automotive repair market. Snap-on's US van salespeople are primarily franchisees who buy tools at a discount, then sell them to mechanics at a price they determine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on's business was slowed by the economic downturn and the subsequent tightened credit market, but the company has been bouncing back. In recent years, the tools company has found success by jockeying for growth opportunities. To this end, Snap-on has boosted its manufacturing capacity in China and Eastern Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tools maker also reorganized its business in recent years to more easily make operations and investment decisions and assess performance. The move focused on realigning its business segments to cater to customer groups. As part of the effort, Snap-on reworked its division management and created four business segments: Commercial &amp; Industrial Group (CIG), Snap-on Tools Group, Repair Systems &amp; Information Group, and Financial Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the automotive repair arena, the company's 'coherent growth' strategy focuses on developing and expanding its professional customer base in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on's CIG is investing in emerging markets, such as China, India, the Middle East and Latin America, and Eastern Europe, while it concentrates on increasing market share in key industrial markets by acquiring new customers and partnering more with existing customers. To strengthen its Asia/Pacific operations the company opened four Blue-Point stores in China in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Snap-on Tools Group made continued progress in 2015, focusing on improving franchisee productivity; developing new programs and products to expand market coverage, reaching new technicians and increasing penetration with existing customers. It announced plans to continue to invest in new product innovation and development in 2016.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 it acquired Ecotechnics S.p.A for $13 million. Based in Sesto Fiorentino, Italy, Ecotechnics, with 2014 sales of approximately €12.4 million, designs and manufactures automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and the automotive aftermarket worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on purchased of Pro-Cut International in May 2014 for $42 million in cash. Pro-Cut, which designs, makes, and sells on-car brake lathes and related equipment and accessories used in brake repair, will be integrated into Snap-on's Repair Systems &amp; Information Group.

  <p>
   Joe Johnson's boss at American Grinder Manufacturing rejected his idea for interchangeable wrench handles and sockets in 1919, and Snap-on Tools was born. With practically no capital, Joe and co-worker William Seidemann made a set of five handles and 10 sockets, and two Wisconsin salesmen sold over 500 orders. Snap-on Wrench Company was incorporated in 1920. Stanton Palmer and Newton Tarble, both salesmen, developed a distribution business based on demonstrations at customer sites and formed Motor Tool Specialty Company in 1920. The next year they bought out Johnson's original supporters, and Palmer became president, holding the office until his death in 1931.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1925 Snap-on had salesmen working out of 17 branches; by 1929 it had about 300 salesmen and 26 branches. Overextended when the Depression hit, Snap-on was rescued by Forged Steel Products. Later, during WWII, tool shortages forced salesmen to carry excess stock in their vehicles. By 1945 walk-in vans loaded with tools were commonplace. Salesmen retailing to mechanics became independent dealers with their own regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Snap-on started buying branch outlets, giving it complete control over distribution and marketing. Research and development during the 1960s produced pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric tools, as well as the patented Flank Drive wrench with superior gripping. The company went public in 1978.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s Snap-on became the sole supplier of tools to NASA for the space shuttles. In 1985 it had 4,000 dealers, and by 1990 over 5,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Cornog became CEO in 1991, the same year Snap-on began signing new dealers as franchisees and offering existing dealers the option to convert. The changeover was prompted by several lawsuits from dealers claiming the company misrepresented their earnings potential. Snap-on purchased all of its minority-owned affiliate, Balco (engine diagnostic and wheel service equipment), in 1991 and acquired Sun Electric (automotive diagnostic, test, and service equipment) in 1992. The following year it acquired J. H. Williams Industrial Products (hand tools).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Snap-on Incorporated in 1994. It also launched its first national advertising campaign. The next year Snap-on increased its stake in Edge Diagnostic Systems (automobile diagnostic software) to 90%. The company also acquired Consolidated Devices (torque application and measuring equipment) in 1995 and Spain-based Herramientas Eurotools SA (hand tools), doubling its European sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Snap-on purchased the automotive service equipment division of FMC Corp. and won a contract to manage the service equipment needs of most US Toyota and Lexus dealers. The following year it moved head-on into the collision repair industry by purchasing Breco Collision Repair System and acquiring a 50% stake in Mitchell Repair Information (upped to 99% in 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on in 1998 bought Hein-Werner (collision repair equipment) and formed Snap-on Credit LLC, a joint venture with Newport Credit Group, to offer customer financing services. After difficulty integrating new acquisitions and the company-wide computer system, Snap-on announced in 1998 that it would "simplify" its operations by cutting 8% of its workers and 10% of its product line. The company also began producing Kobalt professional quality mechanics' tools for Lowe's Home Improvement stores that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Snap-on bought Sandvik Saws and Tools, a division of Sweden's Sandvik AB, for $400 million; the deal helped Snap-on expand in Asia and South America. In 2000 the company began selling its tools via its Web site. In mid-2001 executive Dale Elliott was promoted to president and CEO; Cornog remained as chairman until April 2002, when Elliott took that position. In late 2001 Snap-on lost a $44 million arbitrator's decision to industrial products and services company SPX Corp. in a case involving alleged patent infringement. In 2003 Snap-on started the Technical Automotive Group to distribute equipment to repair facilities through factory-direct salespeople.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2004 Elliott resigned and director Jack Michaels was named as his replacement. Michaels became chairman in late 2007, when Nicholas Pinchuk was named president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   To give it more control over its financing activities, the company's Snap-on Credit unit bought out joint-venture partner CIT Group for more than $8 million in 2009. The partnership had been in place for a decade.
  </p>
  <p>
   After acquiring a 60% interest in its tool manufacturing operation in Xiaoshan, China in 2008, Snap-On purchased the remaining 40% in 2010 for approximately $7.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Snap-on acquired Challenger Lifts for $38 million in cash in May 2013 to boost its under-car equipment business.
