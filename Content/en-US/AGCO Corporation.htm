   , but it reaps some healthy profits. AGCO makes tractors, combines, hay and forage tools, sprayers, grain storage and protein production systems, seeding and tillage implements, and replacement parts for agricultural end uses. It sells through a global network of some 3,000 dealers and distributors spanning 140 countries. It also builds diesel engines, gears, and generators through its AGCO Sisu Power unit. Core brands include Massey Ferguson, GSI, Challenger, Valtra (Finland-based), and Fendt (Germany). The company offers financing services to retail customers and dealers via a venture with Dutch company

  <p>
   AGCO has operations in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and the US. It also has a presence in Australia and Asia. Europe accounted for around 51% of its total revenue in 2015, while the US and South America accounted for 21% and 12%, respectively.

  <p>
   AGCO divides its operations across six segments. Tractors accounted for 58% of its total sales in 2015, while replacement parts generated 16%. Its newest segment, grain storage and protein production systems, accounted for 10%, while combines, application equipment, and other machinery collectively accounted for the remaining 16%.

  <p>
   AGCO distributes its products primarily through a network of 3,000 independent dealers and distributors, who are responsible for retail sales to the equipment's end user in addition to after-sales service and support of the equipment. Distributors also sell its products through a network of dealers supported by the distributor. Sales are not dependent on any specific dealer, distributor, or group of dealers.

  <p>
   AGCO's revenues dipped 23% from $9.7 billion in 2014 to $7.5 billion in 2015, its lowest total in almost five years. This was primarily due to softer global market conditions and the unfavorable impact of currency translations driven by the weakening of the euro and the Brazilian real.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits also plunged 35% from $404 million in 2014 to $264 million in 2015 mainly due to the lower net revenue and an increase in amortization of intangibles.

  <p>
   The company is targeting China and Russia as areas for growth and continues to focus on developing technologically advanced equipment to solve the myriad challenges facing farmers, such as population growth, changing diets, and scarcity of land.

  <p>
   In 2015 AGCO opened its Future Farm and Learning Center near Lusaka, Zambia, as part of its mission on the African Continent to provide agricultural solutions for African farmers.

   In 2014
   <company id="105170">
    DuPont Agriculture
   </company>
   and AGCO Corporation teamed up to bring wireless data transfer technology solutions to farmers in leading agricultural markets, including the US, Canada, Brazil, and in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year AGCO and Appareo Systems teamed up in a joint venture. Building on the existing IAS (Intelligent Agricultural Solutions) business structure, the JV will focus on the need for more advanced electronic technology centered around data collection, wireless communication, advanced sensors, and intelligent machine control.

  <p>
   Strategic acquisitions have supported AGCO's momentum and added to its net revenues over the years. In 2014 it obtained Intersystems, a Nebraska-based manufacturer of commercial material handling equipment sold to grain operations globally.

  <p>
   In 1861 American Edward Allis purchased the bankrupt Reliance Works, a leading Milwaukee-based manufacturer of sawmills and flour-milling equipment. Under shrewd management, The Reliance Works of Edward P. Allis &amp; Co. weathered financial troubles -- bankruptcy in the Panic of 1873 -- but managed to renegotiate its debt and recover. By the time Allis died in 1889, Reliance Works employed some 1,500 workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company branched into different areas of manufacturing in the late 19th century, and by the 20th century the Edward P. Allis Co. (as it was then known) was the world leader in steam engines. In 1901 the company merged with another manufacturing giant, Fraser &amp; Chalmers, to form the Allis-Chalmers Company. In the 1920s and 1930s, Allis-Chalmers entered the farm equipment market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although overshadowed by John Deere and International Harvester (IH), Allis-Chalmers made key contributions to the industry -- the first rubber-tired tractor (1932) and the All-Crop harvester. Allis-Chalmers spun off its farm equipment business in the 1950s, and phased out several unrelated products. The company, with its orange-colored tractors, expanded and prospered from the 1940s through the early 1970s. Then the chafing farm economy of the late 1970s and early 1980s hurt Allis-Chalmers' sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   After layoffs and a plant shutdown in 1984, the company was purchased in 1985 by German machinery maker Klockner-Humbolt-Deutz (KHD), who moved the company (renamed Deutz-Allis) to Georgia. In the mid-1980s low food prices hurt farmers and low demand hurt the equipment market. KHD was never able to bring profits up to a satisfactory level, and in 1990 the German firm sold the unit to the US management in a buyout led by Robert Ratliff. Ratliff believed the company could succeed by acquiring belly-up equipment makers, turning them around, and competing on price. It was renamed AGCO in 1991.
