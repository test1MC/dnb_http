   Q: Where can you learn the names of the marble lions outside New York Public Library's main branch? A: Inside the library, where Patience and Fortitude (their names), along with much more information, can be found. The library's four research centers and about 90 branches in metropolitan New York contain more material than any other library in the US -- about 50 million items. Each year more than 18 million people visit the library's branches, which house such treasures as a Gutenberg Bible and a hand-engraved
   <em>
    Songs of Innocence
   </em>
   . The library was formed by the 1895 consolidation of the Astor Library, the Lenox Library, and the Tilden Trust and by a merger with the New York Free Circulating Library in 1901.

  <p>
   The system is always looking to expand its reach. In 2013 it opened Mariners Harbor Library on Staten Island.

  <p>
   The library's revenue increased by 15%, up to $281 million in fiscal 2013, compared with $244 million in fiscal 2012. The spike was largely due to increased revenue from the City of New York (which contributed 49% of net sales). Private contribution and grants contributed 20% of net sales while  investment return appropriated for spending contributed 15% of net sales during fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   The State of New York and the Federal Government also contribute to the library every year.
