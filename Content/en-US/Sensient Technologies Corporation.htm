   </company>
   and the

        <p>
   Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sensient Technologies rings up 59% of its sales outside of the US. Europe is the company's largest foreign market, accounting for nearly 25% of sales. The Asia-Pacific region represents about 14%. Its Asia Pacific Group (formed in 1996) makes colors, flavors and fragrances for sale to China and other countries in the region.

        <p>
   The color, flavor, and fragrance firm operates through two business segments. Its Flavors &amp; Fragrances Group (F&amp;FG) develops, makes, and markets flavors and fragrances found in thousands of consumer products. It accounts for nearly 60% of the company's sales. F&amp;FG's principal manufacturing operations in the US in California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin, as well as in the countries of Belgium, Canada, China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. Sensient claims to be the second-largest producer (by sales) of dehydrated onion and garlic products. It's also one of the largest producers of distributors of chili powder, paprika, chili pepper, and dehydrated vegetables, such as parsley, celery, and spinach.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Color Group makes and supplies natural and synthetic color systems for foods and beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, inkjet printers, textiles, and paper products. It claims to be one of the world's largest manufacturers by sales of certified food colors and has operations in the US states of California, Missouri, and New Jersey and in the countries of, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, and the UK.
  </p>
        <p>
   The F&amp;FG group operates principally through the company's subsidiaries Sensient Flavors LLC and Sensient Dehydrated Flavors LLC. The Color Group operates through the company's Sensient Colors LLC subsidiary.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Sensient's sales rose 2% during fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 while profits increased 3% over the same period. This represents the third straight year of increasing sales after having seen demand for its products from manufacturers decline during the global financial crisis. Both the F&amp;FG and Color Group segments posted sales gains in 2012, up 2% and 1%, respectively.
  </p>
        <p>
   F&amp;FG revenue has risen due to an increase in volumes of both the traditional and dehydrated flavors businesses in North America and higher selling prices among traditional flavors. The Color Group attributes its sales gains to higher sales of both non-food colors and food and beverage colors driven by higher volumes and higher selling prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   While sales of OEM inkjet products increased in 2012 vs. 2011, the termination of a supply agreement by a major customer is expected to reduce sales of OEM inkjet ink products beginning in 2013. As a result, the group has been working to replace low margin products such as these with higher margin, value-added products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In early 2013 Sensient announced a broad restructuring program that involves the relocation of its F&amp;FG headquarters to Chicago, as well as a profit improvement plan across all segments. The profit improvement plan reduces headcount and consolidates several manufacturing facilities throughout Europe and North America. As a result, it aims to reduce its global headcount by about 200 and consolidate several manufacturing sites during the remainder of 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sensient Technologies is focused on global growth. In 2012 the company made significant investments in facilities in North America, South America, and Europe. It also planned in 2012 to make a significant investment to build a new color and flavor complex in Johannesburg, South Africa. The facility significantly improves Sensient's ability to service the market for pharmaceutical colors and coatings.
  </p>
        <p>
   In response to increasing demand for natural colors, the company invested $16 million to build new facility dedicated entirely to the manufacture of natural color emulsions, dispersions, and liquids. (The move proved prescient as concern over the potential health effects of artificial dyes in children made headlines in 2011.) It has also invested in increased color capabilities in Italy, Germany, and China. The company's natural color line is known as Fusion Precise Natural Colors. Encouraged by growing demand for printer ink, Sensient is expanding its production capacity in Morges, Switzerland.

        <p>
   F&amp;FG sells dehydrated products to food manufacturers for use as ingredients and also for repackaging under private labels for sale to the retail market and to the food service industry. Its Color Group sells its synthetic and natural colors to domestic and international producers of beverages, bakery products, processed foods, confections, pet foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

   Leopold Wirth, Gustav Niemeier, and Henry Koch Jr. founded Meadow Springs Distillery in 1882. It soon began making Red Star yeast. With the liquor market hit hard by WWI restrictions and prohibition, yeast became the main product for the company, which took the Red Star name in 1919. Three years later second-generation company executive Bruno Berganthal took the helm, but disagreements led to his departure in 1938. Leopold's grandson Russell Wirth, who became president in 1950, expanded Red Star's yeast products and, through acquisitions, gave it a national and international presence.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company went public in 1961 and purchased Universal Foods (an institutional food products maker), taking its name the next year. In 1968, 30 years after his father Bruno's resignation, August Berganthal shot and killed Russell (then chairman); he was paroled in 1981.
  </p>
        <p>
   Universal Foods diversified in the 1970s with forays into soft-drink bottling, gourmet foods, and dehydrated products with the 1979 purchase of Rogers Foods. It swapped its bottling operations to Philip Morris in 1984 for Warner-Jenkinson (food colors and flavors).
  </p>
        <p>
   Sales fell in fiscal 1995 after Universal Foods sold its frozen foods subsidiary to ConAgra. Kenneth Manning became CEO in 1996.
  </p>
        <p>
   Acquisitions in the 1990s extended the company's national and international reach. Universal Foods bought pharmaceutical color and jet ink maker Tricon Colors in 1997, and in 1998 it made acquisitions in Europe and Mexico. In 1999 Universal Foods became the world's top color supplier to the cosmetics industry when it bought French firm Les Colorants.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year Universal Foods filed two lawsuits (one dismissed, one settled) against former employees who bashed the company on Internet message boards. In the process, the company tried -- unsuccessfully -- to halt the distribution of a Milwaukee newspaper running a story on the lawsuits. Also in 1999 Universal Foods purchased Pointing Holdings, a leading UK food coloring supplier, and the next year it bought Missouri-based Monarch Food Colors.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2000 the company changed its name to Sensient Technologies to better communicate its expansion into nonfood operations. Sensient also announced plans to consolidate manufacturing plants in the US and Europe, eliminating about 5% of its workforce (mostly outside the US).
  </p>
        <p>
   The company sold its Red Star yeast operations in 2001 to the world's leading yeast producer, Lesaffre, for $122 million and bought the industrial dye business of Crompton (now
   <company id="139261">
    Chemtura
   </company>
   ). The same year it also acquired
   <company id="10856">
    Kimberly-Clark
   </company>
   Printing Technology.
  </p>
        <p>
   Sensient bought German specialty dye maker SynTec and Switzerland's ECS Specialty Inks and Dyes, as well as New Jersey-based cosmetics ingredients maker, Cardre, Inc. in 2002. It also bought the flavors and essential oil operations of
   <company id="133276">
    C. Melchers GmbH &amp; Co.
   </company></p>
        <p>
   During 2003 the company acquired Spanish specialty ink maker Formulabs Iberica S.A. and Japanese flavor producer Kyowa Koryuo Kagaku.
  </p>
        <p>
   In October 2010 the firm opened a new plant in Guangzhou, China.
