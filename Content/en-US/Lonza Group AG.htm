  <p>
   Lonza Group's origin dates back to 1897, when Elektrizit√§tswerk Lonza was founded on the banks of the Lonza River in Gampel, Switzerland, to generate hydroelectric power for making electrochemical products. By 1909 the company had begun to produce basic chemicals. Its product line grew to include fertilizers, organic chemicals, and intermediates. The company was known as Lonza Ltd. by 1919.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s Lonza Ltd. began producing petrochemicals, and in 1965 it began operating a naphtha cracker to produce acetylene, ethylene, and hydrogen. The company expanded into the US in 1969 with the founding of Lonza Inc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Swiss Aluminum AG (which later became
   <company id="90987">
    Alusuisse Lonza Group
   </company>
   or Algroup) bought Lonza Ltd. in 1974. The firm opened its first fine chemicals plant in the US in 1977. Between 1985 and 1990, Lonza expanded its polymer, additive, and intermediate operations in Italy and acquired a US producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 the company bought a Pennsylvania fine chemical plant from SmithKline Beecham and a Czech biotechnological production process firm. It bought Celltech Biologics (therapeutic proteins, UK) in 1996 and expanded into China the next year through a joint venture to construct a niacinamide plant. The company was spun off by Alusuisse Lonza Group in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lonza Group sold its energy business in 2001 to EnBW Kraftwerke AG as part of its effort to concentrate on its life science business. The next year Lonza announced it was selling its polymer intermediates business to Bear Stearns Merchant Fund but shelved the deal in 2002. BZ Gruppe Holding Aktiengesellschaft had owned about 20% of the firm but sold its stake in 2002. As a result, BZ Gruppe's Martin Ebner resigned as Lonza chairman.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2004 CEO Markus Gemuend announced his resignation. Gemuend's announcement came as a result of the company's lagging performance; both the company's sales and its net profit dropped by a third in 2003.

   veteran Stefan Borgas was named the new CEO effective June 1, 2004. He held the post until 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the company expanded with the acquisition of the Bioproducts and Biopharma divisions of US specialty chemical company
   <company id="12881">
    Cambrex
   </company>
   for about $460 million. The Bioproducts unit, which made chromatography, cell culture, and endotoxin detection products, became a new division called Lonza Biosciences. The Biopharma division, which provided contract manufacturing and process development services for biopharmaceutical clients, was integrated into the Lonza Biopharmaceuticals segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lonza's 2008 acquisition of US-based cell discovery firm amaxa enriched the company's Biosciences division.
