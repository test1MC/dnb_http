   Commercial manufacturing group Carlisle Companies is nothing if not diverse. Through dozens of subsidiaries and five business segments, the multinational company manufactures and distributes an array of products, including construction materials, automotive products, brake and friction products, interconnect technologies, and foodservice products. Its largest segments are Construction Materials (rubber and plastic roofing systems, rigid foam insulation, and waterproofing and protective coatings) and Interconnect Technologies (high-performance wire, cable, connectors, contacts, and cable assemblies for the aerospace and defense electronics). Carlisle strives to be a market leader in various niche markets.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company generated about 75% of its 2015 revenues in the US. Sales in Europe in 2015 accounted for 11%; Asia, 6%; Canada 3%; Latin America (including Mexico), 3%; the Middle East 2%; and Africa 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle's manufacturing facilities are located in the US, the UK, Italy, China, Japan, and India.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Carlisle has manufacturing operations in North America, western Europe, and Asia/Pacific. Each of its operating companies are led by a president, who has a considerable level of independent responsibility for the performance of their business -- a model  believed to enhance entrepreneurship and responsive decision making. Its operations are reported in the following five segments:
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM): Rubber (EPDM), thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) roofing membranes used predominantly on non-residential low-sloped roofs, related roofing accessories, including flashings, fasteners, sealing tapes, coatings and waterproofing, and insulation products. In 2015 CCM accounted for 56% of Carlisle's total 2015 sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT, 22%): High-performance wire, cable, connectors, contacts, and cable assemblies primarily for the aerospace, defense electronics, industrial, medical, and test and measurement equipment markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle Brake &amp; Friction (CBF, 9%): High-performance brakes and friction material, and clutch and transmission friction material for the mining, construction, aerospace, agriculture, motor sports, and alternative energy markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle FoodService Products (CFSP, 7%): Commercial and institutional foodservice permanentware, table coverings, cookware, catering equipment, fiberglass and composite material trays and dishes, industrial brooms, brushes, mops, and rotary brushes for commercial and non-commercial foodservice operators and sanitary maintenance professionals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Carlisle began reporting the results of operations of newly acquired Finishing Brands in a new operating segment, Carlisle Fluid Technologies (CFT, 6% of 2015 sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of the company's subsidiaries include Carlisle Canada ULC, Carlisle Brake Products (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd, Carlisle Construction Materials BVTriStar Electronics SA, Carlisle Trading and Manufacturing India Private Limited, Carlisle Trading and Manufacturing India Private Limited, and Carlisle Insurance Company.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company serves a broad range of niche markets including commercial roofing, energy, agriculture, mining, construction, aerospace and defense electronics, foodservice, healthcare, and sanitary maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>
   CCM's primary market is US. The primary market for CIT's products is the US, Europe, and China. CBF's products are sold by direct sales personnel to OEMs, mass merchandisers, and various wholesale and industrial distributors around the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. Key markets served include construction, agriculture, mining, aircraft, heavy truck, and performance racing. In 2015 two distributor customers represented a 34% of CCM's net sales, one of which,
   <company id="110409">
    Beacon Roofing Supply
   </company>
   , Inc., represented 10% of Carlisle's total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   CFSP's sales are primarily in North America. Its product line is distributed from three primary distribution centers located in Charlotte, North Carolina, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Batavia, Illinois, to wholesalers, distributors, and dealers. These distributor and dealer customers, in turn, sell to restaurant, hotel, and onsite foodservice operators and sanitary maintenance professionals. Distributors and dealer business relationships are managed through both direct sales personnel and subcontracted manufacturer representatives.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 net revenues increased by 11% to $3.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CCM revenue increase reflected higher sales volumes, partially offset by negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations and lower selling prices. CCM's net sales volume growth was primarily driven by increased activity in both commercial construction and re-roofing. CCM's net sales into Europe declined 13% (16% related to the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset organic net sales growth). CCM's net sales into Canada, declined 9%, of which 13% was related to effects of foreign exchange, partially offset by 4% organic net sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   CIT's net sales increased 17%, reflecting acquisition growth of 12% from the acquisition of the LHi medical cabling business, and higher sales volumes of 8.5%, primarily on higher demand for its in-flight entertainment and connectivity applications sold into the commercial aerospace markets. Another factor was the slightly higher volumes on increased demand for connectivity applications sold into the defense and test and measurement markets. These gains were partially offset by 2.8% lower selling price.
  </p>
  <p>
   Newly added CFT also contributed to the increase in 2015 net revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Carlisle's net income of $319.7 million rose 27% compared to 2014 due to higher revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities was $529.2 million, an increase of 79% on 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Carlisle's strategy is to achieve profitable growth internally by investing in new product development (such as carbon-carbon technology for off-highway braking applications), modifying existing products to comply with regulatory changes, reducing costs by substituting raw materials, and entering new markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 CFT established a global headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona to streamline administrative functions and coordinate its global strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle plans to continue to pursue opportunities to reduce costs in the current demand environment as well as invest in new business initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has established a strong franchise for CIT, building four factories in 2013 and 2014, making CCM the only single-ply roofing membrane manufacturer of EPDM, TPO, and PVC.
  </p>
  <p>
   Externally, the company has a long history of making acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having acquired more than 50 companies since 1990, Carlisle continues to grow through "bolt-on" purchases that help it gain market share in certain niche markets. In addition it considers acquiring new businesses that can operate independently from other Carlisle companies. Factors considered by the company in making an acquisition include consolidation opportunities, technology, customer dispersion, operating capabilities, and growth potential.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also sells underperforming businesses and segments to improve its bottom line.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2016 Carlisle bought Micro-Coax, Inc., a leading global supplier of high-performance, high frequency coaxial wire and cable, and cable assemblies for mission-critical RF/microwave applications for defense, satellite, test and measurement and other industrial customers. Micro-Coax has annual sales of $45 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Carlisle bought Finishing Brands Holdings from
   <company id="10671">
    Graco
   </company>
   for $590 million. Finishing Brands is a global manufacturer and supplier of finishing equipment and systems serving diverse end markets for paints and coatings, including OE automotive, automotive refinishing, aerospace, agriculture, construction, marine, rail and other industrial applications. Finishing Brands became a new reporting segment within Carlisle's operations, named Carlisle Fluid Technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company acquired LHi Technology, a leading designer, manufacturer, and provider of cable assemblies and related interconnect components to the medical equipment and device industry, for $195 million.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Charles Moomy founded Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1917 to make rubber inner tubes for auto tires. The company debuted its full-molded inner tube in 1926. Success followed until the stock market crash of 1929.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle limped through the Depression with help from the New Deal's Industrial Loan Act. However, Moomy was forced to turn his stock over to the
   <company id="110932">
    Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
   </company>
   , which became Carlisle's biggest shareholder. Pharis Tire and Rubber Company acquired Carlisle from the Federal Reserve Bank in 1943. Upon Pharis' liquidation in 1949, Carlisle stock was distributed to Pharis stockholders and company officials. Carlisle Corporation was formed, and it bought Dart Truck (mining and construction trucks).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle continued to diversify. During the 1960s it added jar sealant rings, roofing materials, automotive accessories, and tires for recreational vehicles. It moved to Cincinnati in the 1970s and acquired foodservice product and computer peripherals companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1980s, unable to compete with the big car tire makers, Carlisle focused on tires for smaller vehicles (motorcycles and snowblowers), and it sold car tires to the auto aftermarket. The company restructured as Carlisle Companies Incorporated in 1986 and moved to Syracuse, New York, the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle bought Brookpark Plastics (plastic compression molding) and Off-Highway Braking Systems (from B.F. Goodrich Aerospace) in 1990, gaining factories in Europe and South America. After taking a hit in the early 1990s recession, Carlisle consolidated operations and sold its communications and electronics industries. With its 1993 purchase of Goodyear's roofing products business, Carlisle became the US's top maker of nonresidential roofing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the mid-1990s Carlisle has increased its acquisitions, buying Sparta Brush (specialty brushes and cleaning tools), Trail King Industries (specialized low-bed trailers), Ti-Brook (trailers and dump bodies), Walker Stainless (trailers and in-plant processing equipment), Intero (steel and aluminum wheel rims), and Unique Wheel (steel wheels). The company also bought the engineered plastics unit of Johnson Controls and Hartstone (ceramic tableware, cookware, and decorative products).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle acquired several small tire and wheel makers in 1997. The next year the company bought Vermont Electromagnetics and Quality Microwave Interconnects, both makers of specialty cable assemblies; Industrial Tire Products, an industrial and recreational vehicle tire distributor; and Hardcast Europe (adhesives and sealants, the Netherlands).
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle stopped making refrigerated marine shipping containers in 1999, and its Carlisle Tire &amp; Wheel Company subsidiary sold its surfacing products division. Carlisle bought privately owned Johnson Truck Bodies that year to boost its production of insulated dairy trucks. It also bought Innovative Engineering (cheese-making system supplier, New Zealand) and Marko International (table coverings and accessories for the food service market).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Carlisle bought Damrow Denmark and Damrow USA (cheese-making equipment) and Red River Manufacturing (custom trailers and paving equipment). It also bought Titan International's consumer tire and wheel business and Process Controls Engineering, a control systems designer that serves the food and dairy industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company moved to North Carolina, and the deal-making continued apace with the acquisitions of Wincanton Engineering (food- and beverage-processing equipment) and EcoStar (roofing). Carlisle also bought Mark IV Industries' Dayco industrial power transmission business for about $150 million. Carlisle acquired the MiraDri division (waterproofing) from Nicolon Corporation in late 2002. The following year the group added Flo-Pac, a broom and cleaning tool manufacturer, to its General Industry segment. Specialty tire and wheel manufacturer Trintex was acquired by Carlisle in 2004 for $32.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle wasn't all purchases, though. In early 2003 it sold its European-based power transmission belt operations to Italy-based Megadyne and closed a plastic automotive parts plant in Erie-Bundy Park, Pennsylvania. Carlisle sold Carlisle Engineered Products (later named
   <company id="104770">
    Creative Engineered Polymer Products
   </company>
   ) to the Reserve Group in 2005. Later that same year the company bought the off-highway brake business of competitor
   <company id="54341">
    ArvinMeritor
   </company>
   for just under $40 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to strengthen its higher margin businesses, Carlisle placed its Carlisle Systems &amp; Equipment operations up for sale in 2005. The following year it sold Carlisle Process Systems (cheese-making and food-processing equipment) to
   <company id="92818">
    Tetra Laval
   </company>
   subsidiary
   <company id="128648">
    Tetra Pak
   </company>
   . Shortly afterwards, it sold industrial stainless steel storage vessel maker Walker Group (including
   <company id="118116">
    Walker Transport
   </company>
   ) to private investment firm Insight Equity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group was affected by economic trends, including the near-collapse of the US automotive industry and a widespread slowdown in construction. In 2007, the company closed facilities in Virginia and Wisconsin in the US and a third facility in Wales. It also began actively reducing its inventory. However, it boosted its construction materials segment -- its biggest -- with the $160 million acquisition of insulation company Insulfoam.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008, Carlisle acquired Dinex International, a foodservice equipment manufacturer targeting the health care and other institutional industries. It also bought Carlyle Incorporated, a provider of aerospace and network interconnections equipment. Both acquisitions expanded Carlisle's developing applied technologies operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year the company also started streamlining several of its businesses. To focus on its core operations, Carlisle exited its on-highway friction and brake shoe business and dissolved subsidiary
   <company id="118329">
    Motion Control Industries
   </company>
   in 2009. The following year, it sold its
   <company id="118091">
    Trail King
   </company>
   trailer business to
   <company id="43098">
    CC Industries
   </company>
   and its refrigerated truck bodies business. Carlisle sought a buyer for its power transmission belt business but instead combined those operations with its tire and wheel operations to create the transportation products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 Carlisle bought Jerrik, a maker of specialty filter connectors for the aerospace and defense markets. The acquisition expanded the group's developing interconnect technologies segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Carlisle acquired
   <company id="55287">
    Hawk Corporation
   </company>
   , a maker of friction products for auto brakes, clutches, and transmissions used in on- and off-highway applications including aircraft, heavy trucks, and farm equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carlisle added to its Interconnect Technologies segment through the acquisitions of the Thermax/Raydex business from  Belden for $265.5 million in 2012 and Tri-Star Electronics International for $284.8 million in late 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it acquired Hertalan Holding, a Dutch manufacturer of single-ply roofing systems, for about $48.9 million. Added to its Construction Materials segment, Hertalan gives Carlisle local manufacturing and distribution channels to better serve the roofing market in Europe. The purchase also complements Carlisle's prior acquisition of Germany-based PDT Phoenix, a manufacturer of single-ply roofing systems in Europe, for $111 million in 2011.
