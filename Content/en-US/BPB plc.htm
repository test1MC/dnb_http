   Getting plastered every day is the BPB way. The

    Saint-Gobain
   </company>
   -owned company, which does business under the Gyproc name, is Europe's top manufacturer of plasterboard, also known as drywall -- the material of choice for constructing walls and ceilings. The company uses gypsum to make lightweight construction products and paperboard for packaging materials. Other products include fire-resistant board and construction tools and fittings, as well as flooring, insulation, and decorative materials. BPB operates worldwide in nearly 60 countries.

  <p>
   BPB got its start from UK's McGhie &amp; Sons gypsum mining operation, founded in 1906. American Frank Culver came to the UK in 1912, believing there was gypsum money to be made there. In 1914 he convinced McGhie &amp; Sons to open a plaster mill for the manufacture of plasterboard (invented in the US in 1890). Shortly after the start of WWI, Culver became managing director of McGhie &amp; Sons. The firm bought a US plasterboard plant in 1915, but soon realized it had bitten off more than it could chew. It sold the plasterboard assets to a private company, British Plaster Board (incorporated 1917).
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon after buying the US plasterboard plant, one of Culver's friends stole money that was flagged to pay for a plasterboard machine, and an important technical advisor was lost in the sinking of the
   <i>
    Lusitania
   </i>
   . Need for its plasterboard increased with the army clamoring for plasterboard for its temporary buildings. Culver sailed back to the US in 1917, never to return; company records indicate strained relations between him and other firm officials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plasterboard gained popularity in the building industry in the 1920s, and by 1932 trade had grown tremendously. British Plaster Board decided to go public that year, and by the mid-1930s it had acquired competitors and completed a series of takeovers. In 1948 the company bought a stake in South Africa's Gypsum Industries. It purchased Canada's Western Gypsum Products in 1954 (renamed it Westroc Industries) and during that period formed the Gyproc Group joint venture with Swedish company Scancem. By 1968 the company, now called BPB Industries, basked in monopolistic success after UK's only other plasterboard producer, ICI, closed its plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1977 the European Commission imposed anti-competitive guidelines for BPB Industries to follow, but in 1985 the company still controlled most of UK's plasterboard market. The following year, however, imports from Spain, France, and Germany began threatening BPB Industries' dominance. In 1988 the European Commission slapped fines on the company for allegedly trying to stop Spanish imported plasterboard from being sold in the UK. The next year the commission began investigating the entire British plasterboard market, after BPB Industries asked to be released from the commission's 1977 restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Competition from imports caused BPB Industries' market share to drop considerably in 1990. The firm also struggled with low gypsum prices in the early 1990s. It tried to buy National Gypsum of America (a US leader) in 1995, but was outbid by Delcor. The next year the company shortened its name to BPB, and its Westroc subsidiary became BPB Westroc. BPB also set up a joint venture with Chile's Matte Group to produce gypsum in South America, and it purchased the rest of South Africa's Gypsum Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 BPB expanded its acquisitions in Spanish and Swiss companies. It also began a drastic restructuring of its struggling paperboard unit. Several factors contributed to BPB's 1998 drop in sales and profits: the strength of the British pound, product oversupply in the industry, and restructuring costs. The company also bought China-based Shanghai Orient and the remainder of its joint venture with Scandinavian-based Gyproc Group. Also in 1998 the Commission of European Communities began investigating BPB for suspected anti-competition violations and raided the company's offices.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO Jean-Pierre Cuny retired in 1999 and was replaced by David Leonard, COO of the company's gypsum division. The following year BPB secured its stake in the US linings market by acquiring Celotex Corporation, a wallboard and ceiling business. The company also bought Heidelberger Dammsysteme, Europe's largest manufacturer of expanded polystyrene insulation products.
  </p>
  <p>
   BPB bought Rawlplug, a UK-based maker of wall, ceiling, and floor anchoring and fixing products, in 2001. The following year BPB acquired

   's US gypsum business, which added three gypsum wallboard plants. In November 2002 the European Union concluded its four-year investigation and issued its second-largest antitrust fine ($475 million) to building materials companies

   </company>
   (France), BPB, Knauf (Germany), and Gyproc (Belgium) for participating in a plasterboard cartel between 1992 and 1998. BPB's portion of the fine was $137.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 BPB strengthened its European plasterboard business by acquiring Gyproc Benelux NV in tandem with transactions that added Etex's plasterboard and plasters business (Belgium and the Netherlands) and sold Gyproc's plasterboard businesses (Germany and Poland) to Lafarge.
  </p>
  <p>
   BPB streamlined its German plasterboard and insulation systems operations, initiated a process to align its IT platforms in Europe and North America, and closed its paperboard mill at Purfleet (UK) in 2004. To cut costs and focus on its higher-margin plasterboard business, BPB restructured its paperboard business, selling or closing some operations. In 2004 it sold its paper recycling business BPB Recycling to British paper wholesaler and packaging firm
