   DJO sold off Empi's rehabilitation equipment and supply catalog business, Empi Therapy Solutions (ETS), to Patterson Medical (part of
   <company id="14827">
    Patterson Companies
   </company>
   ) in 2009. DJO sold the division to focus on its own product brands; the ETS unit sold products made by other suppliers.

  <p>
   Clinical engineer Donald Maurer, formerly a director of neurological research at Medtronic, founded Empi in 1977 to make pain-control devices that used transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Because the company's founding predated FDA product testing rules, the efficacy of these products was not required to be proven. In 1984 the company bought Minnesota-based Techmed, one of its major distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Empi doubled its size in 1992 with the acquisition of Medtronic's Nortech division. That year the company introduced its Dupel iontophoretic product and its first female incontinence product, Innova PFS, which uses electrical stimulation to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles (often weakened by pregnancy and childbirth). Empi acquired biofeedback company Physical Health Devices in 1993 to add to its incontinence line. Although Empi's stock had been riding high, it plummeted after more questions were raised about TENS's efficacy. The company diversified into braces and supports in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Empi's stock looked set to recover, but in 1996 Medicare refused reimbursement for Empi's female incontinence devices, citing a lack of clinical data. This news sent the company's stock back to the roller coaster. In 1997 the company introduced its InnoSense pelvic floor muscle stimulation female incontinence product. With the floor dropping out from under its stock, the company sought to restore shareholder value via a 1999 buyout by
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   , an investment firm.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Carlyle Group strengthened Empi's emphasis on rehabilitative products; in 2000 it bolstered Empi's rehabilitative line with the purchase of Germany-based Ormed. Also that year Medicare agreed to provide reimbursements for Innova, Empi's treatment for female urinary incontinence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Empi filed to go public in 2004, but the company was instead acquired by medical device maker Encore Medical for some $370 million later that year. Empi's electrical nerve stimulation products were added through Encore Medical's acquisition of Compex Technologies in 2006. Encore Medical was taken private by the
   <company id="43093">
    Blackstone Group
   </company>
   in late 2006; Encore Medical changed its name to ReAble Therapeutics early the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2007 ReAble acquired
   <company id="54697">
    IOMED
   </company>
   , a producer of drug delivery systems used in pain management, and made it part of Empi. IOMED's products -- used primarily in sports medicine and physical therapy settings -- included non-invasive iontophoresis systems that deliver pain drugs through the skin using low levels of electricity.
  </p>
  <p>
   ReAble Therapeutics merged with medical device maker
   <company id="103835">
    DJO Incorporated
   </company>
   and took on the DJO name in late 2007.
