   Peter Black makes footwear and assorted accessories. Founded in 1947, the company first made shopping bags and slippers from old army webbing. It later expanded into personal care products (cosmetics, baby care, and other toiletries), vitamins, and diet supplements, as well as men's and women's footwear and accessories (handbags, jewelry, gifts). Peter Black now focuses on product design, development, and supply chain management of footwear and accessories. Among the mainly UK retail customers, the company has supplied

   At one time, every family in Peter Black's hometown of Keighley had someone working at the company. Its workforce has considerably declined as its businesses, particularly footwear, were hurt by less expensive foreign competitors and difficulties in keeping pace with fashion trends.
