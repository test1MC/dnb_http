   Arianespace is tops in space launches. Arianespace, the world's leading satellite launch company, is a private European commercial space consortium that has launched more than 260 satellites. Its group of launchers includes The Ariane 5 heavy-lift launch vehicle (77 launches to date), The Soyuz medium-size launcher (11), Baikonur with Starsem (26), and the Vega light-weight launcher (four). Satellite makers -- including

    Lockheed Martin Space Systems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="52289">
    Mitsubishi Electric
   </company>
   -- are among its customers. Arianespace was formed in 1980 and is being acquired in a joint acquisition by both

   Arianespace has contracts with 35 customers; since its inception, the company has signed contracts with 93 customers worldwide carrying out 221 Ariane launches.

  <p>
   Arianespace's revenue increased by 41% to €1.4 billion (its second-best revenue in history) in 2014. The growth was fueled by a launch increase from eight in 2013 to 11 in 2014. Also that year, the company returned to profitability, posting net income of €3 million.

  <p>
   Growth for Arianespace -- which claims a 50% share of the launch services market -- means making sure that launchers are available and costs are reasonable in an industry in which long lead times and variable expenses are the norm. The company continues its efforts to reduce the cost of its launchers and to further improve Ariane 5's competitiveness before its new Ariane 6 launcher enters service, which is expected to debut in 2020.
