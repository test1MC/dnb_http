   Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal reported a decrease in sales volume in fiscal 2016 (March year end) due to a delayed recovery in steeldemand in Japan (and a related inventory adjustment), and a global decline in steel product prices caused by lower raw material prices. As a result, the company saw drop of ¥702.6 billion in net sales to ¥4,907.4 billion.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's ordinary profit decreased by ¥250.8 billion in fiscal 2016 to ¥200.9 billion due to weak domestic steel demand, lower export sales, and depressed sales to the energy sector (the result of lower oil prices), all of which outpaced the company's cost improvement measures.
  </p>
        <p>
   Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal's free cash flow declined by ¥126.6 billion in fiscal 2016, to ¥320.7 billion due to lower profit attributable to owners of the company's parent. Cash from operating activities and cash generated from asset compression resulted in a ¥270 billion reduction in interest-bearing debt.

   The company is looking to strengthen its Japan-based manufacturing plants by prioritizing investments in new technology and by sharing some of the best practices in Japan with overseas manufacturing bases. It plans to consolidate its upstream processes in Japan to increase its cost competitiveness.

   The $24 billion acquisition of

   in 2012, mating Japan's #1 and #3 steelmakers, boosted the expended company's market share against

   and other Asian rivals in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Similar consolidation has been happening in other countries -- particularly China and Russia -- aimed at elevating their steel industries to compete in the international market.

        <p>
   As Japan prepared for war, the government in 1934 merged Yawata Works, its largest steel producer, and other Japanese steelmakers into one giant company -- Japan Iron &amp; Steel. During postwar occupation, Japan Iron &amp; Steel was ordered to dissolve. Yawata Iron &amp; Steel and Fuji Iron &amp; Steel emerged from the dissolution, and with Western assistance the Japanese steel industry recovered from the war years. In the late 1960s Fuji Steel bought Tokai Iron &amp; Steel (1967), and Yawata Steel took over Yawata Steel Tube Company (1968).
  </p>
        <p>
   Yawata and Fuji merged in 1970 and became Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker. In the 1970s the Japanese steel industry was criticized in the US; American competitors complained that Japan was "dumping" low-cost exports. Meanwhile, Nippon Steel aggressively courted China.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company diversified in the mid-1980s to wean itself from dependence on steel. It created a New Materials unit in 1984, retraining "redundant" steelworkers to make silicon wafers and forming an Electronics Division in 1986. Nippon Steel began joint ventures with IBM Japan (small computers and software),
   <company id="41866">
    Hitachi
   </company>
   (office workstations), and C. Itoh (information systems for small and midsized companies) in 1988 as increased steel demand for construction and cars in Japan's "bubble economy" took the company to new heights.
  </p>
        <p>
   In an atmosphere of economic optimism, the company spent more than four times the expected expense to build an amusement park capable of competing with Tokyo Disneyland. The company plowed ahead, spending some $230 million on the park. Space World amusement park opened on the island of Kyushu in 1990. The company's bubble burst that year. (The theme park declared bankruptcy in May 2005, and was sold to Kamori Kanko later that year.)
  </p>
        <p>
   In response, Nippon Steel cut costs and intensified its diversification efforts by targeting electronics, information and telecommunications, new materials, and chemicals markets. Seeking to remake its steel operations, the company began a drastic, phased restructuring in 1993 that included a step most Japanese companies try to avoid -- cutting personnel. A semiconductor division was organized that year as part of the company's diversification strategy.
  </p>
        <p>
   Upgrading its steel operations, Nippon Steel and partner
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi
   </company>
   in 1996 introduced the world's first mass-production method for making hot-rolled steel sheet directly from smelted stainless steel. Profits were hurt that year by a loss-making project in the information and communications segment and by a steep decline in computer memory-chip prices.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company began operation of a Chinese steelmaking joint venture, Guangzhou Pacific Tinplate, in 1997. The next year its Singapore-based joint venture with Hitachi, Ltd., began mass-producing computer memory chips in hopes of stemming semiconductor losses. But falling prices convinced Nippon Steel to get out of the memory chip business and in 1999 it sold its semiconductor subsidiary to South Korea's
   <company id="55908">
    United Microelectronics
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   That year the US imposed antidumping duties on the company's steel products. The next year Nippon Steel agreed to form a strategic alliance with South Korea-based Pohang Iron and Steel (
   <company id="42957">
    POSCO
   </company>
   ), at that time the world's #1 steel maker. The deal called for the exploration of joint ventures, shared research, and joint procurement, as well as increased equity stakes in each other (at 2%-3%). Also in 2000 Nippon Steel agreed to provide
   <company id="52323">
    Sumitomo Metal Industries
   </company>
   and Nisshin Steel Co. with stainless steel products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Early in 2001 Nippon Steel formed a cooperative alliance -- focused on automotive sheet products -- with French steel giant Usinor (now a part of
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   ). At the end of the year, Nippon Steel decided to form an alliance with Kobe Steel to pare down costs and share in distribution and production facilities. In 2002 the company continued its series of comprehensive alliances by forming alliances with Japanese steelmaker
   <company id="56887">
    Nippon Metal Industry
   </company>
   to exchange its semi-finished stainless steel technologies and with POSCO to build environment-related businesses.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company reported a loss of ¥51.69 billion ($430 million) for fiscal 2003 due to securities valuation losses and group restructuring charges. In 2004 Nippon Steel formed a joint venture with Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel and Arcelor to manufacture high-grade automotive steel sheets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Nippon Steel moved into the South American market in 2006, forming alliances with steelmaker
   <company id="95060">
    Usiminas
   </company>
   and iron miner
   <company id="41792">
    CVRD
   </company>
   . And the next year it created a JV with
   <company id="57074">
    Baosteel
   </company>
   and
   <company id="51740">
    ArcelorMittal
   </company>
   that produces automotive steel sheets.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company joined up with
   <company id="52323">
    Sumitomo Metal Industries
   </company>
   in 2009 when the two companies agreed to form a joint venture that will combine their arc-welded stainless steel pipe and tube operations. Sumitomo will own 60% of the JV. The operations that make up the new company, which will be called Sumikin &amp; Nippon Steel Stainless Steel Pipe Co., achieved sales of more than $250 million in 2008.
