   Innovation is a big selling point for ITW's myriad of products. The company holds about 10,600 US and foreign patents, as well as 6,000 patents pending. R&amp;D is executed cooperatively with customers seeking specific applications.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ITW has operations in 57 countries. The company operates 314 international plants and office facilities in China, France, Germany, and the UK. The US represents ITW's largest market, generating 46% of net sales in 2015. Other major markets include Europe/Africa/Middle East (EMEA, 28%), South America (3%), and Asia/Pacific (16%).
  </p>

  <p>
   ITW distributes its products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors. It serves customers in a range of industries, including automotive OEM/tiers, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, and construction.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ITW's revenues declined 7% from $14.5 billion in 2014 to $13.4 billion in 2015 due to sales decreases across all its segments and the effects of unfavorable currency translations. Most notably, its Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segments suffered in 2015 from lower demand in the oil and gas end markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits also plummeted 36% from $2.95 billion in 2014 to $1.9 billion in 2015 due to the absence of income from discontinued operations that it previously recorded in 2014. In addition, its operating cash flow jumped 42% in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to favorable changes in assets and liabilities that were affiliated with acquisitions and divestitures.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is focusing on a five year enterprise strategy that includes three key initiatives: portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. ITW's portfolio management initiative, which included divesting businesses which were no longer aligned with the company's long-term objectives, was completed in 2014.

  <p>
   In the past ITW has achieved strong growth through the use of acquisitions. In 2016 it agreed to acquire the Engineered Fasteners and Components (EF&amp;C) business from
   <company id="106099">
    ZF TRW
   </company>
   for approximately $450 million. EF&amp;C is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and interior technical components to the automotive OEM market and operates 13 manufacturing facilities globally.

  <p>
   In the early years of the 20th century, Byron Smith, founder of Chicago's
   <company id="14276">
    Northern Trust Company
   </company>
   , recognized that rapid industrialization was outgrowing the capacity of small shops to supply machine tools. Smith encouraged two of his four sons to launch Illinois Tool Works (ITW) in 1912. Harold C. Smith became president of ITW in 1915 and expanded its product line into automotive parts.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW developed the Shakeproof fastener, the first twisted-tooth lock washer, in 1923. When Harold C. died in 1936, the torch passed to his son Harold B., who decentralized the company and exhorted salesmen to learn customers' businesses so they could develop solutions even before the customers recognized the problems. Smith plowed profits back into research as WWII spurred demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1950s the company began exploring plastics and combination metal and plastic fasteners, as well as electrical controls and instruments, to become a leader in miniaturization. Its major breakthrough came in the early 1960s with the development of flexible plastic collars to hold six-packs of beverage cans. This item, under a new division called Hi-Cone, was ITW's most-profitable offering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silas Cathcart became CEO in 1970. Smith's son, another Harold B., was president and COO until 1981 (he remained on the board of directors and served as chairman of the board's executive committee). By the early 1980s ITW had become bureaucratic and susceptible to foreign competition. It was forced to lower prices to hold on to customers. Wary after the 1982 recession, ITW hired John Nichols as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nichols broadened the company's product line, introduced more-effective production methods, and doubled ITW's size by buying 27 companies, the largest being Signode Industries, bought for $524 million (1986). Nichols broke Signode into smaller units to speed development of 20 new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW purchased Ransburg Corporation (electrostatic finishing systems, 1989) and the DeVilbiss division of Eagle Industries (1990) and merged the two to form its Finishing Systems and Products division. In 1992 the company introduced the Ring Leader Recycling Program to recycle its plastic six-pack rings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through a stock swap, ITW acquired ownership of the Miller Group (arc welding equipment and related systems) in 1993. An 11% increase in car building in Europe in 1994 caused revenues of the company's engineered-components segment to grow dramatically; that year 76% of ITW's international sales came from European operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 ITW named president James Farrell as CEO. He replaced Nichols as chairman in 1996. ITW acquired Hobart Brothers (welding products) and Medalists Industries (industrial fasteners) in 1996 and made 28 acquisitions and joint ventures in 1997. It entered the domestic spray-painting equipment business in 1998 by acquiring Binks Sames (now Sames Corporation) for $106 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW gained the technology to make bar-code printers in 1999 when it acquired industrial ink-jet maker Trident International in a $107 million deal. Other purchases that year included a polyester film-processing plant from South Korea's SKC, Duo-Fast (pneumatic nailing and stapling tools), and for $3.5 billion,
   <company id="11204">
    Premark International
   </company>
   (consumer products, which it began selling off in 2002). ITW sold its Irathane Systems urethane linings and moldings division to Industrial Rubber Products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company added to its ink-jet operations in 2000 with the acquisition of Imaging Technologies LLC. Through its Hobart subsidiary, ITW also acquired Trilectron Industries (ground support equipment) from HEICO in a deal worth about $57 million. Early in 2001 the company added to its welding operations by buying four welding component businesses from
   <company id="10470">
    Dover Corporation
   </company>
   . Later in the year it acquired hot stamp foil company
   <company id="42082">
    Foilmark
   </company>
   . In early 2002 the company's board of directors gave its stamp of approval for the divestiture of ITW's consumer products segment. That decision led to the sale of its Precor fitness equipment business to Finland's
   <company id="90933">
    Amer Sports
   </company>
   in October for about $180 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Farrell retired as CEO in 2005, though he remained chairman; he was replaced by president David Speer. Farrell retired as chairman in 2006 and was succeeded by Speer in that post. EVP Thomas Hansen was elevated to vice chairman, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW purchased the
   <company id="117475">
    Wynn Oil
   </company>
   segment of industrial products maker
   <company id="11156">
    Parker Hannifin
   </company>
   in early 2005. Wynn Oil manufactures chemical car care products and maintenance technology for the auto industry. It also bought Rippey Corporation, a maker of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cleaning products for the semiconductor industry, that year. ITW continued its streak of diverse acquisitions later in 2005 with the purchase of instrumentation maker
   <company id="12048">
    Instron
   </company>
   from investment group
   <company id="108867">
    Kirtland Capital Partners
   </company>
   . Instron's products include instruments, software, and services designed to test materials and structures. And the company rolled on into 2006 with more acquisitions with the purchase of Alpine Engineered Products, a maker of connectors, design software, and related machinery from Stonebridge Partners, which had just acquired the company in the middle of 2005. Alpine fit in well with other ITW companies, like Truswal and Pryda.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2006 ITW acquired
   <company id="44552">
    CFC International
   </company>
   (multilayer coatings for a variety of markets, including furniture) for about $90 million in cash. In mid-2006 ITW bought BagCo (plastic recloseable packaging) and Kester (solder and related materials). The company then acquired
   <company id="100021">
    Click Commerce
   </company>
   , a developer of supply chain management software, for about $292 million in cash. ITW saw the software company, with its 1,500 customers, having strengths in industries served by ITW. In late 2006 ITW purchased
   <company id="125544">
    Speedline Technologies
   </company>
   , a manufacturer of printed circuit board assembly and semiconductor packaging equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 the acquisitive company accumulated another 52 firms, following a record set in 2006 that picked up more than 50 companies at a cumulative investment of around $1.7 billion. Also that same year ITW acquired the assets of Avery Berkel, a venerable manufacturer of retail scales and other food processing equipment, from
   <company id="112310">
    Avery Weigh-Tronix
   </company>
   . The company bought the rest of Avery Weigh-Tronix in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trymer was among the 50 businesses acquired worldwide in 2008; the maker of rigid foam products expanded ITW's mechanical insulation offerings in its industrial packaging segment, as well as sports a plant in La Porte, Texas. Trymer's product applications run from mechanical and panel insulation to floral arrangements and crafts. Its lines, like many of ITW's products, are sold under their original owner's name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2009 ITW acquired the assets of South Carolina-based Hartness International, a manufacturer of conveyor systems and line automation for the beverage and food industries. The acquisition complements ITW's packaging business in a lower cost geography. Nineteen other acquisitions were made in 2009, including a savvy negotiation for Ride Rite, an inflatable paper dunnage (packing) bag manufacturer, from recession hit
   <company id="159652">
    KapStone Paper and Packaging
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW also divested a number of companies that didn't pan out for growth. In mid-2009 it jettisoned its
   <company id="100021">
    Click Commerce
   </company>
   , a business with a buffet of industrial software applications to private equity
   <company id="160708">
    Marlin Equity Partners
   </company>
   . Marlin bought three software divisions from
   <company id="102192">
    Requisite Technology
   </company>
   (formerly Click Commerce), and raked away Service Network Solutions, Research and Healthcare Solutions, and Contract Service and Management operations, as well as the Click Commerce nameplate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company pushed to unload an automotive components business, on the sale rack since 2007. Instead, the business was reclassified as discontinued, along with an automotive machinery business, and two consumer packaging businesses. Its consumer products holdings (appliances and cookware, exercise equipment, and ceramic tile acquired with
   <company id="11204">
    Premark International
   </company>
   ) were also curbed. In a surprise move, ITW's decorative surfaces segment, which could not find a buyer, was revived in 2009 as a continuing business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 ITW acquired Accessories Marketing (dba Slime), a maker of tire care products and accessories, from private equity Friend Skoler &amp; Co. Slime brings a flagship brand, green Slime tire sealants, and a lineup of tire gauges, tire repair kits, portable air compressors, and self-healing tire tubes, sold in more than 60,000 retail stores worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   To build on its automotive aftermarket business, in 2011 the company purchased
   <company id="41841">
    Shell
   </company>
   's SOPUS Products unit, a car care product distributor for
   <company id="58708">
    Pennzoil-Quaker State
   </company>
   brands, such as Rain-X (window rain repellent), Black Magic (liquid wax), and Gumout (fuel system cleaner). SOPUS (an acronym for Shell Oil Products US) made about $300 million in annual sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2011 Minnesota-based Despatch Industries joined ITW. The acquisition expanded ITW's presence in thermal processing equipment for the solar, carbon fiber, and other thermal technology sectors -- a high-growth market.
  </p>
  <p>
   ITW in late 2012 sold 51% of its Decorative Surfaces segment to Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice for about $1.05 billion. The divestment allowed ITW to focus on core segments while retaining some value in Decorative Surfaces, which is expected to enjoy more sales as the construction sector strengthens. ITW in spring 2012 sold its finishing group of businesses to fluid-handling equipment specialist Graco for $650 million. Included in the sale were ITW companies such as Binks (spray guns) and Gema, which made paint and spray systems for industrial applications. The company also sold its electronic components business in the power systems and electronics segment, and it is divesting its consumer packaging operations in the "all other" segment.
