   C-B is capitalizing on the wave of environmental regulations by transforming itself into a one-stop source for fuel-efficient, low-emission technologies and retrofit offerings. Its investment in a Milwaukee research and development facility has paved the way for a stream of new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also is on the look-out for acquisitions in order to grow its geographic footprint and enhance its product portfolio. In 2014 C-B acquired two Texas-based boiler sales and service companies:  Holman Boiler Works, which operated 12 regional offices in six states, and Affiliated Power Services (APS), with offices in Dallas, Houston, and Corpus Christi; TX. The companies were merged together under the name Cleaver-Brooks Sales and Service and now operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.
