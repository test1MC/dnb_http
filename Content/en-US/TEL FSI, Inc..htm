   TEL FSI (formerly FSI International) stays focused on semiconductor wafers all around the world. The company's surface conditioning equipment performs key cleaning, etching, and stripping functions that remove contaminants from silicon wafers and prepare them for subsequent production steps. Its equipment is typically used by electronics manufacturers worldwide, such as

   ,
   <company id="55277">
    Samsung Electronics

    STMicroelectronics

   , and
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   , as well as by other high-tech organizations, including
   <company id="111717">
    Sandia National Laboratories
   </company>
   . In 2012
   <company id="53860">

   bought the former FSI International for some $250 million and changed its name to TEL FSI.

   <company id="53860">
    Tokyo Electron
   </company>
   bought the former FSI International for some $250 million and changed its name to TEL FSI.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Outside of the US, TEL FSI has facilities in China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the UK. Customers outside the US account for almost three-quarters of sales.

   Like other equipment suppliers, the company faces long sales cycles for its products that may take 12-18 months, as chip makers qualify a piece of equipment and see if it will fit into their fab lines. It brands its products under the Zeta, Mercury, Orion, Antares, and Polaris names.

  <p>
   While the semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, wreaking havoc with the financial results of its equipment suppliers, TEL FSI is unprofitable in good times and bad. In the past decade, the company eked out a profit in only two years (2010 and 2011) before being acquired by Tokyo Electron in 2012.

  <p>
   In 1966 Vic Wallested offered his protégé, Joel Elftmann, a chance to head tool and production design for his new company, Fluoroware (which merged with another company 33 years later to become
   <company id="52084">
    Entegris
   </company>
   ). Elftmann developed a silicon wafer spin-dryer, which in 1973 formed the nucleus of spinoff Fluoroware Systems Corporation (renamed FSI Corporation in 1977). Elftmann became FSI's VP/GM, rising to chairman and CEO within 10 years. In 1987 FSI Corp. became FSI International, Inc. In 1989, the year the company went public, Elftmann promoted president and COO Richard Jackson to CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   FSI was losing money by 1991, in part due to a downturn in the chip market and a lag in sales as the company moved to a new photoresist licensee. Jackson resigned and Elftmann returned as CEO, reorganized management, hired technical talent, and cut product lines from seven to three. By 1993 the company returned to profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 1995 FSI went on a spending spree, buying Applied Chemical Solutions, licensing a cleaning technology from
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   , and completing a production facility. In 1996 it acquired Semiconductor Systems, Inc. (SSI), a supplier of equipment for processing semiconductors, flat-panel displays, thin-film heads for data storage, and multichip modules. The subsequent semiconductor slump prompted the company to cut its staff in 1996 and 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 FSI acquired YieldUP International (now SCD Mountain View), a maker of specialized cleaning equipment used in chip making. Also in 1999 the company sold its chemical manufacturing division to
   <company id="90067">
    BOC Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Donald Mitchell, former president of Air Products Electronic Chemicals, became president and CEO; Elftmann remained chairman until 2002, when Mitchell succeeded him. In 2001, amid another industry downturn, FSI again cut its workforce and reduced capital expenditures.
  </p>
  <p>
   A dismal worldwide semiconductor slump that ran from 2001 into 2003 fostered topsy-turvy business conditions for FSI. After failing to find strategic partners and investors for its POLARIS System microlithography business, the company closed the unit in 2003, reducing its workforce by about 40%. FSI reorganized support functions for its microlithography lines into a unit called POLARIS Systems and Services (PSS).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 FSI took over direct sales in Europe and Asia from its distributor
   <company id="61398">
    Nortem
   </company>
   (formerly Metron Technology). Nortem was acquired by semiconductor equipment industry behemoth
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   later that year. FSI owned 20% of Apprecia Technology (formerly known as m•FSI), a Japanese joint venture formed in 1991 with Mitsui. Apprecia distributed and supported certain FSI products in Japan, while also distributing its own equipment and products from other manufacturers. In 2004 m•FSI granted FSI exclusive rights to distribute certain m•FSI products outside Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 FSI sold its facility in Allen, Texas, that was home to the POLARIS product group. It sublet space for PSS employees in the building.
