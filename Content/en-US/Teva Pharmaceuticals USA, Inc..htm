   Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, the US subsidiary of massive Israeli generic drug maker
   <company id="52434">
    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
   </company>
   , develops, manufactures, and markets both generic and branded pharmaceuticals. The company is the largest manufacturer of generic drugs in the US; its product roster boasts more than 350 generic equivalents of prescription drugs in a wide variety of therapeutic categories, including cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, oncology, central nervous system, women's health, and dermatological. The company also produces over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

  <p>
   Teva Pharmaceuticals USA primarily operates in the generics and specialty medications markets.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Teva Pharmaceuticals USA is headquartered in Pennsylvania and has more than 30 locations nationwide.

  <p>
   Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gets almost half of its revenues from direct sales to drugstores and another third from drug wholesalers; other customers include mail-order pharmacies, distributors, and hospitals. It relies upon an in-house sales force that calls on purchasing agents for retailers and institutional buying groups.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Teva Pharmaceuticals USA accounts for more than half of its parent company's sales; in fiscal 2015, Teva's revenue totaled $19.7 billion, a 3% drop from the prior year. The decline was attributed to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. However, when considered in local currency terms, sales rose on OTC, generic, and specialty medications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Teva's US generic business revenue was $4.8 billion in 2015, an 8% increase from the previous year's $4.4 billion. That increase was largely due to the launches of generic versions of Abilify and Nexium as well as the sales of products not available in 2014. Sales of the generic versions of Pulmicort, Xeloda, Niaspan, and Lovaza slowed down that year
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Teva's US specialty medicines business totaled $6.4 billion, a 5% increase from $6.1 billion in 2014. US sales of Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis treatment, rose 4% to $3.2 billion that year.

  <p>
   The company still expects US demand for generics to continue to grow as the population ages and as the nation continues to look for ways to reduce escalating health care costs. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA keeps its pipeline pumping out generics and to that end, the company has more than 100 new generic drugs awaiting FDA approval at any given time. Along with performing its own research and development, the company forms alliances with other pharmaceutical firms to license and market generic versions of their branded drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Teva launched generic equivalents to Abilify in several dosages, Argatroban Injection for intravenous infusion, and Exforge in four different dosages (all in the US). Also that year, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approved inhalant ProAir RespiClick and a generic version of Diovan. That year, the company received a total of 23 final generic drug approvals. In 2016 Teva Pharmaceuticals USA launched its Rajani generic version of
   <company id="41808">

   's Beyaz birth control pill.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was one of the first biologics medications to lose patent protection (in 2014). Anticipating the possible launches of biosimilar competitors from the likes of
   <company id="103281">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11030">
    Mylan
   </company>
   , Teva has introduced new versions of Copaxone, including a long-lasting variation that is taken three times a week. If and when generic versions of the biologic are approved, the company's revenue stream (of which 20% comes from Copaxone) could take a downturn.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of parent Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' cost-reduction plan and efforts to streamline operations, the company sold its manufacturing facility in Sellersville, Pennsylvania, to G&amp;W Laboratories in 2015.

   The company's roots go back to Lemmon Pharmaceutical Company, founded in 1945. Lemmon Pharmaceutical was acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1981.
