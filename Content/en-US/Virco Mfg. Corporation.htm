   Have childhood memories of metal-legged folding tables, upholstered auditorium seats, or molded plastic chairs with attached wooden desks designed mostly for right-handers? Thank Virco Mfg. for the memories. The company makes a broad range of furniture and fixtures for the education market, including student and teacher desks, chairs, tables, computer furniture, mobile pedestals and tables with combined seating for cafeterias, A/V equipment, and filing and storage cabinets. It also offers seating, tables, media units, and other furniture for hotels, government agencies, churches, and convention centers. Founded in 1950, Virco provides delivery and installation services, as well.

   From its headquarters in Torrance, California, Virco serves customers nationwide. The company rings up more than 90% of its sales in the US, with Puerto Rico, Canada, and other countries accounting for the remainder.

  <p>
   In Torrance and in Conway, Arkansas, the company boasts 1.1 million sq. ft. of fabrication facilities and 1.2 million sq. ft. of assembly and warehousing facilities.

   Virco's business is normally seasonal, especially among customers in the education market. More than half of the company's sales are made from June through September; the winter months are usually slow. To ensure that orders are filled and shipped quickly during its peak period, the company amasses inventory at its warehouses in California and Arkansas. Virco reported advertising costs of $1.25 million in fiscal 2014 (ended January) compared with $1.1 million in 2013.

  <p>
   Virco has endured declining sales and profits in recent years. The recession prompted state and local government agencies to tighten their budgets and reduce deficits, which ultimately led to less funding for Virco's core customer group: schools. Indeed, the company's sales have declined by about a third from their peak of $229.6 million in fiscal 2008. Most recently, Virco's sales fell 2% in fiscal 2014 (ended January) versus the prior year, to about $156 million, and the company posted a loss of $1.7 million, its fourth consecutive year in the red. Still, the firm has managed to narrow its losses significantly since 2011, when it lost more than $17 million. Cash flow from operations continued on its roller coaster ride: cash flow used in operations was $243,000 in fiscal 2014 compared to cash flow provided by operations of more than $7 million in the prior year. The company blamed unfavorable economic conditions and their adverse impact on school budgets and a reduction in completions of bond-funded projects for its continued poor financial performance.

  <p>
   While the company expects demand for its furnishings to remain under pressure, Virco has positioned itself to pull through continued turmoil, thanks to its lean operations. The company has had to shift gears in recent years to adjust, as schools -- due to budgetary pressures -- have either reduced or eliminated central warehouses, janitorial services, and professional purchasing functions in favor of the ease of an all-encompassing regional, state, or national contract. Virco has responded by expanding the products and services it provides its primary educational customers. Customers can now have furniture delivered to warehouses and school sites and even have furniture installed in classrooms.

  <p>
   Despite the somewhat depressed outlook, Virco has been broadening its product line and production capabilities to boost revenues. The company rolled out the Sage Contract and Civitas seating lines in 2012 as it works to target colleges, hospitality venues, and offices and reception areas. The company develops many of its products in-house, but also works with accomplished independent designers, as well.
