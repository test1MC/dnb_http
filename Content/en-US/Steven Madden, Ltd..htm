   Steven Madden's sales jumped 24% in 2012 versus 2011, to $.123 billion, after rising more than 50% in the previous annual comparison. Indeed, 2012 marked the fourth consecutive year of rapidly rising sales and profits for the firm, with growth accelerating in 2011 and 2012. The strong sales performance in 2012 was broadly supported by double-digit growth across all of the company's business segments. Gains by the wholesale business have been the primary sales driver in recent years. Net income increased 23% in 2012 versus 2011, to nearly $120 million driven by rising sales.

   Steven Madden's recent success is a result of its focus on its wholesale operation. The company is also gaining a foothold in areas beyond shoes, and it continues to invest in its accessories business. (The footwear maker's accessories business has eclipsed its men's business.) While small compared to the wholesale business, retail is an important avenue for growth at Steve Madden. The company has added more than 30 stores over the past two years and is looking to enter new markets.
