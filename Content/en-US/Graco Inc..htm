   Graco has fluid management skills. The company, which was founded in 1926 as Gray Company, manufactures fluid-handling equipment designed to move, measure, control, dispense, and apply fluid materials. Products include pumps, applicators, spray guns, pressure washers, filters, valves, and accessories; these goods are used in industrial and commercial applications to handle paints, adhesives, sealants, and lubricants. In addition to painting contractors, Graco's customers include automotive, construction equipment, and vehicle lubrication companies. Graco sells its products through independent distributors worldwide.

  <p>
   Graco has subsidiaries located in Australia, Belgium, China, Japan, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, and the UK, which distribute products in their local areas. The majority of manufacturing occurs in the US, but some products are assembled in China and Belgium.

  <p>
   Graco's largest segment is industrial; its products account for almost 60% of company sales. The business, which includes the Applied Fluid Technologies division, manufactures and distributes equipment to apply paint and other coatings (liquid finishing), to move and dispense chemicals and liquefied foods (process pumps), and to refinish and repair automobiles (Sharpe brand by Graco) to customers who make, assemble, maintain, repair, and refinish products such as appliances, vehicles, airplanes, electronics, cabinets, furniture, and other articles. The alternative energy market utilizes the company's sealant and adhesive application equipment for solar panel seals and wind power components, such as turbine blades.
  </p>
  <p>
   The contractor segment generates about 30% of Graco's total sales. This segment markets a complete line of airless paint and texture sprayers, hoses and filters, and spare parts to painters in the construction and maintenance industries. Contractor products are also sold through general equipment distributors and retail home centers. The equipment is used to mark roads, parking lots, fields and floors; to paint and texture walls, ceilings, and structures; and to apply coatings to roofs. The lubrication segment represents approximately 10% of company sales. Graco makes pumps and applicators used by the vehicle services and industrial markets, including oil-change outlets, service garages, fleet service centers, automobile dealerships, and auto parts stores.

  <p>
   Graco has achieved unprecedented growth over the last few years, with revenues climbing 11% from $1.1 billion in 2013 to peak at a record-setting $1.2 billion in 2014. Profits also jumped 7% to $211 million in 2013 to $226 million in 2014, another company milestone. The company's operating cash flow has slowly increased over the years, hovering around the $240 million mark for both 2013 and 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic growth for 2014 was driven by increases across all its segments. Industrial sales jumped 12% primarily due to additional revenue from previous acquisitions, and contractor sales increased due to the recovery in the US housing and construction markets. By region, the Americas increased 15%, the EMEA climbed by 8%, and the Asia/Pacific saw growth of 3% during 2014.

  <p>
   Graco has posted milestone financial results over the last few years through the use of acquisitions. In early 2015, the company bought High Pressure Equipment (HiP; purchased for $160 million), a manufacturer of valves, fittings, and other flow control equipment engineered to perform in ultra-high pressure environments. It also obtained White Knight Fluid Handling, a maker of air-operated double-bellows pumps, air-operated double- diaphragm pumps, and metering pumps.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also in 2015 purchased GeoBlaster (manufacturer of wet abrasive blasting equipment for coating removal and surface preparation) and Brazil-based Multimaq, a maker of finishing products that serve a variety of industries including metal, wood, and leather.
  </p>
  <p>
   Graco in 2014 swallowed up QED Environmental Systems (QED), a manufacturer of fluid management equipment for the growing environmental monitoring and remediation markets, and EcoQuip, a producer of eco-friendly vapor abrasive blasting systems for coating removal and surface preparation. Also that year, the company acquired Alco Valves Group (Alco), a UK-based manufacturer of high quality, high pressure valves used in the oil and natural gas industries.

  <p>
   Graco is the successor to Gray Company, founded by Russell and Leil Gray from a downtown Minneapolis garage in 1926, to make air-powered grease guns for car lubrication. Their devices proved more effective than hand-operated grease guns, and by the 1930s were marketed nationally to car dealerships and service stations. The company expanded during the Depression and made battlefield lubrication equipment during WWII; afterward, it moved into other industrial markets with sprayers, finishers, and dispensers.
