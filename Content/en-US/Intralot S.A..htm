   The world's #2 lottery company knows how to hedge its bets. Intralot S.A. (second only to
   <company id="13812">
    International Game Technology
   </company>
   ) designs and develops hardware and software for lottery gaming systems around the world. It also operates the lotteries, including managing the games, printing tickets, handling advertising and marketing, and controlling payments and payouts. In addition, Intralot, which has operations in more than 55 countries, provides products and services for non-lottery gaming such as sports betting, horse and greyhound racing, interactive gaming, and casino gaming. It offers more than 400 games, including sports betting, fixed odds betting, pari-mutuel wagering, video lottery, instant games, and online betting.

  <p>
   Intralot generates about half its sales from the European Union, including operations in Cyrpus, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and the UK. The Americas contributes nearly a third and other countries (primarily in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa/the Middle East) account for the rest.

  <p>
   The company reported a 14% jump in revenue for 2012 to 1.4 billion euros. A slight decrease in sales across the European Union was more than offset by substantial increases in the Americas (nearly 20%) and the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, and the Middle East (nearly 75%). Key to Intralot's results were new products and new markets. It entered the German sports betting market; began developing games for the National Lottery of Mexico; and won a bid (as part of a consortium) to operate Greece's Hellenic Lotteries.

  <p>
   Intralot's primary strategy has been a focus on expanding beyond the European Union, which in 2009 accounted for more than 80% of revenue (in 2012 it was about 50%). In 2012 and 2013 it introduced or expanded operations in Mexico, Peru, Jamaica, Russia, and the US, among other markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also invests heavily in R&amp;D to keep its portfolio of products on the cutting edge of the industry. In 2012 it increased R&amp;D spending 12% and created an Innovation Lab to incubate state-of-the-art ideas.
