   Heidelberger Druckmaschinen (Heidelberg) may well be responsible for all the news that's fit to print. A world leader in the manufacture of printing machinery, Heidelberg claims to have installed more than 400,000 of its printing presses around the globe. The company's products include sheetfed and offset presses, prepress units, and machines for die cutting, folding, and binding. It also manufactures software and consumables for various printing applications and makes black-and-white digital presses and high-performance copiers. Heidelberg has more than a dozen manufacturing sites and 250 support centers worldwide.

   In 1850 Andreas Hamm took over his older brother's Hemmer, Hamm &amp; Compagnie bell foundry and machine factory in Frankenthal, Germany. Six years later he partnered with Andreas Albert to make printing presses. Hamm died in 1894, and his son sold the company. Two years later the company was moved to Heidelberg; it was incorporated as Schnellpressenfabrik AG Heidelberg.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the end of WWI, the company presented its "platen press," which did not require paper to be hand-fed into it. Heidelberg expanded its casting capability with its 1929 merger with Maschinenfabrik Geislingen. It debuted an automatic high-speed cylinder press (1934), but the onset of WWII forced production cutbacks. The company made lathes and hydraulic devices during the war. Printing press production resumed in 1945.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heidelberg opened the largest printing press plant in the world in Wiesloch, near Heidelberg, in 1957. That factory churned out 100,000 presses in its first two years. In 1962 Heidelberg began making offset presses, and in 1967 it changed its name to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG.
  </p>
  <p>
   Setbacks in the 1970s and a growing demand for color presses caused Heidelberg to open a fully computerized factory in Amstetten in 1985. It bought US-based Harris Graphics (web-offset presses) in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heidelberg pushed into full-service products and acquired Stork Contiweb (splices and dryers), Sheridan Systems (bookbinding systems), and Linotype-Hell (prepress equipment) in 1996. To further intensify its efforts in becoming a full-service printing provider, the company bought Stahl Group (finishing machines) in 1998, added Eastman Kodak's office imaging division the following year, and entered a joint venture with US-based Creo to enhance the capability for printing PDF files.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid record sales in 2000, Heidelberg acquired its Swiss sales partner Lüscher, Leber + Cie AG. The company continued its push into high-growth markets in 2001, increasing its sales in China and Latin America.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing an 18% sales decline in fiscal 2003, the company implemented an extensive restructuring effort that included cutting 14% of its workforce in March 2004.

  <p>
   After much deliberation, the company's majority shareholder, German utility

   , sold its 50% interest in Heidelberg in mid-2004. Also that year the company sold its Heidelberg Web Systems subsidiary to its main competitor in the web-offset press machinery market,
   <company id="51319">
    Goss International
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company sold its Linotype subsidiary to Monotype Imaging, an international supplier of type fonts and font technologies to graphics professionals, software developers, and manufacturers of computer printers and display devices. Linotype would function from its base in Germany as a wholly owned subsidiary of Monotype.
  </p>
  <p>
   Heidelberg sold its mailroom supplier, IDAB WAMAC International, to Schur International in 2008.
