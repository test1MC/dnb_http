   DoALL's Sawing division makes metal-cutting instruments of bi-metal (carbon steel backing); tungsten carbide (for use on alloys); carbon steel (for greater flexibility); and grit-edge (to cut hardened steels and brittle materials such as glass, silicon, and quartz); among others. Its line of sawing machines includes general purpose (fixed or swivel head); vertical contour (for cutting plastic, wood, and fibrous materials); miter cutting; and production power saws (numerical control or automatic). This division also produces cutting fluids, such as synthetics (water soluble), semi-synthetics (water soluble with lubrication), soluble oils (for tool life and surface finish), and direct application fluids (applied directly to cutting tool edge).
