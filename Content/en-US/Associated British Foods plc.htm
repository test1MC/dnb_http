   They say man cannot live on bread alone, so foodstuffs producer Associated British Foods also sells clothes, tea, sugar and cereals. ABF's bread-baking operation is its oldest function, but it makes the biggest chunk of its money from clothes - the company owns low-cost high-street fashion chain
   <company id="135120">
    Primark
   </company>
   . ABF also makes and markets grocery products, sugar, ingredients, and agricultural products. Its grocery lines include household staples Allinson, Tip Top, Karo syrup, Argo corn starch, Kingsmill bread, Silver Spoon sugar, and Twinings tea. In the US, it owns
   <company id="131747">
    Fleischmanns Yeast
   </company>
   , and ingredient and spice maker
   <company id="109702">
    ACH
   </company>
   . Other divisions churn out sugar, specialty oils, and animal feed. ABF's activities span nearly 48 countries worldwide.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ABF's business is divided up into Groceries, Agriculture, Sugar, Ingredients and Retail. Several of the segments are customers of each other - for instance, part of the Sugar division's output is sold under the Groceries segment as Silver Spoon. Groceries, responsible for around 25% of sales, manufactures products including hot beverages, sugar, oils and baked goods. The similarly sized Agriculture and Ingredients segments (around 10% of sales each) manufacture animal feed and bakery ingredients respectively. Food-related activities comprise 60% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, despite its focus on food, ABF's largest segment by revenue is Retail. The segment owns low-cost high-street chain Primark, which pulls in around 40% of total sales and has sites in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and France, and the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells to more than 100 countries worldwide and has operations in 48 countries across Europe, southern Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia. The UK accounts for about 43% of sales, the highest globally, followed by Europe and Africa, which together accounted for 32% of sales in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first Primark store in the US opened in Boston in 2016, with 11 openings planned by year-end.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company's branded products are sold through supermarkets and other retail outlets, and it also sells wholesale. To keep expenses down, Primark neither has an online offering nor operates any significant marketing function. It relies on word-of-mouth for brand awareness.

   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales declined in 2015 by £143 million to £12.8 billion, mostly due to a fall in global commodity prices and the subsequent impact on sugar earnings. However, a rise in retail sales, driven by strong and continued growth in Primark helped mitigate the decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell in 2015 for the first time since 2011, down a third to £524 million. This was mostly due to the fall in earnings related to low sugar prices, but a £98 million non-cash charge to majority-owned Vivergo Fuel due to a decline in biofuel prices also contributed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities fell £273 million to £1.1 billion, in line with the fall in revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ABF is vulnerable to sugar prices, and the Sugar division's profits rise and fall in line with the commodity. To combat this volatility, ABF has secured lower future sugar beet (i.e. input) costs, and closed two unprofitable factories in China. The diversity of its operations also help mitigate price fluctuations, with Primark key to this.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, in recent years Primark has been the most successful segment by a distance, and as a result is the focus of investment activities. ABF increased the low-cost chain's floor space by 9%, or 1 million square feet, mostly in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The first store in the US opened in 2015, hoped to be the first of many. The company also invested heavily in supply-side infrastructure and warehouse capacity, particularly in the Czech Republic and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Grocery businesses are given leeway to operate independently. For instance, Ryvita's growth strategy is to focus on growth in core markets, while AB World Foods is looking to move into new markets and expand in developing ones.

  <p>
   In 2015, ABF acquired BP's 47% stake in Vivergo Fuels, in which ABF already had a 47% stake, taking the total to 94%. It hopes that the biofuels business will be better placed to focus on cane sugar for ethanol production in Brazil. The plant in the north of England produces about half of the UK's biofuel needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company acquired fast-growing Dorset Cereals, a high-end muesli brand for the health conscious, for £50 million, expanding its presence in the specialty cereals market.

  <p>
   When Garfield Weston took over his father's company upon the elder Weston's death in 1924,
   <company id="41280">
    George Weston Limited
   </company>
   was one of Canada's largest bakeries. Ten years later, taking advantage of the cheap prices afforded by a worldwide depression, Garfield purchased a biscuit-making division from Scottish baker Mitchell &amp; Muir and opened a factory in Edinburgh. He promptly purchased other UK bakeries and grouped them in 1935 as Allied Bakeries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Allied went public that year, with the Weston family controlling most of its shares. The company's early accomplishments included the introduction of sliced bread to the UK. By 1940 Allied had acquired more than 30 bakeries and had become Britain's largest baker by introducing inexpensive biscuits to the masses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Garfield's son Garry joined Allied's board of directors in 1948. The following year the company acquired two Australian firms: Gold Crust Bakeries and Gartelle White. It also bought the Ryvita Company, a maker of crispbread. Placed under Garry's control, Ryvita eventually became a household name in the UK. Garry also helped the Burton's biscuit division launch the popular Wagon Wheels chocolate biscuits in 1951. Three years later he was sent to Australia to oversee the company's operations there.
  </p>
  <p>
   To control the entire food-selling process, Allied moved into retailing during the 1950s, acquiring famous London department store
   <company id="125424">
    Fortnum &amp; Mason
   </company>
   (later acquired by the Weston family). The company was renamed Associated British Foods (ABF) in 1960. During the 1960s ABF opened Primark clothing stores and bought the Fine Fare chain of supermarkets. By the time Garry returned to the UK to become CEO in 1966, his father had thrown together a number of businesses that made everything from flour to parrot food. To achieve a stronger focus, Garry sold many of these.
  </p>
  <p>
   Growth continued internally. In 1970 ABF opened the largest bakery in Western Europe in Glasgow, Scotland. Frozen foods were added in 1978, the year Garfield died. The company's Twinings Tea subsidiary opened its first North American factory in 1980. Two years later ABF formed AB Ingredients to make new ingredients and additives for baked goods. The company sold the Fine Fare chain to Dee Corp. (now
   <company id="57886">
    Somerfield
   </company>
   ) in 1986, and the following year it formed AB Technology to develop high-tech improvements for food processing.
  </p>
  <p>
   After nearly 25 years without a major acquisition, in 1991 the company purchased British Sugar, one of the UK's two sugar processors, from Berisford, a diversified holdings firm. In 1995 the company acquired AC Humko, a manufacturer of specialty oils in the US, from
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   . The next year ABF sold its supermarkets in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland to the UK's biggest supermarket chain,
   <company id="90426">
    Tesco
   </company>
   . Peter Jackson was appointed CEO in 1999. That year the company acquired German baking ingredients producer Rohr Enzymes and bought several mills from Dalgety Feed.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 ABF sold its UK ice-cream business to
   <company id="102066">
    Richmond Foods (now R&amp;R Ice Cream)
   </company>
   . Deputy chairman Harry Bailey took over as chairman when Garry became ill. ABF sold Burtons Biscuits (Wagon Wheels) that year to investment firm
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital Partners
   </company>
   (then called Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst) for about $187 million, and it bought several
   <company id="11211">
    Procter &amp; Gamble
   </company>
   commercial shortening and oil brands. In 2001 ABF sold AB Coatings, its food coatings business, and Nelsons, its jam and preserves business. Also that year the company agreed to buy the UK bakery ingredients business of the
   <company id="91314">
    Kerry Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 ABF's subsidiary, ACH Food Companies, purchased 19 of
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   's North American brands, including Mazola corn oil, Argo and Kingsford's corn starches, Karo corn syrup, and Henri's salad dressings. Also in 2002 ABF acquired the food and beverages business of
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   , with the exception of Puerto Rican and US assets. (Brands included Caotina, Ovomaltine, and Ovaltine.) Later in the year the company sold off its Allied Glass Containers business to management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 ABF sold six UK flour mills to
   <company id="10124">
    Archer Daniels Midland
   </company>
   . In 2004 the company acquired Unilever's Mexican oils and fats brands, including Inca, Mazola, and Capullo, in a $110 million cash transaction. Later that year it acquired Irish feed ingredients companies Vistavet and Nutrition Services Ltd. ABF's subsidiary ACH Food Companies also acquired the global yeast, herbs, and spice businesses of Australian company
   <company id="53766">
    Burns, Philp
   </company>
   . The acquisition included Burns, Philp's
   <company id="131747">
    Fleischmann's Yeast
   </company>
   brand and herb and spice company Tone Brothers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 chief executive Peter Jackson unexpectedly announced he was stepping down. A member of ABF's founding and controlling family, George Weston, was chosen to succeed Jackson. (The Weston family also controls Canadian food processor and supermarket operator
   <company id="41280">
    George Weston Limited
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   ABF's Allied Grain unit formed a joint venture with
   <company id="135892">
    Banks Cargill Agriculture
   </company>
   , Frontier, in 2005. Frontier's products include grains and oilseeds. The 2005 purchase of retailer
   <company id="57987">
    Littlewoods'
   </company>
   stores added to ABF's Primark retail department-store operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 AFB bought the ethnic foods business of
   <company id="10693">
    Heinz
   </company>
   subsidiary, HP Foods; it also acquired a 51% stake in South Africa's largest sugar producer, Illovo, for $599 million in cash. The next year, it acquired Indian food maker, Patak's. Its meal-accompaniment products, Blue Dragon and Westmill Foods add to ABF's other ethnic cuisine offerings. The acquisition included Patak's assets and brands in all countries with the exception of India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Already a player in the breakfast-food sector both in the US and internationally, in 2007 the company added to its branded food product offerings with the acquisition of
   <company id="134897">
    Jordans
   </company>
   , a UK maker of breakfast cereals, cereal bars, muesli, and oat porridge.
