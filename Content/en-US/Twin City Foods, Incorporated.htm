   Some might say that Twin City Foods is more important to their children's health than a pediatrician. The company is one of the largest independent processors of private-label frozen vegetables in the US. Its four processing plants in Michigan and Washington strategically neighbor major growing fields. The company boasts more than 200 million pounds of onsite cold storage capacity; it can pack and ship a variety of beans, carrots, corn, and peas for both domestic and international customers. Twin City Foods serves food manufacturers, as well as foodservice operators and retail supermarkets. It also supplies frozen goods for the organic food market. The family-owned company was started by Arne Lervick in 1943.

   Vertically-integrated Twin City Foods is involved in frozen vegetable production from planting to harvesting to freezing and packaging. It locates its processing plants close to growing fields to minimize the time between when raw product arrives and it's frozen, preserving nutrition and freshness. The vegetable processor is looking to fuel growth by developing specialty blends and line extensions coupled with more convenient cooking processes. Twin City Foods holds the trademark for Steam Smart, a cook-in-the-bag method for vegetables and other foods promoted for healthy eating.

   The company in 2013 broke ground on a $1.75 million expansion of its food processing plant in Pasco, Washington, to provide an additional 32,000-sq.-ft. of storage space.
