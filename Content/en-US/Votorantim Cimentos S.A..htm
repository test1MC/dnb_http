   If you build it in Brazil, Votorantim Cimentos will probably come. The company, Brazil's largest manufacturer of cement, also makes and sells aggregates, concrete, lime, and mortar. Votorantim Cimentos supplies such large-scale construction projects as office buildings, bridges, and hydroelectric dams. Its other products include such building materials as concrete blocks, paving stones, and roof tiles. A subsidiary of industrial conglomerate

   , the company operates 27 plants in Brazil and five in North America. It produces as much as 52 million tons of cement annually. In 2013 Votorantim Cimentos filed and withdrew an IPO in the US, citing unfavorable market conditions.

  <p>
   The company planned to raise up to $5.4 billion and use the proceeds for strategic expansion, including the acquisition of assets outside Brazil, for adding a more diversified range of products within Brazil, and for general corporate purposes.

  <p>
   Votorantim Cimentos manufactures more than one-third of the cement produced in Brazil, which is in turn the largest cement-producing country in Latin America. Through subsidiaries it also makes about a third of the cement used in Chile and more than a fifth of that in Argentina. Branches have also been established in Asia and the Mediterranean basin (a surprising fifth of the market is supplied in Tunisia). The company began to pursue inroads in the North American cement market in 2007. It's had the most success in the area around the Great Lakes, roughly from Illinois northeastwards to Ontario. Another outpost has been staked in Florida.

   Between 2010 and 2012 the revenues of Votorantim Cimentos increased annually by about 9%. In contrast, its net income sagged about 70% between 2010 and 2011, and though a 90% rebound appeared the next year, it still fell far short of the 2010 amount. Acquisitions, Brazilian inflationary pressures, increased costs for freight and electricity, and foreign-exchange losses were responsible factors.

  <p>
   Votorantim Cimentos operates throughout its home country and maintains quarries and cement plants near various population centers. Continuing upgrades to its Brazilian manufacturing base are planned and made regularly, and energy costs should fall with the increased use of alternative fuels. Increases in sales of aggregates and ready-mix concrete are seen as key to the diversification of its product portfolio. As the US economy improves, the company expects to ramp up to produce at its plants there for the first time at the level originally planned.
