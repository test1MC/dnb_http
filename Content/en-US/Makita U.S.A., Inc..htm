  <p>
   After a steep decline in sales in 2010 due to decreased demand for power tools as a result of the collapse in the housing market, Makita's sales in North America have increased in each of the past four years. North America accounted for 14% of its Japanese parent company's consolidated sales in fiscal 2014 (ended March), or Â¥49.9 billion ($489.7 million). Sales increased 20% in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year. However, the double-digit increase in sales reflects the sharp decline in value of the yen versus the US dollar. Indeed, while increasing demand for housing in the US drove demand for tools, sales in the US declined due to the severe cold snap in the US toward the end of fiscal 2014.
