  <p>
   In 1913 George Heath transformed an abandoned horse-drawn tram depot in Birmingham, UK, into a Ford dealership. Heath's business grew to include other makes of cars such as Austin, Rootes, and Rolls-Royce, and in the 1920s Heath sold the company to Rootes. The new company was called Bristol Street Motors.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Henry Cressman bought Bristol Street Motors in 1939. During WWII the company ceased selling cars and operated as a government-contracted repair shop. After the war, Bristol Street Motors resumed selling cars -- a lot of them. After years of shortages and bombings, a new Ford was just what the doctor ordered.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bristol Street Motors went public in 1959 and acquired other dealerships. It changed its name to Bristol Street Group Limited in 1963. In 1965 Bristol Street Group acquired the Vauxhall dealership and its L.A. Rumbold subsidiary, which marked Bristol Street's entrance into the aircraft seating market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a move that placed Bristol Street in several new markets (including automotive components), Bristol Street acquired Griffiths Bentley &amp; Co. in 1973. The following year the company changed its name to BSG International Ltd.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the late 1970s BSG was feeling the pain of the oil crisis and worldwide recession, causing the company to scale down operations. As the economy began to recover in the 1980s, BSG found itself undercapitalized. To raise cash, it made a one-for-one rights issue and used the capital to buy Adams &amp; Gibbon in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   The following year BSG bought Australia-based Rainsfords Metal Products, adding vehicle mirrors and children's car safety seats to its product line. In 1987 BSG bought two more Australian companies, both of which made strollers and baby furniture.
  </p>
  <p>
   BSG joined a unit of Daimler Aerospace to form aircraft lavatory maker Dasell in 1991. The company began restructuring in 1994 by selling noncore assets and buying ones that complemented its focus on vehicle systems, aircraft seats, and childcare safety products. BSG changed its name to Britax International plc in 1997 and disposed of its vehicle-leasing unit the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Britax divested its 50% share of Vega (automotive lighting) in 1999. The next year Britax purchased Hexcel Corporation's Seattle-based Bellingham aircraft interiors division. Britax acquired 70% of Poong Jeong, a South Korean maker of interior automobile mirrors, and the company sold its rearview mirror operations to Rietter &amp; Schefenacker GmbH (Germany).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company announced that it was in talks with Bank of Scotland Private Equity and Schroder Ventures concerning the possible sale of Britax; in August the company was a acquired by Seton House Acquisition Ltd. (an MBO vehicle).
