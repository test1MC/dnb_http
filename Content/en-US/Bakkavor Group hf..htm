   To sharpen its focus on catering to the UK, its primary market, the company has been selling other units in other countries. In early 2014 it sold Spring Valley Foods, a prepared fruit business in South Africa, to In2food Group. Months earlier Bakkavör sold Heli Food Fresh, its former Czech ready meals business, to Yazico Investments Ltd and Axentia Financial Consultants Ltd.

   In mid-2012 Bakkavör opened its new facility at Caledonian Produce in West Lothian, Scotland. The state-of-the-art facility specializes in the handling and production of nut-based products in the UK.
