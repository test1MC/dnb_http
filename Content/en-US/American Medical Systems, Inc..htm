Other products treat such conditions as menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding), enlarged prostate, and fecal incontinence. AMS has around 80 independent distributors in addition to a global sale and marketing force of about 500 employees. Marketing efforts target urologists, gynecologists, and colorectal surgeons. A subsidiary of
   <company id="100352">
    Endo International
   </company>
   , AMS sold its men's and prostate health businesses to
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   . in mid-2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AMS focuses on providing technology solutions to physicians treating men's and women's pelvic health conditions and operates in the following business lines: men's health, women's health, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH or prostate health) therapy.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has offices or affiliates in about 70 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of AMS' development activity occurs at its California and Minnesota facilities, but it also works with research hospitals and universities in the US and abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounted for 64% of the company's revenues in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AMS distributes devices through its direct sales force and independent sales representatives in the US, Canada, Australia and Western Europe. Additionally, AMS distributes devices through foreign independent distributors, primarily in Europe, Asia, and South America, who then sell the products to medical institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though most people don't want to talk or even think about the products AMS sells, plenty of people need them. Most of AMS' products are bought by hospitals that are dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care and private care plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of that, AMS is indirectly affected by changes to reimbursement levels, because as they drop, hospitals' income drops, and they delay purchases of AMS' products.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMS spends a certain amount of its income each year to educate the industry about its products and why they are needed.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AMS posted more than $492 million in sales in 2013 (a decrease of 2% over 2012) due to lower sales in the women's health line,  particularly of  pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair procedures, which was partially offset by an increase in the men's health business due to increased volumes.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMS accounted for 19% of its parent company's total revenues in 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Crucial to AMS' growth strategy is new product development. Many of AMS' developments are next-generation versions of best-sellers that were remade with additional features for ease-of-use or comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
   AMS focuses on the pelvic health market and its ability to develop new products and innovative procedures, obtain regulatory clearance, maintain regulatory compliance, protect its intellectual property, protect the proprietary technology of its products and manufacturing processes and maintain and develop preference for its products among physicians and patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a major deal announced in 2015,
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   has agreed to buy AMS' men's and prostate health businesses for $1.6 billion plus a potential $50 million (based on 2016 sales). AMS parent Endo is considering strategic alternatives for the company's women's health operations.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
  <p>
   AMS was acquired by Endo Pharmaceuticals (renamed
   <company id="100352">
    Endo International
   </company>
   ) in 2011 for $2.9 billion. With AMS' portfolio added to its own, Endo became better positioned to offer a diverse range of health care products, reducing each single company's reliance on a specific product line for it income.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 AMS consolidated its laser therapy manufacturing capacity by moving its Arizona operations to California. It made moves to increase efficiencies even further in 2011 by using a third-party warehouse and distribution center for certain finished goods in the US.
