   Burt's Bees wants to mind its own beeswax, but sting the competition. The company makes and markets lip balm, bath oils, soaps, and about 170 other personal care products made from beeswax, nut oils, and other natural ingredients. Its products are sold through the Burt's Bees website, as well as through some 30,000 health food and grocery stores located in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It launched the eco-fun güd brand in 2012 to bring Millennials onboard. The company was founded in Maine in 1984 when Roxanne Quimby met reclusive beekeeper Burt Shavitz and they began making candles and lip balm from his beeswax. Burt's Bees is owned by cleaning-products-giant

    The Clorox Company
   </company>
   purchased Burt's Bees for $925 million in cash in 2007 in a bid to diversify and capitalize on the growth rate (about 9% at the time) in the natural products sector. Clorox retained the Burt's Bees headquarters in North Carolina.

  <p>
   Burt's Bees makes 95% of its products at its manufacturing plan in Durham, North Carolina. Its products are sold in 36 countries worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Burt's Bees is part of Clorox's Lifestyle and International business segments alongside other big-name brands Brita (water filters), KC Masterpiece (barbecue sauce), and Hidden Valley (salad dressing). The Lifestyle segment generated about 17% of parent Clorox's $5.6 billion in sales in fiscal 2013 (ended June). The International segment accounted for 21% of sales during the reporting period.

   Burt's Bees peddles its products through a variety of retailers, including independent pharmacies, grocery stores, health food stores, and gift shops, as well as through major chains and online.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Burt's Bees business is somewhat seasonal. It generates slightly more than half of its annual net sales during the months of October through March.

   Under Clorox, Burt's Bees is expanding internationally into countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe. In fiscal 2013, for instance, it focused on extending the reach of the Burt's Bees brand to the Middle East and North Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The natural products company is also adding new brands to its portfolio. In 2012 Burt's Bees added the güd brand of eco-friendly personal care products in an effort to serve the Millennial generation, which aims to make earth-conscious purchasing decisions. Through a licensing agreement with Ayablu, Burt's Bees rolled out a line of natural and organic baby items nationwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   More recently, Clorox has been looking to its Burt's Bees subsidiary for its expertise in e-commerce. About 10% of the company's sales in the US come from e-commerce, compared with less than 2% for Clorox's overall sales. Also, innovation in lip care products drove sales growth for Burt's Bees in 2013.
