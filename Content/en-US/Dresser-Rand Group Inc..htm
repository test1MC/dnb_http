   Dresser-Rand is a leading maker of industrial rotating equipment that includes steam and gas turbines, centrifugal and reciprocating compressors, hot gas expanders, and control systems. It makes new and replacement units and offers aftermarket repair and upgrades for its own and third-party products. Dresser-Rand serves customers in the oil and gas, power, and chemical and petrochemical markets through 14 manufacturing and nearly 50 service facilities in about 30 countries. The majority of its sales come from energy infrastructure and oilfield projects. In mid-2015 Dresser-Rand was acquired by electronics and engineering giant
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   .

   In mid-2015 Dresser-Rand was bought by global industrial, engineering, and electronics giant
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   in a transaction valued at $7.6 billion. Siemens continues to operate Dresser-Rand as its oil and gas business and retain the Dresser-Rand brand name. The deal gave Siemens a more significant presence in Houston, which became the headquarters location of the oil and gas business of Siemens.

   As part of the Siemens, Dresser-Rand offers an equipment portfolio that includes turbo and reciprocating compressors, steam turbines, industrial and aero-derivative gas turbines, high-speed engines, and modular power substations.

  <p>
   Dresser-Rand operates through manufacturing facilities in Brazil, France, Germany, India, Spain, Norway, the UK, and the US. Its network of nearly 50 service and support centers spans more than 150 countries.

  <p>
   The company's core customers primarily come from the upstream (exploring and extracting), midstream (storing, marketing, and transporting), and downstream (refining and processing) segments of the oil and gas market. Dresser-Rand is targeting emerging markets such as alternative energy and environmental services for growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, it sees the aftermarket parts and service business as a way to weather the cyclical oil industry by providing a recurring revenue stream. (Customers tend to spend less on capital equipment when times are tough, opting instead to upgrade their existing base of installed equipment.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Dresser-Rand generally seeks multiyear contracts and preferred-partner supply agreements for products and services rather than individual purchase arrangements. It uses a flexible manufacturing model, in which it relies on suppliers to help adjust production up or down as demand dictates.

  <p>
   Before it agreed to be acquired by Siemens in 2014, Dresser-Rand planned to expand its aftermarket parts segment to include more non-Dresser-Rand equipment, to expand into emerging markets (such as Brazil, China, India, and countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East), to introduce new products and technologies, and to grow its alliances.
