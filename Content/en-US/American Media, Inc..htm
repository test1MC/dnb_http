   These publications cover some American obsessions: celebrity gossip and good health. American Media is the nation's top publisher of tabloid newspapers and magazines, including
   <em>
    National Enquirer
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Star
   </em>
   . The company also publishes women's health magazine
   <em>
    Shape
   </em>
   , as well as a number of other magazines including
   <em>
    Flex, Men's Fitness
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Natural Health
   </em>
   . In addition to publishing its own titles, American Media also distributes and markets other publishers' periodicals. The company is owned by a group of investment firms including
   <company id="109881">
    Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co.
   </company>
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   American Media sells its magazine worldwide, although the US and Canada are its primary markets. The company offers distribution and marketing services to other publishers to get their periodicals in the racks at supermarkets throughout the US and Canada.

  <p>
   The company reported revenue of $245 million in fiscal 2015. That was a decrease of almost $100 million (or 29%) in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior fiscal year. The drop in revenue resulted in American Media reporting a net loss of more than $27 million in fiscal 2014, although that was an improvement of about $27 million compared to the $54 million net loss the company suffered in fiscal 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   During fiscal 2015 the company's cash inflows increased by 30% to $12.71 million compared to $9.79 million in fiscal 2014.

   With the magazine and newspaper industries in decline, the company's publications are struggling to remain viable in the era of Internet blogs and expanding choices on cable television. American Media transformed its core publications
   <em>
    Star
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    National Enquirer
   </em>
   into celebrity gossip papers, but that niche is quickly being dominated by online and multimedia operators such as
   <company id="159521">
    TMZ
   </company>
   and
   <company id="148341">
    Gawker Media
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Generoso Pope Jr. bought the weekly
   <i>
    New York Evening Enquirer
   </i>
   in 1952, changed it into a tabloid, added unusual news items, and gave it a more national focus. It was renamed
   <i>
    National Enquirer
   </i>
   in 1957. Pope died in 1988, and Macfadden Holdings (publisher of such magazines as
   <i>
    True Confessions
   </i>
   ) and Boston Ventures bought the company the next year. In 1990 they formed American Media and acquired the
   <i>
    Star;
   </i>
   a year later American Media went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Macfadden Holdings and Boston Ventures were rebuffed in a $315 million LBO that would have taken the company private again. Advertising cuts and increased coverage of celebrities on TV and by other magazines caused circulation to slide, but the O. J. Simpson trial boosted sales by 15%-20% for both the
   <i>
    Enquirer
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Star.
   </i>
  </p>
  <p>
   Soft circulation continued in 1996, but a price increase helped revenues. In 1997 many retailers limited the tabloid content they would sell, following the death (allegedly caused by paparazzi) of Diana, Princess of Wales. Echoing their concern, new editor Steve Coz said the
   <i>
    Enquirer
   </i>
   would scale back its lurid content.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the first half of 1998, circulation fell about 15% for both the
   <i>
    Enquirer
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Star.
   </i>
   American Media that year introduced its first newsletter,
   <i>
    HealthPlus,
   </i>
   in an effort to diversify.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 American Media ceased publication of
   <i>
    Soap Opera News
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Soap Opera Magazine,
   </i>
   both massive money pits, and sold the magazines' trademarks to
   <company id="40258">
    PRIMEDIA
   </company>
   . Later that year
   <company id="99628">
    Evercore Partners
   </company>
   bought the company, and David Pecker, the former head of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines (now part of
   <company id="92826">
    Lagard√®re Active Media
   </company>
   ), took over as CEO. Pecker initiated a makeover for the
   <i>
    Enquirer
   </i>
   to give it a more newsy look, attracting large advertisers such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company also launched
   <i>
    National Enquirer TV
   </i>
   (renamed
   <i>
    National Enquirer's Uncovered
   </i>
   in 2000) and bought rival Globe Communications for about $105 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Media launched two new titles, Spanish-language tabloid
   <i>
    Mira!
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    AMI AutoWorld Weekly,
   </i>
   in 2000. Also that year it acquired
   <i>
    Country Music Magazine,
   </i>
   giving the company the two best-selling titles in the country music category. The anthrax scare touched American Media in 2001 when spores were found in company headquarters and an employee died from anthrax. The local health department quarantined the company's headquarters for an additional 18 months in 2002. The company relocated to a building two blocks away and sold the contaminated building.
  </p>
  <p>
   Facing a difficult newsstand market, Pecker announced in fall 2003 plans to cut 7% of the staff, about 70 positions, mainly in the legal, manufacturing, and editorial departments. That same year, American Media moved to expand its publishing operations by acquiring several health and fitness publications from Weider Publications, including
   <em>
    Muscle &amp; Fitness, Shape
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Flex
   </em>
   , for $350 million. It also hired
   <em>
    Us Weekly
   </em>
   editor Bonnie Fuller to revamp
   <em>
    Star
   </em>
   and build credibility at its publications. (Due to declining sales, she was bumped up to the corporate executive ranks as chief of editorial operations and relieved of her duties at the tabloid after just 16 months; she resigned in 2008.)
  </p>
  <p>
   American Media formed a joint venture with Integrity Multimedia in 2008 to acquire the website
   <company id="119570">
    Radar Online
   </company>
   as part of an effort to boost its online publishing operations. The following year, however, the company was forced to restructure its mounting debt by selling a 95% stake to a group of bondholders including
   <company id="109881">
    Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co.
   </company>
   The move helped the company avoid bankruptcy. American Media eventually did file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2010 before emerging at the end of the year after restructuring its debt through a revolving credit agreement.
