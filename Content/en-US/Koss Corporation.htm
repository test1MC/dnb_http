   Koss makes sure you can turn up the volume without disturbing the neighbors. The company makes stereo headphones, or "stereophones," and related accessories for consumers and audio professionals. Its lineup includes full-size, noise-cancellation, portable, earbud, and wireless headphones. Products are sold through more than 17,000 US retail outlets, including specialty audio stores, discount stores, and mass merchandisers, as well as by catalogs and online merchants. The company also produces classical music recordings through its Koss Classics subsidiary. In addition to its US operations, Koss has an international sales office in Switzerland. Founded by John Koss, the firm has roots reaching back to the 1950s.

  <p>
   John Koss started the Koss company with $200 in 1953 to rent refurbished televisions to hospital patients. A passionate entrepreneur, he invented stereo headphones five years later, making the first set out of a wire hanger, two plastic cups, and a pair of three-inch speakers. To make the best product he could, he sought the input of respected performers of the day such as Dizzy Gillespie and Tony Bennett. The company went public in 1966.

   In the late 1970s Koss made an ill-fated decision to diversify. By the early 1980s the company had begun to manufacture stereo radios and tape players but could not compete in those areas. The company halved its salaried workforce in 1983 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year. After this setback, Koss stopped making tape players and changed its manufacturing system from an assembly line to a cell structure, organizing production into efficient work teams. It emerged from bankruptcy in late 1985. John's son Michael became president in 1987 and CEO in 1991. In 1988 Michael formed Koss Classics to produce classical music recordings.

   To generate cash, the firm licensed its name to Dutch trading company Hagermeyer in 1992 to sell noncompetitive audio products in North and South America (the deal ended in 1997).
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales dropped in 1995 because of a decline in computer speaker sales and due to losses from its Canadian subsidiary, Koss Ltd., which was later closed. In 1998 the company shifted production of Koss computer speakers to Canadian licensee Logitech Electronics -- fiscal 1999 sales fell as a result -- and it expanded a licensing agreement with Jiangsu Electronics for car stereos and other products.

   In 2000 Koss introduced a line of headphones designed specifically for prison inmates; the headphones are made with translucent plastic (and don't contain any metal). In 2001 Koss experienced a loss in sales from licensing agreements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired hands-free communications headset maker ADDAX Sound (renamed Bi-Audio) in 2003, allowing Koss to broaden its market to include wireless products. Bi-Audio products are sold primarily to police, fire, and security workers for use with two-way radios.
