   Salon Media Group (formerly Salon.com) hopes to satisfy sophisticated Web surfers weary of run-of-the-mill Internet schlock. The company that garnered attention for essays by the likes of Camille Paglia and Allen Barra has expanded from its original online magazine format. Salon.com's content includes news, features, interviews, columns, and blogs covering topics such as politics, business, technology, books, sports, and arts and entertainment. Revenues come from advertising and subscription fees. Salon.com and its online communities (Table Talk and The Well) attract more than six million unique visitors a month.

   Journalism veterans David Talbot, Andrew Ross, and David Zweig founded Salon Internet in 1995. Targeting a literate audience attracted to highbrow content, the trio launched Web-based Salon Magazine with financial backing from Adobe Ventures,
   <company id="12644">
    Apple Computer
   </company>
   , and Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
  </p>
  <p>
   With essays by Camille Paglia and an interactive Table Talk section, Salon soon caught the eyes of the mainstream media.

   magazine selected Salon as the best website of 1996. Michael O'Donnell, a consumer software executive, became president and publisher that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Salon's coverage of the death of Princess Diana in 1997 brought a cluster of new visitors to its website. By the end of the year, the company had attracted additional financial backing from Japanese publisher ASCII Corporation and
   <company id="42887">
    Borders Group
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   With inquiries into the dealings of President Clinton dominating the headlines in 1998, Salon began delving into investigative pieces. Its coverage of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation helped usher Salon into the spotlight. The company secured 1998 distribution agreements with
   <company id="15558">
    America Online
   </company>
   , the Go Network (now
   <company id="43304">
    Walt Disney Internet Group
   </company>
   ), and CNN Interactive.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Salon expanded from its original magazine format and began offering a variety of websites. O'Donnell became CEO that year, and the company also bought subscription-based online community The Well. Salon also bought the rights to the salon.com URL from a Texas beauty-store operator (the magazine had previously operated under a variety of URLs).
  </p>
  <p>
   After changing its name to Salon.com, the company went public in 1999 using a Dutch auction allowing potential shareholders to bid for shares. Salon.com subsequently made its content available to users of wireless devices and inked a deal with Rainbow Media Holdings (now known as
   <company id="103270">
    AMC Networks
   </company>
   ) to develop television content.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired MP3Lit.com, a website offering spoken work and audio literature recordings, in 2000. Later that year Salon.com used the content it acquired through the MP3Lit.com purchase to create audio download website Salon Audio. The company also did a little belt-tightening and cut its staff by 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Salon.com launched a subscription-based service to deliver premium content and changed its name to Salon Media Group. Later that year, Salon decided to make more of its once-free content available only to subscribers, including its news and political articles.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 in the face of a $76 million debt, the company announced that without new funding it would have to cease operations. Months later a small loan breathed new life into the company. In 2003 O'Donnell left to pursue other interests after seven years with the company. Talbot became the next CEO, but left that position in 2005. He was replaced by Elizabeth Hambrecht.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2004 Salon received more funding from
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   founder and editor Jann Wenner (of
   <company id="43312">
    Wenner Media
   </company>
   ), as well as additional cash from Warnock. The investment resulted in Salon working together with
   <em>
    Rolling Stone
   </em>
   on stories dealing with the 2004 presidential election. Salon also hired Sidney Blumenthal (a former assistant to President Clinton) as a columnist and a consultant; he eventually became an executive in charge of editorial development.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 a growing number of subscribers and an increased share of the expanding Internet advertising market resulted in the company's first profitable quarter. However, in 2006 the company experienced a decline in Salon Premium paid subscriptions, possibly due to its Site Pass advertising model, which subjects users to lengthy online advertisements. Richard Gingras was appointed the new CEO in 2009. He left the company two years later to join Google.
