   Maxwell Technologies is more than capable of making products that store energy and deliver power, you might even say ultracapable. The company makes ultracapacitors, postage stamp-sized cells that are able to provide quick bursts of energy to meet power demands, then recharge by capturing excess power that would otherwise be lost. Its ultracapacitors are used to provide additional power for hybrid cars, electric trains, and semi-trucks, as well as in energy grid, solid-state memory, and other applications that need fast, reliable power. Maxwell also makes high-voltage capacitors that protect power grid systems and radiation-shielded microelectronics for satellites and spacecraft.

   Customers outside the US account for more than 80% of sales. Nearly half of its sales come from China and Germany. Maxwell has significant operations in Switzerland and the US (in San Diego); it also opened another, larger US production facility in Arizona. The company has sales offices in China, Germany, and the UK.

   In addition to direct sales, Maxwell sells through distributors that include

    Digi-Key

   ,
   <company id="41641">
    TTI
   </company>
   (and its Mouser Electronics unit), Tecate Group, RUTRONIK, and Bainacap.

   Maxwell's ultracapacitors are used in wind turbine blade-pitch systems to regulate voltage to the power grid. In data centers, the products provide the energy between power failures and the initiation of backup power systems such as diesel generators and fuel cells. In another application, the company announced that ShinMaywa Industries, a Japanese maker of special purpose trucks, designed Maxwell's ultracapacitors into the all-electric loading mechanism for garbage trucks to reduce noise and emissions during loading and unloading.

   Maxwell continues to seek opportunities in China, its largest market, where it has a contract manufacturing arrangements with Belton Technology Group and Tianjin Lishen Battery. Maxwell collaborates with Chinese companies to expand its presence in that burgeoning market, supplying ultracapacitor electrode materials to Shanghai Sanjui Electric Equipment and Yeong-Long Technologies. In China, the company must carefully guard its intellectual property rights, since some contract manufacturers will illegally copy a company's product and then sell it for less in export markets.
