   Dynavax Technologies is trying to reprogram the way the body reacts to disease. The firm focuses on immuno-oncology research, developing treatments for such diseases as metastatic melanoma and lung cancer. In early 2017 the company suspended manufacturing of former lead candidate HEPLISAV, a hepatitis B vaccine. Other candidates in the company's pipeline include a universal flu vaccine that would cover a wider span of flu viruses than traditional flu vaccines, as well as potential treatments for asthma, hepatitis C, and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To share the expense and risk of development, Dynavax has partnered with drugmakers including
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Materials used in the HEPLISAV trials have been produced at the company's German unit, Rhein Biotech (also known as Dynavax Europe), which also offers small-scale contract manufacturing services. If HEPLISAV is approved for use, the key antigens will be manufactured at the Dynavax Europe facility.

   In late 2016, the US FDA rejected Dynavax's experimental hepatitis B vaccine HEPLISAV for the second time. The company began seeking for a partner to help further the vaccine's development but was unable to secure one swiftly. Early the following year, Dynavax suspended the manufacturing of the vaccine, switching its focus to its immuno-oncology programs. As part of the major restructuring, the company also laid off 38% of its workforce. Dynavax still hopes to ultimately get HEPLISAV on the market.

   The company partners with

    AstraZeneca

   on its asthma research program and with

   on an early-stage autoimmune candidate targeting conditions such as lupus and psoriasis. The company also has an agreement with
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   through which Novartis supplies a key ingredient for (and has an option to co-develop) the universal flu vaccine. In addition, the

    National Institutes of Health
   </company>
   has provided grants to help fund several of the company's development programs over the years.
