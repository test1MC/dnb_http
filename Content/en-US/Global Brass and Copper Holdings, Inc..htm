   Global Brass and Copper Holdings (GBC) is okay knowing that not all that glitters is gold. Through its subsidiaries, GBC is a leading North American manufacturer and distributor of fabricated copper and copper-alloy products. The company's operations are divided into three segments: Olin Brass (fabricator of copper and brass sheet, strip, foil, and tubing), Chase Brass (manufacturer of brass rods used by OEMs to make valves, fittings, and other machining products), and A.J. Oster (distributor of copper-alloy products). GBC serves customers from a variety of sectors, including construction, automotive, coinage, electronics, and industrial manufacturing. Formed in 2007, the company went public in 2013.

  <p>
   Prior to the offering, GBC was owned by Halkos Holdings, an affiliate of private equity firm
   <company id="108940">
    KPS Capital Partners
   </company>
   . Through the affiliation, GBC was a KPS portfolio company, and KPS still owns more than 50% of GBC's voting rights now that it is a public company.

  <p>
   The company's revenues have fluctuated over the last several years. After increasing in 2013, revenues dipped 3% in 2014 due to lower metal prices and lower sales of unprocessed metal. The decrease in volume was primarily attributable to lower demand within the electronics/electrical components end market. This market has also suffered from customers sourcing their finished products offshore. Additionally, volume in the munitions end market was lower in 2014 as the result of de-stocking throughout the supply chain and reduced demand following an unprecedented peak in demand in 2013.
  </p>

   GBC's net income tripled from $10 million in 2013 to $32 million in 2014. The surge was mainly due to cost-cutting efforts and a significant decrease in salaries, benefits received, and professional fees. In addition, the company's operating cash flow has oscillated, decreasing in 2013 and spiking in 2014.

  <p>
   After experiencing declining net income over the years, GBC worked to cut costs across its manufacturing operations and supply chain during 2014. Within Olin Brass, the company strategically realigned its business to address operational underperformances at its East Alton strip facilities. In 2015 it also sold its 50% interest in a Japanese joint venture it previously owned.
