   Smurfit Kappa Group (SKG) is a world boxing champion. The firm is one of the world's top producers of corrugated boxes, graphicboard, and containerboard. It operates two segments: Europe and The Americas. The Europe segment runs mills and plants that manufacture containerboard that is converted into corrugated containers. The Americas segment conducts forestry, paper, corrugated, and folding carton activities across Latin America and oversees Mexico's Smurfit Kappa Orange County. SKG owns 350 production sites across 32 countries, as well as 103,000 hectares of plantations in Latin America. It maintains a Dublin headquarters and a pair of regional headquarters in Paris (for Europe) and Miami (for The Americas).

  <p>
   English tailor John Jefferson Smurfit began his career in box making as an advisor to a box maker that had been established in Dublin in 1934. In 1938, at the age of 29, he left his tailoring business in Belfast to fully control the Dublin company. Smurfit named it Jefferson Smurfit &amp; Sons Limited in 1942. By 1950 the plant had expanded fivefold in size, and production had increased eight times.
  </p>
  <p>
   After going public in 1964, the company went on a buying spree that included carton and box maker Temple Press Limited (1968), which doubled the company's size. Its size doubled again with the 1970 purchase of the Hely Group, a diversified company with holdings in packaging, radio and television distribution, and educational and office supplies. The company moved into the UK with its purchase of W. J. Noble and Sons (cartons and printing). In 1972 Jefferson Smurfit Group Limited became the company's name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding to overseas markets, the company bought 40% of US-based Time Industries (paper and plastics) in 1974, increased its share to 51% in 1976, and bought the rest in 1977 -- the same year Jefferson Smurfit's founder died. Jefferson Smurfit became full owner of Alton Box Board Company (US) in 1981. Two years later, in its effort to diversify, it formed Smurfit Paribas Bank, a joint venture with the French Bank Paribas. Also in 1983 the company established Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC) to oversee its US operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jefferson Smurfit diversified further with the 1984 purchase of a 76% stake in Executive Travel and full acquisition of Swains Packaging (plastic packaging). The company then moved into the newsprint business (1986), acquiring 80% of Publishers Paper Company (renamed Smurfit Newsprint Corporation). In a joint venture with
   <company id="15970">
    Morgan Stanley
   </company>
   Leveraged Equity Fund, Jefferson Smurfit purchased 50% of Mobil Oil's Container Corporation of America in 1986 for $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1988 Jefferson Smurfit bought Sonofit Containers Limited and renamed it Smurfit Fibreboard Converters. Purchases in 1989 included Rolex Paper (paper tubes, UK) and Cartonera Nacional (corrugated packaging, Puerto Rico). Already a leading recycler of wastepaper, Jefferson Smurfit bought California-based Golden State Newsprint and Pacific Recycling in 1990. In 1994 it added the paper and packaging operations of France's
   <company id="40729">
    Compagnie de Saint-Gobain
   </company>
   , doubling its European operations. The following year it bought Les Papeteries du Limousin of France (corrugated packaging). Jefferson Smurfit also entered the Asian market through a joint venture with a company in China to establish a linerboard mill through its JSC unit.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Jefferson Smurfit sold Swains Packaging and Smurfit Packaging Products to
   <company id="90076">
    British Polythene Industries
   </company>
   . The next year it bought majority shares in two Argentinian companies (paperboard and corrugated cases) and fully acquired two German trading companies (corrugated boxes and boards). It sold its Mexican Plastics division to Owens Illinois Group. JSC merged with Stone Container Corporation in 1998 to create the US's largest producer of containerboard,

    RockTenn PC
   </company>
   (originally known as Smurfit-Stone Container). Jefferson Smurfit owned about 30% of the public company, but the holding was later spun off to shareholders. In 1999 the company began disposing of noncore operations -- timberlands, newsprint holdings, and finance businesses (Smurfit Finance and Smurfit Paribas Bank). Jefferson Smurfit doubled its converting capacity in Argentina in 2000 by buying corrugated plant Fábrica Argentina de Cartón Corrugado (FACCA).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company placed a revised bid to buy Swedish paper company Munksjö as low paper prices in Europe led to an industry-wide devaluation. That June the shoe was on the other foot, however: US-based investment company
   <company id="98988">
    Madison Dearborn Partners
   </company>
   made a $3.5 billion cash bid for Jefferson Smurfit -- a 38% premium over where the stock was trading at the time -- and bought the company in July 2002. (Jefferson Smurfit did ultimately acquire Munksjö, too.)
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company acquired the European assets of its former US affiliate Smurfit-Stone Container in return for 50% of its Canadian unit and $200 million. Later that year, Jefferson Smurfit acquired 98% of Spanish paper company Papelera Navarra and changed the acquired company's name to
   <company id="103162">
    Smurfit Navarra
   </company>
   . In 2004, it acquired the remaining stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, the company changed its name to Smurfit Kappa Group after acquiring rival Kappa Packaging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sharing in the global economic slowdown, SKG struggled to maintain its paper prominence by trimming assets faster than adding them. The company disposed of its non-core, non-productive businesses including newsprint, timberlands, and finance holdings. SKG exited the tissue and specialties business, dropping

   </company>
   in 2005. In 2008 the Group unloaded its 40% stake in the corrugated and containerboard manufacturer Duropack, and its ownership in the UK educational publisher EDCO.
