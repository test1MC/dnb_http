   While candy sales are important to Topps, traditional baseball cards are its primary product. A pack of Topps baseball cards includes 12 cards and generally costs about $2. The company also sells sets of packs containing some 660 cards, which cost about $60. Cards are sold through the company's website and at hobby stores. Sets are randomly packaged, so there's no guarantee which players you'll get. The company also issues several special editions a year for collectors to purchase and set aside for safekeeping.

  <p>
   The company continues to expand in all areas of the business. Topps continues to satisfy card collectors by maintaining its relationships with major sports organizations. The company enjoys a multiyear trading card licensing agreement with the NFL, last inked in 2010. The previous year, Topps won exclusive rights to use the logos for the MLB and its teams.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2013 Topps has been busy helping to develop a new Mysticons action series targeting boys ages 6 to 11. Developed through a partnership with Corus Entertainment's Nelvana Enterprises, Mysticons will come to life as 26 22-minute animated series produced by Nelvana Studio and written by Sean Jara, who's written RedaKai and The League of Super Evil.

  <p>
   Topps hasn't been particularly acquisitive in recent years. Its last two acquisitions were back in 2011. The cards maker earned a stake in the digital currency retail space in 2011 when it purchased GMG Entertainment, a publisher of digital currency cards. As a result of the buy, Topps has brought manufacturing, design, and collectability skills to digital currency cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company's Bazooka Candy Brands division also acquired Sharkies, maker of Sharkies Organic Fruit Chews. Topps purchased the business in response to consumers' shifting attitudes toward health and wellness. It plans to leverage its distribution and marketing capabilities to grow the organic snack food brand.

   Brothers Abram, Ira, Philip, and Joseph Shorin founded Topps Chewing Gum in 1938 and set out to make the top (or Topp) chewing gum on the market. Their individually wrapped gum, which sold for a penny apiece, soon became popular.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Topps went public and introduced Bazooka bubble gum in the same year (1947); the Bazooka Joe comic character (modeled after Joseph Shorin) debuted in 1953. Topps began producing baseball cards in 1951 and bought its main baseball card rival, Bowman Gum Company, in 1956. Sports cards -- including baseball, football, and hockey -- continued to propel Topps' growth through the 1960s and 1970s. Arthur Shorin, Joseph's son, became chairman and CEO in 1980.
  </p>
  <p>
   Management maneuvered a $97 million leveraged buyout in 1984, taking the company private (it went public again in 1987 as The Topps Company). The company unveiled the popular (and grotesque) Garbage Pail Kids card series in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the mid-1990s Topps had expanded its collectibles card line to feature pop stars and major movies, which helped offset a slump in the sports card market. The company acquired Merlin Publishing International (now Topps Europe) in 1995. Its 1997 loss resulted primarily from a $30 million charge for closing a factory in Pennsylvania. Belt-tightening measures continued the next year as Topps closed its manufacturing facility in Ireland. Topps signed a licensing agreement to market trading cards featuring characters from the popular Nintendo game
   <i>
    Pokémon
   </i>
   the following year and began to benefit almost immediately as orders rolled in.
  </p>
  <p>
   Topps began a strong push into the collectible games market in 2003 with its purchase of most of
   <company id="114888">
    WizKids
   </company>
   , which sold collectible strategy games. Topps gained full ownership of WizKids in 2005.  Also that year Topps reintroduced new editions of Garbage Pail Kids, a product line popular in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Topps ended its manufacturing agreement with
   <company id="10722">
    Hershey
   </company>
   , the longtime manufacturer of Bazooka gum, in 2006 in favor of a cheaper partner in Mexico. The following year the company's
   <em>
    Pokémon
   </em>
   license expired.
  </p>
  <p>
   Topps was acquired by private equity firms Madison Dearborn and Tornante Co. for some $385 million in 2007.  Scott Silverstein became CEO in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not immune from a weak economy, in 2008 the company cut costs by pulling the plug on WizKids. The business operated out of a Bellevue, Washington office, and Topps decided to shift those gaming activities to its New York office.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silverstein was replaced by former TV Guide Network president Ryan O'Hara in 2010.
