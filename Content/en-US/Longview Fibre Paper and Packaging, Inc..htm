  <p>
   In the late 1920s Monroe Wertheimer experimented with papermaking using Douglas fir scraps. After successful papermaking trials, a group of investors founded Longview Fibre Company in 1927. A year later the company was operating two paper machines, and in 1929 it bought General Fibre Box. Demand for its products was strong, and by 1956 it was operating seven papermaking machines. In 1960 Longview Fibre acquired Downing Box, a maker of corrugated and solid box containers.

  <p>
   The company fended off cyclic paper market difficulties related to the eruption of Mount St. Helen's and

   restrictions to enter the 1990s as a prosperous concern. In 1994 Longview Fibre built a cogeneration plant to meet its long-term energy needs. Bowing to environmental regulation, the company agreed to close down its bleached-pulp plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Longview Fibre was an early participant in reestablished US trade relations with Vietnam, shipping 2,000 tons of kraft paper there in 1995. The next year Longview Fibre's earnings were felled, partly due to weak paper prices and old equipment. The company upgraded its labeling and printing operations in 1997; sales and earnings, however, dropped for the second straight year due to oversupply and the economic crisis in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the company suffered a fiscal 1998 loss, it shut down its Rockford box plant in Illinois and drastically cut production of grocery and carry bags at its Spanish Fork plant in Utah. Longview Fibre also dropped its mill operation to just 75% capacity. By the end of fiscal 1999, Longview Fibre had returned to profitability and its mill capacity rebounded to 97%.
  </p>
  <p>
   As sales continued to climb, in 2000 the company began building a corrugated-container plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in 2001 accused Longview Fibre of selling electricity generated at its cogeneration plant and replacing that power with lower-cost electricity from the local utility. Arguing that it was within its rights, Longview Fibre reached a settlement with the BPA later that year.

   In 2004 Longview Fibre sold its bag business to

   . In 2006 the company restructured to qualify for real estate investment trust (REIT) tax treatment. That same year it rejected an unsolicited pitch from Obsidian Finance Group and

   </company>
   , but in 2007, it accepted Brookfield Asset Management's purchase offer of more than $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spurred by Brookfield Asset's operating focus, and by the difficult environment experienced by its paper and forest products during 2008, Longview Fibre restructured its operations to concentrate on extracting value from its industrial timberland holdings.
