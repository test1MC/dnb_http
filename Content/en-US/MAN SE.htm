   This venerable old MAN still shows all the right moves. For more than 250 years, MAN SE and its subsidiaries have manufactured transport- and energy-related equipment, from trucks and buses to diesel engines for ships. MAN Nutzfahrzeuge is one of Europe's largest truck and commercial vehicle makers, as well as a giant supplier of vehicle, boat, and power generation engines. MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo makes a variety of compressors, expanders, and gas and steam turbines, as well as leads the world market for shipboard diesel engines and is second in stationary engines. It also provides parts and service. Although MAN's reach is global, Europe accounts for over 60% of sales.

  <p>
   MAN grew out of a company started by Carl August Reichenbach and Carl Buz, who leased an engineering plant in Augsburg, Germany, in 1844. Reichenbach, whose uncle had invented the flatbed printing press, began producing printing presses in 1845. On the same premises, Buz began manufacturing steam engines and industrial drive systems, and he soon added rotary printing presses, water turbines, pumps, and diesel engines. In 1898 the company took the name MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg) after merging with a German engineering company of the same name.

  <p>
   Another German heavy-industry company, Gutehoffnungshutte Aktienverein AG (GHH, with roots stretching to 1758), bought a majority interest in MAN in 1921. Through acquisitions and internal growth MAN emerged from the world wars as one of Germany's major heavy-industry companies, with added interests in commercial vehicles, shipbuilding, and plant construction. By 1955 MAN's commercial vehicles were a major division destined to dominate the company's sales; MAN moved the division's headquarters to Munich that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s an overseas recession caused the sales of some operations to slump, although MAN's commercial vehicles and printing-equipment businesses held steady. When economic hardship reached Europe in the 1980s, MAN sought markets outside its home region, especially targeting Asia, the Middle East, and the US. Late in the decade the company dropped its less-profitable products (lifts, pumps, heavy cranes) and began licensing more of its technology and subcontracting out more work. MAN moved its corporate headquarters to Munich in 1985 and merged with GHH in 1986.

  <p>
   After a fast start in the 1990s, Europe's economy again faltered, taking a toll on the company's sales. MAN's profits slumped in fiscal 1994. It laid off about 10% of its workforce between 1993 and 1995. As the economy recovered, so did MAN, and by fiscal 1998, its stagnant profits had rebounded.

   Early in 2000 MAN purchased truck makers ERF Holdings (UK) and STAR (Poland). Later that year MAN picked up

   's diesel engine business. MAN acquired the Neoplan bus-making business of Gottlob Auwarter GmbH in 2001, as well as the turbomachinery business of Switzerland's

    Sulzer
   </company>
   . After discovering accounting irregularities that year, the company suspended the CEO (John Bryant) and CFO (Klaus Wagner) of the newly acquired ERF. In 2002 the company began implementing its Truck Generation A (TG-A) technology into all of its commercial vehicles. In 2003 MAN sold its 51% stake in SMS AG.

   In 2005 the MAN Group sold off its MAN Wolffkran subsidiary to private investors. The business sold and rented tower cranes, a.k.a. cherry pickers, for the building industry; the sale was part of the company's effort to pare down its operations to what are considered to be its core divisions. MAN also restructured its financial services division to prepare it for expansion; the company was renamed MAN Finance International, financing activities in seven countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 MAN sold MAN TAKRAF Fördertechnik to Germany's VTC Industrieholding. TAKRAF Fördertechnik, acquired by MAN in 1994, built equipment, systems, and complete facilities for open-pit mining, harbor and crane technology, and bulk cargo handling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year the company sold MAN Roland Druckmaschinen, its printing press business, to a new venture put together by Allianz Capital Partners for €624 million (about $790 million). MAN kept a 35% equity stake in the business following the transaction.
