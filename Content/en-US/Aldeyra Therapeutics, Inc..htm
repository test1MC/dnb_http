   Aldeyra Therapeutics focuses on the development of products to treat immune-mediated, inflammatory, orphan, and other rare diseases related to a naturally occurring toxic chemical species (free aldehydes). The company discovered and is developing NS2, a product candidate designed to trap and allow for the disposal of free aldehydes for the treatment of Sj√∂gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS, caused by mutations in an enzyme that metabolizes fatty aldehydes), and acute anterior uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease. Aldeyra is hoping to commercially develop NS2 and related products as an alternative to corticosteroids (which has toxic side effects). The company raised $12 million in 2014 IPO.

  <p>
   In May 2014 Aldeyra conducted an IPO to obtain additional capital to support its operations, create a public market for its stock, give it future access to public equity markets, and boost its visibility. It plans to use $5 million of the $12 million net proceeds from the offering for research and development activities for NS2 (including funding currently planned clinical trials) and for the development of other molecules that may relate to the company's aldehyde trapping platform. Aldeyra is using the balance of the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the offering, Aldeyra director Jesse Treu held about 39% of the company, and former director Asish Xavier, 34%.

  <p>
   The company is looking to conduct clinical trials of NS2 and develop different aldehyde traps for the treatment of other diseases. Aldeyra believes that NS2 has the potential to be the first in class of aldehyde traps for SLS, acute anterior uveitis, and for other inflammatory diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it planned to initiate a Phase II clinical trial for an NS2 eye drop for acute anterior uveitis; and a Phase II/III clinical trial to treat SLS with a topical dermatologic formulation of NS2.
  </p>
  <p>
   The data from these trials are expected to be available in the second half of 2015. To date, none of Aldeyra products have been approved for sale.
