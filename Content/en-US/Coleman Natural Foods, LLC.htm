The poultry-and-pork producer sells its products through grocery retailers, warehouse chains, specialty and natural food stores, and food service operators (including schools) throughout the US.

   Catering to those who prefer not to eat food genetically modified foods (GM foods), in 2014 Coleman added new Non-GMO verification labels for its organic line of poultry products. Its Rosie Organic and Draper Valley Farms organic products now carry labels identifying them as GMO-free products. In 2014 parent

   moved production from the older Booth Creek plant in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania (which it closed) to modern plants with the capacity to better serve customers for its Coleman and customer-owned organic and no-antibiotics-ever brands.
