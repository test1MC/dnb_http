   Among the competitive frozen organic and prepared foods niche of the food industry, Amy's Kitchen holds a hefty 70% market share. To maintain its stake and keep sales revenue up while new entrants work to loosen Amy's foothold, the company has reached beyond the frozen foods aisle to get its products in the air and in restaurants. To this end, Amy's Kitchen supplies

   and its 1,500 locations with its veggie burgers.

   It's also exploring size. In 2014, the food maker introduced half a dozen frozen entrees in family sizes while also launching a new organic vegan non-dairy frozen dessert.

   To support its growth, Amy's Kitchen is making plans to build a manufacturing facility in New York, with a $95 million investment.
