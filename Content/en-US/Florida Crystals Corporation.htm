   Florida Crystals' growth is fueled in large part by

   's Domino Foods, which drives sales, marketing, and logistics for its owners' sugar products. Domino distributes to customers in the industrial, grocery, foodservice, and specialty and export markets.

   In 2014, the company launched a real estate division, through which it bought a Channel District property in downtown Tampa for $3.8 million and plans to build 270 luxury apartments on the former Amazon Hose and Rubber site.

   Domino has enjoyed a supply agreement with China's Sunwin International Neutraceuticals, a major supplier of stevia extracts, through an agreement inked in 2011. Domino and its affiliated companies use stevia extracts in making low calorie sweeteners, such as Domino Lite, as well as market the extracts to food and beverage industry customers in North America and Europe.

  <p>
   Florida Crystals and the Dante B. Fascell Port of Miami also teamed up in late 2011 to develop the South Florida Intermodal Logistics Center on 850 acres owned by the sugar company. The center serves as a distribution facility, where freight from South Florida ports can be transported by road and rail, and stored and routed. It will also expand Florida Crystals' distribution capacity nationwide.
