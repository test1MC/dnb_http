   Motorcar Parts of America (MPA) is always ready for a fresh start. The company manufactures, remanufactures, and distributes alternators and starters for cars and all-weight trucks. MPA sells the remanufactured products to retailers and warehouse distributors, which sell to do-it-yourself (DIY) consumers and to repair shops (DIFM or do-it-for-me), primarily in the US and Canada. Some of its top customers include retail chains

   . Although most of MPA's products are sold under its customers' private labels (about 90%), the company does market alternators and starters with its Quality-Built, Reliance, and Xtreme brands.

   The majority of MPA's remanufacturing operations are conducted at facilities in Mexico and Malaysia. The company sells products throughout the US and Canada, with facilities located in California, Mexico, Malaysia and China. It has domestic administrative offices located in California and Tennessee and international administrative offices in Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, and Canada.

   The company sells products to the largest auto parts retail and traditional warehouse chains and to major automobile manufacturers for both its aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs. It manages an aggregate network of 24,000 retail outlets.

   The auto parts maker reported revenues increases of 22% from 2015 to 2016. The growth for 2016 was attributed to increases across all its product lines and also reflected the full year impact of additional sales from new products. This included its new rotating electrical business and its new remanufactured brake master cylinder product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   MPA's profits remained flat from 2015 to 2016, hovering around the $11 million mark for both years. The stagnation in 2016 was driven by a spike in general and administrative expenses related to insurance recoveries and by a litigation settlement from bankruptcy cases relating to a discontinued subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated wildly over the last several years; after experiencing negative cash flow in 2015, MPA's posted positive cash flow of $15 million in 2016. This was the result of favorable inventory levels and accrued core payments made in fiscal 2016.

  <p>
   While MPA has historically served the DIY market -- which is popular in times of recession -- it is also pursuing the DIFM market, which it views as a growth opportunity. MPA is especially looking to sell to major automotive manufacturers for their aftermarket and warranty replacement programs. In order to serve the large producers, MPA generally must enter into longer-term agreements, which requires expending more working capital and building inventory through increased production.
  </p>
  <p>
   To counteract costs associated with this strategy, the company has relocated the vast majority of its US remanufacturing operations to offshore facilities. Approximately 99% of MPA's manufacturing now takes place in Malaysia and Mexico. It also operates a warehousing, testing, and distribution facility in Singapore.

   ), Mel Marks founded Motorcar Parts &amp; Accessories (MPA) in 1968. Initially MPA only distributed imported auto parts, but in 1986 it expanded into remanufacturing through foreign affiliates. The next year the company began remanufacturing in the US. As the number of imported cars in the US grew, so did MPA. The company went public in 1994.
