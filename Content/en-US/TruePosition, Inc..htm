   Hansel and Gretel might not have needed that trail of bread crumbs if they'd used TruePosition's location software and services. The company provides wireless positioning applications (using a variety of technologies including GPS and cellular) that it sells to wireless carriers and enterprises. Its software and related network devices enable a 911 service for carriers, allowing them to pinpoint an emergency caller's location, as well as enabling traffic alerts, turn-by-turn directions, and directory assistance. TruePosition also provides consulting, systems integration, network design and support, and training services. Founded in 1992, the company owns more than 300 patents and is owned by

   TruePosition in 2011 bought the patent portfolio of Rosum Corporation, consisting of more than 30 US and international patents, to expand its intellectual property holdings. Rosum specialized in location-based analog and digital wireless technology based on television signals. TruePosition acquired a controlling interest in EmFinders, a provider of emergency location services and devices, the previous year.

   The company sold subsidiary Zoombak, a maker of portable GPS locators, to GPS manufacturer Securus LLC for an undisclosed amount in 2011 to focus on its core product lines.
