   Petrofac provides facility design, construction, engineering, procurement, and management services for the oil and gas industry. It delivers production and processing facility services to international oil companies and other clients. Petrofac operates in the UK, Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (which includes former Soviet Republic nations), and is building its business in the Asia/Pacific region. In addition to its engineering, construction, and consultancy services, the company offers integrated energy services and safety, emergency response, and efficiency training for facility personnel. In 2014 Petrofac operated 31 offices in 29 countries.

  <p>
   Petrofac operates through four reporting segments: Onshore Engineering &amp; Construction (50% of total revenue), Offshore Projects &amp; Operations, Engineering &amp; Consulting Services, and Integrated Energy Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The largest segment, Onshore Engineering &amp; Construction, serves the onshore oil and gas industry, while the Offshore Projects &amp; Operations segment specializes in offshore oil and gas services. Both units provide engineering, procurement, and construction services; together, they account for more than 80% of Petrofac's total earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engineering &amp; Consulting Services provides a range of services including technical engineering, consulting, design, front-end engineering and design (FEED), and project management consultancy (PMC). Finally, Integrated Energy Services partners with others to invest in oil and gas production, processing, and transportation assets. It also provides training and consultancy services.

  <p>
   Petrofac operates in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia/Pacific region, India, and Africa.

  <p>
   Revenue has remained fairly steady over the past three years following a couple of years of strong growth. In 2014, revenue fell 1% to $6.2 billion due to declines in the Integrated Energy Services and Onshore Engineering &amp; Construction segments. Lower average commodity prices and lower levels of activity impacted earnings, especially the Integrated Energy Services operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell 78% to $140 million in 2014 as operating costs rose despite revenue declines. Petrofac reported an operating cash inflow of $648 million that year, versus an outflow of $86 million in 2013. That turnaround was largely due to changes in working capital items.

  <p>
   With a strong backlog and record-breaking amounts of new business, Petrofac is banking on growing returns over the next few years. To further improve its bottom line, the company is working on streamlining operating costs and maintaining capital discipline. One way it has done this is by partnering with others to invest in infrastructure projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Petrofac formed a marketing alliance with offshore specialist

    McDermott International
   </company>
   ; through the partnership, both companies will gain a wider geographic reach. The two companies will together provide a broader range of offerings for deepwater developments.
