   Gieves &amp; Hawkes has been outfitting Jeeveses (gentlemen's personal gentlemen) and their men for the past 200 years. The exclusive No. 1 Savile Row tailor was founded in 1785, following the merger of Gieves with Hawkes, started in 1771. Gieves &amp; Hawkes boasts a tradition of bespoke (custom in the US) tailoring. It was, however, the first Savile Row clothier to make and sell ready-to-wear suits in the 1920s. The company has since launched Gieves, a fashion collection, and more than a dozen stores in the UK and an e-tail site. Its line is sold through more than a 100 stores and concessions in Asia. The company is owned by Hong Kong retail group Trinity Ltd.

   In 2015 Gieves &amp; Hawkes' launched a China campaign to woo tourists to Savile Row. The company wants to see a surge in Chinese shoppers visiting its flagship shop at 1 Savile Row where they can buy bespoke suits ranging from £3,000 to £5,000.

   In 2014 the company ran a digital window display at

   , combining traditional visual merchandising with a screen showcasing a short film that had been created for its Autumn/Winter 2014 season by filmmaker Eddie Wrey.

   Trinity paid £32.5 million ($52 million) to acquire Gieves &amp; Hawkes from
   <company id="56806">
    Wing Tai Holdings
   </company>
   in 2012, plus up to an extra £60 million ($96 million) after meeting certain performance targets, for Gieves &amp; Hawkes' handful of shops. As significant, it garnered one of Europe's most iconic fashion brands. The Hong Kong group already owned around 100 Gieves &amp; Hawkes banner stores in Southeast Asia, but the move boosts its closet of luxury labels, including France's Cerruti 1881 and Britain's Kent &amp; Curwen, as Trinity pursues a larger share of the newly wealthy Chinese market. Trinity, in which the Fung family (of
   <company id="101769">
    Li &amp; Fung
   </company>
   ) owns more than a 35% stake, posted nearly a 30% increase in sales in 2011 over the prior year. About one-fifth of its sales are attributable to the Gieves &amp; Hawkes brand in Asia.

   The change in ownership of the venerable British tailor coincides with a tough economy nationwide that drove another unprofitable year for Gieves &amp; Hawkes' UK and Irish operations. Despite shuttering underperforming concessions, the business has not made a profit since 2005. With more control over the brand's distribution, Trinity looks to rebuild demand for Gieves &amp; Hawkes at home, where the tailor holds royal warrants as suppliers to the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. The new owner has also signaled an interest in broadening the brand's line of casualwear and in customizing a lifestyle range for Chinese consumers coupled with continuing to open stores across Asia -- about 12 to 20 each year.

   Trinity, meanwhile, is likely to benefit from Asia's appreciation of the legendary credentials surrounding the business built by Mr. Gieves and Mr. Hawkes. The group's acquisition gained a chest of Gieves &amp; Hawkes artifacts, including a 1794 letter from customer Lord Horatio Nelson (best known for his victory in the Battle of Trafalgar). By another account in 1871, when African explorers Dr. David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley so famously met up, they raised their pith helmets to each other. The men found that one helmet was made by Gieves, and the other by Hawkes.
