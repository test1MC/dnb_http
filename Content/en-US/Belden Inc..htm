   Can you hear me now? If not, Belden can help. The company designs and manufactures cable, connectivity, and networking products that make possible the transmission of data, sound, and video signals. Offerings include copper cables (shielded/unshielded twisted, coaxial, and stranded) and fiber optic and composite cables (multiconductor, coaxial, and fiber optic). It also makes fiber and copper connectors and networking products such as Ethernet switches. Products are used in industrial (robotics), enterprise, broadcast, and consumer electronics applications. Founder Joseph Belden established the company in 1902.

  <p>
   Belden manufactures its products in the US, as well as Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, and certain countries in Europe. With roughly 45% of its revenues coming from non-US sales, the company is maintaining its strategy of expanding into emerging markets such as Brazil, China, and India to take advantage of lower-cost labor, as well as getting its operations closer to its customers.

   Belden primarily designs and manufactures cables and Ethernet switches, as well as connectors (fiber and copper) for the industrial, audio/video, security, and communications industries. It also manufactures harsh-environment switches for factory automation, power generation, and railway applications and makes internal wiring for consumer electronics, automotive wire, and audio/video cable.

   After the acquisition of
   <company id="103946">
    Tripwire
   </company>
   in January 2015, the company organized its business across five segments: Broadcast (38% of net sales), Industrial Connectivity (26%), Enterprise Connectivity (19%), Industrial IT (10%), and Network Security (7%).

   Core customer
   <company id="10809">
    Anixter
   </company>
   , a distributor, accounts for about 12% of sales; Belden also sells to OEMs.

  <p>
   Belden experienced unprecedented growth in 2015 as revenues peaked at $2.31 billion. The growth for 2015 was fueled by surges within its Network Security segment revenue as a result of its acquisition of Tripwire. Its Enterprise Connectivity segment grew by 6% on an organic basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its profits fell 11% from $74 million in 2014 to $66 million in 2015. This was due to a rise in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015 as a result of acquisitions completed. Belden's operating cash flow has increased the last few years, jumping 22% to $236 million in 2015 due to an influx in cash provided by accounts payable and changes in accrued taxes.

  <p>
   Belden's blueprint for growth involves a steady stream of acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In one of its largest purchases to date, Belden in 2015 acquired
   <company id="103946">
    Tripwire
   </company>
   , a global provider of advanced threat, security, and compliance products and services, for $710 million. Tripwire's products enable enterprises, service providers, manufacturers, and government agencies to detect, prevent, and respond to growing security threats. The deal expanded Belden's networking and security portfolio and added a new segment to its operations: Enterprise Connectivity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Belden obtained ProSoft Technology, a manufacturer of industrial networking products that include disparate automation systems, for $105 million. The newly acquired operations were folded into its Industrial IT segment. Also in 2014, Belden picked up Grass Valley USA and GVBB Holdings (collectively, Grass Valley) for $218 million. Headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, Grass Valley is a provider of technologies (production switchers, cameras, servers, and editing equipment) for the broadcast industry.

   When Joseph Belden couldn't find the silk-wrapped, magnetic wire needed for telephone coils, he decided to make it himself and founded Belden Manufacturing Company in Chicago in 1902. Thomas Edison was one of the company's early customers. Rubber-covered and enamel-coated wire used by the fledgling electricity industry, and later in radio cars and electrical appliances, spurred the company's growth. During the 1950s Belden began making products for data processing and television. The company changed its name to Belden Corporation in 1966.
   <company id="10405">
    Cooper Industries
   </company>
   bought the company in 1981. During that period Belden established its presence in the computer industry. Cooper spun off Belden in 1993. The following year Belden moved its headquarters to St. Louis.
