   appreciate iRobot. The company makes robots for home cleaning use, with its Roomba FloorVac and Scooba being the first of their kind to automatically clean floors. In collaboration with partners, iRobot also designs products for business and health care use, including videoconferencing-enabled robots that allow mobile teleconferencing for meetings or doctor/patient interactions. Founded in 1990 by robot engineers from the

   , iRobot has offices in the US, UK, China, and Hong Kong and sells its home products worldwide through retailers. The company sold its struggling defense and security robot business (which performed tasks such as battlefield reconnaissance and bomb disposal) to Arlington Capital Partners in 2016.

   iRobot operated two primary business segments in 2014: Home Robots accounted for more than 90% of sales in 2014, while Defense &amp; Security Robots represented the remainder. The firm sold its Defense &amp; Security Robots business to Arlington Capital Partners in April 2016.

  <p>
   Sales to Japan's Sales on Demand Corp. and a network of affiliated European distributors accounted for about 30% of home robot sales in 2014. The US federal government accounted for about 4% of the company's total revenue in 2014, down from 6% and 15% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

   iRobot spent $46.1 million on advertising in 2014, up from $38.2 million and $34.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

  <p>
   iRobot has enjoyed rising sales and profit over the past few years thanks to its growing sales in its home robot line. Revenue in 2014 jumped by 14% to $556.85 million, mostly thanks to a 19% jump in home robot sales as shipments and prices increased domestically and internationally (with particularly strong Roomba 800 series and Roomba 600 series growth). Defense and security robots continued to fall due to US Army-related spending declines. China was the top market for growth, with a 200% increase in sales during the year. In 2012, sales had dipped because of a 57% decline in defense and security robot sales as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wound down.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher revenue in 2014 drove profit higher for a second year, with net income spiking by 36% to $37.8 million. Cash levels remained stable in 2014, as operations provided $40.61 million during the year.

  <p>
   With its foothold in the robotic appliances niche, iRobot has boosted its consumer business by developing new products, such as the new Roomba 700 series, built on popular brand names. To keep its product pipeline full, iRobot continues to pour more money into new inventions every year, investing $69.4 million in research and development in 2014 (up from $24.8 million in 2010). In 2014, iRobot introduced its Ava 500 Video Collaboration robot, a remote presence solution for the enterprise market. In 2013, it began selling remote presence telemedicine robots to InTouch Health for resale in the healthcare market. Other products released in recent years include the Roomba for Pets, Roomba Discovery for Pets, and the Dirt Dog Workshop Robot, which was designed to keep work spaces free of sawdust, small nails, and debris.

   Amid falling sales of its tactical military robots, the company began focusing more on its home care robots a few years ago. In April 2016, the company sold its Defense &amp; Security robot business to Arlington Capital Partners.

  <p>
   In October 2012, iRobot acquired privately-held Evolution Robotics, the maker of Mint brand automatic floor cleaning robots, for $74 million. The purchase expanded iRobot's technology leadership through a combination of intellectual property, engineering talent, and new products that broadened its robot offering.
