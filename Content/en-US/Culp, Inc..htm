   Culp just wants to keep on ticking. The company is one of the world's largest makers of furniture upholstery fabrics and mattress fabrics (known as ticking). Culp delivers fashion-conscious, stylish fabrics with broad appeal to some of the largest home furnishing retailers and manufacturers. Its upholstery fabrics include wovens (jacquards and dobbies), knits, screen-prints, and velvets (woven and tufted). Its fabrics are used in upholstering residential and commercial furniture such as recliners, sofas, and love seats. Culp's ticking is used for covering mattresses and box springs.

  <p>
   Culp reported a record-setting year in 2015, posting $310 million in revenue. The historic revenue growth for 2015 was fueled by increased sales from its both upholstery fabrics and mattress fabrics segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profits, however, dipped 14% to $15 million in 2015 due to a spike in income tax expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Like its revenues, Culp's cash flow has risen steadily over the years, spiking 29% from 2013 to 2014, primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable.

  <p>
   The company's strategy includes investing heavily in its mattress fabric business, restructuring its upholstery fabrics business to be more competitive, and expanding in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the keys to Culp's success has been the shift of manufacturing activities from North America to China and Europe. It is continuing to expand manufacturing facilities in China, where the company has operated since 2004.

  <p>
   A member of the American Furniture Hall of Fame, Robert Culp Jr. developed the heat-transfer method of printing cloth and introduced tufting machinery for manufacturing velvet. In 1972, with his life savings and son Rob (Robert III) at his side, he founded Culp, Inc., as a fabric converter for the upholstered furniture industry. In 1979 it switched to manufacturing and went public in 1983.
