   If you're angling to find cancer-fighting products, Angle PLC may be able to help. The specialist medical diagnostic business develops cancer diagnostic and foetal health-related products. Its leading Parsortix product is a patented separation platform technology for the isolation of cells in blood in order to conduct cancer diagnostics of a patient and use the findings to create personalized cancer care. Currently in the research market, Parsortix carries CE Mark regulatory approval for the clinical market in Europe and is awaiting FDA approval in the US. Because Parsortix can be used with all solid cancers, the product presents a big growth opportunity in the lucrative medical diagnostic market.

   Before focusing almost entirely on Parsortix, ANGLE as late as 2011 acted as a management services firm that helped its portfolio companies (in the life sciences, bioscience, electronic, and software industries) finance and commercialize their existing technologies and intellectual property. It had substantial equity stakes in a handful of companies, which included Novocellus and Geomerics. Novocellus had developed a patent protected system, EmbryoSure, for selecting embryos likely to lead to a successful pregnancy. Geometrics developed commercial applications for geometric algebra; the mathematical technology can be used in fields such as computer gaming and electromagnetic modeling.
