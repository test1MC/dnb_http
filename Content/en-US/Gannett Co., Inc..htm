   Gannett is focused on local news that could be of national interest.
   <em>
    USA TODAY

   has a truly national following, and it is considered one of the few national newspapers. However, the paper is not as highly regarded as the
   <em>
    New York Times
   </em>
   or the
   <em>
    Wall Street Journal
   </em>
   .
