   For many soft drinkers, it's a snap decision about which doctor to choose. Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) is the bottler and distributor of Dr Pepper soda and
   <company id="101214">
    Snapple
   </company>
   drinks. Serving Canada, Mexico, and the US, the company offers a vast portfolio of non-alcoholic beverages including flavored, carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated soft drinks, along with ready-to-drink non-carbonated teas, juices, juice drinks, and mixers. Among its brands are Dr Pepper and Snapple, of course, along with A&amp;W Root Beer, Hawaiian Punch,
   <company id="111655">
    Mott's
   </company>
   , and Schweppes. It has some cult favorites as well, including Vernors, Squirt, and Royal Crown Cola. DPS is the #3 soda business in North America after #1
   <company id="10359">
    Coke
   </company>
   and #2
   <company id="11166">
    Pepsi

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   DPS's four core brands include: Canada Dry (the #1 ginger ale in the US); 7up (the #2 lemon-lime carbonated drink in the US); A&amp;W (the #1 root beer in the US), and Sunkist (#1 orange carbonated drink in the US).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates its business through three segments: Packaged Beverages, Beverage Concentrates, and Latin America Beverages. Serving the US and Canada, the Packaged Beverages segment generated more than 70% of total sales during 2015, and makes and distributes finished beverages and other products, including its own brands and third party brands, through both direct-store and warehouse direct delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Beverage Concentrates segment (roughly 20% of total sales) sells branded concentrates and syrup to third-party bottlers primarily in the US and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are carbonated soft drink brands. Pepsi and Coke are the Beverage Concentrates segment's largest customers, accounting for some 27% and 21% of net sales, respectively, in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Latin America Beverages segment (less than 10% of sales) serves the Mexico and Caribbean markets, making and distributing concentrates, syrup, and finished beverages. About 90% of the segment's net sales are generated in Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Plano, Texas-based company operates nearly 150 administrative, manufacturing, and distribution facilities across the US, which supply customers in the US and Canada. In Mexico it has more than a dozen sites through which it serves its customers in that country. In 2015, almost 90% of the company's net sales were generated in the US, while Mexico and the Caribbean generated some 8% of net sales. Canada generated the remaining 3%.

  <p>
   Its Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by its bottlers, including its own Packaged Beverages segment, through all major retail channels. Unlike the majority of its other carbonated soft drink brands, 58% of DPS volumes in 2015 were distributed through the Coca-Cola- and PepsiCo-affiliated bottler systems. The company's Packaged Beverages' products are made in multiple facilities nationwide and sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by its own distribution network or by third party distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   DPS sells its Packaged Beverages' products both through a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system, supported by a fleet of about 8,500 vehicles and 19,000 employees, including sales representatives, merchandisers, drivers, and warehouse workers, as well as through its Warehouse Direct delivery system (WD), both of which include sales to all major retail channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Mexico, DPS makes and distributes its products through bottling operations and third-party bottlers and distributors. It also sells finished beverages through all major Mexican retail channels, including local stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and on premise channels. Further, in Mexico it participates in a joint venture to manufacture Aguafiel brand water with Acqua Minerale San Benedetto. In the Caribbean, it distributes products through third-party bottlers and distributors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company entered a three-year sponsorship agreement with the
   <company id="46734">
    San Francisco Giants
   </company>
   . Through the arrangement, Snapple's iced tea products will be sold at the baseball club's AT&amp;T Park venue.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   DPS has enjoyed steady revenue and profit growth for the past several years, thanks in large part to sales growth in its Latin America Beverages segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales rose 3% to $6.28 billion during 2015 mostly thanks to growth in its Packaged Beverages segment with a favorable product mix, higher branded sales volumes (particularly with the Squirt, Canada Dry, Bai, Fiji, Snapple, Clamato, and Hawaii Punch brands), and higher pricing. The Beverage Concentrates segment's sales grew 1% thanks to favorable product mix (driven by fountain business) and higher pricing, with the fastest volume growth tied to the Schweppes and Canada Dry brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales growth in 2015 drove DPS' net income up 9% to $764 million. The company's operating cash levels dipped 3% to $991 million for the year due to unfavorable changes in working capital mostly related to trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, and other liabilities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company might be #3 in overall North American sales, but it wins the gold in one category. DPS is the #1 flavored carbonated soft drinks (CSD) company in the US. Dr Pepper, its largest and namesake brand, is the #2 flavored CSD in the US, according to Nielsen, and its Snapple brand is a leading ready-to-drink tea. DPS is the industry leader in flavored carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) with a 38.8% market share in the US for 2015, also according to Nielsen, as measured by retail sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   To this end, DPS works to leverage the strength of its significant brands by launching innovations and brand extensions to its core brands (Dr. Pepper, 7UP, Sunkist soda, A&amp;W, and Canada Dry). To support supply and sales growth in fast-growing Mexico, the company in 2016 broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the country.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In late 2016, DPS announced plans to acquire Bai Brands LLC, a maker of antioxidant drinks, for $1.7 billion. The move represents the latest diversification away from soda, which has been declining in recent years as consumer awareness increases of the negative effects of sugary beverages on health.
  </p>
  <p>
   In November 2014, DPS acquired Pennsylvania-based Davis Beverage Group and Davis Bottling Co., nearly doubling its direct store delivery footprint in Pennsylvania. The purchase included a 42-county distribution territory covering most of the eastern half of Pennsylvania, excluding the Philadelphia area, as well as western and central New Jersey.

  <p>
   DPS in 2013 inked a deal with
   <company id="103392">
    Mondelez International
   </company>
   to reacquire the distribution rights for Snapple and several other non-carbonated beverage brands in parts of the Asia/Pacific region to give DPS rights to distribute the Snapple brand in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. In Australia, the company also will have distribution rights for Mott's, Mr &amp; Mrs T, Clamato, Mistic, Holland House, and Yoo-hoo. As part of the agreement, DPS can explore opportunities for expanding the presence of Snapple and other non-carbonated brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 DPS acquired the assets and territory of Dr Pepper/7-Up Bottling Company of the West, based in Reno, Nevada. The purchase includes rights to the Dr Pepper/7-Up West territory and ownership of its distribution operation in Reno, Chico, California, and Boise, Idaho. The purchase is consistent with DPS's strategy of strengthening its route to market in the US.
