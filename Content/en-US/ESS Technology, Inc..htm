   ESS loves to mix the sights and sounds of technology. ESS Technology designs multimedia chips for electronics devices such as DVD players, DivX movie players, and digital audio systems. Its decoder chips support a wide range of video and audio formats, while its encoder chips transform DVD players into recordable devices. Its image processors are used in digital still cameras and camera-enabled cell phones. Top customers of the fabless semiconductor company have included noteworthy names like

   ESS has focused on the standard-definition DVD market, retreating from the high-definition/Blu-ray DVD and image sensor chip markets. It licensed the next generation of its standard-definition DVD chips (Video CD or VCD) to Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics of China, although Silan notified ESS that it does not plan to go ahead with developing or making such chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company once designed PC audio, communications, and fax/modem chips. It now sells those legacy products only from inventory. ESS also ceased operations for its camera phone business, offering its image sensor patents and technology for licensing.

  <p>
   Fred Chan started two computer-aided design and engineering firms before founding ESS Technology with Forest Mozer in 1984 to develop audio chips for toys. He increased sales through the 1990s by catering to the booming PC market, especially to makers of notebook computers. The company went public in 1995. Competition intensified, particularly from industry leader
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , which added ESS product functions into its own chips.
  </p>
  <p>
   ESS expanded through acquisitions to move beyond notebook PCs. In 1996 the company bought digital video processing specialist VideoCore Technology and modem technology maker OSEE Technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 ESS bought Platform Technologies, thereby gaining expertise in more powerful audio technologies. The acquisition allowed ESS to expand its core audio product family to address advanced applications such as 3-D gaming and virtual reality.
  </p>
  <p>
   ESS established subsidiary
   <company id="118906">
    Vialta
   </company>
   in 1999 to develop products and applications for the Internet. (Chan relinquished his president and CEO titles to head up Vialta. EVP Robert Blair was named CEO.) In 2000 ESS acquired NetRidium Communications, a privately held developer of broadband communications technology. It also announced plans to spin off Vialta.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company appointed Didier Pietri as president of Vialta in advance of its spinoff; four months later, he became CEO of the venture. ESS spun off its 62% stake in its former subsidiary, which made Internet-enabled DVD players, that same year. After going public in the 2001 spinoff, Vialta was taken private by Chan in 2005. Chan continued as chairman of Vialta.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the company acquired privately held Pictos Technologies, a maker of digital imaging chips, for $27 million. It also bought privately held
   <company id="100364">
    Divio
   </company>
   , which made chips for digital imaging and video applications, for a similar sum in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The
   <company id="105589">
    Motion Picture Association of America
   </company>
   (MPAA), the Hollywood studio group, sued ESS Technology in 2004, alleging the company failed to ensure that customers for its DVD chips were licensed by the DVD Copy Control Association. The MPAA and ESS settled the case the following year, with the company agreeing to sell DVD chips only to customers licensed by the DVD association and to work with Hollywood studios to combat film piracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 ESS Technology was acquired by Imperium Partners Group, a New York-based institutional asset management firm.
