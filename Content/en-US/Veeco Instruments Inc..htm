   Veeco Instruments gives high-tech components the VIP treatment. The company offers precision equipment for manufacturing components, such as thin-film magnetic heads, photovoltaic solar cells, and semiconductor devices. Its deposition, etching, and lapping and dicing systems are used in the hard-disk drive, sensors, semiconductor photomask, microelectromechanical (MEMS), and coatings industries. The company targets applications in the light-emitting diode (LED), solar, and data storage markets.

   and Seoul Viosys Co. are among its top customers. Veeco gets around 90% of sales from outside the US.

  <p>
   Veeco's metal organic chemical vapor deposition products for LEDs generate 71% of its revenue; its molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) products are another significant source of revenue (20%). The MBE products are used in making solar cells, fiber-optics, mobile phones, radar systems, and displays.

   Customers in the Asia-Pacific region account for 79% of revenues; those in China make up 40% of sales. Veeco has development, manufacturing, sales, and service facilities in the US, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and across Europe. Major customers include
   <company id="183751">
    HC SemiTek
   </company>
   and Seoul Viosys, each accounting for more than 10% of sales in 2014. Its five largest customers were responsible for almost half of Veeco's sales in 2014. Advertising expense incurred was $0.6 million, $0.5 million, and $0.8 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

  <p>
   Reflecting uncertain market conditions, Veeco's revenue has fluctuated over the past five years with a peak of $979 million 2011. In 2014, the company's revenue bounced 18% higher to $393 million from $331 million in 2013. Customers who increased manufacturing capacity pushed MOCVD revenue 27% higher in 2014. A 2014 acquisition also added to revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Veeco's loss, however, deepened in 2014 to $67 million from $42 million in 2013. The loss stemmed from a dropped in an income tax benefit and higher asset impairment expenses related to goodwill and other long-term assets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several factors broke in Veeco's favor to boost its cash flow to $42 million in 2014 from just $727,000 in 2013. Changes in customer deposits and deferred revenue and income taxes helped cash to flow.

   The company is allocating additional R&amp;D spending toward end markets that it believes offer significant growth opportunities, such as LEDs, optical communications, photovoltaic solar cells, wireless networking, and other communications applications. In an indication that the LED market is growing, General Electric said it would phase out production of CFL light bulbs and concentrate on LED lighting products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Veeco in 2014 introduced new MOVCD products designed to lower its customers manufacturing costs, which should reduce the cost of LED lighting. The new products were the TurboDisc EPIK700™ GaN MOCVD System and the Propel™ PowerGaN MOCVD System. Early customers for the TurboDisc system were KaiStar Lighting Co. and

   , both Chinese LED makers.

   In 2014, Veeco acquired Solid State Equipment LLC, a developer of single wafer wet etch, clean, and surface preparation equipment, for $145 million. The unit, branded Precision Surface Processing by Veeco, serves makers of advanced packaging, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and compound semiconductors.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased Synos Technology, Inc., a designer and manufactures fast array Scanning atomic layer deposition systems expected to enable the production of flexible organic light-emitting diode displays for mobile devices. The unit, renamed Veeco ALD Inc., has operations in California and Korea.

   Albert Nerken, a civil engineer in the Manhattan Project, and Frank Raible founded Veeco Instruments in 1945 to make equipment that detected microscopic leaks. The next year the company received its first order from the

   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s Veeco supplied critical parts for the space race. Raible died in 1975. In 1989 Nerken retired as chairman and sold the company for more than $250 million to UK-based Unitech, which wanted its power supply business. Chairman and CEO Ed Braun and other Veeco executives bought the instrumentation business in 1990 in a leveraged buyout.

  <p>
   In 1993 the company began reselling

   's SXM atomic force microscopes to semiconductor manufacturers. Veeco went public a year later. In 1995 Veeco developed an ion beam deposition tool for microelectronic films. The next year the company debuted a direct-deposit ion beam system for depositing diamond-like carbon coatings for disk drive read-write heads. In 1997 Veeco acquired Materials Research Corp.'s ion deposition and etching equipment division. That year Veeco also acquired Wyko Corp., a leading maker of optical measurement systems.
