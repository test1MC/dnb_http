   GEA Group may run hot and cold, but that's its business. The company helps growing markets around the globe get a grip on their process engineering needs, especially those requiring heat exchange (cooling, freezing, and heating) and exchange of material (drying, separating, distilling, pumping/dosing, and packaging). About 70% of its sales come from the food and energy industries. Having  divested itself of its turnkey plant construction operations, GEA is now divided into Farm Technologies, Heat Exchangers, Mechanical Equipment, Process Engineering, and Refrigeration Technologies. Operating through about 250 companies in some 50 countries worldwide, GEA gets more than 85% of its sales from outside of Germany.

  <p>
   Wilhelm Merton, Leo Ellinger, and Zachary Hochschild founded Metallgesellschaft as a metal trader and manufacturer in Frankfurt in 1881. Germany's domestic mines were insufficient to meet demand, so the company formed subsidiaries in Europe, and by 1890, in the US, Mexico, and Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1897 the company formed Metalurgische Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft as a metal-testing and technical subsidiary. (The company soon became known as LURGI, the abbreviation it used on telegrams.) Metallgesellschaft flourished and also made a name for itself as a good corporate citizen by establishing a pension fund for its employees and founding what would later become Frankfurt University.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not surprisingly, the World Wars were hard on Metallgesellschaft. Long-term relationships with foreign companies abroad ended, imports dried up, and foreign subsidiaries were seized. Problems, however, weren't just external. Richard Merton, who had assumed control of the company after his father's death in 1916, was imprisoned for a time in 1939 -- as the company was "Aryanized" -- before escaping to England.
  </p>
  <p>
   Richard Merton returned from exile in 1947 and took the reins of a company that had been reduced to recycling rubble and made roofing felt and a turnip-based jam substitute. As the company regrouped, it concentrated on expanding its technical capabilities by investing in LURGI's labs. Metallgesellschaft's first post-WWII subsidiary was established in Paris in 1960; Merton died that same year.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1960s and 1970s the company worked at re-establishing international operations, and in 1971 the company reorganized into five divisions: metals processing, chemicals, plant construction, transport, and communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   By its centennial year (1981) the company's strategy was to focus on its raw materials operations (trading and mining), engineering services, and specialty processing chemicals. A decade later financial services had also become significant to its operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991 Metallgesellschaft acquired Dynamit Nobel, a heating/materials technology and explosives company, for about $700 million. About the same time, however, the end of the Cold War had the unfortunate side-effect of flooding the European market with cheap metals. Metallgesellschaft's mining, trading, and recycling operations were adversely affected. The company began divesting some operations to raise cash, but when oil prices fell in 1993, Metallgesellschaft was hammered by its hedging on oil-futures and nearly went belly-up. The management team was axed, and fix-it specialist Kajo Neukirchen was brought in to turn things around. The company lost more than a billion dollars in both 1993 and 1994, but managed to stay afloat over the next few years by restructuring, selling businesses (including its mining operations), and cutting jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1997 Metallgesellschaft was focused on engineering (Lurgi), chemicals (Dynamit Nobel), building systems, and trading (metals and chemicals). The next year the company acquired US-based lithium specialist Cyprus Foote. In 1999 it acquired engineering company GEA, sold its building systems group, and spun off much of its metals-trading business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metallgesellschaft changed its name to mg technologies ag in 2000. The company restructured its management again, and began to sell operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group's structural steel engineering unit, Stahlbau Plauen, was sold in 2003 to Belgian investors, and plastics and chemical unit Dynamit Nobel was set up for sale. Four of Dynamit Nobel's business units were sold to specialty chemicals company

   <company id="57829">
    Delphi
   </company>
   acquired Dynamit's automotive ignition systems unit, which made pyrotechnic safety systems for the automotive industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 mg technologies merged with GEA, and changed its name to GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft. Management was reshuffled again, with GEA executives filling spots on the GEA executive board.
  </p>
  <p>
   The changeover was to continue with the sale of plastics unit Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff (DNK) to US-based
   <company id="105073">
    Flex-N-Gate
   </company>
   , but it was called off after GEA charged that the automotive supplier failed to meet the requirements of the sale agreement. The group eventually found a buyer in Swedish Plastal Group. GEA then sold Fleissner, which made textile manufacturing equipment, to the Tr√ºtzschler Group in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   GEA Group bought UK-based air-conditioning products company Denco Building Services in 2006. The following year it picked up Canadian freezer maker Aero Heat Exchanger, Italian aseptic bottle filler Procomac, and Canadian heavy equipment maker J. Houle &amp; Fils.
  </p>
  <p>
   GEA exited its plant engineering operations in 2007 to focus on its mechanical process engineering and equipment operations. By mid-year GEA sold all three plant engineering subsidiaries; Lurgi and Zimmer were sold to

    Air Liquide
   </company>
   for $270 million, and Lentjes was sold to Austria's A-TEC Industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it picked up Netherlands-based Bloksma, which makes intercoolers and oil coolers for marine and industrial applications. Later that same year it acquired International Cooling Group, a UK-based evaporator and condenser manufacturer.
