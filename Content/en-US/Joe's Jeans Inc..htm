   California-based Joe's Jeans has no significant operations outside of the US. (The company, however, has managed to win business with a number of significant department stores in Europe and Asia.) Its retail stores are located in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Virginia. It has one store in Vancouver, Canada.

  <p>
   Joe's Jeans divides its business between wholesale and retail operations. The wholesale arm, which accounts for about 80% of revenues, represents sales to upscale department stores, specialty stores, and distributors, typically conducted through showrooms in New York and Los Angeles. Revenues generated through licensing agreements are also part of the wholesale business. Retail sales are tied to 15 full-price retail stores and 20 outlet stores in the US, and through Joe's Jeans website. Third parties are relied upon to make the apparel line. Most of the company's apparel is made in Mexico, China, and Los Angeles.

   The company's brands include Joe's (57% of sales), newly-acquired Hudson (40%), and Else (4%).

    Nordstrom

   and
   <company id="12493">
    Macy's
   </company>
   , which each account for more than 10% of annual sales. Its jeans are sold in other department stores, including upscale
   <company id="11064">
    Neiman Marcus
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40406">
    Saks Fifth Avenue
   </company>
   , and in approximately 1,000 specialty shops and online (
   <company id="51493">
    Amazon.com
   </company>
   ). International customers range from Galleries Lafayette and Le Printemps to Harrods, Ztampz, Biesse, Eickhoff, Envols, and TSUM, to name a few. Sales are made through international distributors and sales agents, managed by the company and consultants, and through licensed stores.

   The company reported advertising and trade show expenses of about $4.3 million in fiscal 2013 (ended November), up from $2.9 million in fiscal 2012 and $4 million in 2011.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2013 (ended November) sales jumped 18% versus the prior year to nearly $140.4 million. Wholesale sales rose 19%, while retail sales were up 15%. Driving most of the gain in wholesale sales was the addition of $15.6 million from the acquisition of Hudson in 2013. Retail sales benefited from the opening of six additional stores since the end of fiscal 2012, and $475,000 in online sales from the Hudson acquisition. Same-store sales for Joe's stores, including its online shop, fell 5%. The company posted a loss of $7.3 million in fiscal 2013 versus a profit of $5.6 million the prior year. The company blamed the loss on increased expenses, including those associated with its purchase and integration of Hudson and new store openings. Joe's Jeans has been unprofitable in two of the past three years.

  <p>
   The company's strategic advantage in the marketplace stems in part from a reputation for fitting different body types to meet a variety of consumer preferences. As such, Joe's Jeans looks to grow by adding other products (such as tees, tops, and non-denim bottoms) that enhance sales of its premium denim offerings (generally sold at $150 or more). It is also working on a lower-price point product line to win back shoppers that have traded down during the recession. Simultaneously, Joe's Jeans targets a larger share of the men's and international market. Its future is also focused upon the performance of its banner retail stores as well as that of licensees of the Joe's brand for accessories, such as bags, belts, children's apparel, and shoes. The company's plans include opening additional outlet stores, which are expected to boost sales and sell overstock or slow moving items at a higher profit margin. The company opened its first store in Canada in 2013.

  <p>
   In September 2013, Joe's Jeans acquired Hudson Clothing Holdings, a leading designer and marketer of women's, men's, and children's premium branded denim jeans, pants, jackets, and other bottoms for $97.6 million. The purchase doubled the size of the company's business and significantly enhances its growth potential across the wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels, both in the US and abroad. The combination of the two companies also brought supply chain benefits and is expected to generate cost savings. Hudson operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joe's Jeans.
