   Insulet wants to isolate an insolent disease. The medical device company manufactures an insulin pump for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Its disposable, waterproof product, called the OmniPod Insulin Management System, weighs a mere 1.2 ounces and adheres directly to the patient's skin, making it more discrete than most insulin infusion systems that typically clip to a belt or fit in a pocket. It also includes a handheld device to wirelessly program the OmniPod with insulin delivery instructions. The company sells the OmniPod system to customers both directly and through its distribution partners.

  <p>
   Insulet sells its products in markets, geographic and consumer, in which it can obtain the most lucrative third-party reimbursements. If patients are not reimbursed for the cost of using the OmniPod, it is much more difficult for the company to penetrate and sell in that market. It also must gain the trust of diabetics, as it counts on the adoption of its system as an alternative to traditional insulin management.

  <p>
   The company sells its products in the US, Canada, Europe, and Israel. Headquartered in Massachusetts, it also leases facilities in Florida, New York, and in Singapore and Canada.

  <p>
   The company markets its products to physicians, academic centers, and clinics specializing in the treatment of diabetes treatments, as well as directly to patients in the US market and abroad. The company grows its business with an aggressive marketing campaign meant to introduce the product to potential users and by entering licensing deals with larger pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to direct distribution in the US, Insulet has a five-year agreement with Ypsomed Distribution to distribute and sell the OmniPod System in about a dozen countries including Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In 2015 Insulet acquired the full rights to distribute OmniPod in Canada.

  <p>
   Due to rising sales, revenues have been increasing for the past five years; they have more than doubled since 2011. In 2015, revenue rose 12% to $324 million, thanks to increased OmniPod system sales as well as sales of other products through Neighborhood Diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Insulet spent about half of its existence as a development-stage company before it began selling OmniPod, so it has yet to experience a profit. Since its inception in 2000, it has continued to accumulate losses as operating expenses outweigh earnings. In 2015, net loss increased 43% to $73 million due to higher sales and marketing costs as well as research and development costs surrounding new development projects. As of December 31, 2015, Insulet's accumulated deficit totaled $651.5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   After seeing an operating cash inflow in 2014, the company once again saw an outflow in 2015. That year's net loss led to an outflow of $12 million.

  <p>
   The company's objective is to obtain and maintain long-term profitability by gaining approval on a next generation version of the OmniPod, continuing to reduce its per-unit production costs on the existing OmniPod, and increasing sales in international markets. The next-generation OmniPod will feature increased ease-of-use, functionality, and an even smaller size.
  </p>
  <p>
   Insulet is also researching new ways to use the OmniPod. It entered an agreement to explore combining the OmniPod with
   <company id="107160">
    LifeScan
   </company>
   's OneTouch blood glucose monitoring technology and
   <company id="137746">
    DexCom
   </company>
   's continuous glucose monitoring systems, and it is partnering with
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   to develop a version of the OmniPod for use with Lilly's Humulin drug. It is also working with Eli Lilly to develop a delivery mechanism for U200 concentrated insulin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other objectives of Insulet include expanding its customer base in the US and other countries. Insulet continues to negotiate contracts establishing reimbursement for OmniPod with national and regional third-party payers, which are integral to the company's goal of reaching and maintaining profitability. It also works to improve consumer awareness and adoption of its offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   To further focus on its OmniPod business, the company sold its Neighborhood Diabetes unit to Liberty Medical in early 2016.
