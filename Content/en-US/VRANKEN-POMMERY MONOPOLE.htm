        <p>
   Vranken-Pommery Monopole has corked the notion that fine champagne does not belong on a supermarket shelf. Founded in 1976, the company has built its name selling its libations at grocery retailers -- a market its older competitors have historically shunned. It makes the Charles Lafitte, Cuvée Diamant, Demoiselle, Heidsieck &amp; Co Monopole, Pommery, and Vranken brands of champagne. It also owns the ROZÈS, San Pedro Das Aguias and Terras do Grifo port brands. Vranken-Pommery operates subsidiaries in Belgium, Germany, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. The company was founded by founder Paul-François Vranken. CHC, a holding company owns 70% of the company.
