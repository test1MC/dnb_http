   Zygo knows how to measure precisely what its customers need. The company makes high-precision electro-optical inspection and measurement equipment, automation systems, and optical components. One of its main products is the interferometer, which measures surface shape, roughness, and other characteristics by means of two light beams ("zygo" is Greek for "pair") used to produce 3D surface profiles for comparing test objects with control samples. Zygo also offers optical design, testing, certification, and assembly services. Its products are used primarily for quality control in the semiconductor and industrial manufacturing markets. In 2014
   <company id="10018">
    AMETEK
   </company>
   acquired Zygo.

  <p>
   AMETEK paid about $280 million for Zygo in 2014. The deal brought together complementary metrology product lines, giving AMETEK a full range of metrology offerings.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company operates two divisions -- metrology solutions and optical systems. Metrology solutions, which accounts for two-thirds of sales, makes 3-D surface metrology products, precision positioning systems, and custom-engineered products. The optical systems segment provides product development and manufacturing services for a variety of semiconductor, defense, laser fusion research, and life science applications.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Zygo has sales and service centers across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. More than half of sales come from the Americas, while customers in Asia account for 35% of sales, and Europe makes up the remaining 12%.
  </p>
  <p>
   The metrology solutions segment has two manufacturing plants in the US (Arizona and Connecticut). International plants are located in Canada, China, Germany, and Taiwan. The optical systems segment has manufacturing plants in Arizona, California, and Connecticut.

  <p>
   Zygo sells its products largely through a direct sales force, as well as through independent agents and distributors. Customers include
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   (9% of sales), which also is a minority shareholder in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its sales and marketing strategy is to establish strategic relationships with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end-users in targeted industries -- such as the semiconductor, optical test, precision machining, photovoltaic, medical, defense and aerospace, and industrial markets.

  <p>
   Overall sales fell 10% in fiscal 2013 (year-end June) to $149 million. That year both the metrology solutions and the optical systems segments both experienced decreased sales, primarily due to reduced capital spending by automotive and semiconductor customers. Geographically, only Japan saw any revenue growth. Profits also fell to $7 million, down 81% from $43 million in 2012, when the company had to pay more in income taxes after enjoying a tax deferment in 2012.

  <p>
   Carl Zanoni, Paul Forman, and Sol Laufer founded Zygo in 1970 with funding from
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   . (Zanoni served as an SVP and director until 2009, while Forman and Laufer both retired earlier.) The company intended to provide cutting-edge optical fabrication manufacturing services. Unsatisfied with the interferometers available, they decided to build and sell their own.
  </p>
  <p>
   Zygo introduced the modular GH-1 Interferometer in 1972 and unveiled an improved version in 1978 that worked in conjunction with a data reduction system to extract more usable information from the measurements. The company went public in 1983 and introduced a user-programmable version of its interferometer in 1985. In 1995 Zygo introduced the industry's first tester able to measure the flying height of magnetic read/write heads.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the next two years, Zygo acquired makers of manufacturing quality control equipment. These included NexStar Automation (automation and parts handling equipment) and Sight Systems (data storage yield improvement). In 1998 Zygo became a global distributor of
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   's Atomic Force Microscope for measuring submicron features. In 1999 process control industry veteran Bruce Robinson replaced Gary Willis as president and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company purchased Firefly Technologies, which became subsidiary Zygo TeraOptix, and entered the optical communications market. Zygo sold its Automation Systems Group, which made handlers, sorters, and inspection systems for wafer reticles, to
   <company id="42833">
    Brooks Automation
   </company>
   the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company put Zygo TeraOptix up for sale in 2002 (there were no takers in the telecom bust of the time) and left the optical communications business. In 2003 it formed the Zygo Applied Optics group to focus on business opportunities in the aerospace and military electro-optic systems market. The following year the company sold the vacant facility that once housed Zygo TeraOptix. Later in 2004 Zygo opened a sales and support office in Shanghai.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company restated financial results for six consecutive quarters, from July 2004 through December 2005, due to inadvertent accounting errors for intercompany revenues from foreign operations, its Singapore and Taiwan subsidiaries in particular. The restatement knocked about $800,000 out of fiscal 2005 sales, and $500,000 from sales in the first half of fiscal 2006. Zygo also restated results from the four previous fiscal years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company announced plans to merge with rival
   <company id="13295">
    Electro Scientific Industries
   </company>
   (ESI), but the deal fell through in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bruce Robinson retired as CEO in 2009 and was succeeded by Chris Koliopoulos, the former CEO of
   <company id="47045">
    ADE
   </company>
   .
