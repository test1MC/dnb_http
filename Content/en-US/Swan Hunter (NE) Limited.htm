   Swan Hunter (NE), which dates back to 1842, once built, repaired, and converted ships at its Wallsend shipyard on the Tyne river and its Port Clarence yard on the Tees River. The first to build tankers of more than 250,000 tons on a slipway, the Wallsend shipyard constructed ships in a floating dock that minimized risks during launches. The Port Clarence yard specialized in structures for the offshore industry and for other shipbuilders.
