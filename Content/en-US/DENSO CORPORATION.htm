   DENSO knows: When building cars, the whole is very little without its parts. Among the world's largest automotive parts manufacturers, DENSO supplies OEM and aftermarket components and systems for most of the world's carmakers. Its six product groups make systems for powertrain control, information and safety, electric, electronic, small motors, and thermal systems. Its lines range from automotive air conditioning systems to radiators and spark plugs. The Information and Safety Systems arm develops car navigation and collision avoidance systems. Non-auto, industrial systems and consumer products are also made; subsidiary DENSO WAVE makes bar code readers, industrial robots, and programmable logic controllers.

   Originally the in-house parts supplier for
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota
   </company>
   , Nippondenso Co. (the predecessor to DENSO) was spun off by Toyota in 1949 because Toyota no longer wanted the burden of Nippondenso's troubled financial performance. Nippondenso remained dependent upon Toyota for sales, and members of Toyota's controlling family, the Toyodas, remained involved in management. Nippondenso established a technological partnership with Germany's
   <company id="41437">
    Robert Bosch
   </company>
   in 1953.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its plan to become a major supplier to North American carmakers, in 1966 Nippondenso established a sales office in Chicago and branch offices in Los Angeles and Detroit. It then turned to Europe, establishing a branch office in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1970. The following year the company established its first overseas subsidiary, Nippondenso of Los Angeles (now DENSO Sales California). In 1972 the company established three more foreign subsidiaries, in Australia, Canada, and Thailand. A European subsidiary (now DENSO Europe) was established in the Netherlands in 1973.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nippondenso began consignment production for what is now known as Asmo Co., a maker of electric motors, in 1978. In 1984 the company joined with Allen Bradley Co. (US) to develop factory automation equipment. That year the predecessor to DENSO Manufacturing Michigan, one of the company's largest international subsidiaries, was established. Nippondenso expanded into Spain in 1989 by opening a plant in Barcelona.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company formed NDM Manufacturing (now DENSO Manufacturing UK), a joint venture (25%-owned) with
   <company id="99474">
    Magneti Marelli
   </company>
   of Italy, for the manufacture of automotive air conditioning and heating systems. The following year Nippondenso and
   <company id="11379">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   formed a joint venture for the development of integrated circuit (IC) cards.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nippondenso established several Chinese manufacturing joint ventures during the mid-1990s. In 1994 the company was recognized by the
   <i>
    Guinness Book of Records
   </i>
   as the maker of the world's smallest car, the DENSO Micro Car.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to DENSO CORPORATION in 1996. In 1999 it acquired the rotating machines business of Magneti Marelli. The next year DENSO agreed to buy out Magneti Marelli's share in the companies' automotive air conditioning and heating joint venture (the deal was completed in 2001).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 DENSO ceased production of wireless phones in order to focus on making onboard car information systems. Also in 2001 the company merged its industrial equipment subsidiaries (bar code scanners and factory automation robots), and spun them off as majority-owned subsidiary DENSO Wave.
  </p>
  <p>
   DENSO joined forces with Robert Bosch GmbH in 2003 to form a joint venture for the development of car navigation and multimedia systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 DENSO added four new Chinese production facilities that make navigation systems, air conditioner compressors, instrument panels, and oil filters. It has also established technical centers in China and Thailand.
