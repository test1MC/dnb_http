   NVE is definitely a spin zone, and one with a certain magnetism. The company develops sensors incorporating spintronic (short for spin-based electronic) materials called giant magnetoresistors (GMR). Spintronics differ from conventional electronics in that they use the spin -- rather than the charge -- of electrons to store and transmit data. The company's sensors are used in aerospace, automotive, currency verification, and factory automation applications. In addition to analog and digital GMR sensors, NVE offers magnetic couplers, magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), and custom-designed modules. Customers include the US government,

   While there's a good deal of science involved in spintronics, NVE calls itself a leader in the practical commercialization of the technology. The company's Its designs of its products are based on either giant magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance. In giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices, resistance changes due to conduction electrons scattering at interfaces within the devices. With tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), sensor products detect the strength or gradient of magnetic fields and are often used to determine position or speed. The company has five lines of coupler products: cost-effective IL500-Series couplers; IL600-Series passive-input couplers; IL700/IL200-Series high-speed couplers; and IL4/IL3-Series isolated network couplers; and IL800-Series top-of-the-line couplers.

   The company makes 98% of its revenue from the sale of its products with the other 2% filled in by research and development contracts.

  <p>
   The company has customers more than 75 countries. About 45% of NVE's sales are made to European companies with US customers accounting for 39% of sales and those in Asia, 14%. International sales increased about 24% in 2015 (ended March) with the US increase at just under 7%.

  <p>
   NVE had its second best year for revenue and best year for profit in 2015 (ended March). Revenue jumped about 18% to $30.6 million in 2014. (It had $31.2 million in revenue in 2011). Increased sales to existing customers pushed product sales 17% higher in 2015 and a better environment for government research helped contract R&amp;D zoom 63% higher. Net income hit $14 million in 2015, a 29% increase from 2014. The increase in sales boosted profit as did a reduction in sales and marketing and R&amp;D expenses. The company completed some product development activities in 2015 and reallocated resource toward its contract R&amp;D business. Cash flow from operations rose to $15 million in 2015 from about $12 million in 2014.
