   Torakusu Yamaha first repaired medical instruments. But while repairing a broken organ, he decided he could make his own. His first attempt did not have good sound, but continuous work over a four-month period led to a new organ -- completed in 1887 -- that was highly praised. He established Yamaha Organ Manufacturing Company in 1889. In 1897, as production grew, Yamaha incorporated the company as Nippon Gakki (Japan Musical Instruments). Nippon Gakki began producing upright pianos in 1900 and grand pianos in 1902.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1920 the company diversified into the production of wooden airplane propellers (based on woodworking skills used in making pianos) and added pipe organs (1932) and guitars (1946) to its line of musical instruments. Genichi Kawakami, whose father had managed the company since 1927, took over in 1950.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company formed its first overseas subsidiary, Yamaha de Mexico, in 1958. Under Kawakami's leadership, Nippon Gakki became the world's largest producer of musical instruments, developing Japan's first electronic organ, the Electone, in 1959. Kawakami conducted the company's movements into wind instruments (1965), stereos (1968), microchips (1971), and furniture (1975). He established the Yamaha Music Foundation in 1966 to oversee the company's music schools. By 1982 people in the Americas, Europe, and Asia could buy Yamaha-brand products locally.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nippon Gakki undertook further diversification, particularly into customized chips for CD players. In 1983 it introduced a powerful, but affordable synthesizer. The company changed its name to Yamaha in 1987. It opened a facility in China two years later. Yamaha emphasized exports of electronic instruments and the production of integrated circuits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Until 1992 three generations of the Kawakami family dominated Yamaha. After a failed attempt by heir apparent Hiroshi Kawakami to cut back Yamaha's workforce through early retirement, the manufacturer's in-house labor union revolted. Kawakami was replaced by Seisuke Ueshima, a Yamaha veteran who set out to work on a combination of product innovation and corporate restructuring. Ueshima made a pact with the unions to keep most factory workers, lay off 30% of its Japanese administrative staff, and cut overseas employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company launched a joint licensing program with
   <company id="40442">
    Stanford University
   </company>
   for the Sondius-XG sound synthesis technology; the two institutions agreed to share royalties from the technology, which provides realistic sound quality for musical instruments and computer games.
  </p>
  <p>
   Undergoing sluggish sales of electronic parts, in 1999 Yamaha stopped producing magnetic heads for hard disk drives, shut down a semiconductor plant, and trimmed its workforce by giving 11% of its employees early retirement. In 2000 the company introduced a bamboo guitar that could help slow the depletion of hardwoods and debuted its Super "Melo-Ring" for cellular phone users. That same year, Shuji Ito was named president of Yamaha. The company launched a high-resolution projector for home theater use in 2001. Genichi Kawakami, the 90-year-old former president of Yamaha, died in 2002.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2003 the company decided to exit from the CD recorder market to focus more on high-end home theater systems. Also that year Yamaha's Electronics Marketing Corporation began operations and the Hangzhou Yamaha Musical Instruments Co. was founded in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its position in the music-creation market, Yamaha acquired Steinberg Media Technologies (a division of
   <company id="42285">
    Pinnacle Systems
   </company>
   ) in late 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2008 Yamaha bought out the founders of NEXO, a leading French manufacturer and seller of professional acoustic speaker systems, making the firm a subsidiary. It also sold off several of its resorts after having logged deep sales drops in its recreation segment.
