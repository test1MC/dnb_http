   Like most companies in the manufacturing sector, CalsonicKansei North America grows by adding to its manufacturing capacity and investing in its equipment and infrastructure. In late 2013 it announced plans to invest $110 million and add 1,200 new manufacturing jobs across its facilities in Lewisburg, Shelbyville, and Smyrna, Tennessee. It is investing some $50 million at its Lewisburg facility, which manufactures electronic components for meters, inverters and dash electronics, and plastics components for interiors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The investment in Lewisburg includes the construction of a new 300,000 sq. ft. warehouse facility; it is investing nearly $58 million at its Shelbyville facility, which manufactures exhaust units, catalytic converters and manifolds. Around $2 million will go toward its Smyrna facility, which is located within the Nissan plant and places Calsonic products into the Nissan vehicles.
