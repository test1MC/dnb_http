   Garmin's roadmap for growth has its research and development operation as its north star. The company has more than 3,400 people -- about a quarter of overall employment -- working on new products. The company spent 8% more on R&amp;D in 2015 from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   While in-house R&amp;D is important, Garmin also tracks down and acquires technologies that help it expand it product portfolio and market penetration.
