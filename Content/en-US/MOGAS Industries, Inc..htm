   The more industries there are, the more MOGAS Industries is in demand. The family owned company makes metal ball valves for mining, power, process, and special industrial applications. Serving industries where ball valves have to function well in harsh environments, MOGAS Industries has experience in working with abrasive particulates, acidic anhydride, corrosive media, heavy solids build-up, and viscous sludge. The company's engineers visit a client's site, tour the plant's valve boneyard, and discuss plant operations with end user personnel as part of its overall design and manufacturing package. It also provides equipment cleaning services.
