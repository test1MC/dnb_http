   Cuisine Solutions began in 1972 as Ile France, which sold baguettes to restaurants in the Washington, DC, area. It was renamed Vie de France, and by 1974 it had bakeries in Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. Needing money to expand, the company allowed Jean-Louis Vilgrain, of France's Grands Moulins de Paris, to buy a 26% stake in the company; he became chairman and CEO in 1977. In 1979 Vie de France created a chain of cafe/restaurants that were soon franchised. It went public in 1984.

  <p>
   In 1990 Vie de France opened its first
   <i>
    sous vide
   </i>
   plant in Virginia. The next year Stanislas Vilgrain, son of the chairman and head of the
   <i>
    sous vide
   </i>
   operation, was named president and COO. The company's bakeries and restaurants were sold to Vie de France Yamazaki (an unrelated Japanese business) in 1991 and 1994, respectively. In 1994 Vie de France opened a
   <i>
    sous vide
   </i>
   plant in Norway.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company struggled with high costs and operating losses throughout the mid-1990s. In 1997 Vie de France restructured its sales operation to focus on the banquet industry and beefed up its internal sales team. It also adopted a new name -- Cuisine Solutions. In 1998 the company completed its reorganization process and began pursuing international expansion. It acquired a
   <em>

   </em>
   plant in France in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 1998 joint venture with Sanoli Indústria e Comércio de Alimentacão to launch Cuisine Solutions Brazil also enhanced its global presence; however, due to legal difficulties with its partner, the company terminated its activities in Brazil in 2002. Cuisine Solutions also exited its Norway manufacturing operations in 2004 due to a lack of profitability; it transferred its seafood operations to Cuisine Solutions Chile, in which it acquired a minority stake.
