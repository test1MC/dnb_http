   By joining forces, Nissan Forklift (a subsidiary of
   <company id="41879">
    Nissan Motor Co.
   </company>
   ) and TCM America (a unit of
   <company id="119621">
    Hitachi Construction Machinery
   </company>
   ) became the seventh-largest lift truck maker in the world. The merged company will focus on growing its forklift business by adding new, more efficient products, and addressing its customers' logistical problems.

   In 2014 UniCarriers Americas improved its position in the South American market through the opening of a unit in Brazil. The company will first focus on its dealer network in SÃ£o Paulo, and then intends to grow its dealer partnerships in the Southeastern region of Brazil (including Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Espirito Santo).
