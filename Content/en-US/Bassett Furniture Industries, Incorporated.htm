   Bassett Furniture Industries is busy building a better furniture business. The company, founded in 1902, makes wooden and upholstered furniture for home use, featuring bedroom and dining suites, sofas, chairs, love seats, and home office furniture. Bassett sells its products primarily through some 94 Bassett Furniture Direct stores (more than half of which are licensed) and Bassett Home Furnishings locations. Bassett boasts about 55 company-owned stores located mostly in the southern and northeastern US. Operating in more than 20 states nationwide, Texas is Bassett's largest market by store count.

  <p>
   Upholstered furniture brings in 60% of Bassett's wholesale sales, with most of the rest coming from wooden pieces. Approximately 42% of its 2013 wholesale sales were generated from imported products, compared to 50% in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bassett has stepped up advertising spending in recent years reaching $15.6 million in 2014 from $14.8 million in 2013, and $13.3 million in 2012.

  <p>
   Bassett's revenue increased 6% in 2014 from 2013 to more than $340 million. The higher revenue came from six more Bassett owned-and-operated stores and growth of wholesale shipments outside the licensee network. Bassett's net income has lurched from loss to profit in the past 10 years, but the company posted a profit of $9.3 million in 2014 -- an 82% increase over 2013. The increase was attributed to the higher income. The company reported that cash flow from operations increased to about $30 million in 2014 from about $20 million in 2013.

  <p>
   The Bassett Furniture Company was founded in 1902 by brothers John, Charles, and Samuel Bassett and their brother-in-law Reed Stone. Their goal: to make affordable furniture out of the oak that grew so abundantly nearby. The first bed sold for $1.50. Associate companies were spawned in the 1920s, but in 1930 John brought the three Bassett furniture firms under one umbrella, Bassett Furniture Industries. Eight years later the firm introduced its hallmark Waterfall design. The company made truck bodies during WWII.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Spilman Sr. took charge of the company in the early 1960s. By 1971 Bassett's revenues were over $144 million. In 1972, with the acquisitions of E.B. Malone Bedding and National Furniture of Mt. Airy, the company operated 31 plants across the US. Acquisitions of smaller furniture companies continued through the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bassett's profits began a steady decline in 1992, coinciding with a slump in home furnishing sales. The company vertically integrated in 1994 when the first licensed Bassett stores opened. Bassett made the California Public Employees' Retirement System's list of the 10 worst companies (in terms of stock performance) for 1996 and 1997. Robert Spilman Jr. was named president and COO in 1997, and outsider Paul Fulton became chairman and CEO. Also in 1997, as sales continued to fall, Bassett trimmed its product lines, closed or sold 14 factories, and cut about 1,000 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold its mattress division to LIS Corporation, which agreed to produce Bassett-brand bedding under license. Bassett opened its first company-owned furniture stores in 1999 and then formed The Ladin Retail Group, a joint venture (51%-owned by Bassett) combining those stores with licensed stores operated by Phillip and Ronnie Ladin.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Spilman Jr. became CEO. Also that year Bassett announced it would consolidate some of its wood manufacturing operations and eliminate about 280 jobs; it cut 100 more jobs in March 2001. In August the company announced plans to increase levels of imported occasional tables and cribs, thus negatively impacting domestic production. In 2002 Bassett purchased five stores (in California and Virginia) from LRG Furniture. In February 2003 the company shut down a wood manufacturing plant in Georgia and laid off about 300 of its employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2003 Bassett's wholly owned subsidiary, Weiman Furniture, acquired certain assets of Preview Furniture. The same year Bassett acquired an additional 29% of LRG Furniture, bringing its total stake in the retailer to 80%. Bassett sold Weiman in 2006. In 2004 the company acquired the final 20% of LRG that it didn't own.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 2015, the company had 60 retail stores, which provided 49% of revenue.
