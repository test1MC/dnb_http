   What used to be Kodak moments are now Kodak print projects. But the concern for a crisp, clean image remains. Kodak, the inventor of the Brownie camera, has put consumer photography in albums on a shelf to focus on imaging for businesses. The company has staked its future on commercial printing. It makes presses and imprinting systems, as well as technology to print documents, publications, and product packaging for corporate customers. It also serves the motion picture industry with motion imaging products, services, and technology for studios, labs, and independent filmmakers. Founded in 1880 by George Eastman, Kodak emerged from bankruptcy in 2013 after restructurings made it a smaller company.

  <p>
   Two years post-bankruptcy Kodak refined its reporting structure into seven segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The biggest segment is Print Systems, which generates 61% of revenue. It sells printing plates to graphic arts and commercial print customers. From there the segments get smaller. Consumer and Film, which includes consumer inkjet products, motion picture and commercial films, synthetic chemicals, and brand licensing, account for 15% of revenue; followed by Enterprise Inkjet Systems, which serves inkjet printing customers, 10%, Micro 3D Printing and Packaging, which serve packaging customers and display OEM partners, 7%; Software and Solutions, which includes Kodak Technology Solutions, 6%; Eastman Business Park, which is the operations of the Eastman Business Park, 1%; and Intellectual Property Solutions, which includes licensing and R&amp;D services unrelated to the other segments.

  <p>
   Rochester, New York-based Kodak generates roughly 35% of its revenue from the US, and another 33% from the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. About 22% of total revenue comes from the Asia Pacific region, while the Canada and Latin America region produces another nearly 10%. The company has manufacturing operations in Rochester; Dayton, Ohio; Weatherford, Oklahoma; and Columbus, Georgia. Outside of the US, its manufacturing facilities are located in Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Graphics products and services are sold worldwide either directly through Kodak or indirectly through dealers. The company's motion picture products are sold directly to studios, independent filmmakers, and laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastman Kodak reduced its advertising spending to $8 million in 2015 from $13 million in 2014 and $20 million in 2013.

  <p>
   <em>
    Note: Upon emerging from bankruptcy, Kodak adopted fresh start accounting methods that are not comparable to financials in the years prior to 2014.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Kodak's revenue fell 14% to $1.8 billion in 2015 as all segments, business and geographic, but one posted lower sales. The Software and Solutions business, 6% of revenue, reported 4% higher revenue in 2015. Otherwise Digital Printing and Enterprise revenue dropped 17% on lower ink sales for Consumer Inket Systems and inkjet component and electrophotographic units.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company didn't lose as much money in 2015 compared to 2014. The 2015 loss was $80 million, some $43 million less than 2014. Kodak reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs through actions that included job cuts, facilities consolidations, and renegotiations of vendor contracts

  <p>
   Eastman Kodak has been undergoing profound transformation as it's gone through heavy restructuring in recent years. The company reaffirmed its strategy in 2015 to focus on investments in imaging and printing products and services for businesses. Some of its target areas are in commercial inkjet, packaging and functional printing solutions (including Micro 3D), and enterprise services. During 2014, Kodak expanded its printing plate manufacturing to help it meet global demand and realigned the business into seven reportable segments instead of two with the intention of reducing costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Eastman Kodak has been looking to reposition itself in the film industry. In 2015, the company managed to get supply agreements with all six major Hollywood studios (20th Century Fox, Walt Disney, Warner Bros, NBC Universal, Paramount Pictures, and Sony Pictures). But with sales declining in the sector, the company has been pursuing other avenues in film production technologies in growth applications such as touchscreens for smartphones and tablet computers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, Kodak began looking for a buyer for its Enterprise Inkjet and silver metal mesh touch sensor businesses. The sale would include the KODAK PROSPER enterprise inkjet business, with its PROSPER Press Platform, PROSPER S Series Imprinting Systems, and related products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2016, Kodak signed a joint development agreement with Carbon to develop materials for Carbon's Continuous Liquid Interface Production technology.

   In its January 2012 bankruptcy filing, Kodak listed more than 100,000 creditors and debts totaling $6.75 billion. The

  <p>
   After developing a method for dry-plate photography, George Eastman established The Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company in 1884. In 1888 it introduced its first camera, a small, easy-to-use device that was loaded with enough film for 100 pictures. Owners mailed the camera back to the company, which returned it with the pictures and more film. The firm settled on the name Eastman Kodak in 1892, after Eastman tried many combinations of letters starting and ending with "k," which he thought was a "strong, incisive sort of letter." The user-friendly Brownie camera followed in 1900. Three years later Kodak introduced a home movie camera, projector, and film.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ailing and convinced that his work was done, Eastman committed suicide in 1932. Kodak continued to dominate the photography industry with the introduction of color film (Kodachrome, 1935) and a handheld movie camera (1951). The company established US plants to produce the chemicals, plastics, and fibers used in its film production.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Instamatic, introduced in 1963, became Kodak's biggest success. The camera's foolproof film cartridge eliminated the need for loading in the dark. By 1976 Kodak had sold an estimated 60 million Instamatics, 50 million more cameras than all its competitors combined.
