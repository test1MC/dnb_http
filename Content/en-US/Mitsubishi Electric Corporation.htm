   If it has an "on" switch, chances are Mitsubishi Electric makes it or makes a part for it. The company, part of the
   <company id="55546">
    Mitsubishi Corporation
   </company>
   , operates across five primary sectors: Energy and Electric Systems (power generation plants, supervisory systems, and escalators); Industrial Automation Systems (programmable controllers, measurement and control systems); Home Appliances (air-conditioning systems, TVs, and Blu-ray disc recorders); Information and Communication Systems (satellites, wireless systems, and network systems); and Electronic Devices (power devices, LCD displays). Mitsubishi Electric has operations in about 40 countries, but it earns the majority of its sales from Japan.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mitsubishi Electric has more than 20 manufacturing plants in Japan, as well as factories in other countries that include China, Malaysia, Thailand, the US, and the UK. Japan accounts for 66% of its net revenue. Other major markets include Asia (without Japan; 19%), North America (7%), Europe (7%), and others (1%).

  <p>
   Energy and Electric Systems, representing 25% of sales, which the company terms its social infrastructure business, includes building systems with elevators and escalators. The AXIEZ elevator features LED lighting and speed-adjustment technology that reduces waiting time. The segment also installs power plants for operations that range from utility companies to the individual sites of companies seeking in-house power generation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Automation Systems, making up 23% of sales, provides such products as programmable logic controllers under the MELSEC brand; the MELSERVO-J4 used for the manufacturing of semiconductors, flat panel display equipment, and industrial machinery; no-fuse circuit breakers and earth leakage circuit breakers for wiring protection and short-circuit protection; and electrical discharge machines for the manufacturing of automobiles, home electronics, and IT-related devices. Home Appliances, accounting for 19% of sales, includes KIRIGAMINE air conditioners, photovoltaic generation, heat pumps, LED lighting, RakuRaku-UD technology that enhances the performance of appliances, as well as products that go beyond the domestic market, such as digital signage and other visual equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Information and Communication Systems, 11% of sales, offers services that include information systems monitoring, server integration, and such products as satellite platforms, vehicle-mounted satellite communication equipment, broadband optical access systems, and digital closed-circuit TV systems. Electronic Devices, 5%, include products for cutting power losses and power consumption, integrated circuits for electric vehicles, high-electron mobility transistor amplifiers, and LCD modules for high brightness and contrast. The company's Other segment, 15% of sales, mainly comprises materials procurement and engineering.

  <p>
   Mitsubishi Electric's revenues climbed 7% from 2014 to 2015. The growth was fueled by increases across the majority of its segments, including Electronic Devices (23%), Industrial Automation Systems (17%), Information and Communication Systems (2%), Energy and Electric Systems (4%), and Energy and Electric Systems (4%).
  </p>
  <p>
   The uptick in Industrial Automation Systems sales was supported by demand in the Asian smartphone and tablet markets, as well as the automotive equipment markets in the developing world and North America. The surge in Electronic Devices sales was driven by strong demand for power modules in the industrial, commercial, automotive, and railcar markets.

  <p>
   Looking ahead, each Mitsubishi Electric segment has specific goals for product development. The Energy and Electric Systems segment is focused on research and development to improve rotating machines for generators, electric motors, switches and transformers, transportation systems, and elevators and escalators. The segment is also concentrating its R&amp;D efforts on IT for supervision and control, power information systems, and building management systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Industrial Automation Systems is focused on improving motors, mechatronics equipment, automotive components, electric power steering, and auto multimedia systems. Information and Communication Systems is emphasizing network systems for telecommunication operators and space systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Electronic Devices is tasked with product development in semiconductors while Home Appliances is focused on energy saving, recycling, universal design, and digital imaging systems. The Other segment is focused on work that helps the entire group. This segment's accomplishments include a robot system for bulk components and a multi-band power amplifier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each segment has also enjoyed some significant capital expenditures. Energy and Electric Systems received investments for more production capacity. Factory automation systems and automotive equipment operations were the focus for Industrial Automation. Home Appliance spending favored increasing production capacity for air-conditioning equipment. Improving research and development received the most capital expenditure focus in Information and Communication Systems and the Other segment. Electronic Devices concentrated on improvements for its power device operations.
