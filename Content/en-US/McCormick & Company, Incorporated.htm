  <p>
   McCormick operates two business segments: Consumer (more than 60% of sales in 2016), and Industrial (nearly 40%). Both segments manufacture, market, and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments, and other flavorful products worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's brands in the Americas include McCormick, Lawry's, and Club House. Its ethnic brands include Zatarain's Thai Kitchen, and Simply Asia. In the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, its major brands include the Ducros, Schwartz, and Karmis brands of spices, herbs, and seasonings, and its Vahin√© brand dessert line.

  <p>
   Maryland-based McCormick has sales, distribution, and production facilities throughout North America and Europe, with additional facilities in Australia, Central America, China, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Thailand. The US accounts for almost 60% of the company's total sales, while the EMEA region and emerging markets each account for more than 20%.

  <p>
   McCormick sells its products directly to customers, as well as through brokers, wholesalers, and distributors. Its products are marketed to the entire food industry, which includes retail outlets, food manufacturers, and foodservices businesses. McCormick's largest consumer business customer is
   <company id="42411">
    Wal-Mart Stores
   </company>
   , which accounted for more than 10% of consolidates sales in fiscal 2016 (ended November). On the industrial side of the business,
   <company id="11166">
    PepsiCo
   </company>
   also accounted for more than 10% of sales that year.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The spice maker has experienced unprecedented growth over the past several years as it's continued to expand its product lines and enter new markets. McCormick's sales rose by 3% to peak at a record-setting $4.41 billion in fiscal 2016 (ended November), primarily due to a 4% spike in Consumer segment sales. Overall the company saw higher volume, beneficial product mixes, and higher pricing, as well as gains on acquisitions for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income jumped 18% to peak at $472 million in 2016, another company milestone. The rise in net income was attributed to a decrease in  restructuring and impairment charges. Cash flow from operations rose from $590 million in 2015 to $658 million in 2016, primarily due the higher net income, a decrease in cash payments related to special charges, and the impact of higher employee benefit accruals.

  <p>
   While acquisitions and joint ventures are fundamental to McCormick's growth strategy to grow product lines and enter new geographic markets, the company has also attracted more customers by adding new products that cater to evolving consumer preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recent years, McCormick has launched a line of Hispanic seasoning blends along with a stable of some 450 salt-free products for US shoppers. In 2015, it introduced its lineup of 11 new classic fall recipes including its McCormick Slow Cooker Sauces, Gluten-Free Recipe Mixes, and Pure Pumpkin Pie Spice Extract, its Kitchen Basics Flavored Stock Cubes, and its new Thai Kitchen Coconut Cream.

  <p>
   One way the company has achieved historic growth is by acquiring rivals that are positioned around the globe. In 2016 McCormick paid $127 million to acquire Enrico Giotti SpA, an Italian flavor manufacturer located in Florence, Italy. The deal enhanced McCormick's industrial business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region while expanding the breadth of its value-added flavor products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2016 also picked up Australia-based Botanical Food Company, a manufacturer of the Gourmet Garden brand of packaged herbs. The brand complements McCormick's existing branded herb portfolio with the addition of chilled convenient herbs. McCormick plans to drive sales of the Gourmet Garden brand by expanding global distribution and building awareness with increased brand investment.
  </p>
  <p>
   McCormick the previous year expanded its Industrial product line after it purchased Brand Aromatics, a supplier of natural savory flavors, marinades, and broth and stock concentrates to the packaged food industry, for $62.5 million. Additionally that year, it expanded its spices and seasoning brands in Europe after buying Italy-based spice and seasoning supplier Drogheria &amp; Allimentari (D&amp;A) for $49 million.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   McCormick &amp; Company was founded in 1889 by 25-year-old Willoughby McCormick, who crafted fruit syrups, root beer, and nerve and bone liniment in his Baltimore home. He employed three assistants to hawk his wares door-to-door. His company soon expanded its product line to include food coloring, cream of tartar, and blood purifier. By 1894 McCormick was exporting, and two years later it acquired the F.G. Emmett Spice Company of Philadelphia, firmly committing itself to the spice industry. By the turn of the century, McCormick was trading around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Willoughby's nephew, Charles McCormick, joined the company as a part-time shipping clerk in 1912. When Willoughby died in 1932, Charles succeeded him as CEO. He increased employee wages, shortened the workweek, and established the Multiple Management system (still an integral part of the company's management structure), which solicited employee input. By 1933 McCormick was on a growth track that continued unabated through the 1930s. In 1938 Charles wrote a book expounding his participative management philosophy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened its first international office in 1940 and achieved coast-to-coast distribution seven years later with the acquisition of A. Schilling &amp; Co., producers of spices and extracts. In 1959 McCormick purchased Gorman Eckert &amp; Co., Canada's largest spice business and the precursor to Club House Foods. It acquired Gilroy Foods in 1961 and rival Baker Extract in 1962. From 1962 until its sale in 1988 McCormick ran a real estate subsidiary, Maryland Properties (renamed McCormick Properties, 1979).
  </p>
  <p>
   Charles died in 1970. Though the years following his death were characterized by acquisitions and joint venture agreements in the US and abroad, profits slumped until his son, Charles "Buzz" McCormick, took over as CEO in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1989 Australia's Burns, Philp began challenging McCormick by buying up spice companies in the US and Europe, including the Spice Islands and Durkee French brands. Buzz -- succeeded twice as CEO in the mid-1990s, only to return when one successor died and the other left for health reasons -- responded with a bruising battle for shelf space that led to Burns, Philp's near-collapse in 1997. The company also sold garlic and onion processing subsidiary Gilroy Foods, Minipack Systems (UK), and several smaller, noncore operations. In 1997 Buzz yielded the CEO's post -- for good -- to Robert Lawless.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's earnings were erratic in the 1990s, partly because of a price war with then-rival
   <company id="53766">
    Burns, Philp
   </company>
   , but also due to the decline of home cooking in the US. McCormick countered with increased advertising and a growing emphasis on industrial sales to flavor the foods eaten outside the home. McCormick also has been expanding internationally through its Decors spice business and operations in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Economic woes in Venezuela caused McCormick to cease manufacturing operations there in 1998. In 1999 Lawless succeeded Buzz as chairman. That year the company announced it would cut costs by eliminating 300 jobs (mostly overseas) and closing a British plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   McCormick's sweet victory over Burns, Philp was soured by an FTC investigation into its alleged practice of offering some grocery chains low prices in exchange for up to 90% of their shelf space for spices. The investigation brought scrutiny on a common supermarket practice known as slotting fees. McCormick settled with the FTC in 2000, agreeing not to illegally discriminate against retailers in its pricing. Also that year the company bought France-based Ducros (spices, herbs, dessert aid products) from B√©ghin-Say for about $380 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 McCormick's UK subsidiary acquired condiment maker Uniqsauces, adding the Beswicks and Hammonds, as well as the licensed Newman's Own brands to its European product line. That year the company also acquired New Orleans-style cuisine product maker Zatarain's. Saying that the packaging business was not a strategic part of the company, McCormick also sold its packaging business (Setco and Tubed Products) to
   <company id="10851">
    Kerr Group
   </company>
   in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acquisitions continued in 2004 with McCormick's purchase of C.M. van Sillevoldt and its Silvo brand of spices, herbs, and seasonings, which is sold in the Netherlands and Belgium. In 2006 the company consolidated its North American operations with the closure of its manufacturing facility in California.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 39% of McCormick's sales came from its international operations in 2005. The year was not the company's best, however, as a drop in vanilla prices and the effects of Hurricane Katrina both cut into sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its expansion via acquisitions, the company purchased Dessert Products International (DPI) in 2006. DPI markets the Vahine brand dessert toppings in Europe. It also purchased Simply Asia Foods that year for $97.6 million in cash. Simply Asia manufactures products under the Thai Kitchen and Simply Asia brands; its products include noodle and soup bowls, meal kits, coconut milk, and sauces and pastes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its well-known roster of brands, McCormick acquired Lawry's marinades and spice blends from
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   for $605 million in 2008; the deal represented McCormick's largest acquisition in company history. To buy Lawry's, however, the company was required by the
   <company id="139112">
    FTC
   </company>
   to sell its Season-All business, which it did -- to
   <company id="104200">
    Morton International
   </company>
   . The company also purchased Canada's largest honey business, Billy Bee Honey Products, for $75 million.
