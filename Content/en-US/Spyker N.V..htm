   Spyker (formerly Swedish Automobile) combines vroom-vroom with bling-bling. The Dutch automaker offers high-powered, hand-made sports cars for enthusiasts demanding a model built to their specification. A Spyker car -- with features including polished aluminum scoops, wide-mesh grill, jet-fighter-like glass canopy enclosure, quilted leather seats, and toggle switch controls -- typically costs between $200,000 and $300,000. Brand models produced at the company's manufacturing center in Zeewolde, Netherlands, include the Spyker B6 Venator, the Spyker B6 Venator Spyder, and the Spyker C8 Aileron. The company was founded in 1880.

   Spyker transports cars from its factory directly to dealerships, which are typically multi-brand retail outlets. The company looks for retail outlets that target clientele looking for high-end sports cars; such car dealers typically carry similar offerings such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Rolls Royce models.

   The company promotes new and older models through motor shows and concourses, as well as through ride and drive events.

   New car model development is key to Spyker's growth. In 2013, for instance, it launched its Spyker B6 Venator Concept, a new high-luxury sports car model.

        <p>
   The company also looks to partner on development and commercialization efforts. In 2012 Spyker formed two joint ventures with Chinese auto maker Zhejiang Youngman Passenger Car Group. Through the ventures, majority owned by Zhejiang Youngman, the companies will collaboratively develop and manufacture a new range of vehicles under the P2P and Phoenix brands.

   Branding strategy has varied over the years: The company operated as Spyker Cars following its 2004 IPO. It changed its name to Swedish Automobile in 2011 to reflect diversity after it bought
   <company id="52961">
    Saab Automobile
   </company>
   from GM for about $400 million; however, Spyker sold Saab's assets to
   <company id="162880">
    National Electric Vehicle Sweden
   </company>
   in 2012 after Saab filed for bankruptcy in 2011. The company then converted back to the Spyker name in 2012.

   The original Spyker Cars dates to 1898 when brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker, two Amsterdam coachbuilders, built their first Benz-engined car. In the same year the company built the famous golden state coach, still in use today, to commemorate the forthcoming coronation of the Dutch queen, Wilhelmina.
  </p>
        <p>
   To diversify production prior to World War I, it merged with the Dutch Aircraft Factory in 1914. To this day, Spyker cars are made with aircraft technology and design influences.
  </p>
        <p>
   It wasn't until 2005 that Spyker cars became available in the US.
