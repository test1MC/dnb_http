  <p>
   Virbac Corporation is the North American segment of the Virbac group, which typically accounts for about 15% of the Virbac group's overall sales worldwide. Virbac Corporation is based in Fort Worth, Texas, while its primary manufacturing plant is located in St. Louis, Missouri. The company also has customer support branches in communities across the US and Canada.
  </p>

  The company develops, makes, and distributes a broad range of products and services for the prevention and treatment of common pathologies in pets.

  <p>
   Virbac Corporation sells directly to US and Canadian customers, which include veterinary distributors, large retail chains, and pet store distributors. It employs field representatives and field veterinarians that serve customers on a regional basis.

  <p>
   Virbac's North American segment experienced a 36% growth in sales due to a 29% growth in the ethical revenues as a result of the launch of new products (Rilexine, Easotic and Effitix), as well as the growth of traditional products such as Iverhart and Soloxine.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company opened a new satellite office in Canada, with the aim of creating a separate affiliate in that country by 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   New product launches are also key to Virbac's strategic growth initiatives. In 2012 Virbac's US business obtained three major registrations for companion animal products: Effipro Plus, Suprelorin F and Rilexine tablets. It also introduced C.E.T.HEXTRA Premium Chews for Cats from Virbac Animal Health for clients to clean and protect their cat's teeth between professional cleanings; SUPRELORIN F, a treatment for adrenal gland cortical disease in ferrets; and EASOTIC suspension for canine ear infection treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Virbac's US subsidiary temporarily halted the commercialization of its internal antiparasitic Iverhart Plus due to the fact that some batches were (or might have been) below specification in potency level on a certain ingredient.
