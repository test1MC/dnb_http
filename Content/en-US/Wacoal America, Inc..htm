  </p>
  <p>

   Wacoal America's move from selling solely through retail partners to adding e-commerce is part of its strategy to raise brand awareness, better target its market, and enhance the in-store space. Each of its three sites provides a fit guide, glossary, and tips to help match the garment's style with an individual's body type and personal preference.

  <p>
   While Japanese parent
   <company id="46677">
    Wacoal
   </company>
   does not break out separate financials for Wacoal America, it reports that sales from its North Americana and Europe segment generated 18,245 million yen, representing a 55% increase in fiscal 2014 as compared to 2013. The company attributes the noteworthy gains to its aggressive efforts to expand US market share and enhance its product lineup among its major clients: department stores. It also benefited from expanding its sales areas and channels, selling its core brassiere products, and growing its Internet sales and business in Canada.

  <p>
   The US, long Wacoal's largest international opportunity, accounts for 49% of overseas business.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its parent's strategy, Wacoal America is extending its reach beyond traditional lingerie to attract a larger portion of the global apparel market. Wacoal America has launched shapewear designed to support certain areas of a woman's body according to her shape.
  </p>
  <p>
   While some of Wacoal America's competitors are scaling back on fabrications, such as laces and embroideries to cut costs, the company spends months in product development to maintain its reputation as having a noteworthy fit and finish.
  </p>
  <p>
   Citing that eight out of every 10 women are wearing the wrong size bra, Wacoal America hosts more than 800 fitting events nationwide. It has developed the Silhouette Analyzer, a built-in computer that draws an outline of a woman's shape that appears on a private monitor screen. A fitting specialist then suggests a bra and panty based on the customer's shaping needs. The analyzer then draws another silhouette for comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wacoal America has partnered with
   <company id="114575">
    Susan G. Komen for the Cure
   </company>
   for the past decade. Wacoal's support includes encouraging breast cancer screening and introducing bra lines designed for breast cancer patients.
