   If there were an Oprah Book Club for science, research, and education, books and journals published by John Wiley &amp; Sons might be frequently featured. The company publishes scientific, technical, and medical works, including journals and reference works such as
   <i>
    Current Protocols
   </i>
   and
   <em>
    Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology
   </em>
   . In total, it publishes more than 1,600 journal titles. It also produces professional and nonfiction trade books, and is a publisher of college textbooks. The firm publishes the
   <i>
    For Dummies
   </i>
   how-to series, too. Wiley has publishing, marketing, and distribution centers in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

   Wiley's recently streamlined its operating segments into Research, Professional/Trade, and Education.
  </p>
        <p>
   Accounting for almost 60% of revenue, the Research segment provides digital and print scientific, technical, medical and scholarly journals, reference works, books, database services and advertising. Its online component, Wiley Online, provides access to 4 million articles from 1,600 journals and 15,000 books, and hundreds of reference works and databases. The division's
   <company id="116211">
    Wiley-Blackwell
   </company>
   unit is a leading publisher of journals and books for the academic, research, and professional markets focused on science, technology, medicine, social sciences, and humanities.
  </p>
        <p>
   Professional/Trade publishes digital and print books, online assessment and training services, and test preparation and certification. It brings in about 20% of Wiley's revenue in helping financials analysts, and other professional, become chartered or certified.
  </p>
        <p>
   The other 20%-or-so of revenue comes from the Education segment. It, too, provides digital and print content as well as online program management service for higher education and course management tools.

        <p>
   Wiley has its headquarters in New Jersey and has operations elsewhere in the US as well as Canada, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The US accounts for just more than half of revenue with 14% coming from Asia and 7% from the UK.

   Wiley's revenue nudged up 1% to $1.78 billion in 2014 (ended April) from 2013. Contributions from recent acquisitions helped boost revenue. The company also saw growth in journal subscriptions and in digital books and other digital products. Net income jumped 11% to $160.5 million in 2014 from $144.2 million in 2013.

   In recent years, Wiley has divested assets in its Professional/Trade including
   <em>
    Frommer's
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Betty Crocker
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    Weight Watchers
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    CliffsNotes
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    Webster's New World
   </em>
   brands. Wiley has stated it is making the divestiture to accelerate its digital transformation, drive long-term growth, and focus on its core operations.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Part of Wiley's strategy is to acquire companies to open it to new markets or to fill gaps in the markets it serves. In 2014, made several acquisitions of this nature.
  </p>
        <p>
   About 67% of the company's biggest segment comes from subscriptions to scholarly and academic journals, which charge for access to the articles. There have been calls to provide access at least to research funded by the public. Several alternate journals have been started to provide open access to such research. Although Wiley has acknowledged that open access is a threat to its business model, it has not articulated an answer.
  </p>
        <p>
   Meanwhile, the company has found new sources of revenue in strategic partnerships and licensed content. Wiley is the exclusive global publisher of
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   and
   <company id="140920">
    Bloomberg Businessweek
   </company>
   branded books, marketed as "BLOOMBERG PRESS®, a Wiley imprint." In addition, the company publishes Meredith books in the lifestyles, pets, and education categories, and has the rights to publish a list of business and modern language textbooks from
   <company id="113006">
    Cengage Learning
   </company>
   .

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In 2014, Wiley acquired Elan Guides, an early-stage Chartered Financial Analyst test preparation company. Elan's CFA materials will be incorporated into Wiley's CPA Excel test preparation platform.
  </p>
        <p>
   Also in 2014, the company bought Profiles International for $48 million. Profiles provides pre-employment assessment and selection tools that enable employers to improve candidate selections and develop employees.
  </p>
        <p>
   In another 2014 acquisition, Wiley picked up CrossKnowledge Group Limited for $175 million in cash. CrossKnowledge focuses on leadership and managerial skills training and development. It offers subscription-based, digital learning services for small, medium, and big companies and universities. It has had 5 million end-users in 80 countries speaking 17 languages.
  </p>
        <p>
   Stepping back to 2013, Wiley acquired FIZ Chemie Berlin, a provider of online database products for organic and industrial chemists.

   Charles Wiley founded a bookstore when he was 25 years old in 1807 and began printing and marketing books for local authors in return for a share of the profits. Soon, prominent writers began meeting in the store's back room (known as "The Den"), which attracted more attention to the business. By the end of the Civil War, the firm (renamed John Wiley &amp; Sons, after Charles' son) had become an established publisher of books on science and technology. Wiley pioneered technical textbooks that became industry standards. In 1899 it published Charles Davenport's
   <i>
    Statistical Methods
   </i>
   and in 1947 Hans Liepmann's
   <i>
    Aerodynamics of a Compressible Fluid,
   </i>
   among others. The company went public in 1962.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1989, Wiley acquired Alan R. Liss, a publisher of scientific journals. Four years later Bradford Wiley II took over as chairman of the company. Wiley sold its Canadian high school and Australian primary school textbook subsidiaries the next year and bought the professional computer book line of QED Information Services and UK-based science publisher Belhaven. Wiley teamed with publisher Adweek Magazines in 1995 to print media and marketing books under the name Adweek Books. Also that year the company purchased the publishing operations of Executive Enterprises.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1996 Wiley acquired a 90% stake in Germany's VCH Publishing Group, boosting the company's presence in the scientific and technical journal markets. The company increased its Teutonic knowledge base in 1998 by buying German scientific book publisher Huthig Publishing. In addition, it bought the publishing business of Chronimed (which included about 80 titles), a provider of health care products and pharmacy services. Also that year Wiley started working with various online publishers on interactive quizzes in accounting and other educational fields.
  </p>
        <p>
   William Pesce was appointed president and CEO in 1998, succeeding Charles Ellis. In 1999 the company bought a number of college textbook titles from Pearson for $58 million, and later bought San Francisco-based business publisher Jossey-Bass from the same UK company for $82 million.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 the company bought
   <company id="57201">
    Hungry Minds
   </company>
   , publisher of the
   <i>
    For Dummies
   </i>
   series of how-to books, for about $185 million. The acquisition was the largest in the company's history at that time. It also bought Frank J. Fabozzi Publishing, a finance title publisher based in Pennsylvania.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 the company moved its headquarters from New York to Hoboken, New Jersey. That year the company acquired 250 teacher education titles from Prentice Hall Direct, part of
   <company id="104281">
    Pearson Education
   </company>
   , for $6.5 million. In 2005 the company sold Chronimed to MIM Corporation (now
   <company id="51404">
    BioScrip
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
        <p>
   Wiley expanded in 2007 with the acquisition of Blackwell Publishing, which became
   <company id="116211">
    Wiley-Blackwell
   </company>
   . It acquired Blackwell Publishing for $1 billion, the largest purchase in the company's history.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Stephen Smith replaced the retiring Pesce as president and CEO.
