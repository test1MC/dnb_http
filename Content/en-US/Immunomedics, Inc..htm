   Immunomedics develops monoclonal antibody (MAb) medicines to treat cancer, autoimmune conditions, and other diseases. Its lead product, epratuzumab, is in development for the treatment of lupus; biopharmaceutical firm
   <company id="93837">
    UCB
   </company>
   has licensed the drug for further applications in autoimmune diseases, but is exiting that partnership. Immunomedics is also conducting clinical trials for epratuzumab as an oncology treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Other drugs in clinical trials aim to treat various cancers, including pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma. It also makes diagnostic imaging products; its majority-owned IBC Pharmaceuticals develops radiotherapeutics for applications in oncology treatments.

  <p>
   The company also markets diagnostic imaging agent LeukoScan in Canada, Australia, and Europe; the product is being sold for the detection of bone infections. Another product, ImmuSTRIP, detects human anti-murine (mouse) antibodies (HAMA) in patients who may either have pre-existing HAMA or have developed HAMA in treatments.

  <p>
   Immunomedics operates its own bioreactor to produce its drug candidates used in clinical trials. The same facility in New Jersey also makes the diagnostic (LeukoScan) products. While the US accounts for more than half of revenues, the company also markets products internationally and has operating subsidiaries in the Netherlands (Immunomedics B.V.) and Germany (Immunomedics GmbH).

  <p>
   The company markets LeukoScan with its own sales force, but distributes the product through third parties. Logosys Logistik packages and distributes the product in Europe.

  <p>
   Immunomedics' revenues are primarily generated from license fees and other earnings from collaborators; as such, changes in partnerships tend to cause earnings to fluctuate. In fiscal 2015 (ended June), revenue fell 38% due to lower license fees and changes in the company's epratuzumab collaboration with
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   . Additionally, European sales of LeukoScan fell that year, further impacting revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has incurred significant operating losses since its formation. As of the end of fiscal 2015, it had an accumulated deficit of some $309.5 million. Net loss rose 35% to $48 million that year on lower revenue and higher R&amp;D expenses related to the firm's clinical trials. Also in fiscal 2015, the firm's operating cash outflow increased 27% to $39 million.

  <p>
   As it works to move its product candidates through development stages, Immunomedics often teams up with other companies. In 2016, UCB decided to terminate its collaboration with the firm for the development of epratuzumab for non-cancer indications. Immunomedics will take advantage of regaining the worldwide rights for the candidate by exploring additional capabilities. In 2013, it entered into a collaboration with Algeta ASA (which has subsequently been acquired by Bayer) for the development of epratuzumab in conjunction with Alget's proprietary thorium-227 alpha phamaceutical payload. The company has a handful of other candidates in clinical trial stages, and it is looking for additional partners to help fund the next stages of its development programs.

   Immunomedics is focusing less on its diagnostic imaging products, including imaging agent LeukoScan, in order to focus on its drug therapies.
