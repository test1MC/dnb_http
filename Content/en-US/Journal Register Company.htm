   You might say this company publishes all the local news that fits. Journal Register Company is a leading newspaper publisher with about 20 daily papers covering small towns and suburban areas in a half-dozen states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York. Its dailies, including the flagship
   <em>
    New Haven Register
   </em>
   (Connecticut), boast a combined circulation of more than 450,000. In addition, the company publishes about 150 non-daily papers and distributes news and information through more than 150 websites. Journal Register's more than 350 multi-platform products reach an audience of 21 million Americans each month. The company is owned by Alden Global Capital.

        <p>
   Journal Register delivers local news and information to 992 communities in 10 states. It operates in two top-ten media markets (Detroit and Philadelphia) and is prominent in Connecticut, Greater Cleveland, and the Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York.

   Like other newspaper groups, Journal Register built its portfolio of titles through a series of acquisitions that left the company heavily burdened with debt. Declines in readership and advertising revenue, which have affected the entire industry, forced Journal Register to seek Chapter 11 protection in 2009 to reorganize and restructure. Alden Global Capital, which owns part of
   <company id="140040">
    Philadelphia Media Network
   </company>
   and has a history of buying struggling newspapers, took control of Journal Register in 2011.
  </p>
        <p>
   The reorganized company focused on cutting operating expenses at its papers while investing in online distribution to reach readers. During its restructuring, Journal Register sold a dozen smaller papers and shoppers serving areas in Michigan. The disposal followed the sale of two Connecticut dailies,
   <em>
    The Bristol Press
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Herald
   </em>
   (New Britain), to publisher Michael Schroeder.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 Alden Global Capital created Digital First Media Inc., combining both Journal Register and MediaNews Group with the intent of cutting operating expenses and leveraging the combined scale and expertise in both companies. The move created a media entity with more than 880 multi-platform products in 18 States serving more than 57 million consumers per month.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Journal Register signed a "stalking horse" purchase agreement with 21st CMH Acquisition Co., an affiliate of funds managed by Alden Global Capital.
