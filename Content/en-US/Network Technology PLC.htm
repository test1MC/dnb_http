   Not one for cute or cryptic corporate names, Network Technology provides computer hardware, software, and related electronic devices. The company's Ringdale subsidiary produces goods ranging from printers to smart card readers, access control systems, scanners, and fax machines. Its Nextus unit provides contract manufacturing services, including circuit board printing, general machining, laser marking, and sheet metal work. Network Technology also specializes in LED lighting fixtures for commercial clients. It sells directly and through resale partners largely in Europe and the US.

  <p>
   Based in the UK, the company also has offices in the US, Singapore, and Japan. Customers in Europe and the US each generate about 37% of Network Technology's revenue. UK customers account for 9%.

  <p>
   In 2014, the Network Technology's revenue increased 6% to £4.42 million compared to £4.16 million in 2013, primarily due to increases in sales of its FollowMe printer management products in the US, Germany, France, and the UK and a slight increase in lighting sales in the US. Despite higher sales, Network Technology's net income tumbled 50% lower in 2014 due, in the main, to a near doubling of its tax payments for the year. The reduction in net income led to 30% lower cash flow from operations in 2014 from 2013.

   Network Technology expanded its sales staff in the US and UK to bolster sales in those markets and established a Ringdale presence in Japan to help improve the 3% of company sales the country generates.
