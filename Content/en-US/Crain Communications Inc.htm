   These Crains have been whooping it up in the publishing business for a long time. Crain Communications is a leading publisher of trade journals and weekly business newspapers with about 30 titles serving audiences mostly in North America, Europe, and Asia. Its portfolio covers such areas as the automotive industry (
   <em>
    Automotive News, AutoWeek
   </em>
   ), the financial sector (
   <em>
    Business Insurance, InvestmentNews
   </em>
   ), and media (
   <em>
    Advertising Age
   </em>
   ). Crain also publishes business journals in four major US cities (Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and New York City), and its publications host events such as the
   <em>
    AutoWeek
   </em>
   Virtual Green Car Show. The family-owned company was started by G. D. Crain in 1916.

   Crain Communications has built up its stable of trade journals over time, focusing on, and in most cases ultimately dominating, particular niche markets. Its
   <em>
    AutoWeek
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Automotive News
   </em>
   are must-reads for anyone following the auto manufacturing industry,
   <em>
    Pensions &amp; Investments
   </em>
   is the go-to source for financial services professionals, and
   <em>
    Advertising Age
   </em>
   (also known by the shortened moniker
   <em>
    AdAge
   </em>
   ) is the bible for creatives and marketers.

        <p>
   Like the rest of the media industry, Crain Communications has been shifting its focus away from print. Recent examples of this strategy include its conversion of
   <em>
    TelevisionWeek
   </em>
   magazine into TVWeek.com, a Web-only property, and the launch of
   <em>
    AutoWeek's
   </em>
   iPad app. In 2013 the company sold its monthly magazine Workforce Management and all of its assets, including workforce.com, to Chicago-based
   <company id="128594">
    MediaTec Publishing
   </company>
   . Crain Communications now produces more revenue from websites than from print subscriptions
  </p>
        <p>
   Crain Communications selected database management provider Omeda to build a corporate-wide Business Intelligence Database for all of its brands. The database will incorporate all of Crain's subscription fulfillment operations and drive its email marketing efforts via Omeda's integrated "Omail" suite. This database will be a key cornerstone to the future growth of the organization.

   G. D. Crain founded his publishing company in 1916 in Louisville, Kentucky, but quickly moved to Chicago. The firm produced two publications:
   <i>
    Class
   </i>
   (renamed
   <i>
    Business Marketing
   </i>
   ) and
   <i>
    Hospital Management
   </i>
   (sold in the 1950s). In 1930 the company launched trade magazine
   <i>
    Advertising Age
   </i>
   and adopted the name Advertising Publications Inc.
  </p>
        <p>
   Over time the company broadened its scope beyond advertising and in 1969 changed its name to Crain Communications. G. D. Crain led the company until his death in 1973. That year Rance Crain, G. D.'s elder son, became president; Crain's widow, Gertrude, became chairman; and Keith Crain (Rance's brother) was appointed vice chairman.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1986 Crain bought
   <i>
    Media World,
   </i>
   the UK's #1 media magazine at the time. By the early 1990s the company was publishing three magazines in Europe. It bought
   <i>
    RCR Radio Communications Report
   </i>
   (a wireless communications tabloid) in 1992.
  </p>
        <p>
   Keith took Gertrude's place as chairman in 1997 after her 1996 death. In 1998 Crain introduced two publications:
   <i>
    Global Wireless
   </i>
   for the wireless communications industry and
   <i>
    InvestmentNews
   </i>
   for the financial planning industry.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company bought
   <i>
    Automotive News International
   </i>
   in 1998, giving it a new presence in Asia and Latin America. In 1999 Crain acquired European media magazine
   <i>
    Media International
   </i>
   and turned it into a section of
   <i>
    Advertising Age International.
   </i>
   The following year it launched
   <i>
    BtoB,
   </i>
   a publication serving the business-to-business marketplace. The company advanced into Latin America in 2001, buying two Mexican business publications. (It closed the titles in 2007.) In 2002 the company renamed its
   <i>
    Electronic Media
   </i>
   magazine
   <i>
    TelevisionWeek
   </i>
   . It subesquently converted
   <em>
    TelevisionWeek
   </em>
   into a Web-only title.
  </p>
        <p>
   The media industry was particularly affected by the weak economy, and Crain was doubly hurt because many of the industries it covers, in particular the automotive sector, were hit hard. In response, Crain was forced to institute a number of cost-cutting measures in 2009, including staff and salary cuts. It also shuttered some titles, including
   <em>
    RCR Wireless News
   </em>
   .
