   Like the mythical messenger, Mercury Marine races. It is the world's #1 recreational marine-engine maker and marketer (by sales volume). The company builds sterndrive propulsion systems, including inboard and outboard engines under the Mercury MerCruiser, Mercury Racing, Zeus, and other brand names. It also makes a slew of marine parts and accessories under brands like Quicksilver and Kellogg Marine Supply. A remanufacturing arm offers replacement engines and service parts. Mercury Marine operates mainly in North America and the Asia/Pacific region. Its lineup is sold to boat builders, domestic and foreign governments, and the boat business of its corporate parent,

   , as well as indirectly to end-users.
