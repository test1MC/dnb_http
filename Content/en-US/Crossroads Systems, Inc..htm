   Crossroads Systems sets up shop where business and information intersect. The company provides storage networking equipment and data archiving systems used to manage and protect critical data. Its products include StrongBox (network attached storage appliance that uses linear tape file system technology), RVA (monitoring tape media and the condition of disk drives), and SPHiNX (protecting data by working as a network attached storage device or virtual tape library). Crossroads Systems sells directly to manufacturers, such as
   <company id="10723">
    HP
   </company>
   (45% of sales) and
   <company id="10491">
    EMC
   </company>
   , and through distributors. The company was founded in 1996.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Austin, TX, Crossroads Systems also has a sales office in Germany. International sales account for less than 10% of revenues.

  <p>
   Crossroads relies on a small number of distributors that offer its products as part of an overall data protection package, since many of its tape and disk products are incorporated into larger storage systems, such as those sold by
   <company id="41760">
    Fujifilm
   </company>
   . These distributors can also install and support its products on behalf of Crossroads; its internal sales force is only responsible for managing the OEM and strategic partner relationships.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company counts on a small number of customers; its top three account for more than two-thirds of sales. End users include small businesses, large corporations, and government agencies.

  <p>
   Crossroads has also been at a financial crossroads, with a history of losses and declining sales. Revenue was down 10% in 2013 to $12.6 million. Sales from its RVA and SPHiNX product lines experienced decreases, while its StrongBox product grew $2 million in its first full year of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products account for about 60% of sales, and the other 40% comes from companies that license its intellectual property. Crossroads has a software license and distribution agreement with HP where the computer giant pays Crossroads royalties and support fees; the deal makes up a huge chunk of Crossroads' revenues every year.

   Crossroads presents itself as a cost-effective storage company, compared with the likes of
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103884">
    Hitachi Data Systems
   </company>
   . The markets for its products are characterized by significant price competition and it anticipates that its products will continue to face price pressure.

   Crossroads delisted its shares from the Nasdaq National Market in 2006. The company cited the increased costs of operating as a publicly held company, especially those associated with complying with Section 404 of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the reason for the listing change. Trading of the company's shares shifted to the Pink Sheets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Crossroads Systems purchased assets of Grau Data Storage, namely its hierarchical storage management (HSM) software product called FileMigrator Agent, for less than $1 million in cash. That same year, the company cut its workforce (primarily in product development) by about 8% in order to reduce expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2011 Crossroads Systems began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
