   CRH has built its business upon building materials. Through subsidiaries (including
   <company id="111761">
    Oldcastle
   </company>
   ), the international company makes and distributes cement, concrete, aggregate, glass, and asphalt for commercial, residential, and infrastructure projects across the globe. CRH has some 4,000 operating locations and operates more than 700 wholesale and retail building supply stores under the Professional Builders Merchants, GAMMA, and Allied Building Products brands. With a presence in some 35 countries, CRH has become the top supplier of building materials in North America and the third-largest worldwide.

  <p>
   CRH's operations are divided into six segments, based on its largest service lines in the Americas and Europe. Its Europe Heavyside businesses (which make up 20% of CRH's total revenue) manufacture and supply cement, aggregates, precast and ready-mixed concrete, concrete landscaping, and asphalt products, while its Americas Materials businesses (nearly 30% of revenue) provide similar products in the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Europe Distribution businesses (20% of revenue) consist of its Do-It-Yourself (DIY), General Merchants and Sanitary, Heating and Plumbing (SHAP) businesses that supply bricks, cement, sanitary, heating, plumbing and other building products to consumers and small and medium-sized builders. Its Europe Lightside businesses (5% of revenue) make and sell construction accessories, shutters and awnings, fencing, and composite access chambers.
  </p>
  <p>
   CRH's Americas Products businesses (more than 15% of revenue) produce and sell concrete masonry and hardscapes, clay brick, packaged lawn and garden products, cement mixes, fencing, utility, drainage, and other construction products. Its Americas Distribution businesses (nearly 10% of revenue) supply exterior products like roofing and siding, as well as interior products like gypsum wallboard, metal studs, and acoustical ceiling systems.

  <p>
   While Ireland-based CRH operates in more than 35 countries, it generates more than 50% of its sales in the US. More than 10% of sales come from countries in the Benelux region (mainly the Netherlands), while less than 2% of its sales come from its home country. The company also supplies materials in emerging markets in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.

   CRH has struggled to grow its revenues and profits in recent years as the sluggish housing markets and overall economies across Europe have held back demand for its products.
  </p>
  <p>
   CRH's sales rose by 5% to €18.9 billion ($23 billion) in 2014, mostly thanks to higher demand for its products in the US as the housing market and overall economy picked up steam. Business in Europe picked up as well thanks to favorable early season weather, while like-for-like sales picked up by 6% in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher sales and gains from the sale of discontinued operations in 2014 pushed CRH's profits up to €582 million ($707 million), compared to a loss of €296 million in 2013. CRH's operating cash levels jumped by 13% to €1.2 billion ($1.46 billion) thanks to higher cash earnings.

  <p>
   Since the company's formation in 1970, acquisitions have been a key part of CRH's growth strategy. The company has historically targeted growth across all business divisions in both developed and emerging regions, making strategic bolt-on acquisitions each year. After a brief break from acquisitions after the financial crisis, CRH has resumed making acquisitions, making its biggest deal yet in 2015 after purchasing cement facilities from rivals

    Lafarge
   </company>
   and
   <company id="91789">
    Holcim
   </company>
   to boost its production capacity and geographic reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company is growing in some areas, it is making cuts in others -- particularly in the US. In 2014, the company announced a multi-year divestment program intended to streamline operations to prepare for future growth and make acquisitions that align with that goal. That year it divested 16 units, realizing total proceeds of €350 million; most had been bolt-on acquisitions for its existing operations in the Americas. Late in 2014, CRH also announced plans to sell its UK clay and concrete businesses and its US clay business to European funds managed by Bain Capital for £414 million.

  <p>
   In August 2015, CRH purchased cement assets from Holcim Ltd. and Lafarge SA for a total of €6.5 billion ($7.3 billion), marking its largest acquisition to date. The deal bolstered the company's production capacity and expanded its operations in Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and several countries in Europe.
