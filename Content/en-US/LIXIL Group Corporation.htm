  <p>
   LIXIL experienced a 3% bump in revenues from 2014 to 2015, primarily due to increased sales from its distribution and retail business. It also generated additional revenue from Asia and from a previous acquisition it made.

  <p>
   The company has achieved revenue growth through the help of acquisitions. In 2013 LIXIL purchased SD Americas Holding Corp., the parent company of American Standard Brands (ASB), for $542 million. ASB is a leading North American manufacturer of a wide range of high quality kitchen and bath products. The deal enhanced LIXIL's core offerings and significantly improved its position in the North American market.
