   San Diego-based PETCO Animal Supplies, through
   <company id="137426">
    PETCO Animal Supplies Stores
   </company>
   , operates stores in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. PETCO expanded to Mexico in 2013 with stores in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

  <p>
   In addition to its superstores, PETCO operates 100-plus smaller format shops, designed for neighborhoods, called Unleashed by Petco (launched in 2009). The fast-growing neighborhood format -- which added 38 stores in 2013 -- provides a tailored assortment of mostly dog and cat products focused on natural foods. It also offers services, such as dog training and grooming, vaccinations, and pet parties.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also operates ten Pooch Hotels, for pet daycare and boarding. Beyond pet supplies, PETCO stores offer services including dog training, grooming, vaccinations, pet photography, insurance, and online pet first aid.

   PETCO is expanding internationally. After entering Mexico in 2013 through a partnership with

   </company>
   the chain expects to operate 50 stores throughout Mexico and Latin America by 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   At home, the company is barking up the tree of main rival

   </company>
   via organic growth and acquisitions. In 2014 it announced plans for a new corporate headquarters in San Diego. The facility consolidates two separate locations in Miramar and Scripps Ranch, and creates a central facility to help support its national network of stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   PETCO's nonprofit organization, the Petco Foundation, has raised more than $125 million since its founding in 1999 to help promote and improve the welfare of companion animals (helping find homes more than 400,000 animals a year).

   PETCO was founded in 1965.

  <p>
   PETCO evolved from Upco, a suburban San Diego veterinary supply store opened in 1965. In 1979 it moved into mainstream pet supplies and changed its name to PETCO Animal Supplies. It had 40 stores by 1988, when it was bought by the Spectrum Group and the
   <company id="40463">
    Thomas H. Lee Company
   </company>
   . That year PETCO bought two pet supply chains, more than tripling its store count. Management then began a strategy of having periodic, heavily promoted sales; however, this raised advertising costs and made customer traffic irregular. By 1990 PETCO was in trouble.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chain installed a new management team headed by then CEO Brian Devine. It launched an everyday-low-pricing strategy for its popular premium pet food lines that increased traffic and resulted in more impulse purchases of toys and grooming supplies. Sales stabilized, and by the time PETCO went public in 1994, it had 198 stores. Over the next five years, the firm made 19 acquisitions, adding 208 stores in 28 states. Yet integration of new stores proved costly and competition had heated up. Merger and acquisition costs contributed to losses in 1997-98.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 PETCO harnessed its acquisitive pace, adding only four stores. Still, 1999 profits were again affected by merger costs relating to purchases made in 1997. In 1999 PETCO took a 26% interest in e-commerce firm Petopia.com, looking to mark its territory in the already dog-eat-dog online pet-supply market.
  </p>
  <p>
   A poor stock showing led the company to accept a 2000 buyout offer from
   <company id="55199">
    Leonard Green &amp; Partners
   </company>
   and Texas Pacific Group. The acquisition was completed for nearly $600 million. Late that year the company bought the 74% it didn't already own in Petopia.com and subsequently merged it with existing PETCO online operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in February 2002. In November, PETCO was named in a lawsuit filed by the San Francisco city attorney's office, alleging that some PETCO employees didn't properly care for pets being sold at the company's two San Francisco stores. The next month Petco settled a California lawsuit that accused the company of improperly denying overtime pay to store managers and assistant store managers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 PETCO spent some $15 million in its stores to supply more boutique pet items, such as designer Michael Simon's fashion petwear, Burberry dog carriers, and $200 cat houses.
  </p>
  <p>
   PETCO Animal Supplies holding company was formed in early 2005. The company went private in 2006 after two buyout firms acquired it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was affected in early 2007 by a recall of pet foods made by Menu Foods, a manufacturer whose products contained a wheat gluten that had been contaminated with the chemical melamine. The affected foods were linked to pet illnesses and deaths across the country. PETCO,
   <company id="16273">
    PetSmart
   </company>
   , and other pet retailers, were named in several lawsuits for distributing tainted products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the chain launched a smaller-format store better suited to neighborhoods, called Unleashed by Petco.
