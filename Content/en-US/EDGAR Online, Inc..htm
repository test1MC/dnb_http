  <p>
   In the mid-1990s husband-and-wife team Marc and Susan Strausberg saw an opportunity to provide easy and inexpensive Internet access to the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval) database. They founded Cybernet Data Systems in late 1995, just as the SEC was in the process of requiring all US public companies to file documents electronically. In early 1996 the company launched its EDGAR Online website, through which customers could access year-end and quarterly reports, proxy statements, and other SEC documents. Cybernet expanded its Internet presence that year through distribution partnerships with companies such as Yahoo!
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Cybernet established its EDGAR Online Investor Relations service, which provided co-branded websites for publicly traded companies to present their SEC filings. In 1998 the company introduced EDGAR Online People, which allowed customers to search through SEC filings using an executive's name. It continued to build distribution partners that year, securing deals with CNET (which was later absorbed into CBS Interactive) and MarketWatch.com (now MarketWatch).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cybernet changed its name to EDGAR Online, Inc., in 1999. That year that company unveiled its IPO Express service. In May 1999 the company went public. Later that year it acquired Partes Corporation (renamed FreeEDGAR.com), which provided free access to SEC filings, in a deal designed to increase EDGAR Online's user base by more than 50%.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 EDGAR Online inaugurated its IPO Express2go service delivering IPO market data to wireless devices. Also that year it purchased InsiderTrader, a source of data on insider trading and institutional holdings from Individual Investor Group (later renamed
   <company id="45788">
    WisdomTree Investments
   </company>
   ). Later it agreed to buy Financial Insight Systems, a provider of EDGAR products to large financial institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 the Nasdaq-Online.com website that EDGAR Online had been hosting was removed from EDGAR's data center and into Nasdaq's facility, reducing EDGAR Online's technical services revenue and causing EDGAR to trim its workforce by 17% that year. In 2004 Nasdaq further reduced its technical services contract with EDGAR Online. The company discontinued its FreeEDGAR service, a free site with restricted navigation tools, in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Susan Strausberg resigned as CEO in 2007 and was replaced by Philip Moyer. Moyer resigned in 2010 citing personal reasons. In 2011 Robert Farrell became the company's next CEO.
