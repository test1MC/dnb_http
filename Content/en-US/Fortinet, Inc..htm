   Fortinet has posted steady revenue growth over the years and that continued in 2014 when revenue increased 25% to $770 million. Product revenue rose 30% driven by sales of its FortiGate product to enterprise and service provider customers. Services and other revenue increased 22% on the strength of FortiGuard security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support contracts.

   The company recorded its second straight year of declining revenue in 2014 with a 43% decrease to $25.3 million. It had higher costs and paid more taxes in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $196 million at the end of 2014, up from $147 million at the end of 2013. The increased cash flow was due to changes in working capital because of deferred revenue.
