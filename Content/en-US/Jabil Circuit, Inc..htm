  <p>
   Revenue rose 2.5% to $18.3 billion in 2016 (ended August) on sales increases of 3% and 2% in its two segments. Geographically only the Mexico market posted a gain, of 20%, from 2015 to 2016. The rise in sales came from its mobility business in the first half of the year and from telecommunications equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit slipped 10.5% in 2016 from 2015 to $254 million. Higher costs for selling, general, and administrative functions rose 7% mainly because Jabil increased hiring and salaries to support growth. It also had higher amortization expenses related to intangible assets in acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations dropped to $916 million in 2016 from $1.2 billion in 2015. Part of the drop stemmed from a decrease in accounts receivable because of reduced consumer demand in the mobility business in the second half of 2016 in combination with cash collection efforts.

  <p>
   To compete in a rapidly consolidating industry, Jabil provides production on a global scale and operates through semi-autonomous business units that are dedicated to individual customers. The company continues to add services and to expand globally through acquisitions, including deals to acquire manufacturing operations from customers looking to reduce costs through outsourcing. The company tends to place manufacturing plants close to its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In emphasizing that geographic strategy, Jabil is expanding its manufacturing operations in order to provide products of equivalent or comparable quality throughout the world. It has established and acquired operations in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

  <p>
   Acquisitions have extended Jabil's product portfolio and its geographic reach.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2016 Jabil acquired Inala, a South African energy products provider and systems integrator. The deal acquisition expanded Jabil's presence in the market for remote location energy products and marked its first venture in Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2015 Jabil acquired Clothing+, which makes the sensor fabric in the Victoria's Secret smart bra. It has been integrating electronics into textiles for almost two decades.
  </p>
  <p>
   In August 2015, Jabil acquired Kasalis, which makes sophisticated systems used in the assembly high-precision optical equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Jabil's healthcare and packaging division, Nypro, acquired Plasticos Castella, a molder of plastic lids for condiments. Nypro's acquisition of Plasticos Castella expands smart packaging capabilities by combining design, engineering, and manufacturing facilities in Spain and Hungary with the services of Nypro's six North American plants.

   Jabil Circuit was named for founders James Golden and Bill Morean. The duo, who originally ran an excavation business, started Jabil in suburban Detroit in 1966 to provide assembly and reworking services to electronics manufacturers. Jabil incorporated in 1969 and began making printed circuit boards for Control Data Corporation (later renamed
   <company id="11174">
    Control Data Systems
   </company>
   ) that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   William D. Morean, the founder's son who had worked summers at Jabil while in high school, joined the company in 1977. The next year the younger Morean took over Jabil's day-to-day operations. The company had entered the automotive electronics business in 1976 through a $12 million contract with
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1980s Jabil began building computer components, adding such customers as
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   , NEC,
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   . Jabil moved its headquarters to St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1983. William Morean became Jabil's chairman and CEO in 1988.
