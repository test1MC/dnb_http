   GW Pharmaceuticals works to relieve pain and muscle stiffness that result from multiple sclerosis, cancer, and other ailments. The company develops and sells prescription medicinal drugs derived from cannabis-based medicinal extracts that don't cause a psychotropic high. GW's main product is Sativex, a cannabinoid medicine delivered by an oral spray. Sativex has been approved in Canada, New Zealand, and several European countries for the treatment of muscle stiffness (spasticity) caused by multiple sclerosis. The company is working independently and with partners to expand the drug's uses and markets; it is also working to develop additional cannabinoid therapies.

  <p>
   The company operates through three reportable segments: Sativex Research and Development, Commercial, and Pipeline Research and Development. The largest segment, Sativex Research and Development, seeks to maximize the drug's potential, which has thus far been primarily focused on the treatment of cancer pain. The segment earns revenue through R&amp;D fees charged to Sativex licenses; it accounts for more than three-fourths of GW's revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Commercial segment handles all of the sales and distribution of GW's products, as well as royalties, licenses, collaborations, and fees. It accounted for some 20% of the company's revenue. Meanwhile, the smallest segment, Pipeline Research &amp; Development, is developing additional cannabinoid therapies. Its portfolio includes Epidiolex for the treatment of Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes (both types of epilepsy), as well as additional candidates in clinical studies for the treatment of epilepsy, schizophrenia, and diabetes.

  <p>
   Headquartered in the UK, GW also has operations in the US, continental Europe, Canada, New Zealand, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Its largest market is the US, which represents about 80% of sales, followed by Europe (17%).

  <p>
   Revenue, which has fluctuated over the past five years, decreased 5% to £44.5 million in fiscal 2015 (ended September). This decline was driven by reduced earnings across all three segments, as sales of Sativex and R&amp;D and licensing fees dropped. Net income took its fourth consecutive decline and its third year in the red, falling 204% to a loss of £44.5 million. While lower sales impacted the bottom line, an increase in expenses related to R&amp;D, expansion in the UK, and general corporate costs also contributed to the loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow also took a steep downturn, increasing 268% to £46.5 million.

  <p>
   GW's strategy for growth involves working with other pharmaceutical firms to research and market its products, which it hopes will prove effective in the treatment of additional maladies. The company has research collaborations with 36 universities around the world. It has marketing agreements with a number of companies to sell its products as they are approved; these include Almirall (Europe, excluding the UK, and Mexico), Otsuka (the US),
