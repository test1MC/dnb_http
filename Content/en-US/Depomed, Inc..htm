   For comedians and Depomed, it's all about the delivery. The drug company makes proprietary drug therapies using its patented delivery technology AcuForm, an extended-release technology that stretches out the time a pill stays in the stomach, thus reducing the number of necessary doses and potential side effects. Depomed's internal development efforts have yielded
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved and marketed products: Gralise, which is used to treat nerve pain; CAMBIA, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults; Zipsor Liquid Filled Capsules for pain relief in adults; and Lazanda Nasal Spray to manage breakthrough pain in adults.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Depomed's pipeline products include MNK-155 and Nucynta ER for the treatment of pain, and IW-3718 for refactory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a license agreement with
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   that grants Janssen non-exclusive rights to certain patents and other rights to the AcuForm technology for the development of tapentadol extended-release products including Nucynta ER. It also has licensing partnerships with
   <company id="10798">
    Mallinckrodt
   </company>
   , providing rights to use the AcuForm technology for the exclusive development of up to four products containing acetaminophen in combination with opiates. In 2014, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   approved XARTEMIS XR for the management of pain severe enough to require opioid treatment. In addition, Depomed has a partnership with
   <company id="108828">
    Ironwood Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for IW-3718.

   Depomed commercializes its products through partnerships with other pharmaceuticals.

   Revenue spiked 191% in 2014 as product sales and royalties grew. Such products as Zipsor, Lazanda, CAMBIA, and Gralise all saw an increase in sales that year. However, the bulk of the revenues came when Depomed sold its interests in royalty and milestone payments in the type 2 diabetes therapeutic area to
   <company id="10346">
    PDL BioPharma
   </company>
   for some $240.5 million; proceeds from the sale were slated for acquisitions of promising pain and neurology products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has generally followed revenue, also rose in 2014: It increased 204% to $132 million that year. Such fluctuation in revenues and net income levels is typical for development-stage pharmaceutical companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, cash flow from operations declined as a result of changes in income taxes payable. Depomed reported a $56 million cash outflow in 2014 (after reporting a cash inflow in 2013).
  </p>

  <p>
   Depomed is focused on continuing to identify, license, and develop new products to offer enhanced therapeutic options. It also works to maintain the growth of its existing brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Depomed acquired the US rights to pain medication Nucynta (tapentadol) from
   <company id="100382">
    Janssen Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   for $1.05 billion. With that purchase, the company expects to more than double its annual revenue, as Nucynta's sales surpass those of Depomed's existing products. The firm plans to add significantly to its sales force in order to market Nucynta.
  </p>
  <p>
   The FDA in 2014 approved Mallinckrodt's New Drug Application (NDA) for Xartemix extended-release tablets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Narrowing its focus on pain relief, and gaining some cash in the process, Depomed sold its type 2 diabetes royalties and milestones to PDL BioPharma for $240.5 million in 2013. The deal included payments from sales of Glumetza, Janumet XR, Invokana, and extended-release metformin (off-patent).
