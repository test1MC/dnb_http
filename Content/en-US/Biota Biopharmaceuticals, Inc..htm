   Aviragen Therapeutics (formerly Biota Biopharmaceuticals) would like to wave bye-bye to a host of viral infections plaguing mankind. It has three drugs in active clinical development: Vapendavir for the treatment of human rhinovirus (common cold) upper respiratory infections in asthmatics, BTA585 for the treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections, and BTA074 for the treatment of condyloma caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. Biota changed its name to Aviragen in 2016 to reflect its transition from a drug discovery company to one focused on late-stage products treating viral diseases. The firm was formed in 2012 when Biota Holdings purchased Nabi Pharmaceuticals.

   Nabi Biopharmaceuticals' NicVAX, a vaccine for nicotine addition, is still being developed by the new company. NicVAX works by stimulating antibodies (immune-system proteins) that reduce cravings. NicVAX is being developed in partnership with GSK, which has an option to license worldwide marketing rights to the vaccine. If GSK exercises its option, Biota will be eligible for up to $460 million in milestone payments on NicVAX and future versions of the nicotine vaccine, plus royalty payments on sales of the vaccines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Biota has three other drug candidates in its pipeline.

   The company is headquartered in Georgia. Former Nabi facilities in Australia and the UK serve as R&amp;D locations.

  <p>
   Biota reported a 67% revenue increase for 2013 based mostly on receiving benchmark payments from Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA; a unit of
   <company id="150448">
    Health and Human Services
   </company>
   ) as laninamivir (the US version of Inavir) advanced to the next stage of clinical trials.
  </p>
  <p>
   The payment and merger-related gains lead to a 55% decrease in net loss and improved cash flow for 2013.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company plans to continue to pursue clinical-trial advancement for laninamivir under the $231 million BARDA contract, to choose a pre-clinical candidate for respiratory diseases, and to continue its work on antibiotics for drug-resistant bacteria. It will also continue to look for in-licensing, acquisition, and other collaborative arrangements to advance candidates in its pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Biota bought Paris-based Anaconda Pharma, which is developing AP611074, a treatment for anogenital warts, as well as the orphan disease recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP).

   In 2009 Nabi sold its PentaStaph candidate (a modified version of its first unsuccessful S
   <em>
    taphylococcus aureus
   </em>
   bacteria vaccine StaphVax) to GlaxoSmithKline for about $46 million. Nabi received $20 million cash up front, and received the rest through milestone payments over an 18-month period as it wound up ongoing clinical trials on the candidate and transferred the PentaStaph technology to GSK.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nabi had already divested some assets as a result of an earlier reorganization to focus on NicVax, including its marketed products -- hepatitis B vaccine Nabi-HB, Aloprim for chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia (a metabolic disorder), and PhosLo for kidney disease -- as well as several vaccine candidates and its biologics (plasma protein) operations.
