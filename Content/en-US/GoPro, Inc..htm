   GoPro strives to be the go-to professional to capture on-the-go activities with its assortment of mountable and wearable cameras and accessories (or capture devices, as the company calls them). Its products' small, lightweight, and durable designs allow for versatility when it comes to taking pictures. Flagship products include its Hero 4 Black, Hero 4 Silver, and Hero 4 Session cameras. Customers can transfer footage from the capture devices to GoPro Studio, the company's desktop application that edits and manages videos. It also offers remote controls and integration with mobile devices via its GoPro App. Since establishing its first HD capture device in 2009, the company has sold more than 20 million HD cameras.

  <p>
   GoPro launched an IPO in mid-2014, expecting to raise about $200 million in proceeds. Instead, its stock quickly skyrocketed as it raised $427 million. It is using the money to repay loans, for general corporate purposes, and for potential acquisitions and investments. Two years later the company's stock had plunged to about $9 a share.

  <p>
   GoPro has achieved significant growth over the course of its brief history. Its revenue rose 16% in 2015, but profit tumbled 72% from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenue reached $1.6 billion in 2015, compared to about $1.4 billion in 2014. Overseas expansion pushed overseas sales higher. At home, the company's sales disappointed with a 31% drop in the fourth quarter, usually boosted by holiday sales. GoPro blamed the weak fourth quarter on the release of new products earlier in 2015 while, in 2014, new products hit the market closer to the holiday shopping season.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell to $36 million in 2015 from $128 million in 2014. GoPro increases spending on research and development and sales and marketing in 2015, which contributed to the lower profit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash generated by operations rose to $157.6 million in 2015 from $97 million in 2014.

  <p>
   The lower fourth quarter 2015 sales could extend into 2016 and the company expects to report its first decrease in annual revenue for the year. The company will launch its Hero 6 cameras as well as the new Karma, a drone-mounted camera, in 2016. Beyond those products the company vowed to simplify its product line to reduce consumer confusion.
  </p>
  <p>
   While there might some customer confusion, there is a good amount of consumer enthusiasm for GoPro, which the company cultivates. Many users upload the videos they've shot to GoPro's website and the company's numerous YouTube Channels. The company sends it own content teams around the world to shoot videos. GoPro believes the videos inspire people to buy GoPro products to create their own content. The company is seeking new revenue opportunities by increasing production of GoPro-produced content while increasing the aggregation and redistribution of the best of user-generated content. The company started GoPro Awards in 2015 and plans to make grants totaling up to $5 million a year to creators of compelling GoPro content. Users had submitted more than 90,000 videos (as of February 2016) and the company had awarded more than $250,000 for video and photo content.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also moving into virtual reality, a market that could reach $30 billion in 2020. It has released Omni, a six-camera rig that goes for $5,000, that capture the angles needed to produce virtual reality video. The company also provides software for processing virtual reality video thanks to an acquisition. And there's GoProVR, a website and app for smartphones for sharing and viewing virtual reality productions.
  </p>
  <p>
   GoPro also will devote R&amp;D resources to make it easier for customers to use its capture devices as well as to edit the capture video. It also intends to open its content management and editing software to other capture devices such as smartphones and DSLR cameras.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its impressive IPO, GoPro experienced a 31% decrease in sales during the 2015-2016 holiday season compared to the previous time period. As a result, executive changes were made, and the the company reduced its product portfolio. (It stopped making its cheapest camera, the Hero, along with the Hero+ LCD and the Hero+.) To right the course, in 2016 GoPro launched its Hero 5 camera, its new Karma drone, and is working on virtual reality products. To reduce expenses, in late 2016 the company announced it was laying off 15% of its workforce, or 200 employees, and closing its entertainment division.
