   VIZIO has done for HDTVs what Dell did for PCs: sell them for less. Best known for its sticker-friendly flat panel and plasma LCD HDTVs, VIZIO also makes and sells Blue-Ray players, sound bars and speakers, headphones, Internet routers, PCs and other consumer electronics through retailers and wholesalers across North America. Sourcing its products from China and Taiwan, VIZIO sells many of its low-priced electronics through top discount chains including

   . Thanks to its low prices, VIZIO ranked as the #1 sound bar seller and the #2 Smart HDTV seller in the US market by unit sales in 2014. It's sold more than 65 million products since its founding in 2002. In 2016 Chinese tech company LeEco agreed to acquire VIZIO for $2 billion.

   Keeping low-prices in mind, VIZIO continues to innovate with its core HDTV product line. In December 2015, it introduced its D-Series Collection of Smart TV and 4K Ultra HD ranging in price from $149.99 for the 24" LED TV to $1299.99 for the 70" Full-Array LED Smart TV. In 2014 it launched its new E-Series Full-Array LED backlit HDTV collection as well as its 120-inch Reference Series Ultra HD Smart TV and sub-$1,000 pricing on its 50-inch P-Series Ultra HD Smart TV at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, with the market for flat TVs maturing, VIZIO has been working to become a more diversified consumer electronics brand. In April 2015, after ranking the #1 unit seller of sound bars in the US for 2014, VIZIO released its 40" 5.1 Sound Bar System to complement screen sizes from 32" and up. The company has also been introducing its products beyond the US market, introducing its HDTV and audio products to the Canadian market in late 2014 and to the Mexican market in August 2015. In 2013, in a bid to enter the booming market for smartphones, VIZIO began testing an Android-powered smartphone that had been released in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   VIZIO controls the design and marketing of its products and partners with contract manufacturers to make TVs less expensively than its competitors. Its collaboration with AmTran Technology Co., based in Taipei, has proven to be an integral part of the success of both VIZIO and AmTran. AmTran, which has an ownership stake in VIZIO, generates some 80% of its revenue from sales to VIZIO, while VIZIO relies on AmTran as a supplier for most of its TVs.

   The company was founded by William Wang in 2002 and initially sold its TVs at membership retailers such as

    Costco Wholesale
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="53503">
    BJ's Wholesale Club
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="56161">
    Sam's Club
   </company>
   . It then extended its reach to discount retailers

    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The TV maker entered the market for smart TVs, which are integrated with Internet functionality, when it shipped its first model during the second half of 2011.

  <p>
   VIZIO entered the PC market in mid-2012 with a new line of laptops and desktops starting at about $890. By combining its entertainment know-how with the power of the latest Intel Core processors, VIZIO hopes to set a new standard for the Windows experience. The line consists of the VIZIO Thin + Light, Notebook, and All-in-One PC.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of America's largest private companies, VIZIO rang up an estimated $3.1 billion in sales in 2012. The bulk of the company's sales have historically come from flat-screen TVs.
