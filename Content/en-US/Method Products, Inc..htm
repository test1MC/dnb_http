   The small company has grown rapidly, much of it through word of mouth, as well as maximum exposure for its young hip founders. To pique the interest of new customers and continue to build on its products portfolio, the cleaners company has been focusing on product development. Method Products over the years has added an antibacterial line of botanical household disinfectant sprays and wipes through a partnership with CleanWell, which specializes in thyme-based disinfecting technology. It also has launched a new laundry detergent that utilizes its "smartclean technology" formula. At eight times the concentration of regular detergents, the laundry cleaner has a miniature container, considering its 50-load capacity, for ease in handling and a biodegradable formula that is derived from plant-based ingredients.
