   Plastic is the real thing for Wilbert, Inc. Wilbert is the holding company of Wilbert Plastic Services and, formerly, burial vault maker Wilbert Funeral Services. Spun off in 2009, the funeral business (one of the world's largest makers of concrete burial vaults) buys plastic liners from Wilbert. The plastics service, one of the largest thermoformers in the US, makes components for the automotive, agricultural, and building and consumer products markets, among many, through thermoforming and injection-molding, which softens a rigid plastic sheet under heat and molds it into finished parts.

  <p>
   Wilbert has facilities in Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Carolina.

   In 2011 Wilbert purchased South Carolina-based Easley Custom Plastics. The deal for the injection molder further expanded Wilbert's footprint in the Southeast as well as adding paint and other capabilities to its production processes. Easley Custom Plastics, like Wilbert, supplies the automotive, hand and power tool, building and construction, recreational industries.

  <p>
   Wilbert evolved from the L.G. Haase Manufacturing Co., founded in 1893.
  </p>
  <p>
   The economic downturn in 2008 hurt Wilbert's financial performance and forced a number of hard choices including dropping its funeral service and focusing instead on its plastic engineering and technical capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of the turnaround, Wilbert Plastic Services moved its headquarters from Illinois to North Carolina in 2010. That year, it became a direct supplier to auto giants
   <company id="10334">
    Chrysler
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10597">
    Ford
   </company>
   . That year it also acquired United Southern Industries, a North Carolina injection molder for the lawn and garden, and a variety of industrial products markets.
