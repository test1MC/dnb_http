   Enanta Pharmaceuticals is getting hip to Hep C. The biotech firm is developing treatments for viral infections including hepatitis C (HCV), a virus that can lead to chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, organ failure, and cancer. The company's first licensed product, which is licensed to
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   , is paritaprevir, is a protease inhibitor for use against HCV. Enanta also has four small molecule drugs under development: glecaprevir, another protease inhibitor for the treatment for HCV; the similar EDP-239 and EDP-494; and EDP-305, which is being studied for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). In late 2014 Enanta discontinued its biodefense antibiotic program.

  <p>
   Enanta Pharmaceuticals makes most of its money from royalties for its protease inhibitors. It also earns milestone payments related to those same compounds.

  <p>
   The biotech has yet to make any revenue from product sales, but rather has earned money on collaborations with other pharmaceuticals (primarily
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   ) and from a now-closed government contract to develop antibiotics for biodefense purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended September), Enanta had revenue of $88.3 million, a 45% decline from the previous year. This was primarily due to a significant drop in milestone payments from AbbVie, as well as a drop in funding from the government (its antibiotics contract ended during 2015). Net income that year totaled $21.7 million, a 73% decline from fiscal 2015. Lower revenue and higher R&amp;D expenses led to the drop in net income.

  <p>
   Enanta Pharmaceuticals is currently focused on three disease areas: the liver disease NASH, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and hepatitis B. It also continues to develop treatments for HCV. The company sees plenty of opportunity and hopes to introduce new treatments for unmet medical needs in these areas (NASH has no approved treatments, for instance.). It uses funding from its AbbVie collaboration to advance its development pipeline; it is also open to other partnerships to finance its R&amp;D activities.
