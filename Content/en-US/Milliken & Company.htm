  <p>
   Milliken broadens its product portfolio through the use of acquisitions. In 2015 it acquired Springfield LLC, a manufacturer of technical, performance and flame resistant (FR) fabrics for the safety apparel, fire service, military, and occupational markets. Springfield is based in Jericho, New York, with offices in Rock Hill and manufacturing facilities in Gaffney and Lyman, South Carolina. With the acquisition, the company further improved its user experience for industrial workers, first-responders, and military personnel with performance-driven protective apparel.

  <p>
   Seth Milliken and William Deering founded the company in 1865 as Deering Milliken Company, specializing in woolen fabrics. Seth's grandson, chairman Roger Milliken, Jr., led the company until his death in 2010.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Seth Milliken and William Deering formed a company in 1865 to become selling agents for textile mills in New England and the southern US. Deering left the partnership, and in 1869 he founded Deering Harvester (now Navistar).
  </p>
  <p>
   Milliken set up operations in New York before the turn of the century, began buying the accounts receivable of cash-short textile mill operators, and invested in some of the companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In his position as agent and financier, Milliken was able to spot failing mills. He bought out the distressed owners at a discount and soon became a major mill owner himself. In 1905 Milliken and his allies waged a bitter proxy fight and court case to win control of two mills, earning Milliken a fearsome reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   H. B. Claflin, a New York dry-goods wholesaler that also operated department stores, owed money to Milliken. When Claflin went bankrupt in 1914, Milliken got some of the stores, which became Mercantile Stores. The Milliken family retained about 40% of the chain (sold to Dillard's in 1998).
  </p>
  <p>
   Roger Milliken, grandson of the founder, became the president of the company in 1947 and ruled with a firm hand. He fired brother-in-law W. B. Dixon Stroud in 1955, and none of Roger's children, nephews, or nieces has ever been allowed to work for the company. The workers at Milliken's Darlington, South Carolina, mill voted to unionize in 1956. The next day Milliken closed the plant, beginning 24 years of litigation that ended at the US Supreme Court. Milliken settled with its workers for $5 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1960s the company introduced Visa, a finish for easy-care fabrics. Milliken launched its Pursuit of Excellence program in 1981; the program stressed self-managed teams of employees and eliminated 700 management positions. Tom Peters dedicated his 1987 bestseller,
   <i>
    Thriving on Chaos,
   </i>
   to Roger.
  </p>
  <p>
   Away from that limelight, Milliken is (and has always been) a secretive, closely held business. In 1989 that secrecy and family control were threatened when members of the Stroud branch of the family sued the company in the Delaware courts and then sold a small number of shares to Erwin Maddrey and Bettis Rainsford, executives of Milliken competitor Delta Woodside. The courts ruled in favor of Milliken in 1992; Maddrey and Rainsford were required to sign confidentiality agreements before receiving Milliken information. Roger financially backed opponents of NAFTA in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Woven-filament maker NRB sued Milliken in 1997 for corporate spying and the following year industrial textile maker Johnston Industries filed a similar lawsuit. Milliken settled both cases out of court.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Milliken began using its Millitron dye technology to produce residential carpets and rugs. It also introduced new brands of patterned rugs (including Royal Dynasty, Prestige, American Heritage). In 2000 the company built a manufacturing facility in South Carolina to expand its production of Millard-brand clarifying agents. Milliken closed its Union and Saluda plants in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2008 the company made a deal for the fire-retardant business of Western Nonwoven, which was struggling to emerge from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Milliken &amp; Company gained the Paladin and Sandmat lines, which reinforced Milliken &amp; Company's know-how in fire-retardant barriers and geo-textile nonwovens, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company sold off its automotive body cloth division to a Milliken management group backed by private equity Azalea Capital, LLC. The sale shed 1,200 jobs, five plants in the US, one in Brazil, and support centers in the US, Japan, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2009 Milliken &amp; Company snatched up Georgia-based floor covering maker Constantine. Constantine joins Milliken &amp; Company's Floor Covering Division, extending Milliken's lineup with broadloom and modular carpet tile, and durable, hard surface flooring, primarily for commercial applications. The deal also expanded Milliken &amp; Company's already significant slice of the architectural decorative carpet market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also (through one of its subsidiaries) the company purchased the assets of Rebus, Inc. in 2010. A Pennsylvania-based chemical company, Rebus gave Milliken &amp; Company capacity in producing custom-blended colorants and additives to serve thermoset plastics and coatings manufacturers -- a developing market with promising growth in the Asia/Pacific region.
