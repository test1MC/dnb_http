   CoStar Group acquired LoopNet in 2012 for about $860 million in cash and stock. The deal combined two complementary providers of marketing and information services to the commercial real estate market. It effectively doubled the size of CoStar's paid subscriber base to some 160,000. In addition, CoStar's software products, which allow clients to access its database of office and industrial space and tenant information, are bolstering LoopNet's offerings.
