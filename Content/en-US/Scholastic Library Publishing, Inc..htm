  <p>
   Begun in 1895 as a history and memoir publisher, the Grolier Society started selling the
   <i>
    Encyclopedia Americana
   </i>
   in the 1930s and was incorporated in 1936. In 1960 the company changed its name to Grolier Incorporated. It expanded into a variety of businesses through acquisitions, but by the early 1980s, the company was concentrating on publishing. Grolier formed a new subsidiary, Grolier Electronic Publishing, in 1982, and in 1986 the company released the
   <i>
    Academic American Encyclopedia
   </i>
   on CD-ROM under the name
   <i>
    The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia.
   </i>
   It was the first encyclopedia published in electronic format.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paris-based Hachette (now owned by Lagardère) bought Grolier in 1988. After the acquisition Hachette sold Grolier's educational toy maker, Childcraft Education, to Disney, and in 1992 it sold its Krames unit to K-III (now PRIMEDIA). Two years later the company made a direct-marketing deal with Disney, allowing Grolier to sell Disney books via telemarketing and direct mail and in stores.

   In the mid-1990s Grolier began to focus on its multimedia business. In 1995 it sold educational publisher Scarecrow Press and in 1998 the company targeted schools with its online
   <i>
    Multimedia Encyclopedia
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Encyclopedia Americana.
   </i>
   Also in 1998 Brian Beckwith, a former PRIMEDIA executive, was named president and COO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to target slightly older children (5-8 years old), Grolier developed a line of books based on Mattel's Barbie doll in 1999. In 2000 Lagardère sold Grolier to Scholastic for $400 million, and Beckwith became a consultant for Scholastic. The company changed its name to Scholastic Library Publishing in 2002. The business was later folded into Scholastic's other classroom and library assets to form the Scholastic Classroom and Library Group.
