   CIC Group can see clearly that its future (like its present) is in heavy manufacturing and construction. Its group of commercial and industrial subsidiaries specialize in the manufacture, maintenance, and repair of equipment for the crude oil, natural gas, coal, and other energy industries. Its largest subsidiary is Nooter/Eriksen, which supplies heat recovery steam generators for combustion gas turbines worldwide. CIC's Nooter Construction is a construction contractor serving the refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and power industries, among others. The employee-owned holding company was formed in 2002.
