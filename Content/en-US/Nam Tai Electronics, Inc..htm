   Nam Tai Electronics takes a calculated approach. The company makes electronic components, such as touchpad control panels for microwaves, large-scale integrated circuits, LCD-based information displays, and rechargeable cell phone battery packs. Nam Tai also makes a variety of consumer electronics, including basic-function and scientific calculators, PDAs, electronic dictionaries, and cordless telephones that are rebranded and sold by other electronics makers. The company's largest customers include

    Sharp
   </company>
   , Epson Imaging Devices, and
   <company id="122662">
    GN Netcom
   </company>
   . Asian clients account for a majority of sales.
Nam Tai's components are incorporated into consumer products made by OEMs in the electronics and telecommunications industries. Additional customers include

   M. K. Koo founded Nam Tai as a Hong Kong trading company in 1975. When the Chinese government suddenly restricted trade in 1986, sales dropped by half. In 1987 the company restructured: A holding company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands to facilitate share trading. (Unlike Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands does not tax share transfers, nor does it tax income or dividends between parent companies and subsidiaries.) Also in 1987 Nam Tai moved its manufacturing facilities to Shenzhen, China, 30 miles from Hong Kong, to take advantage of the low manufacturing costs there. The next year Nam Tai went public.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tadao Murakami succeeded Koo as president in 1994 and became CEO in 1995. The company established its Namtek subsidiary in 1996 to develop commercial software for consumer electronics and engage in other new product R&amp;D. That year Nam Tai completed a new factory in Shenzhen, doubling capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   President and CEO Shigeru Takizawa, formerly a technology senior fellow for
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   , joined the company in 1998, as Murakami succeeded Koo as chairman. That year the company began moving into the telecommunications market with the acquisition of 20% of Group Sense Ltd. (educational and telecommunications products) and bought a majority stake in troubled electronics manufacturer Albatronics. This led to a drop in earnings for the year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Nam Tai bought a South Korean maker of cordless telephones and signed a deal with Legend (now
   <company id="56726">
    Lenovo Group
   </company>
   ), China's largest PC maker, to manufacture palm-size computers. The company also liquidated Albatronics. The next year Nam Tai expanded its communications equipment-component production and acquired the JIC Group, which specialized in LCD panels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nam Tai revamped its executive lineup in 2001. Takizawa assumed the role of chairman; Murakami remained on the board of directors and became the head of corporate strategy and finance. The company hired another Toshiba veteran, Toshiaki Ogi, as its new CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Nam Tai merged its failed Albatronics business with its JIC subsidiary, of which Nam Tai kept a 93% stake. After only about a year as CEO, Ogi retired from the post and was succeeded by Joseph Li, the chairman and managing director of JIC. Takizawa left the board and Murakami became chairman again.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 the company announced plans to take private two of its publicly traded units in which it holds a controlling stake -- Nam Tai Electronic &amp; Electrical Products (NTEEP) and JIC Technology. The move was unsuccessful, however, as Nam Tai was unable to obtain the required 90% of the stock in either company.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Murakami resigned as chairman in 2005 and Koo became non-executive chairman of the board. Li stepped aside as CEO and CFO in 2006 to become vice chairman of JIC Technology. Patinda Lei, a 15-year veteran of Nam Tai and the chairman of its Zastron Precision-Tech subsidiary, was named to succeed Li. Warren Lee, a Hong Kong merchant banker, was named CEO of Nam Tai in 2006, succeeding Lei, who remained chairman of Zastron and CFO of Nam Tai.
  </p>
  <p>
   Koo had planned to step down as chairman of Nam Tai at the end of 2006, but remained in that post into 2007. In 2007 Lee resigned as CEO effective to become managing director of Yu Ming Investments, where he had previously worked. Koo took over the position on an interim basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Nam Tai sought to simplify its group organization structure and to achieve some of the goals in the 2005 bid to take NTEEP and JIC Technology private. Nam Tai, NTEEP, JIC, and Zastron would undertake a series of transactions involving capital shares and asset transfers among the companies. NTEEP would issue a convertible note that would bring $38.5 million in interest income and cash to Nam Tai.
  </p>
  <p>
   The reorganization would see Nam Tai's ownership in NTEEP decline from about 73% to nearly 68%. The company would slash its ownership in Zastron from 100% to almost 68%. Nam Tai's ownership in JIC would remain the same, at around 75%. (Namtek is a subsidiary of NTEEP.)
  </p>
  <p>
   After objections to the reorganization were raised by some shareholders, Nam Tai revised the details. Its ownership in NTEEP and JIC remained the same, while its ownership of Zastron was reduced by nearly 27%, to around 73%. Following that reorganization, Nam Tai sold its entire stake in JIC Technology to HKC (Holdings) Ltd. for about $51 million in cash.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 Nam Tai named Masaaki Yasukawa, a former
   <company id="55160">
    Seiko Epson
   </company>
   executive, as CEO. Koo remained as non-executive chairman. Yasukawa resigned later that year, and the company named Karene Wong as his successor.
