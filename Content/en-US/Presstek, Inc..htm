   Image is everything at Presstek, which combines printing press and computer technologies in its PEARL direct imaging (DI) systems. These systems produce color printing plates and non-photosensitive films, and also transfer images from computer to press. The PEARLdry process results in high-resolution plates without chemical processing or hazardous byproducts. Presstek markets its products through 30 graphic arts dealers worldwide.

   The company intends to expand its global sales operations, seeking more overseas customers. To facilitate the intended growth, Presstek has added more than 40 dealers to its distribution network in the European-African-Middle Eastern (EAME) region and more than two dozen in Asia-Pacific region. Expanding distribution and demonstrating equipment at major international trade shows is also a key component for growth.

   Robert and Lawrence Howard founded Presstek in 1987. Prior to launching Presstek, Robert had founded Howtek (electronic prepress equipment) and Centronics Data Computer Corporation (printers). He also invented the first impact dot matrix printer. Robert took Presstek public in 1989.

   Presstek signed a licensing agreement with
   <company id="53893">
    Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
   </company>
   (the world's largest printing press manufacturer) in 1991 and launched its PEARL thermal printing plate in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Presstek acquired Catalina Coatings, a maker of digital-imaging and printing-plate equipment and systems. That year the company won a patent dispute against
   <company id="59626">
    Agfa-Gevaert
   </company>
   . Presstek announced an agreement to cross-license certain printing technologies with rival Scitex Corporation in 1997. Presstek also agreed to collaborate with Fuji Photo in the development of printing products. Presstek, Robert Howard, and the company's president that year settled an

    SEC

   investigation into allegedly fraudulent company statements. The deal included $2.9 million in fines with no admission of wrongdoing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Presstek acquired custom printing press designer and manufacturer Heath Custom Press in 1998. The company recorded a loss that year in part because of acquisition costs, lower sales to Heidelberger (a primary customer for the direct-imaging systems), and increased costs for raw materials, labor, and overhead. In 1999 CEO Robert Hallman replaced Robert Varrando as president.
  </p>
  <p>
   Presstek established subsidiary Lasertel in 2000 in order to secure a steady supply of laser diodes for manufacturing its imaging systems. The Presstek board voted to remove Robert Hallman as CEO in 2002, and replaced him with Edward Marino, who was on the board since 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company acquired printing plate maker Precision Lithograining and printer

    A.B. Dick Company
   </company>
   . The following year Presstek announced plans to dissolve the operations of its ABD International subsidiary, which was formed when A.B. Dick was acquired. The A.B. Dick business was absorbed into the company's Presstek business segment.

   Following a chemical-spill incident at a manufacturing facility in South Hadley, Massachusetts, that triggered an evacuation of nearby homes and closing of the local schools for one day since school buses could not pass by the affected plant, Presstek decided in 2006 to discontinue manufacturing of its Precision analog newspaper plates. The business accounted for nearly 5% of sales. The company said it would help customers for the analog plate business make the transition to other vendors. Presstek continued to make digital plate products at a separate but adjacent facility in South Hadley.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent more than $1 million in cleaning up the spill, which involved about 1,500 gallons of sulfuric acid, and investigating the cause of the incident. The

   later fined Presstek $80,000 for the spill incident.
  </p>
  <p>
   Edward Marino left Presstek in 2007.

   executive Jeffrey Jacobson succeeded him as president and CEO.
