  <p>
   Altogether O-I operates almost 80 manufacturing plants in 23 countries. It has joint ventures in China, Malaysia, Mexico, the US, and Vietnam. In addition, the company operates machine shops that rebuild and repair its glass forming machines, as well as a mold shop to make molded shapes. Engineering support sites for its glass manufacturing operations are located Australia, Columbia, Poland, Peru and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company divides its operations across four reportable segments based on geography: Europe (38% of total sales), North America (33%), Latin America (17%), and Asia/Pacific (11%).

  <p>
   O-I sells most of its glass container products directly to customers under yearly or multi-year supply agreements, however, some of its products are sold through distributors. Customers range from large multinationals to small local breweries and wineries.

  <p>
   The company's overall revenues have gradually declined the last several years, falling 9% from $6.78 billion in 2014 to $6.16 billion in 2015. It also posted a net loss of $74 million in 2015 due to higher selling and administrative expenses and additional financing fees related to its refinancing activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decline for 2015 was primarily driven by a 15% drop in Asia/Pacific revenues, a 17% decrease in Europe, and a 8% decline from Latin America. O-I attributes the majority of the decreases due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the US dollar.

   O-I grows through acquisitions and joint ventures. In 2014 it formed a joint venture, IVC, with
   <company id="11800">
    Constellation Brands
   </company>
   , the world's largest premium wine producer. The new venture operates a plant in Nava, Mexico, and produces bottles exclusively for Constellation's brewery, which makes a portfolio of Mexican beer brands for export to the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also looks to product development to grow its business. In mid-2014 it opened an Innovation Center, a combined R&amp;D and pilot plant at its global headquarters in Ohio. At the Innovation Center, employees will research new concepts in glass production and qualify emerging technologies to improve the glass-making process.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simultaneously, O-I is placing a priority on winning over customers that have shied away from glass packaging as well as encouraging existing ones to use more. To this end, its marketing efforts piggyback on the wave toward sustainable packaging. Along with developing a variety of container features and functions, the company highlights the benefits of glass recyclability.

   In a historic transaction, O-I in 2015 acquired the food and beverage glass container business from
   <company id="47689">
    Vitro, S.A.B. de C.V.
   </company>
   for $2.15 billion. Vitro is the largest supplier of glass containers in Mexico. The deal included Vitro's five food and beverage glass container plants in Mexico, a plant in Bolivia, and the food and beverage business of Vitro Packaging, its North American distribution business based in Plano, Texas. The transaction cemented O-I with a competitive position in the attractive glass segment within the packaging market in Mexico,

  <p>
   The Owens Bottle Machine Corp. was incorporated in Toledo, Ohio, in 1907 as the successor to a four-year-old New Jersey company of the same name. It initially grew by acquiring small glass companies. In 1929 Owens bought the Illinois Glass Co. (medical and pharmaceutical glass) and became Owens-Illinois Glass.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company bought Libbey Glass (tableware) in 1935. Three years later Owens-Illinois and Corning Glass, which were both studying uses for glass fiber, began Owens-Corning Fiberglass, a joint venture with a virtual industry monopoly.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWII Owens-Illinois (O-I) started to diversify beyond glass. The company went public in 1952. In 1956 it bought National Container (cardboard boxes). It also created a semi-rigid plastic container that was adopted by bleach and detergent companies.
