   As an independent biometric consultancy and systems integrator, HRS is not beholden to any one biometric system or manufacturer and can pick the appropriate mix of equipment, software, and services for the unique needs of each client. Although security is a primary application of the technology, HRS has also made use of biometrics for more general corporate functions. The company's MSite solution provides workforce management options that integrate security, health and safety regulatory enforcement, and payroll management within a single system.
