   Lifetime Entertainment Services hopes viewers make a long-term commitment to its television programs. The company primarily operates three cable-TV networks (Lifetime Television, Lifetime Movie Network, Lifetime Real Women) focused on serving female viewers with original movies, talk shows, and syndicated shows. Its Lifetime Television network reaches nearly 100 million US households, airing such television fare as
   <em>
    Project Runway
   </em>
   , while its Lifetime Digital operates websites such as myLifetime.com, DressUpChallenge.com, and LifetimeMoms.com. Formed through the merger of channels Daytime and Cable Health Network in 1984, the company is a subsidiary of

    A&amp;E Television Networks
   </company>
   (AETN).

   The Lifetime networks generate most of their revenue through advertising and carriage fees paid by cable system operators such as
   <company id="103276">
    Time Warner Cable
   </company>
   and
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   . Like other cable TV programmers, it aims to attract the largest possible audience in order to sell airtime at a premium to its advertisers. The company's flagship Lifetime channel continues to lead the pack among women's cable networks, but it faces rivals in a crowded market that also includes

    WE
   </company>
   (owned by
   <company id="103270">
    AMC Networks
   </company>
   ),
   <company id="59171">
    Oxygen
   </company>
   (
   <company id="128633">
    NBC Universal
   </company>
   ), and OWN (

    The Oprah Winfrey Network
   </company>
   ).
