   Methanex methodically makes methanol. The world's #1 producer of methanol (also known as wood alcohol), Methanex produces about 9.4 million tons per year from plants in Chile, the US, Canada, Egypt, New Zealand, and Trinidad. Methanol is used to produce acetic acid, formaldehyde, and other chemicals, which are found in products such as adhesives, paints, plastic bottles, polyester, and solvents. Methanol also is used as a blending additive for gasoline called dimethyl ether (DME). It's also used to make methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), which enhances octane and creates cleaner burning fuel, although production has declined because it has been found to be a groundwater contaminant.

  <p>
   In 2015 Methanex's revenues decreased by 31% to $2.2 billion due to a decline in revenues from Europe and US, driven by lower prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, the company's net income decreased by 56% to $200.6 million due to lower net revenues and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily the result of depreciation associated with the start up of commercial operations of a methanol plant in  Geismar, Louisiana.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Methanex's operating cash inflow decreased by 63% to $296.9 million.

  <p>
   The company focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, which continues to lead global methanol demand growth (particularly China, South Korea and Japan). It is also investing in upgrading its global distribution and supply infrastructure (including opening two production facilities in Louisiana in 2015).
