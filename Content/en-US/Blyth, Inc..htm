   Blyth lights up the party with its wicked products. As the largest candle maker in the US, Blyth's
   <company id="113692">
    PartyLite Worldwide
   </company>
   subsidiary sells its scented and unscented candles, flameless products, and reed diffusers all under the PartyLite brand. Blyth's portfolio extends beyond the candle business with
   <company id="162867">
    ViSalus
   </company>
   nutritional supplements, as well as a variety of catalog and online businesses that market household goods and gifts under the Silver Star Brands umbrella. Blyth's products are sold through home parties, online, and by retailers worldwide. The company also supplies institutional customers, such as restaurants and hotels. In 2015 Blyth agreed to be acquired by
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   for $98 million.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The US is Connecticut-based Blyth's largest market, accounting for nearly 60% of sales. Other markets include Australia, Canada, about a dozen countries in Europe (including Germany, France, and the UK), and Mexico. The company has a sourcing office for PartyLite in Hong Kong.

        <p>
   Blyth operates three business segments: Candles and Home Decor (
   <company id="113692">
    PartyLite
   </company>
   ); Health and Wellness (
   <company id="162867">
    ViSalus
   </company>
   ); and Catalog and Internet (Silver Star Brands). These segments contributed approximately 44%, 40%, and 16% of sales in 2013. In the US, PartyLite brand products are sold by a cadre of about 17,000 independent consultants (down from more than 19,000 in 2012) who market products through home-based parties and on their own websites. In Europe, PartyLite merchandise is sold by more than 30,000 independent consultants.
  </p>
        <p>
   ViSalus, Blyth's health and wellness business, sells weight management products, nutritional supplements, foods and energy drink mixes, also by independent sales representatives. Silver Star Brands' is another direct to consumer business that offers decorative and functional household products including cards, gifts, food, and health and wellness products. Brands include Miles Kimball (hard-to-find gadgets and personalized gifts), Walter Drake (kitchenware, organizers, and more), As We Change (merchandise target at women over 40), Easy Comforts (health and personal care), and Exposures (photo albums, holiday decor, gifts).

        <p>
   Blyth reported sales of $885.5 million in 2013, a decline of 25% versus 2012. The double-digit sales dip was due to lower sales by the company's health and wellness segment and, to a much lesser extent, a decrease in candles and home decor sales, partially offset by a 3% sales gain by the catalog and Internet unit. PartyLite's sales dipped 6% year over year primarily due to a 17% decline in sales in North America as the direct marketer's team of active independent sales consultants shrank from 19,000 in 2012 to 17,000 in 2013. PartyLite's sales in Europe also declined by 2% (in US dollars) year over year, while its sales in Australia increased 17% (in US dollars) on growing consultant counts.
  </p>
        <p>
   Net income fell 94% to $2.4 million over the same period. The steep decline in profitability was primarily due to ViSalus's decreased operating performance, partially offset by improved operating results at Silver Star Brands.

        <p>
   The company is aiming to boost its business through an expanded selection of products. To that end, Blyth has been increasing its stake in vitamin and nutritional supplement merchant
   <company id="162867">
    ViSalus Holdings
   </company>
   through several purchases and currently owns about 81% of the shares. ViSalus extends Blyth's marketing reach into dietary supplements, weight management products, and energy drinks. Blyth also aims to ignite sales in the years ahead by offering monthly sales and productivity incentives to its independent sales representatives and distributors.
  </p>
        <p>
   To build up cash reserves and streamline its operations, Blyth has been purging some of its non-core businesses. In late 2012 the company sold its Sterno butane products and lighting business to
   <company id="128459">
    Westar Capital
   </company>
   portfolio company Candle Lamp Company, purging the Sterno, Handy Fuel, QuickFlame, and Sterno Decorative Lighting Collection brands. The move completes Blyth's shift from a multi-channel marketing company to a direct-to-consumer marketer. The company parted ways with gourmet coffee and tea seller Boca Java in 2011. Boca Java had been facing decreased consumer demand -- its sales fell by nearly 35% in fiscal 2011. As part of the disposal, Blyth recorded a $1 million impairment charge. Also in 2011 Blyth sold the assets of its Midwest-CBK premium seasonal and home decor business to MVP Group, a maker of private label candles and home fragrance items, for $35 million (consisting of $23 million in cash and a $12 million promissory note).

   Robert Goergen, a McKinsey &amp; Co. consulting alum and the head of the Sprout venture capital funds at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, teamed up with three partners in 1977 to buy a small Brooklyn candle company (founded in 1933) as a "hobby investment." When it ran into trouble in 1978, he took over as CEO. He changed the company's name from Candle Corp. of America to Blyth Industries, the name of an existing unit, because he wanted a less specific name in the event of future expansion. Introducing segmentation and brand management to the industry, the company created new markets (such as bath candles) and introduced lines at various price points, providing items attractive to customers of
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   or
   <company id="105266">
    Bloomingdale's
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   Blyth Industries began acquiring other related companies in the 1990s, including Colonial Candle in 1990. This purchase brought the company PartyLite Gifts, a party-plan seller of candles, candleholders, and party accessories. It then bought potpourri-maker Aromatic Industries in 1992, went public in 1994, and acquired an 88% stake in Jeanmarie Creations (decorative paper and gift bags) in 1995. (Jeanmarie Creations was sold to its own management team in 2004.)
  </p>
        <p>
   The next year Blyth Industries bought
   <company id="40196">
    Hallmark
   </company>
   's candle manufacturing business and became a preferred provider for Hallmark's stores. It purchased Endar, a maker of home fragrance products, for nearly $46 million in 1997. The company bought
   <company id="10363">
    Colgate-Palmolive
   </company>
   's heating-fuel business (Handy Fuel, Sterno) in 1998 for $70 million. In late 1998 Blyth Industries bought about 40% of Europe's largest candle maker, Liljeholmens Stearinfabrik AB; it bought the remaining shares in 1999. In 2000 the company shortened its name to Blyth, Inc.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2001 the firm acquired giftware and home and garden products retailer Midwest of Cannon Falls to further its growth into non-fragranced markets. In May 2002 Blyth acquired all membership interest in CBK, Ltd., a designer and marketer of premium everyday giftware and home decor products. In December 2002 Blyth formed Blyth HomeScents International to wholesale home fragrances in North America and Europe.
  </p>
        <p>
   In February 2003 Midwest of Cannon Falls changed its name to Midwest and introduced the Seasons of Cannon Falls brand. In April of the same year Blyth acquired Miles Kimball Company, a direct marketer of frames, giftware, holiday cards, home decor and household convenience items, and premium photo albums. In June the company acquired Kaemingk B.V., a Netherlands-based marketer and designer of seasonal decorations. (It sold the company in early 2006 to SMF Management Consultants for about $42 million.) In December 2003 Blyth acquired Jackson Acquisition Company, LLC (dba Walter Drake), which sells goods through catalogs and the Internet.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2004 Blyth acquired two home-decor companies based in the Netherlands, Edelman BV (home and garden decorations) and Euro-Decor BV (maker of gifts and floral products).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 Blyth sold its Impact Plastics seasonal decorations business to its former owner. Also that year, it spun off its Dutch wholesale units into a publicly traded company. Edelman and Euro-Decor, the firm's two Dutch wholesale units, were folded into management-owned Monceau Deelnemingen. With about 3,200 employees and revenue estimates of $700 million in 2006, the business was among the largest publicly traded wholesale home decor companies.
  </p>
        <p>
   Noticing that its sales dropped, the company began restructuring its home fragrance operations in North America in 2007. As part of the plan, Blyth closed down a manufacturing center in Mexico, pared down its customer base, outsourced operations, and cut nearly 10% of its workforce. It also sold some of its HomeScents International assets to MVP for about $25 million that year. The deal allowed Blyth to focus on its premium wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and Sterno businesses.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2008 Blyth acquired a stake in vitamin and nutritional supplement merchant ViSalus Holdings. (It later boosted its stake to more than 50% in 2011.)  Also in 2008 the company bought catalog and Internet retailer As We Change, which sells products targeted at women aged 40 and older.
  </p>
        <p>
   Blyth sold its Sterno business in late 2012 to a portfolio company of Westar Capital. The move allows Blyth to transition from a multi-channel marketing company to a direct-to-consumer marketer.
