   Prime time is anytime with TiVo. That's the idea behind TiVo and its digital video recorder (DVR). The DVR (similar to a VCR, but using a hard drive instead of videocassette) allows more than 7 million subscribers to record standard- and high-definition TV (broadcast, cable, or satellite). The company sells DVRs online and through electronics retailers such as
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   . In addition to buying a DVR, customers pay for TiVo's subscription service, which is essentially a high-tech TV listing. TiVo reaches cable and satellite viewers by licensing its technology to
   <company id="42070">
    DIRECTV
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103320">
    Comcast
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="134371">
    Virgin Media
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="144400">
    Vodafone
   </company>
   , and other service providers worldwide. In 2016 TiVo agreed to be bought by
   <company id="52934">
    Rovi
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Although Rovi is paying $1.1 billion for TiVo the combine company will take the TiVo name, which is more familiar to consumers. Rovi makes technology to deliver video over multiple platforms and has much in common with TiVo. The company's expect to find savings in the combination and benefit from complementary products.
  </p>

  <p>
   TiVo's sales increased 8% 2016 (ended January) versus the prior year, to $490 million. The company had a 9% revenue increase in its technology revenue, which accounts for 445% of the total. The hardware business's revenue rose 17%; it accounts for 36% of overall revenue. Hardware revenue fell 6%.
  </p>
  <p>
   TiVo recorded a profit of $21.7 million in 2016, but it was 30% lower than the 2015 earnings figure. The company spent more on development work for multiple systems operator (MSO) partners such as Virgin in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company barely generated positive cash flow in 2016 at $288,000, compared to $24 million in 2015.

  <p>
   While TiVo became synonymous with time-shifted viewing with its DVRs, the technology has been challenged by streaming services from over-the-top carriers such as
   <company id="100752">
    Netflix
   </company>
   and
   <company id="159434">
    Hulu
   </company>
   as well as content providers themselves such as CBS and HBO. TiVo has been building relationships with streaming services and building access to them in its devices. The deal with Rovi should help both companies navigate the quickly changing landscape of viewing programs on TVs, tablets, smartphones or PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To extend its cloud-based service to beam content to multiple devices, TiVo acquired the video technology company Digitalsmiths to enable it to offer elements of its service through non-TiVo branded user experiences. TiVo added $5.6 million to its research and development spending in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to expanding from when to where in terms of devices, the company is also looking to expand beyond the US market. TiVo currently has subscribers in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan. TiVo has made headway in international markets. In 2016 sales in Europe rose 91% and were up 155% in other international markets. Customers outside the US generated 19% of TiVo's revenue in 2016, up from 10% in 2015.

  <p>
   As part of its plans to expand internationally, TiVo in 2015 acquired Cubiware, a Polish company that makes software to connect cable company software and set-top-box hardware. Cubiware brings with it about 40 customers in 25 countries in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. The company says its products have been integrated into more than 4 million STBs.
