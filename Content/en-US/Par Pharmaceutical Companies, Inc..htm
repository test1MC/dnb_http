   Generic drugs are par for the course for Par Pharmaceutical Companies. The company markets about 55 generic drugs with a focus on central nervous system, cardiovascular, and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as infectious disease. The generic division, which uses the Par Pharmaceutical name, manufactures some of its own products, but it also distributes drugs manufactured by strategic partners. Its Par Specialty Pharmaceuticals (formerly Strativa) division develops updated versions of off-patent branded drugs. Par markets product through its internal sales force, mainly to wholesalers, retail pharmacy and grocery chains, and distributors across the US. Par Pharmaceutical was acquired by

    Endo International
   </company>
   in 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Endo paid investment firm
   <company id="51545">
    TPG
   </company>
   $8.05 billion for Par Pharmaceuticals, which it bought to increase its own generics operations. Endo will combine its existing generics unit, Qualitest Pharmaceuticals, with Par to create a subsidiary named Par Pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   The company's generic drug businesses, which operate as Par Pharmaceutical, account for about 95% of sales. In addition to its own portfolio of off-patent generics, Par Pharmaceutical sells some authorized generics, which are off-brand versions of drugs that are sanctioned by the patent holders (and hence gain rights to a period of market exclusivity before other generic versions can be sold). Par sells authorized generic versions of Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate) and Entocort (budesonide) through a contract with
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   , and rizatriptan (Maxalt) licensed from Merck. Recent launches (since 2013) include generic versions of Exforge, Lovaza, Precedex, Lamictal XR, Luvox CR, and Focalin XR. Par Pharmaceutical also holds a portfolio of sterile products marketed under the Par Sterile name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Par Specialty focuses on marketing and distributing two prescription drugs: nasal spray Nascobal and Megace ES.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the end of 2014, Par had over 200 products in its pipeline. This portfolio included 115 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) pending with the

   Par sells its products in the US and has manufacturing facilities in New York, Michigan, California, and Connecticut, as well as another in India.

   The company primarily sells its generic products to wholesalers, drug store chains, supermarket chains, other retailers, distributors, mail-order accounts, hospitals, and the government. In 2014 its four largest customers were
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (25% of sales),
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health

   (18%),
   <company id="10984">
    CVS Health

   (15%), and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen

   (13%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Par markets its sterile products under the Par Sterile brand name.

  <p>
   Par has seen several years of revenue fluctuation. In 2014 it rose 19% to $1.3 billion as the generic division enjoyed increased sales, thanks to the releases of amlodipine/valsartan and clonidine, increased sales of bupropion ER, and the acquisition of Aplisol. Those increases were partially offset by declines in Par Specialty, which struggled with decreased sales of Megace ES.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income has been on the decline since 2011; however, net loss remained relatively flat at some $106 million in 2014 due to several factors including higher settlements and loss contingencies related to omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate patent litigation and restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Par Sterile.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations increased 29% to $145 million due to changes in accounts payable and similar factors.
  </p>

  <p>
   In recent years the company has been pursuing additional market exclusivity opportunities by focusing on "first-to-file" opportunities (which are gained through patent-challenge litigation) and "first-to-market" opportunities (which involve drugs that are difficult to formulate or manufacture). At the same time the company has downsized the internal R&amp;D organization of its generics division, announcing plans to instead focus on gaining new products and development candidates through partnerships, licensing agreements, or acquisitions. It is also focused on expanding its technological abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company restructured its then-named Strativa division, cutting 70 mostly sales positions, as part of its $45 million settlement with the
   <company id="150279">
    Department of Justice
   </company>
   related to Par's marketing of Megace, a product for AIDS-related weight loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Par introduced three new generic medications in 2014: entecavir (licensed from
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   ), budesonide nasal spray (licensed from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca
   </company>
   ), and digoxin (licensed from Covis Pharma). It received US approval for its New Drug Application (NDA) for Vasostrict and for the Nascobal Nasal Spray single-use device (launched in 2015).

  <p>
   Par acquired Innoteq (a maker of coated products) and Ethics Bio Lab (a contract research organization, since renamed Par Biosciences) in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014 Par acquired JHP Pharmaceuticals, a branded and generic injectable maker, for about $500 million. The purchase fit with Par's strategy of going after products with high barriers to entry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased Nuray Chemicals, an Indian pharmaceutical ingredient maker, for $19 million.
