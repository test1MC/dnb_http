   Silgan Containers, a subsidiary of
   <company id="41494">
    Silgan Holdings
   </company>
   , is North America's largest manufacturer of metal food containers, carving off for itself about half of the US market. Its steel and aluminum containers and traditional and convenience ends are used by food processors to package fruit, vegetables, meat, coffee, soups, sauces, tomato based products, seafood, adult nutritional drinks, and other products such as pet food. Customers include
   <company id="10287">
    Campbell Soup
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10388">
    ConAgra
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Silgan Containers operates through sales offices in five locations and nearly 26 manufacturing plants. It also has technology centers in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin and Waukegan, Illinois.
  </p>

  <p>
   Although demand for metal containers has declined, Silgan has managed to increase its market share and income from operations by adding value-added features (commanding a higher selling price) to its standard metal offerings. Among them, it has introduced easy-open end containers, shaped and ornamental containers, single-serve cans, and a lineup of colored aluminum cans.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also partners with sister subsidiary,
   <company id="112144">
    Silgan Plastics
   </company>
   , to produce such hybrid products as microwavable bowls with easy-open metal ends. The economic recession has had a silver lining, too; more budget-strapped consumers are picking up canned foods for dinner instead of a restaurant menu.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its 40,000 square foot Technology Center is fully equipped with 10 independent labs. Every year, Silgan produces 15 billion metal food containers at 26 manufacturing plants across US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company works in partnership with sister company Silgan Plastic Food Containers to address multi-material packaging needs.

  <p>
   Concurrently, Silgan maintains a tight grip on its supplier agreements with its two largest customers,
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   (12% of total sales) and Campbell. Approximately 90% of its container sales come from multi-year contracts. Supplier agreements soften the impact of global economic ups and downs, providing the company a stream of sales over a specified period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Parent Silgan Holdings markets Silgan's products primarily by a direct sales force and for its plastic container business, in part, through a network of distributors.

  <p>
   The company is part of the Metal Containers segment of its parent; this segment generated around 60% of its total revenues in 2014 as sales increased by 2% due to customer contract renewals and extensions in the metal. Unit volumes were relatively flat versus the prior year as a strong European fruit and vegetable pack and volumes associated with a previous acquisition were offset by declines in the core vegetable and soup markets in the United States.

  <p>
   A key to Silgan's growth has been its acquisition strategy. Its purchases, which reach across North and South America, Europe, and Asia, increase its proximity to customers. A number of acquisitions have been driven by food processors that stopped manufacturing their own metal food containers in an effort to reduce costs. Silgan has capitalized on the trend by purchasing the can-making plants of Nestlé,
   <company id="52370">
    Dial
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40118">
    Del Monte
   </company>
   , Campbell Soup, and others, along with snatching up agreements to supply the processors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Silgan is also searching for ways to lower costs and increase efficiency. While it has expanded the metal container business and increased its market share of metal containers primarily through acquisitions and the growth with existing customers, it is continuing to make capital investments in the metal container business to offer its customers value-added features, such as its family of Quick Top easy-open ends for metal food containers.
