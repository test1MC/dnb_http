   Agios Pharmaceuticals wants to say "
   <em>
    adios
   </em>
   " to cancer. The biopharmaceutical company is developing metabolic treatments for certain types of cancer and rare genetic diseases. Its lead drug candidates, AG-221 and AG-120, are oral tablets that apply cellular metabolism to treat patients with cancers that harbor certain mutations. Agios has a development collaboration agreement with
   <company id="12913">
    Celgene
   </company>
   for its cancer metabolism program. Another drug candidate, AG-348, would treat a form of hemolytic anemia known as pyruvate kinase deficiency, or PK deficiency. Agios went public in 2013, raising about $106 million in its IPO, which it plans to use to further fund clinical development for its drug candidates.

  <p>
   Celgene's exclusive discovery agreement with Agios extends through mid-2016; it holds the rights to further develop and commercialize drugs emerging from Agios' cancer metabolism research platform through the agreement.

  <p>
   Agios has primarily relied on sales of its securities and its collaboration with Celgene to fund its operations. In 2014, revenue increased 156% to $65.4 million, largely due to the amended and extended agreement with Celgene.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the company has operated at a loss every year since its inception, and it expects that to continue as it works to develop, conduct trials, and gain approvals for its drug candidates. Its net loss rose 36% to $53 million in 2014 as research and development activities increased and general and administrative expenses grew. As of the end of 2014, Agios' accumulated deficit totaled $166.9 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash outflow increased 5% to $59 million in 2014.

  <p>
   With a specialized focus on cellular metabolism products, the company is primarily working to develop treatments for cancer and rare genetic disorders of metabolism. It has ramped up its spending on R&amp;D activity as it prepares its candidates for clinical trials. In 2014, Celgene extended its collaboration with Agios through 2016. The following year, Celgene licensed AG-120, the second mutant protein inhibitor it has licensed from Agios, for development outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015, the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   granted AG-120 orphan drug designation for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. It also granted orphan drug status to investigational medicine AG-348 for the treatment of PK deficiency.
