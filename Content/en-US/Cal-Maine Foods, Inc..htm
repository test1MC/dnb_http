   Cal-Maine Foods' more than 26 million laying hens are some of its top performers. The nation's largest shell egg producer and marketer, the company sells more than 880 million dozen eggs a year. It is also one of the top suppliers of specialty shell eggs (which are Omega-3 enhanced, organic, and cage free), that are marketed under the Egg-Land's Best, Farmhouse, and 4Grain brands. Cal-Maine's operations span all phases of shell egg production: hatching chicks, making feed, housing hens, and distributing eggs. Customers include US grocery stores (such as
   <company id="40378">
    Publix
   </company>
   ), superstores the likes of
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   , and warehouse clubs (
   <company id="56161">
    Sam's Club
   </company>
   ), as well as foodservice distributors and makers of egg products, dotting 29 states.

        <p>
   Cal-Maine continues to grow its share of the shell-egg market through acquisitions of existing production and processing operations. It has made nearly 20 acquisitions since 1989. Each added between 600,000 to 7.5 million laying hens (called layers) and related facilities, as well as expanded the company's portfolio of name brands. Such investments and acquisitions have boosted Cal-Maine's flock of layers, pullets, and breeders. The flock is likely the largest in the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company acquired certain egg operations from
   <company id="11187">
    Pilgrim's Pride
   </company>
   in 2012. Cal-Maine gained two production facilities in Texas with capacity for some 1.4 million laying hens and stepped up its presence in the Southwest market as a result. Adding to its Texas holdings, Cal-Maine in late 2012 acquired Maxim Production Co. The purchases complement its 2009 acquisition of Florida's Tampa Farms' 4Grain brand of specialty shell eggs.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Cal-Maine also looks to shore up operations through construction of new, more efficient egg production and processing plants paired with a pullet growing facility. It also regularly disposes of older, less efficient facilities.
  </p>
        <p>
   On several separate occasions, the company was hit by a nationwide food recall. The 2011 and 2010 recalls were attributable to possible s

   contamination from eggs produced by
   <company id="130403">
    Hillandale Farms
   </company>
   of Iowa as well as from other outside contractors. In addition, Cal-Maine is under pressure from animal welfare advocates who argue for better treatment of its flock of hens, including larger cages, fewer beak trimmings, and decreased forced molting practices (which put chickens under stress to lay more eggs).
   <company id="56124">
    The Humane Society of the United States
   </company>
   and the United Egg Producers agreed in 2011 to press toward new federal legislation, which, if passed, will increase the production costs of housing and feeding hens.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Net sales rose 18% in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 due in part to an 8% increase in total dozens of eggs sold and a boost in the average selling price of shell eggs. Cal-Maine's 48% increase in net income during the same reporting period is primarily attributable to the increase in net sales partially offset by the increase in cost of sales. Contributing to the cost of sales bump were the increase in dozens produced, dozens purchased from outside shell egg producers, and cost of feed ingredients.

   Cal-Maine markets its shell eggs through a distribution network, serving a diverse group of customers. It caters to national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors, and egg product makers. Together, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club account for 31% of sales and Publix Super Markets generates 10%.

        <p>
   The company's advertising costs totaled $4,245, $5,768, and $2,098 in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

        <p>
   One can side with the chicken or the egg in the which-came-first argument, but it was Fred Adams Jr. who came first at Cal-Maine. A former salesman with pet food giant Ralston Purina (now
   <company id="104717">
    Nestlé Purina PetCare
   </company>
   ), Adams founded a poultry and egg business in Mendenhall, Mississippi, in 1957. He focused exclusively on egg sales in 1960 and merged his company in 1969 with Maine Egg Farms and Dairy Fresh Foods in California to form Cal-Maine Foods.
  </p>
        <p>
   Cal-Maine cracked new markets through internal growth and the acquisition of rival egg firms. The company acquired Egg City (Arkansas, 1989), Sunny Fresh Foods (Arkansas, 1990), Sunnyside Eggs (North Carolina, 1991), Wayne Detling Farms (Ohio, 1994), A&amp;G Farms (Kentucky, 1995), and Sunbest Farms (Arkansas, 1996). After going public in 1996, Cal-Maine bought two Georgia firms: Southern Empire Egg Farm (1997) and J&amp;S Farms (1998).
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1998 the company sold off its egg products division, which provided food makers with egg whites and yolks and accounted for 4% of total sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Cal-Maine bought two egg producers and processors: Kentucky-based Hudson Brothers and Texas-based Smith Farms. Declining supplies in the cyclical egg market and increasing demand in late 2000 raised the company out of the loss column for the first time in 18 months. In late 2001 Cal-Maine's board of directors voted to explore the possibility of the company becoming privately held but abandoned the idea because of a sagging egg market. Industry-wide overproduction helped to drive down egg prices, pecking away at the company's profits in 2002.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2003 Cal-Maine's board of directors voted to take the company private. However, as demand for eggs shot up, so did Cal-Maine stock prices, and shareholders were unconvinced such a move would benefit them. Faced with shareholder lawsuits, in November of that year the board voted to terminate the proposal to take the company private.
  </p>
        <p>
   After years of oversupply and weak prices, starting in 2003 the entire egg industry enjoyed a boost from the popular protein-heavy Atkins diet. Cal-Maine's sales jumped as people chose hard-boiled eggs as snacks. However, by 2004 its popularity had peaked, leaving the market (and Cal-Maine) with an egg glut and plunging sales. In 2005 the company acquired egg supplier
   <company id="130403">
    Hillandale Farms
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2006 the company formed a 50-50 joint venture (Green Forest Foods) with Pier 44 Properties to lease and operate Green Forest Egg's production assets, which included about 1 million laying hens at facilities located in Arkansas. Cal-Maine's bought of Pier 44's interest in Green Forest in 2007 and purchased the shell-egg division of George's Inc., for which it paid $11 million in cash.

   Fred Adams Jr., founder and chairman, handed over the title of CEO to former COO Dolph Baker in late 2010.
