   If Globus Medical helps you stand up straight, then the company's products are working. Globus Medical makes medical devices used during spinal surgery to treat a variety of spinal disorders and assist surgeons with different types of spinal procedures, from screws and plates to disc replacement systems and biomaterials for bone grafts. Top sellers include the REVERE screw-and-rod system and the COALITION cervical fusion device. Altogether Globus Medical has more than 100 spinal devices on the market in the US; its products are also sold in about 25 international markets. Globus Medical went public in 2012.

  <p>
   The company divides its products into two categories -- innovative fusion or disruptive technologies. Innovative fusion products are used in spinal fusion surgery, a common and traditional procedure where two individual vertebrae are fused together. This division accounts for about 60% of sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other 40% is made up of products in the disruptive technologies segment, a growing category of newer generation products used in novel surgical procedures or as improvements to existing procedures, as well as for minimally invasive procedures used as an alternative to surgery.

  <p>
   Even though international sales accounts for less than 10% of the company's overall revenues, sales outside the US are growing rapidly.

  <p>
   Globus Medical uses direct sales to promote its products in the US, primarily to spine surgeons and hospitals. The company is rapidly adding direct sales personnel in international countries; it also uses distributor representatives to sell in some global markets. Global sales are conducted in Europe, Australia, India, South Africa, South America, and the Middle East.

   Putting new products on the market is crucial in the medical device industry, and Globus Medical has launched more than 110 new products since its inception. The firm introduced 14 new products in 2012 including the MARS anterior retractor and the SECURE-C cervical artificial disc. The company has also entered a new market by introducing the Algea Therapies line of pain management products. Globus Medical is pursuing R&amp;D projects in both the innovative fusion and disruptive technology segments; in addition to new product development, the firm works to improve existing products.

   Other means of growth include pursuit of acquisitions or strategic alliances, increasing market penetration, growing the sales force, and hiring and retaining personnel with market experience.
