   Celanese Corporation gets a lot of good ink about its acetates. The global technology and specialty materials company's primary operations include the manufacture of building block chemicals like acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomers. Those chemicals are used in everything from inks and paints to agricultural products and chewing gum. Canadian subsidiary
   <company id="106429">
    Acetex
   </company>
   , the majority of whose sales come from Europe, is the world's largest acetyls manufacturer. Other products include acetate tow (in cigarette filters) which accounted for 14% of the company's total sales in 2015; industrial specialties like ethylene vinyl acetate; and engineered plastics.

  <p>
   The company is one of the world's largest producers of acetyl products, as well as a top global producer of engineered polymers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Celanese operates through four business segments: Advanced Engineered Materials (specialty polymers for application in automotive, medical and electronics products, as well as other consumer and industrial applications); Consumer Specialties (acetate products and the Nutrinova businesses, which serve consumer-driven applications); Industrial Specialties (emulsions and EVA performance polymers businesses); and Acetyl Intermediates (acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer, acetic anhydride, and acetate esters used as starting materials for colorants, paints, adhesives, coatings and medicines).
  </p>
  <p>
   Celanese also indirectly owns a 25% interest in National Methanol Company affiliate through CTE Petrochemicals Company, a joint venture with Texas Eastern Arabian Corporation Ltd. The remaining interest in Ibn Sina is held by
   <company id="53868">
    Saudi Basic Industries Corporation
   </company>
   (SABIC). SABIC and CTE entered into the Ibn Sina joint venture agreement in 1981. Ibn Sina is constructing a 50,000 ton per year polyacetal production facility in Saudi Arabia and the term of the joint venture agreement extends until 2032.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acetyl Intermediates accounted for 45% of Celanese's total revenues in 2015; Advanced Engineered Materials, 22%; Industrial Specialties, 18%; and Consumer Specialties, 16%.

  <p>
   Celanese markets its products both directly to customers and through distributors. Sales to major global customers in a wide range of industries are usually made under multi-year contracts. The company serves a broad range of industries including consumer and industrial adhesives, paints and coatings, textiles, food and beverage, automotive applications, consumer and medical applications, performance industrial applications, filter media, paper and packaging, chemical additives, and construction applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acetate tow is sold principally to the major tobacco companies that account for a majority of worldwide cigarette production. Customers of Clarifoil film include printers, carton manufacturers, retailers, packaging buyers, publishers, designers and freezer door manufacturers. Food protection ingredients are primarily sold through regional distributors to small and medium sized customers and directly to large multinational customers in the food industry.

  <p>
   In 2015 Celanese's net revenues decreased by 17% due to unfavorable currency impacts across all business segments resulting from a strong US dollar relative to the Euro; lower pricing and volume in the Acetyl Intermediates segment for vinyl acetate monomer and acetic acid; and lower acetate tow volume and pricing in the Consumer Specialties segment driven by customer destocking and reduced industry utilization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Advanced Engineered Materials dropped due to the effects of the strong dollar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consumer Specialties' sales declined as the result of lower acetate tow volume driven by customer destocking and lower acetate tow pricing driven by reduced industry use.
  </p>
  <p>
   Revenues from Industrial Specialties decreased primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact on emulsion polymers business resulting from the strong US dollar relative to the Euro; and lower pricing in emulsion polymers business due to lower raw material costs for VAM, primarily in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acetyl Intermediates results due to lower pricing and volume for VAM thanks to industry outages in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by 51% due to lower net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 cash from operating activities was $862 million compared to $962 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Celanese's strategy is to grow the company through expansion into emerging regions, particularly China; to offer innovation through developing new products and applications; increase its productivity through energy reduction, business process improvements, and manufacturing optimization; and boost its portfolio by growing its business through both acquisitions or internal growth. It s also eyeing Europe as a growth market.

   The company invested significantly in Asia to support continued growth in the region. It expanding its footprint in Singapore by constructing a (vinyl acetate/ethylene) VAE emulsions unit and expanded its customer base in Turkey. In 2015 it expanded its VAE  emulsions product portfolio with the addition of Celvolit 149HV at Nanjing, China plant. It also opened a center in Mexico to serve the company's expanding Central and South American customer base .
  </p>
  <p>
   To cut costs in 2015 the company ceased operation of its VAE emulsions facility in Meredosia, Illinois, sold its conventional and VAE emulsions facilities in Tarragona, Spain, and ceased 50% of manufacturing (acetate tow facility) operations in Lanaken, Belgium.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company teamed up with
   <company id="56032">
    Mitsui &amp; Co.
   </company>
   , forming a joint venture for the production of methanol at its integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. The total investment in the methanol facility (with a planned annual capacity of 1.3 million tons) was estimated to be $800 million. The plant went online in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   To better serve key customers in Japan, in 2014 Celanese Japan Limited and Setsunakasei Co. Ltd. (Setsunan) signed a deal whereby Setsunan will compound Celanese engineered polymers in Setsunan's facilities in Japan. That year
   <company id="52277">
    Indian Oil
