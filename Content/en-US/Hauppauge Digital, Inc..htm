   Wanna watch TV at work? Hauppauge Digital's WinTV analog and digital video boards let viewers videoconference, watch TV, and view input from VCRs and camcorders in a resizable window on a PC monitor. Hauppauge (pronounced "HAW-pog") also offers boards that accommodate radio and Internet broadcasts, and makes a line of PC video editing boards. The company outsources its manufacturing to companies in Europe and Asia. The company sells its products to contract electronics manufacturers, including

   Kenneth Plotkin and Kenneth Aupperle, former
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   employees, co-founded Hauppauge Digital in 1982. The business originally manufactured PC hardware and software used to accelerate scientific and mathematical calculations. By 1985 Hauppauge Digital was marketing 12 software products to universities and research labs; that year it started exporting to Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   When Intel began making math coprocessors, Hauppauge got into developing motherboards -- until Intel moved into that market, too. In 1991 Hauppauge introduced the PC/TV video board, underpricing rivals
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   and
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   . Since 1992 it focused almost exclusively on digital video products. The company went public in 1995 and introduced several new products, including a low-priced video board aimed at the consumer market. The following year Hauppauge Digital teamed with Intel to develop boards that enable PCs to receive Internet broadcasts.

   In 1997 Hauppauge Digital's products were tapped for incorporation into electronics made by
   <company id="10381">
    Compaq
   </company>
   (acquired in 2002 by Hewlett-Packard) and
   <company id="101968">
    U.S. Robotics
   </company>
   (subsequently part of
   <company id="12475">
    3Com
   </company>
   , which later sold most of its stake to
   <company id="102381">
    Accton Technology
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56796">
    NatSteel
   </company>
   ). Sales jumped 50% in fiscal 1998, the result of growth in the company's distribution channels. That year Hauppauge began developing digital TV reception cards for PC makers. In 2000 the company bought video interface specialist Eskape Labs. (Eskape Labs' co-founder and EVP Christopher Knight was a child actor who played middle son Peter on
   <i>
    The Brady Bunch
   </i>
   .)

   In 2001 Aupperle died; Plotkin took on the additional title and duties of president. The next year former Priority Call executive Dean Cirielli joined the company as president. Cirielli resigned in 2004, and Plotkin reassumed the title of president.
