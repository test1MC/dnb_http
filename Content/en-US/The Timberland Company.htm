   Even non-hikers can get a kick out of Timberlands. Best known for making men's, women's, and kids' footwear, Timberland manufactures hiking boots, boat shoes, sandals, and dress and outdoor casual footwear. The company also makes apparel (outerwear, shirts, pants, socks) and accessories, such as sunglasses, watches, and belts. Its brands include SmartWool, howies, IPATH, and Timberland. Timberland sells its products through about 230 company-owned stores and through department and athletic shops in Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and the US. In 2011 uber apparel maker

   purchased the company for more than $2 billion.

  <p>
   Behemoth V.F., which banks on such popular brands as North Face, Vans, Wrangler, and Nautica for revenue, acquired Timberland for $2 billion (or $43 a share) in 2011. Enticed by Timberland's presence overseas and the company's strategic growth during the past decade, V.F. is using the purchase to boost its profitable

    outdoor and action sports business segment
   </company>
   to represent more than half of its total revenue and comprise up to 60% of its business by fiscal 2015. As part of the transaction, V.F. will retain Timberland's headquarters in New Hampshire.

  <p>
   Footwear, Timberland's top product segment, accounts for some 79% of sales. Acquisitions of IPATH (2007) and howies (2006), along with a boost in sales of casual and outdoor performance footwear in recent years, have collectively helped to raise the segment's revenue and offset sales declines of boots and kids' footwear during the economic downturn. Timberland has been slowing shifting its retail format to smaller, more footwear-focused stores. To this end, it has pared down its retail locations by shuttering about 40 of its larger specialty stores in the US, Europe, and Asia and closing several underperforming US factory outlet stores.

  <p>
   The company sells its products through top department and specialty stores as well as Timberland-branded retail stores throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, South America, South Africa, and the Middle East. About 40% of the company's sales come from North America; however, Timberland has been pushing into global markets, such as Europe and Asia, to diversify its revenue streams. Growth in its European distribution operation and gains in Scandinavia were key to balancing stalled sales across Europe. In Asia, Timberland saw its distribution business gain a foothold, showing some traction in China. The company has continued to expand its brand into China and India and opened its first company-owned retail store in China in 2010.

  <p>
   Overall, a debt-free balance sheet has helped to keep Timberland's head above water during the global economic downturn. During 2010, Timberland saw sales rise among its men's footwear in Europe, North America, and Asia. Revenue for women's and kids' footwear rose, as well, in Europe while the company's Timberland PRO products picked up steam in North America. Timberland apparel has been big in Asia while SmartWool sales of apparel and accessories in North America rose. Licensing revenue, which represents 2% of its business, has risen in recent years due, in part, to the company's licensed Timberland PRO apparel and licensed kids' apparel.

  <p>
   Not only was Timberland's purchase of SmartWool a strategic acquisition for a footwear manufacturer, but buying the sock maker allowed Timberland to expand into international outlets. Timberland bought the Colorado-based maker of wool socks, apparel, and accessories from RAF Industries and the Stripes Group for about $82 million. SmartWool items are sold in outdoor specialty stores in the US and through independent distributors in Canada, Europe, and Asia.

  <p>
   After buying a 50% interest in the Abington Shoe Company in 1952, Nathan Swartz purchased the rest three years later and brought his 19-year-old son Sidney on board. Abington Shoe made handmade private-label footwear during the 1950s and 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1968 Nathan retired, leaving sons Sidney and Herman in charge. The brothers persuaded Goodyear to make a synthetic rubber sole, which the Swartzes then bonded to blond leather, creating the first waterproof Timberland boot in 1973. Because of the boot's popularity, the company changed its name to The Timberland Company five years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   The boots were a cult hit on US college campuses, but they really kicked up a following when they reached Italy in 1980. Spurred by the success overseas, US retailers gave the boots an increased focus, and by the late 1980s Timberland was riding the crest of the outdoors craze. The company opened its first store in 1986 and went public a year later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Timberland's success brought competition from NIKE and Reebok. As the "brown shoes" market became saturated, the company closed its US plants and started outsourcing production in 1994. Timberland streamlined its product lines and announced plans to revamp retail stores in 1997. The next year it introduced the "beige shoe," a boot and sneaker hybrid under the Gorge MPO brand. Also in 1998 Jeffrey Swartz stepped into his father's Timberlands as CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Timberland unveiled the Mountain Athletics product line aimed at the 18- to 25-year-old outdoor athlete market and Timberland Pro -- footwear for the tradesperson (construction workers, factory foremen). Timberland reacquired the Asian distribution of its products from Inchcape in February 2000. In 2001 the company launched its "Around the World" ad campaign, the company's most ambitious ever.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2003 Timberland penned a licensing agreement with Italy's Marcolin, S.p.A, to make and distribute Timberland-brand eyewear.
