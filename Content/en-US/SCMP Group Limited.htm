   Alfred Cunningham and a group of British businessmen set up South China Morning Post (Holdings) as a mouthpiece for China's reform movement, and
   <i>
    South China Morning Post
   </i>
   was first published in 1903. The company went public in 1971. Later renamed News Printing Ltd., it diversified into securities and commercial printing. It also acquired stakes in
   <i>
    The Asian Wall Street Journal
   </i>
   and the
   <i>
    Far Eastern Economic Review.
   </i>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. conglomerate acquired News Printing in 1987. After reorganization, the company went public again -- as South China Morning Post (Holdings) -- in 1990. Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok's Kerry Media acquired 35% of SCMP in 1993; he became its chairman.

  <p>
   The Asian economic crisis of the 1990s caused a decline in advertising, forcing the company to close unprofitable businesses and scrap plans to build an ice skating rink in Shanghai. After Kuok retired in 1997, his son Khoon Ean took over as chairman. The company reported a $33 million loss early the following year and raised investor eyebrows when it revealed it had invested in businesses owned by the Kuok family. Still struggling against the Asian economic crisis, SCMP watched newspaper and magazine advertising drop by more than 35% in 1999.

  <p>
   The company announced plans in 2000 to beef up its online content in conjunction with its print operations to make new multimedia products. It changed its name to SCMP Group in late 2001. That year, SCMP Group experienced some bumps along the road in the rocky economic climate, resulting in some layoffs and speculation that the company might sell off underperforming divisions.

   In 2005 the company launched a new upscale lifestyle magazine called
   <em>
    STYLE.
