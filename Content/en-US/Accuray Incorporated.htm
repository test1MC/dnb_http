   Accuray gets an A, not a C for accuracy. Its radiosurgery CyberKnife system, uses precisely aimed, high-dose radiation and improves upon older radiosurgery systems that have limited mobility and are mostly used to treat brain tumors. Doctors can use CyberKnife to treat tumors anywhere in the body; the system tracks and adjusts for movement in real time, allowing for patient and tumor movement. Accuray also offers the TomoTherapy systems, which allow doctors to change the intensity of the radiation beam to adapt to the shape, location, and size of a tumor. Together, the two products have an installed base of more than 700 units in about 40 countries.

  <p>
   The CyberKnife Systems are fully robotic stereotactic radiosurgery systems and stereotactic body radiation therapy systems used to treat multiple types of cancer and tumors throughout the body. The CyberKnife M6 Series System  includes fixed and iris collimators as well as a multi-leaf collimator,and has improved throughput, motion tracking and treatment flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Procedures with CyberKnife require no anesthesia and can be performed on an outpatient basis. Through a "shared ownership" program, hospitals can reduce their upfront expense to install a CyberKnife system. Once the system is in place, Accuray provides training and technical support, and receives a significant portion of the revenue from each procedure performed. Additional revenues come from service plans and sales of system upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
   The TomoTherapy devices use computerized tomography (CT) imaging to focus on killing cancer cells while avoiding harm to healthy tissues. The devices provide an array of technologies ranging from high-precision radiosurgery for early-stage and localized diseases (such as cancer) to image-guided radiation therapy for diseases that have advanced throughout the body. The Tomo H Series includes the following options: TomoHelical, TomoDirectTM, High Performance VoLo Planning, and TomoEdge dynamic jaws.

  <p>
   Accuray has regional offices in several US states, as well as in Belgium, France, Switzerland, China, Hong Kong; Spain; India; Russia; Germany; the United Arab Emirates; the UK; Brazil; and Japan. Its products are also marketed in select European, Latin American, and Asian markets (in addition to the US and Canada).
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 the Americas accounted for 46% of Accuray's total revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Accuray employs a direct sales force in the US and uses a combination of its own sales personnel, and group purchasing organizations and distributors elsewhere. Countries where it has direct sales staff include most Western Europe nations, as well as Japan, India, and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's systems are marketed to hospitals, cancer treatment centers, and university research organizations in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region. Its sales and distribution channels cover more than 90 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advertising expenses were $0.5 million, $0.6 million, and $0.7 million for fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

  <p>
   Accuray's revenues doubled to $409 million in fiscal 2012 through its acquisition of
   <company id="138344">
    TomoTherapy
   </company>
   but declined in fiscal 2013 to $316 million due to a lower product revenues. Since then, product sales and service earnings have rebounded, and in fiscal 2015 revenue grew 3% to $379.8 million. This was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has been in the red for the past few years. It slightly recovered in fiscal 2014 as R&amp;D expenses declined, but net loss increased in 2015 to $40 million on higher operating expenses (including R&amp;D and general and administrative costs). Operating cash outflow has followed net income's suit and in 2015 the company had a cash outflow of $17 million (versus an inflow in 2014).

  <p>
   Radiosurgery was developed to treat brain tumors, but Accuray's strategy has been to expand the CyberKnife's use to treat tumors anywhere in the body where radiation is indicated. So far the strategy has worked: More than 55% of patients treated by the Cyberknife system in the US are treated for tumors in areas other than the brain. Accuray also works to expand use of its devices by educating doctors about the benefits of radiosurgery (via symposiums and clinical studies).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Accuray is actively working to increase its sales and distribution capabilities outside the US by adding direct sales and marketing personnel in international growth markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other expansion strategies include the pursuit of potential acquisitions and partnerships, as well as the development of upgraded versions of its products through internal research and development efforts. In 2015, the company formed a partnership with MIM Software to further develop software for the TomoTherapy and CyberKnife systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Improving its visibility and distribution options, in 2014 the company signed a three-year group purchasing agreement with Premier, Inc.; it also signed new three-year contracts with Amerinet and
   <company id="122607">
    Novation

   covering the CyberKnife M6 and TomoTherapy portfolios. The following year it signed a sales agreement with Christie InnoMed for both systems.

  <p>
   Accuray went public in 2007, with an eye toward using the money for sales and marketing, research and development, and acquisitions. John Adler, a neurosurgeon from Stanford University, founded the company in 1990.
