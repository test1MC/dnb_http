   South African retail group Steinhoff International has an eye for a bargain. Steinhoff's 40+ retail brands, which include Conforama, Harveys and Freedom, mostly occupy the value end of the market. The majority of the company's brands deal in furniture and household goods, but it also owns clothing, accessories and automotive brands. It operates approximately 6,500 stores across 30 countries in Western Europe, Africa, and Australasia that have a combined floorspace of some 5.4 million m2. Steinhoff also owns US-based retailer
   <company id="124361">
    Mattress Firm
   </company>
   , which it acquired in mid-2016, and its 3,600 company-operated and franchised locations. The company was founded in Germany in 1964, before relocating to South Africa in the 1990s.

  <p>
   Steinhoff operates three segments: Household goods, General Merchandise and Automotive. Household goods is the largest of the three by far at around 78% of revenue. Automotive brings in 13% and General Merchandise 9%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Household goods' biggest brands include Conforama, which runs three retail branches with stores concentrated in France; Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK; and Freedom, Snooze and Poco in Australasia. The company also owns and operates US-based
   <company id="124361">
    Mattress Firm
   </company>
   , which it acquired in 2016. Additionally, the segment operates a supply chain division that gives a competitive advantage to Steinhoff's brands by sourcing and manufacturing raw materials and household goods; it also sells to third party retailers. The division has 21 manufacturing facilities across five countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The General merchandise segment comprises mostly the Pepkor businesses acquired in 2014. The chain of shops sells mostly low-cost clothing, and is South Africa's biggest retail chain. The Pepco brand is Poland's biggest non-food retailer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In South Africa, the company also operates Unitrans, a vehicle and parts dealer, and Hertz, a car rental company, under its Automotive segment.

  <p>
   Steinhoff has operations in 30 countries across Europe, Africa and Australasia, including around 6,500 stores, of which roughly two-thirds are in Africa. France is the company's largest single market by revenue.

  <p>
   In 2015, revenue grew to €9.8 billion, a 15% increase on prior year. Growth was attributable to an expansion in the discount and value retail market, particularly Conforama, which grew its market share. There was also a contribution from the acquired Pepkor business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income rose 33% to €830 million  in line with the increase in sales. Cash flow from operating activities rose 26%, for much the same reasons.

  <p>
   Steinhoff's 'flight to value' strategy aims to capitalize on growth in the value market. Its business model is to buy value chains in markets in which Steinhoff is strong, and support them with its horizontal integrated supply chain division. To that end in recent years it has purchased Pepkor Group, a South African retailer that owns Pep and Pepco brands, and has reached an agreement to buy Poundland, a British retailer with more than 900 stores.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the household goods brands in South Africa, the company worked to improve cash flow by adjusting the cash/credit sales mix - credit sales was reduced to 55% from 63% in 2014.

  <p>
   The Group has made a number of notable acquisitions in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Steinhoff acquired US mattress giant
   <company id="124361">
    Mattress Firm
   </company>
   in a deal valued at $3.8 billion. The purchase serves to  introduce Steinhoff to the US market.  The company, which offered 115% ($64 a share) of Mattress Firm's stock price (about $30 a share in August 2016), operates the US retailer as a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition signals Steinhoff's confidence in Mattress Firm and its ubiquitous presence in a stable and growing US retail mattress market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Earlier in 2016 Steinhoff reached an agreement to buy Poundland, a British retailer with revenue of £1.2 billion and 900 stores in the British Isles. Steinhoff hopes to capitalize on the growing value retail market in the UK and right the listing discount chain by putting its supply side muscle to work. The agreed sum is £597 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Steinhoff bought Pepkor retail group, which owns Pepco, Pep, PEP&amp;CO and Best &amp; Less among others, for $5.7 billion. The acquisition represents a significant expansion in Steinhoff's overall size, which will provide greater opportunities to exploit synergies between the Group's various brands.
