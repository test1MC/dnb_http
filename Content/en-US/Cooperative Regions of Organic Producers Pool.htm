   Cooperative Regions of Organic Producers Pool (CROPP) is the largest organic farming cooperative in North America. The group's 1,840-plus farmer/members produce the co-op's Organic Valley Family of Farms and Organic Prairie brands of fluid and shelf-stable milk, along with cheese, butter, and soy milk. Beyond the dairy barn, the cooperative also offers organic citrus juices, produce, eggs, meats, and poultry. Its Organic Valley products are sold by food retailers, and its ingredients are marketed to other organic food processors. Wisconsin-headquartered CROPP's farmer/members are located throughout North America and Australia. The co-op was founded in 1988.

  <p>
   The co-op's sales grew 8% in 2013 versus 2012 to $928 million, after increasing by 20% in the previous annual comparison. Sales have risen sharply along with increasing demand for organic milk and other dairy foods. CROPP added 10 new members in 2013. The co-op struggled in 2013 as a result of a fire that burned down part of its headquarters building. The blaze occurred about a year after the co-op completed a $6.7 million addition to the structure.

   CROPP seeks to quench consumers' growing thirst for organic milk with new products, including the 2012 launch of Organic Valley Grassmilk, an organic specialty milk produced from cows that are 100% grass fed. Organic Valley Grassmilk attained nationwide distribution in mid-2013.

  <p>
   The co-op operates under a regional business model, by which milk is produced, bottled, and distributed in the region where it's farmed to ensure fewer miles from farm to table and to support local economies. About 75% of the co-ops 1,800-plus farmers are located in the "Heartland" region of the US, which includes Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan.
