   International Rectifier (IR) is a top maker of power management semiconductors, which refine the electricity flowing into a device from a battery or a power grid, enabling more efficient operation. Its products -- including MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors), diodes, relays, and rectifiers -- are used in appliances, automobiles, computers, communication devices, lighting and displays, gaming consoles, industrial motors, and military equipment. IR sells its products through distributors, OEMs, and contract manufacturers. Most of the global company's sales come from Asian customers. IR was acquired by

   in early 2015.

  <p>
   International Rectifier was acquired by Infineon Technologies in 2015. It operates as a subsidiary of Infineon. The combined company has a bigger product portfolio and geographic reach that should help it engage with small and medium-size customers in the US and Asia.

   IR's largest segment, power management devices, targets power supply, data processing, and industrial and commercial battery-powered system applications. Other segments include energy saving products (industrial automation, lighting and display, audio and video), automotive products (automotive systems), enterprise power (servers, storage, infrastructure, gaming consoles), and HiRel (high-reliability power components for mission-critical applications).

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Asia accounts for about 58% of the company's revenue, with the US contributing 23% and Europe 19%. IR reported sales increases in all geographic markets in 2014.

   In 2014 revenue was $1.11 billion, a 13% increase from 2013 with each segment posting higher sales. The higher sales helped IR achieve a profit in its last year as an independent company. It recorded net income of $58.7 million, a turnaround from a loss of

   In fiscal 2014, net income was $58.73 million, increased by 166% from net loss of $88 million in 2013. Besides improved revenue, IR had a decrease in asset impairment, restructuring, and related charges that led to the 2013 loss.

  <p>
   Lithuanian native Eric Lidow came to the US and in 1947 founded International Rectifier (IR) with his father. The company provided diodes, rectifiers, and transistors for the US market and became the first to introduce silicon technology to Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even though it held many pioneering high-tech patents, IR stagnated in the mid-1970s. In 1976 Lidow's son Alex developed the HEXFET, an advanced metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) that broke electrical current into smaller, more usable units. Alex and his brother Derek joined IR in 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Lidow brothers argued constantly over corporate strategy. After a reorganization had devolved operations into autonomous realms controlled by each brother, IR was reconstituted in 1992. It moved away from selling commodity components, and instead focused on developing a low-cost electric power conversion chipset.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alex and Derek became co-CEOs in 1995, succeeding their father. In 1998, to settle a patent squabble, Unitrode released its rights as the exclusive licensee for IR's power MOSFET technology in return for a percentage of licensing profits.

   and

    Samsung Electronics
   </company>
   later licensed the technology from IR.
  </p>
  <p>
   Derek resigned in 1999 and Alex took over as CEO. In 2000 IR acquired rival
   <company id="15198">
    Zing Technologies
   </company>
   for about $29 million. Over the following two years it completed a string of small, complementary acquisitions to round out its product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Booming markets, along with a strategic emphasis on higher-margin proprietary products, helped IR achieve record sales and earnings for fiscal 2001. However, business conditions quickly turned dire, and a precipitous decline in the global electronics industry led the company to cut 500 jobs -- about 8% of its workforce.
