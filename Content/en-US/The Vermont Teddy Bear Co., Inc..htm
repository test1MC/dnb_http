   Being cute may not be the key to success in the business world, but Vermont Teddy Bear thinks it can't hurt. It makes old-fashioned, jointed teddy bears up to 3 feet tall. They're available in several colors and about 190 different outfits, such as ballet tutus, wedding gowns, and sports uniforms. Best known for its Bear-Grams (which include a bear, candy, and personalized message), Vermont Teddy Bear sells the bears from a pair of factory retail stores and via catalogs and the Internet. Other operations include Pajama-Grams (sleepwear and bath or body products in a keepsake hat box) and SendAMERICA's Tasty-Grams (regional food specialties). An investment group took the company private in 2005.

   John Sortino began selling teddy bears from a peddler's pushcart in Burlington, Vermont, in 1981. He introduced the Bear-Gram (now known simply as BearGram) in 1985. But what Sortino had in enthusiasm, he lacked in business savvy. Despite a $1 million infusion into the company in 1987, Vermont Teddy Bear was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1990, but it boosted sales by advertising Bear-Grams on popular radio shows. Vermont Teddy Bear went public in 1993.

   Cuddly, however, doesn't pay the bills, and the company ran into trouble again, spending the money from the IPO on a new headquarters and stockpiling $4 million in bears. Sortino resigned in 1995 and Patrick Burns, a Disney and L.L. Bean veteran, came in to rebuild. Burns cut staff, mortgaged the headquarters, arranged for bank credit, and slashed inventory. In 1997 Burns left and CFO Elisabeth Robert became president and CEO. That year the company began taking orders on its website. To cut costs, Vermont Teddy Bear began importing some materials from outside the US in 1998.

   In 1999 the company partnered with toy retailer Zany Brainy for the Make-A-Friend-For-Life program, in which custom-made bears are sold at kiosks in Zany Brainy's stores. In 2000, however, the company ended its relationship with Zany Brainy because it could not meet minimum sales goals (although visitors can still build their own bears at the company's Shelburne, Vermont factory). Building on its success with its bear delivery services, Vermont Teddy Bear began a new business segment in fiscal 2001, with its SendAMERICA subsidiary selling handcrafts and foodstuffs made by American artisans and growers.

   Vermont Teddy Bear launched PajamaGram in April 2002. Later that year it switched the focus of SendAMERICA; dubbing the new product TastyGrams, it ditched the handcrafts and began concentrating on regional foods such as NY Carnegie Deli Cheesecake and Gino's Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. In September 2003 Vermont Teddy Bear broadened its product line with its acquisition of Calyx &amp; Corolla, a direct marketer of flowers and plants.
