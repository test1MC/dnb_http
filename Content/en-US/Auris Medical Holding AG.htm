   Auris Medical is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the developing new products for the treatment of inner ear disorders. Its most advanced product candidate, AM-101, is in Phase 3 clinical development for acute inner ear tinnitus under a special protocol assessment from the

    FDA
   </company>
   , indicating that the federal agency has evaluated the proposed design, size, and planned analysis of the trial and determined that they are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate. It is also developing AM-111 for acute inner ear hearing loss and plans to advance the late-stage AM-111 clinical program in early 2015, which will require additional funding. Auris Medical went public in 2014.

  <p>
   The company raised $56.4 million in an August 2014 IPO. Of the proceeds, it earmarked about $43 million to $48 million to fund research and development expenses for AM-101 (up to the read out of data from the Phase 3 trial), and $8 million to $10 million to fund other research and development activities, including part of the late-stage AM-111 clinical program. The remainder was tagged for working capital and other financial corporate purposes.

  <p>
   Both acute inner ear tinnitus and hearing loss are conditions for which there is high unmet medical need, and Auris Medical believes it has the potential to be the first to market in these indications.
  </p>
  <p>
   In two recently completed Phase 2 clinical trials, AM-101 demonstrated a favorable safety profile (a beneficial benefit-to-risk ratio based on the incidence and severity of adverse events), and a statistically significant improvement in tinnitus loudness and other patient reported outcomes. Auris Medical expects to have top-line Phase 3 clinical data for AM-101 in early 2016.
