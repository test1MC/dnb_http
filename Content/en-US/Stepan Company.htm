   Company secrets aside, makers of laundry detergents, shampoos, toothpaste, and other personal care products can come clean with Stepan Company. Stepan makes basic and intermediate chemicals, including surfactants, specialty products, phthalic anhydride, and polyurethane polyols. Surfactants, the company's largest sector, are used as cleaning agents used in consumer products like detergents, toothpastes, and cosmetics. Stepan's surfactants are also used in commercial and industrial applications ranging from emulsifiers for agricultural insecticides to agents used in oil recovery. The company also makes phthalic anhydride and other polymers, as well as specialty chemicals for food and pharmaceutical uses.

  <p>
   Surfactants, which accounted for 67% of Stepan's sales in 2014, are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes, dishes, carpets, floors and walls, as well as shampoos and body washes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The polymer product group, which accounted for 29% of sales, includes phthalic anhydride, polyurethane polyols and polyurethane systems. Stepan is a supplier of polyurethane polyols used in the expanding thermal insulation market, and the coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Specialty Products, which accounted for 4% of sales, include flavors, emulsifiers and solubilizers used in food, flavoring, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical applications
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Polymers are used in the construction and appliance industries, as well as in applications for the coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers and flexible foam industries. They are also used by automotive, boating and other consumer product companies. Specialty products are used primarily by food, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Principal customers for surfactants are manufacturers of detergents, shampoos, lotions, fabric softeners, toothpastes and cosmetics. In addition, surfactants are sold to the producers of agricultural emulsifiers and lubricating products. Surfactants are also sold into the enhanced oil recovery end markets. Stepan does not sell directly to the retail market, but sells to a wide range of manufacturers in many industries and has many competitors.

  <p>
   Stepan's revenues increased by 2% in 2014 due to a 14% growth in polymers as a result of increase in sales volume, higher average selling prices and the effects of foreign currency translation. The growth in sales volume was due to organic growth in North America and Europe and full year sales from the North American polyester resins business acquired from
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   MaterialScience.
  </p>
  <p>
   The growth was partially offset by a decline in revenues from 2% dip in Surfactants and 1% drop in Specialty Products results due to lower sales volume and selling prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Stepan's net income decreased by 22% due to higher costs as a result of an increase in depreciation expenses attributed to  manufacturing assets at its Canadian plant. It was also due to increase in business restructuring and asset impairments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's operating cash flow dropped by 45% in 2014 due to lower net income and achange in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in cash used in inventories and receivables.
  </p>

  <p>
   The company expands through acquiring surfactants, polyols, and urethane assets, establishing manufacturing plants, sales offices and product development laboratories close to its expanding global markets, focusing on new product development, and forming strategic alliances with other chemical companies to add know-how, technology, capital, and customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stepan saw an opportunity with the growth of Anionic volumes in Brazil as a result of the shift in market from laundry bars to powders to liquids. To meet this projected demand, in 2015 the company built a new customer service laboratory in SÃ£o Paulo.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company initiates expansion and other significant capital projects. In 2015 Stepan built a new manufacturing plant in Nanjing Chemical Industrial Park in China to replace the company's original China facility from which the company was required to vacate.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold its Specialty Polyurethane Systems business (KITS) to J6 Polymers, LLC, which allowed its Polymer business segment to redeploy resources to further improve growth and innovation in its line of polyols for Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants and Elastomers (CASE) applications.

   In 2014 purchased the sulfonation production facility in Bahia, Brazil from Procter &amp; Gamble do Brazil S.A. for $5 million. The facility is located in the northeast region of Brazil and has 30,000 metric tons of capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   It also bought chemical manufacturing assets from The Sun Products Corporation's Pasadena, Texas, manufacturing site.

  <p>
   The family-owned business was founded in 1932 by Alfred C. Stepan Jr. It was incorporated in 1959.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 Stepan acquired the manufacturing assets of Peter Cremer GmbH's 100,000 ton per year methyl ester plant located on Singapore's Jurong Island.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, in a major expansion into eastern Europe, Stepan's European subsidiary acquired Alfa Systems Sp. z o.o. from Chemitex Holding Limited and Chemovil Holdings Limited. Poland-based Alfa Systems manufactures aromatic polyester polyols from recycled polyethylene terephthalate.
