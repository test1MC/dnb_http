   Ball Aerospace has worked on such projects as the Hubble Space Telescope and
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   's James Webb Space Telescope. It designed the Kepler spacecraft and photometer for NASA's "planet-hunting" mission, which launched in the spring of 2009. The photometer is the largest camera that NASA has ever sent outside of the Earth's orbit.

  <p>
   Among other projects, Ball Aerospace was selected to build imaging instruments for NASA's proposed trip to Pluto; helped develop and integrate the Flyby and Impactor spacecraft for comet exploration; and assembled the NPP polar-orbiting satellite. It also completed camera systems for Mars projects, microwave imagers for weather satellites, and optics systems for large telescopes.

   Ball Aerospace contributed 10% of its parent's revenues in 2014. Aerospace and Technologies segment sales in 2014 increased $37.7 due to higher sales for civil space contracts and US national defense contracts. Segment earnings in 2014 increased $13.5 million as a result of favorable program execution and increased recovery of pension costs.

   In 2015 Ball Aerospace signed on to support Principal Investigator Dr. Philip Christensen at
   <company id="125047">
    Arizona State University
   </company>
   to develop the Thermal Emission Imaging System (E-THEMIS) for  a NASA mission to study Jupiter's moon, Europa. The E-THEMIS is one of nine science instruments that will fly aboard a spacecraft to investigate whether Europa could harbor conditions suitable for life. The role E-THEMIS plays in the mission is to act as a heat detector.
