   While Rambus sits around and thinks of new semiconductor technologies, other companies put its designs to work. Rambus licenses its intellectual property designs for computer memory -- called Rambus DRAM, or RDRAM -- that speeds the exchange of signals between a computer's memory and logic chips. RDRAM chips are used in PCs, video game consoles, and other electronic systems. Rambus' leading licensees include
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41865">
    Fujitsu
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41888">
    Toshiba
   </company>
   . It also licenses LCD lighting product designs. The company holds more than 1,800 patents and has some 700 patent applications pending.

  <p>
   The company's Memory and Interfaces Division (MID) accounts for 75% of revenue with the Cryptography Research Division generating 17% of revenue with its "Other" segment bringing in the remaining 8%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rambus also measures revenue gained through royalties and contracts. About 89% was generated by royalties with contracts supplying the rest.

  <p>
   Rambus' intellectual property designs are developed from offices in Canada, Finland, France, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of its customers are located in Asia, where the bulk of the world's semiconductors are manufactured. The US accounts for about 40% of sales with South Korea with 39%.

   Rambus has traditionally depended on a small number of licensees, with its top five customers accounting for about 65% of sales. Customers include

   Rambus does not manufacture chips that use its technology; the company mostly generates revenue from royalties for licensing its designs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales were flat from 2014 to 2015 at about $296 million. A drop in sales from the MID division was offset by sales increases in the CRD and other segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   A big benefit from incomes taxes of $151 million boosted profit 707% to $211 million in 2015 from $26 million in 2014. The tax benefit came from the release of the valuation allowance on deferred taxes offset by federal state and foreign taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was steady at $76.6 million in 2015, compared to $77 million in 2014.

  <p>
   In 2015 Rambus began a restructuring program to reduce corporate spending on sales, general and administrative programs and refine some research and development efforts. The company $3.6 million in 2015 related to the reduction in workforce.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of the company's R&amp;D spending resulted in its first physical product, the R+ DDR4 server memory chipset which is aimed at the enterprise and data center server markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rambus also signed or renewed license agreements with

   Rambus acquired Smart Card Software, including Bell Identification(Bell ID) and Ecebs, for Â£64.7M in cash. The advanced mobile payment platform developed by Bell ID, along with the smart ticketing platform created by Ecebs, will be incorporated into the Rambus Cryptography Research Division. Rambus looks for the the technologies developed by Bell ID and Ecebs to complement its CryptoManager platform.

  <p>
   Rambus was founded in 1990 by Michael Farmwald and Mark Horowitz. Farmwald, whose business cards sported the title "visionary," previously built supercomputers at
   <company id="132785">
    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
   </company>
   . Horowitz was a
   <company id="40442">
    Stanford
   </company>
   electrical engineering professor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1991
   <company id="10037">
    AMD
   </company>
   chip expert Geoff Tate was named CEO. The next year Rambus began licensing its technology. Farmwald left in 1993 to start media processor company Chromatic Research (later part of
   <company id="43328">
    ATI Technologies
   </company>
   , which was acquired by AMD in 2006).
  </p>
  <p>
   Rambus's big break came in 1995, when
   <company id="41877">
    Nintendo
   </company>
   used Rambus dynamic random-access memories (RDRAMs) to speed up its Nintendo 64 video game system. In 1997 (the year it went public) Rambus and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   began developing a chipset to support the use of RDRAM with Intel's PC microprocessors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concern over implementation of RDRAM technology grew among PC makers in 1999 when Intel delayed its Rambus-based Camino chipset. Camino was finally unveiled later that year, but the delay spooked PC makers, several of whom opted for cheaper, more familiar memory technologies. Nonetheless,
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   were among PC makers to release systems with RDRAM chips in 1999.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Intel announced a move away from exclusive use of RDRAMs. Meanwhile, Rambus filed suit against numerous chip companies for patent infringement; it avoided going to court by reaching licensing agreements with
