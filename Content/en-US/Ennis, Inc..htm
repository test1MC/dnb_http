   Ennis logged $542.4 million in fiscal 2014 (ended February), up some 2% from 2013's $533.5 million. An 8% apparel volume gain boosted apparel sales by $3.7 million, or 2% overall, dragged down by a decrease in average selling price. In its print business, Ennis posted a $5.2 million, or 2%, increase in revenue due to the positive impact of acquisitions, which added $23.2 million in reported sales during the reporting period. Impairment of goodwill and $24.2 million in trademark expenses spurred net income to decline some 42% to $13.2 million in 2014. Cash flow from operations came in at $32.8 million in 2014, down $17.2 million from 2013's $50 million. Ennis had used cash for inventory and to reduce its pension liability.

  <p>
   Demand for the company's business forms and other printed products has decreased as electronic and digital technologies replace traditional custom-printed documents and customer communications.

  <p>
   In a bid to reverse slumping sales, Ennis built a new apparel factory located in Sonora, Mexico. The facility, which serves as a knitting, dyeing, cutting, sewing, and distribution plant, should help Alstyle Apparel become more cost-competitive with its rivals, which include

   . The apparel business faces challenges, including rising cotton costs.

  <p>
   Ennis has returned to acquisition mode after a recession-induced hiatus. In 2014 Ennis purchased Hoosier Data Forms, located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The deal follows the company's late 2013 acquisition of the Custom Envelope Division, part of
   <company id="44523">
    Cenveo
   </company>
   's Custom Resale Group, for $47.25 million in cash. The deal gave Ennis the Wisco brand and its Tennessee factory and the National Imprint Corporation and its brand. Ennis also bought the Folder Express business and trade name from Wright Printing Company for $14.6 million, as well as all artwork and production files from Duffie Graphics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most recently, in 2012 the company acquired certain assets of rival Cenveo's document business, including the manufacturing facilities branded under the names PrintXcel and Printegra, which together generate about $80 million in annual sales. Previously, in 2011 Ennis acquired Printgraphics, with two locations in Ohio and Iowa. Also, Ennis purchased the assets of Neenah, Wisconsin-based Atlas Tag &amp; Label. The Atlas purchase boosted Ennis's capabilities and capacity in its tag and label business, as well as broadened its customer base.
