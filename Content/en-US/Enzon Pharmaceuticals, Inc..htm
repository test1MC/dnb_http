   Enzon Pharmaceuticals has PEGged its future on researching ways to fight cancer. The company has developed compounds using its PEGylation and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) technology platforms to improve the performance and deliverability of existing cancer drugs. PEGylation involves attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a drug compound to make it more effective and less toxic for patients.  However, in 2012 Enzon suspended clinical efforts and began reviewing strategic options; in 2013 it refocused on minimizing expenses and maximizing royalty revenue returns.

        <p>
   The company's net revenues dropped by 51% in 2011 due to a decrease in revenues of in-process research and development stemming from the sale of its specialty pharmaceutical business ($40.9 million was recognized as revenues in 2010 as compared to a $5 million payment related to divested in-process research and development in 2011). Other factors included a drop in royalties, contract research and development, and miscellaneous income. Royalty revenues declined 9% in 2011. This was driven almost entirely by lower sales of PEGINTRON.

   Enzon's net income decreased by 112% in 2011 due to a drop in revenues and lower investment income as the result of discontinued operations offset by decrease in operating expenses.

   Strategy
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 the company formed a long-term strategic research, development and licensing collaboration with China-based Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuticals. The agreement provides for the research and development of therapeutics using Enzon's customized PEGylation linker technology. The agreement also includes the license to Hisun of development and commercialization rights for Enzon's PEG-SN38 in China.

   Prior to 2010 the company produced a number of successful dugs, and offered contract manufacturing to other drug developers. However, early that year, beset by a difficult financial situation and activist shareholders, Enzon sold its specialty pharmaceutical operations to a US subsidiary of Italian drug firm Sigma-Tau Group for more than $300 million. The business consisted of Enzon's manufacturing facility, contract manufacturing operations, and a portfolio of

   -approved products including PEG-enhanced enzymes Adagen, for the treatment of Bubble Boy Disease (an immunodeficiency disorder), and Oncaspar, for the treatment of leukemia.Previously, the sale of those drugs made up the bulk of the company's revenues.
