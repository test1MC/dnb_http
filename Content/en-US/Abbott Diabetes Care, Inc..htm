   Abbott Diabetes Care cares about diabetics. The unit of
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Labs
   </company>
   makes glucose monitoring equipment and supplies for use by diabetics at home or by medical professionals in hospitals and other care facilities throughout the US in retail stores and online. Its monitoring systems are sold under the FreeStyle and Precision Xtra brands. Its diabetes data management systems are sold under the CoPilot and Precision Link brands and are designed to be used in conjunction with its monitoring systems. The company also offers insulin pumps including its OmniPod insulin management system.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />

        <p>
   Part of Abbott Diabetes Care's growth strategy is to introduce new products to the diabetes management market that are geared toward ease-of-use and that require less blood to obtain results (such as its FreeStyle Lite and FreeStyle Freedom systems). It's products are meant to treat all types of diabetes and are sold worldwide.
  </p>
        <p>
   Portability is also in demand among diabetics, so the company has worked to meet that demand with products like the FreeStyle Navigator, a blood glucose monitor that continuously measures glucose levels using a sensor, placed on the upper arm or stomach, that sends signals to a pager-sized device.
  </p>
        <p>
   Additional products include insulin syringes for home use and point-of-care systems geared for health care professionals. Many of the company's products are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance, meaning Abbott Diabetes Care can market its diabetes tools as being reimbursable, making them far more accessible to the average patient.

   </company>
   clearance in 2013 for its FreeStyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System, an advanced blood glucose monitoring system.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 the company was also developing an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system and a next-generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform. Both products were slated for submission for government approval in 2013.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Abbott Diabetes Care obtained US regulatory approval for its FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose monitoring system that includes a touch-screen interface.
