   Q.E.P. keeps getting underfoot. The company makes and distributes hardwood flooring and flooring installation tools (including adhesives, trowels, wet saws, and carpet trimmers) for professionals and do-it-yourselfers. It sells more than 7,000 flooring and flooring-related products, mainly for installing marble, carpet, ceramic tile, and drywall, under the QEP, Capitol, ROBERTS, Elastiment, and RhinoGrip brands, among others. Q.E.P. makes about 25% of its products and acquires the rest from about 200 suppliers. Its customers include retailers and distributors to the home improvement, hardware, and construction trades primarily in the US. The family-run company was founded by chairman and CEO Lewis Gould in 1979.

  <p>
   Florida-based Q.E.P. Co. rings up more than 70% of its sales in North America. Europe, and Australia/New Zealand roughly split the rest. The company has more than 1 million square feet of distribution and manufacturing space throughout the US, Canada, Australia/New Zealand, the UK, France, and China.

  <p>
   The company operates four business segments: Domestic, Canada, Europe (UK, France, Holland), and Australia/New Zealand. Each segment markets and sells to home improvement retail centers and specialty distribution outlets in its region.

  <p>
   Q.E.P. reported record fiscal 2014 (ended February) sales of $302.7 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior year. Sales in the US and Canada declined, while sales in Europe increased 82% year over year, driven by acquisitions there. The company's Australia/New Zealand business posted a 3% rise in sales. Operating income fell 14% over the same period from $11.6 million to $9.9 million. Q.E.P. blamed its declining profits on a concentration issue with a major customer.

   Since its founding, Q.E.P. has grown though numerous acquisitions in the US and overseas. The company also grows by expanding its distribution network and market penetration. In June 2014, it added Ohio-based CDC Distributors to distribute its Harris Wood-branded engineered and Harris cork flooring products in Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, and four other states.

   In May 2013, the company sold its manufacturing, distribution and administrative facility in Canada and concurrently entered into a two year lease-back transaction for the facility.

  <p>
   Acquisitive Q.E.P. is busy building its business. Most recently, in February 2014 it acquired the Georgia-based laminate maker Faus Group, which makes and distributes laminate flooring under the Fausfloor brand. The $8.6 million purchase included a 380,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution facility in Calhoun, Georgia and expanded Q.E.P.'s existing product lines and channels of distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company purchased the Homelux and TileRite distribution businesses of UK-based Homelux Nenplas Ltd., a global supplier of tile accessories to the DIY and professional markets, for $23 million. In late 2012, the company purchased Imperial Industries and Ludell brand striking tools. To keep hardwood floors spic and span, Q.E.P. also acquired Harper Brush Works, Inc. for about $2.2 million earlier that year. Based in Iowa, Harper Brush Works makes and sells brushes, brooms, mops, buckets, dust pans, and other household cleaning tools. Other acquisitions that expanded Q.E.P.'s product line include the addition of Porta-Nails, a maker of hardwood installation equipment and fasteners, in 2011.
