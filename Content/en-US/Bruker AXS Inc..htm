   Bruker AXS helps companies X-ray their way to the next hot drug. The firm makes X-ray systems that can analyze the structure of small molecules and aid in drug discovery and materials research. Bruker's products assist pharmaceutical firms and life science research entities in studying protein structure abnormalities, the cause of many diseases. Chemical and raw material manufacturers use Bruker's systems in their research of materials for making such products as steel, semiconductors, and plastics. The company is a subsidiary of the Bruker MAT division of

   Bruker periodically acquires other companies in order to expand its AXS division's core x-ray technologies. For instance, in 2012 the company acquired the assets of German firm Hecus X-ray Systems, which makes analytical instrumentation for Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) systems for the nanoanalytics market. Also that year it purchased SkyScan, a Belgian firm that makes computed tomography (CT) systems used in high-resolution, three-dimensional X-ray imaging for preclinical and life science applications.

   In 2011 Bruker expanded its Bruker Nano division by acquiring Silicon Valley-based Center for Tribology (CETR) in a $17 million deal. CETR became part of the Bruker Nano unit as a separate Tribology and Mechanical Testing (TMT) business, which provides test instrumentation for industrial manufacturing and basic materials research. The Nano division also includes the atomic force microscope (AFM) and stylus and optical metrology (SOM) operations, most of which were acquired from

   in 2010.

   Bruker AXS also regularly conducts research and development efforts in order to introduce new products in areas such as X-ray spectrometry and diffraction. It also partners with other companies on projects, such as its ongoing collaboration and joint development project with the
