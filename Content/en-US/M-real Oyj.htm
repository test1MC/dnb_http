   When it comes to fine paper, M-real is for real. M-real Oyj produces about 6 million tons of paper and paperboard a year. M-real's paper offerings include coated papers for printing and publishing, specialty papers, and uncoated fine paper. The company's consumer packaging segment makes raw paperboard used in packaging and promotional material, and creates finished consumer packaging and advertising products. M-real's merchanting network supplies company-made products as well as products made by others throughout Europe.

  <p>
   Finland is about three-quarters covered with forest, but it wasn't until the late 1800s that the rising cost of wood in Europe made it feasible to exploit those timber reserves. M-real traces its beginnings to this period, when pharmacist Gustaf Adolf Serlachius was hired to manage a timber mill in 1868. Almost immediately, however, Serlachius left to start his own pulp mill. The business was successful, and by the 1890s Serlachius had added a paper mill and three paper machines to turn his pulp into paper. Serlachius' nephew, Gosta Serlachius, took over the company in 1913 and continued to expand the operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toward the 1920s, the Finnish paper industry turned away from the troubled Soviet market and focused, instead, on the burgeoning market for newsprint in western Europe. By 1940 Finland was the world's leading paper exporter. Gosta died in 1942 and was succeeded by his son, R. Erik Serlachius. The country's post-war settlement with the Soviets cost it more than 10% of its forests.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Serlachius had been gearing up during the 1930s, Metsaliton Teollisuus, a Finnish forestry cooperative, was getting its start. By the 1950s the company's product line included timber, impregnated wood, plywood, pulp, paper, paperboard, and paper-related chemicals; during the 1980s the company added finished products such as doors, windows, saunas, and log houses.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the two companies came together in 1987 to form Metsä-Serla (with Ebbe Sommar as managing director), they had subsidiaries in Finland and 14 other European countries. The combination, however, resulted in excess capacity in many of the companies' operating areas such as fine/magazine paper, paperboard, packaging, tissue paper, and building materials. In response, the company laid off more than 1,000 workers and shed seven subsidiaries. That, and an increase in demand for forestry products, helped the company increase sales. In 1990 the company was hit by industry downturn (caused in part by overcapacity). That year Sommar was replaced by Timo Poranen, who continued to cut jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The market began to recover toward the middle of the decade, but soon fell again in 1996, as the industry was once again hurt by sluggish demand and overcapacity. Jorma Vaakoki became CEO that year, when Poranen went to work for Metsä-Serla's parent (Metsälitto Yhtyma). Metsä-Serla acquired Sweden-based Modo Paper and sold its corrugated packaging business to SCA in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year it acquired 88% of German paper company Zanders Feinpapiere. The company also changed its name to M-real Oyj. Subject to regulatory approvals, M-real agreed to sell its minority stake in Noviant Ltd to J.M. Huber Corporation; the deal would end the company's divestment of its chemical business, which started in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jorma Vaakoki stepped down as CEO in late 2001, and Jouko Jaakkola succeeded him. When Mr. Jaakkola retired in January 2005, Hannu Anttila took over the post. Late in 2006, the company announced that Anttila would take a position with Metsälitto; Mikko Helander was named to succeed him as M-real's CEO.
