   Enphase Energy is ready to usher in a new phase of solar power. The company makes all-in-one solar panel systems for residential and commercial use in the US and Canada. Unlike typical small-scale photovoltaic systems, Enphase's solar modules are connected on a microinverter system where each panel has its own inverter that converts the sun's rays into electricity. The company claims its microinverter technology is more energy efficient than having all the panels hooked up to one big inverter. Enphase Energy sells its solar power systems to a network of thousands of distributors.

   California-based Enphase rings up 85% of its sales in the US. International markets include Canada, Mexico, the UK, the Benelux region, France, China, New Zealand, and Australia.

   Enphase Energy's microinverters convert direct current produced by solar panels to alternating current that's routed to the grid. Solar farms typically connect multiple panels to a single, larger inverter, while Enphase's smaller products are designed to be wired to a single panel, thereby increasing efficiency. Since its founding in 2008, the company has sold approximately 11 million microinverters. The company outsources the manufacturing of its products to two key manufacturing partners,

   and CED Greentech, among its major customers, accounting for 12% and 7% of total net revenues, respectively, in 2015. The company also sell directly to large installers, OEMs, and strategic partners.

  <p>
   The company has experienced significant growth, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $357 million in 2015. The company credited the gain to increased in microinverter units shipped as well as a larger mix of microinverter accessories. Despite the historic revenues, Enphase reported a loss of nearly $22 million during 2015, mostly due to an uptick in expenses from salaries and stock-based compensation. In addition, the company has posted eight straight years of negative operating cash flow.

   Enphase's goal is to maintain its status as the leading provider of microinverter systems for the solar industry worldwide and to accelerate the shift from traditional center inverters to microinverter technology. It plans to do so by expanding its market share in its core US market, entering new geographic markets, increasing power and efficiency and reducing cost per watt generated, and extending its technological innovation. It also aims to expand its product offering for commercial installations and utility-scale installations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also intends to further increase its market share in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America. In addition, it intends to expand into new markets with new and existing products and local go-to-market capabilities.
