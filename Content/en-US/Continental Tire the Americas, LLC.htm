   CTA's tire division is pushing ahead with the implementation of its long-term growth strategy initiative -- Vision 2025. The division intends to increase its global production capacity by some 26 million units by 2018 compared with 2011. To help achieve this goal, its new passenger car tire plant in Sumter, South Carolina, began production in January 2014.

   Its Modipuram, India, plant started producing radial tires for trucks and buses as well as for cars in 2014. In addition, starting in 2016, its newest technology center located in Korbach, Germany, will manufacture exceptionally sophisticated tires for high-performance sports cars, and will push forward central process optimization for all tire plants worldwide.

   CTA's parent began as Continental-Caoutchouc-und Gutta-Percha Compagnie in Hannover, Germany, in 1871. The company produced soft rubber products, rubberized fabrics, solid tires for carriages, and bicycles. The US business was set up in 1915. The company chose to change its name from Continental Tire North America in 2010 to better reflect its expanding market position in both the North and South American markets.
