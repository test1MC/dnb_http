   Masterful "preformances" are expected from Preformed Line Products (PLP) by its audience in the energy and communications industries. The company designs and manufactures components and systems used by utility crews and others to construct, repair, and maintain overhead and underground networks for energy, communications, and broadband network companies. It provides formed wire products (for maintenance and repair of aging plant infrastructures), protective fiber-optic closures and splice cases, solar hardware, and data communication interconnect devices and enclosures for data communications networks.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, PLP serves worldwide markets through international operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, the UK, and Thailand.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   PLP's operations are divided into four operating segments along geographic lines: PLP-USA (35% of total sales), The Americas (22%), EMEA (15%; Europe, Middle East, &amp; Africa), and Asia/Pacific (27%). US operations adhere specifically to domestic energy and telecommunications products, while the other three segments work across geographic regions.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After achieving a revenue milestone of $439 million in 2012, PLP saw its revenues dip 7% to nearly $410 million in 2013. Profits fell 30% from $29 million in 2012 to $21 million in 2013. PLP's operating cash flow has also been inconsistent the past three years: it jumped from 2011 to 2012 but fell by $32 million in 2013 due to the decline in net income among other factors.
  </p>
  <p>
   The downward momentum for 2013 was driven by a 4% decrease within the the EMEA segment due to large energy transmission projects during 2012 that were not repeated in 2013. Asia/Pacific sales also dipped 2% due to lower transmission projects in the region and sales volume decreases in data communication.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Through the use of acquisitions, PLP has been focusing its efforts to grow within the energy and communications markets, both of which have been undergoing consolidation. Internationally, however, the company continues to concentrate specifically on the energy markets, especially in developing nations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 it acquired Australian Electricity Systems Pty Ltd. (AES), an Australian company. AES designs, manufactures, and markets hardware for the electrical utility industry. The acquisition strengthened the company's position in the power distribution, transmission, and substation hardware markets and enhanced its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Also in 2012, PLP purchased all of the assets of Forma Line Industries CC in South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014, PLP acquired Helix Uniformed Limited (Helix), located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The acquisition diversified its business in Canada, expanding its manufacturing footprint and fortifying its local engineering capabilities.
