   Any way you slice it, ROFIN-SINAR Technologies is one of the world's leading makers of industrial lasers. The company designs, manufactures, and markets lasers primarily used for cutting, welding, and marking a wide range of materials. Its macro (cutting and welding) line is targeted at the machine tool and automotive markets, while its laser marking and micro (fine cutting and welding) product lines are principally geared toward the semiconductor, electronics, and photovoltaic markets. ROFIN sells directly to OEMs, systems integrators, and industrial end users that integrate its lasers into their own systems. Europe (mainly Germany) is its largest market, followed by Asia and North America.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   ROFIN sells its products to 4,000 customers in 70 countries and maintains sales and service offices in China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. In 2014 its sales from North America, Europe, and Asia accounted for 19%, 49%, and 32% of total sales, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
   In addition to its portfolio of laser products, ROFIN offers laser components (including power supplies, fiber optic beam splitters, and high-brightness modules for semiconductors), replacement parts, and aftersales service in approximately 70 countries through a global manufacturing, distribution, and service network. The company has a direct sales force that works in some 24 countries. It also has independent representatives marketing its products around the world. A smaller portion of revenue is derived from ROFIN providing applications development for customers seeking alternatives to conventional manufacturing techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unlike some competitors that may only specialize in one or two of the principal laser technologies, ROFIN offers all three principal types used in material processing: CO

   </sub>
   lasers use carbon dioxide as the medium for cutting and welding metal and for marking and engraving non-metal materials; solid-state lasers (including fiber lasers) use solid-state crystal in rod or disc form as the medium; and diode lasers generate laser light and are used for surface treatment, soldering, and plastic welding.
  </p>

  <p>
   ROFIN's primary markets include machine tool, semiconductor, electronics, photovoltaic, and automotive. It also targets the sectors of aerospace, consumer goods, medical device manufacturing, flexible packaging, job shops, jewelry, universities, and institutes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its product lineup is designed to meet a broad range of customers' material processing requirements. Lasers for cutting applications are marketed and sold primarily to OEMs in the machine tool industry that incorporate ROFIN's products into their own laser cutting machines. They are also sold to automotive OEMs for the cutting and welding of metals. Lasers for welding applications are marketed and sold to systems integrators and end users.
  </p>
  <p>
   Laser marking products are sold largely to semiconductor and electronics OEMs and end users for the marking of integrated circuits, wafers, solar cells, electronic components, and smart cards. Its laser micro products serve OEMs and end users in the medical device, photovoltaic, semiconductor and electronics, dental, and jewelry markets with spot welding, fine cutting, and micro structuring. Laser micro products also perforate cigarette paper and plastic foils for the consumer packaging and paper industries.

  <p>
   ROFIN has seen its balance sheet fluctuate over the years. After experiencing a surge in revenue in 2013, the company saws its revenues fall 5% to $530 million in 2014. Profits also fell 28% from $35 million in 2013 to $25 million in 2014 due to the lower revenue coupled with higher interest expenses. In addition, the company's cash flow from operations has fluctuated wildly over the last five years as a result of accrued liabilities and pension obligations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2014 were fueled by a 2% drop in laser products sales due to lower business with machine tool industries and advanced applications. Net sales of lasers for marking and micro applications also decreased by 8% due to lower demand from the electronics and photovoltaic industries.

  <p>
   The company's strategy for growth entails increasing its market share for macro (cutting and welding) applications; extending its position in micro (fine cutting, fine welding, perforating, and structuring applications); cross-selling its various laser products to its existing large customer base; and enlarging its market coverage geographically and by developing new applications.
