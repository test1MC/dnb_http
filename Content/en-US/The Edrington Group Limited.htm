   At The Edrington Group, grousing about business isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Edrington Group produces The Famous Grouse, which it touts as Scotland's favorite whisky, along with other whisky brands such as Brugal, Highland Park, The Macallan, and Cutty Sark. It also makes other spirits such as Snow Leopard vodka and Brugal, a top golden rum in the Caribbean. Edrington operates several malt whisky distilleries in the Scottish Highlands, and distributes its products across the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The group, which is one of Scotland's largest private companies, was founded by the Robertson family in the mid-1800s. The Robertson Trust still owns Edrington.

  <p>
   Edrington reported in 2015 that its malt distilleries make more than 17 million liters of spirit drinks per year. Additionally, the company owns a 50% stake in The North British Distiller, which can produce over 65 million liters of grain spirit per year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Brugal plant in the Dominican Republic sources some 12 million gallons of home produced molasses to create 22 million liters of spirit annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its cased goods warehouses processes more than 7 million cases a year, and exports its goods to more than 100 international markets.

   Edrington's revenue grew by 45% between FY2009 and FY2014 (ended March 2014) thanks to rapid expansion initiatives. The company's revenue rose by 3% to £607.7 million ($835.7 million) in FY2014, while its profit rebounded to £74.4 million (or $102.31 million); the company suffered a net loss the prior year due to brand impairment losses.

   Edrington has been rapidly expanding its distribution network around the world in recent years. In early 2015, for example, the company replaced its
   <company id="61203">
    Maxxium
   </company>
   Travel Retail joint venture with
   <company id="10075">
    Beam Suntory
   </company>
   to create Edrington European Travel Retail, a new unit that would focus on the world's second largest travel retail market. In early 2014, to better localize its business in the US -- the world's largest premium spirits market -- Edrington launched its Edrington Americas business to control the sales, marketing and distribution of Edrington's products in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2013, to expand its distribution network across two other continents, the company created new distribution companies in South East Asia (Singapore) as well as Middle East markets. Altogether, the three markets contributed to more than 25% of Edrington's total sales in 2015.

  <p>
   To control packaging and distribution costs, in 2011 the company acquired the Maxxium distribution companies in China and Hong Kong. With Asia being a high growth area for the company, the added distribution outlets in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea would help streamline its operations and hasten deliveries.
