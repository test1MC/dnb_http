   aveni (formerly alchimer) has seen the future, and it is all about developing and marketing chemical formulations and processes used in semiconductors and other electronics applications. Its electrografting technology is an electrochemical process that enables the growth of very thin coatings on conducting and semiconducting surfaces. Chipmakers use this technology to more cost effectively make semiconductor interconnects and 3D TSVs (through-silicon vias), an electrical connection used to create 3D integrated circuits and packages. The France-based company also has an applications and development facility in South Korea. Major investors include

   The company provides of wet deposition technologies for dual damascene, through-silicon vias (TSVs), Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (or MEMS, miniaturized mechanical and electro-mechanical devices) and other electronic applications. In addition to electrografting for conducting surfaces, its chemicalgrafting technologies are used to initiate the growth of nanometric films on nonconductive substrates.

   In 2016 aveni teamed up with a leading semiconductor equipment supplier to develop back-end-of-line metallization processes using aveni's chemistries in conjunction with the equipment supplier's electrochemical deposition products for advanced logic.

  <p>
   In 2015 Alchimer changed its name to aveni (derived from "avenir," French for "future") to symbolize the company's transition from a research and development profile to a manufacturing brand.
