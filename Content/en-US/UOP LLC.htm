   UOP performs well by making oil and gas industries perform well. The
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   subsidiary (part of the Performance Materials and Technologies business segment) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, process plants, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. The technologies mainly are used in petroleum-derived products and chemicals (such as ethylene and propylene), but also in the manufacture of products further downstream like plastics, detergents, and fibers. UOP also produces catalysts, alumina adsorbents (used to purify gas and dry air), and molecular sieves.

        <p>
   In 2015 the company's net revenues decreased by 7% (including organic, 6%), driven primarily by lower gas processing revenues due to a significant slowdown in customer projects and decreased equipment, engineering and licensing revenues partially offset by increased catalyst revenues.

   Throughout the company's history, UOP has maintained its focus on innovation and discovery. The company has more than 65 licensed processes for companies that process hydrocarbons. UOP has more than 3,000 active patents worldwide. More than 60% of the world's gasoline and 85% of biodegradable detergents are made using UOP technology.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2016 Pakistan Refinery Limited began using UOP process technology and equipment to help increase its production of high-quality gasoline, helping meet growing domestic demand for clean transportation fuels.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2015 a new UOP Russell modular gas processing plant in northern Louisiana began processing rich natural gas and recovering valuable natural gas liquids (NGLs).
  </p>
        <p>
   That year UOP announced that Egypt's Alexandria National Refining &amp; Petrochemicals Company will use UOP technology and equipment as part of a $300 million, multi-year project to expand an existing, state-of-the-art gasoline production facility to meet growing domestic demand for high-octane gasoline.
  </p>
        <p>
   That year teh company also  announced that its C3 Oleflex process technology will be used by Poland's Grupa Azoty to produce propylene, and that its process technology, catalysts and proprietary equipment will form the basis for the largest refinery in Africa, reducing Nigeria's dependence on imported fuels and petrochemicals.

        <p>
   In 2012 UOP opened a manufacturing and operations center in Penang, Malaysia to produce natural gas membrane elements to support the growing natural gas markets in the region. That year the company also announced that it will invest $20 million to expand its production facility in Mobile, Alabama to produce adsorbents and catalysts.
  </p>
        <p>
   Expanding its offerings for natural gas processing, in 2012 UOP acquired a 70% stake in Thomas Russell, a leading provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2011 UOP announced that it will expand its portfolio of natural gas treatment technologies through a marketing alliance with the Netherlands-based Twister B.V.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010 UOP began developing and testing fuels from bio-feedstocks, using animal fats, algae, and camelina, in "green" jet fuel for use in military aircraft. Test flights for the fuel on both military helicopters and fighter jets were deemed a success. In 2012 Honeywell Green Jet Fuel produced using UOP's renewable jet fuel process powered demonstration flights by Gulfstream Aerospace.
