   Whether you like your volts high or your watts low, Watlow Electric Manufacturing can help. The company is a custom designer and manufacturer of industrial heaters, sensors, controllers, and software. Its products are used in power generation, semiconductors, plastics processing, foodservice equipment, life sciences, and aerospace applications. The company revolutionized the heater industry with the introduction in 1954 of the FIREROD high watt density cartridge heater, which has mineral insulated leads that can handle temperatures to 1,500ÂºF and resist contamination. Watlow Electric holds more than 415 patents and operates about nine manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, Mexico, and Asia.

  <p>
   In recent years the company has strategically expanded its manufacturing and design operations, opening new facilities in China, India, Singapore, and the US. The effort aims to gain market share in developing regions, as well as to curb production costs.

   Watlow also uses strategic acquisitions as a means for growth. In 2013 it bought Semiconductor Tooling Services (STS), a maker of ion implant refurbishment, elastomer bonding, and high-precision cleaning technologies. STS' primary offering is the development and application of precision bonds between critical components in a process tool assembly, and the deal allowed Watlow to provide more expertise in the development of higher quality, higher performing and higher value wafer processing assemblies.
