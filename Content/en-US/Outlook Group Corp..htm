   Signed, sealed, delivered ... it's yours from Outlook Group, a provider of printing, packaging, and direct marketing services. Outlook prints coupons, labels, booklets, promotional brochures, and recipe cards. Its non-print offerings include carton and paperboard packaging production, laminating, shrink-wrapping, collating, and bulk mailing. Originally focused on printing and bulk mailing, Outlook has evolved to offer a more comprehensive set of products and services related to direct marketing, including postcard mailings, list processing, and distribution services. The company traces its roots to 1977, when David Erdmann founded Mailing and Printing Services.

  <p>
   David Erdmann founded Mailing and Printing Services in 1977. As printing for baseball cards and board games became a larger part of the business, he changed the name to Outlook (from a circular it printed) in 1982. By 1991, the year Outlook went public, sports cards accounted for 60% of sales. Efforts to diversify added food-processing operations from Nestle and two flexible-packaging units (Sunrise Packaging, Barrier Films). The company also bought book publisher Willow Creek Press in 1994 (sold 1995). None of this, however, helped insulate the company from the 1994 baseball strike, which cut into sales the next year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 Outlook agreed to be acquired by investment banking firm Goldner Hawn Johnson &amp; Morrison. The company sold its Barrier Films unit and an underused order fulfillment plant, and it bought the packaging converting operations of R. P. Packaging. In late 1997 Erdmann resigned from the company, and former investment banker Richard Fischer was appointed chairman and CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   With red ink on the books since 1995, Outlook sold its foods unit in 1998 to the newly formed Lake Country Foods (where Erdmann was serving as president). Shortly thereafter, its deal to be acquired by Goldner Hawn Johnson &amp; Morrison fell through. The company made several acquisitions in 1999 and 2000, including assets from commercial printing firm Kostner Graphics and label maker Star Label.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sliding sales continued; the company sold its packing facility in 2001 and cut more than 60 jobs (12% of its workforce) the following year. Outlook invested in its direct marketing operations in 2002 with the acquisition of Paragon Direct for $1.4 million, which it then sold to A.B. Data in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 company president and COO Joseph J. Baksha was named CEO. He replaced Fischer, who remained chairman. In 2006 the company was acquired by Vista Group Holdings, a company backed by Milestone Partners, affiliates of

   . Vista Group Holdings then changed its name to Outlook Group Holdings.
