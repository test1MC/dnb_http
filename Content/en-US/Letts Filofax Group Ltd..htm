   Shall we buy a diary? Yes, Letts. Letts Filofax produces diaries for personal and business use, reflecting a tradition of noting data in an analog, paper-based organizer, rather than a handheld electronic device or personal digital assistant. Its business, including two UK operations and eight overseas subsidiaries, support the Filofax and Letts brands. Letts makes more than 22 million diaries a year for sale in the UK and some 75 countries around the world. In recent years the company has invested in machinery and fulfillment systems that allow it to offer more customized options for its end users. Letts is owned by

   .

  <p>
   Letts has a 250,000 sq. ft. factory which incorporates the lifecycle of the product: customer service, printing, binding, and fulfillment.

  <p>
   The Scottish stationery business was founded by John Letts in 1796 in London, and offered the first commercial diary in 1812.
  </p>
  <p>
   A Filofax organizer was once the essential yuppie accessory in the 1980s. The product line fell on hard times in the 1990s and Filofax was acquired in 1998 by
   <company id="10193">
    Day Runner
   </company>
   , a competitor. Letts bought Filofax Group in 2001 for $29.7 million (£17 million), about one-third of what Day Runner had paid for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Letts itself went through a management buyout in 2000. MD Gordon Presly and FD Gordon Raw bought the venerable diary maker from Bemrose Corp., with financing by
   <company id="134092">
    Dunedin Capital Partners
   </company>
   and the Bank of Scotland (now
   <company id="53890">
    HBOS
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="135031">
    Phoenix Equity Partners
   </company>
   acquired the business from management in 2006 for £45 million ($78.6 million).
