   Valspar wants you to put on a coat. The firm makes a variety of coatings and paints for manufacturing, automotive, construction, and food-packaging companies, as well as for consumers. The company's industrial coatings (for metal, wood, plastic, and glass) are used by OEMs including building product, appliance, and furniture makers. Packaging products include coatings and inks for rigid containers, such as food and beverage cans. Its consumer paints consist of interior and exterior paints, primers, stains, and varnishes sold through mass merchandisers like
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   . Valspar also makes auto paints and colorants. In 2016 rival
   <company id="11350">
    Sherwin-Williams
   </company>
   agreed to buy Valspar for $11.3 billion.

  <p>
   Valspar manufactures and distributes a wide range of coatings, paints, and related products. It operates two divisions: Coating and Paints.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Coatings segment (55% of total sales) offers industrial product lines and packaging product lines. Its broad range of decorative and protective coatings for metal, wood and plastic, are primarily for sale to OEM customers in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Coatings segment products include primers, top coats, varnishes, sprays, stains, fillers and other coatings for a wide range of manufacturing industries, including agricultural and construction equipment, appliances, building products, furniture, metal fabrication, metal packaging and transportation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Paints segment (35% of sales) consists of consumer paints and automotive paint refinish product lines, including paints, primers, topcoats, and aerosol spray paints through retailers, distribution networks and company-owned stores.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has operations in 25 countries in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. It has 25 manufacturing plants North America (USA, Canada and Mexico); 15 in Europe; 13 in the Asia Pacific region; two in Brazil; and one each in India and South Africa. It also has joint ventures in Japan, South Africa, Switzerland and Vietnam and sales offices in a number of other countries. Valspar serves customers in 100 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US accounts for more than 55% of its Valspar's total revenues; China, more than 10%; Australia 5%; and other countries, more than 25%.

  <p>
   The company markets it products through a range of channels. In the US and Canada, Valspar sells through home centers, hardware wholesalers, distributors, and independent dealers; in China through distributors and retailers; in Australia and New Zealand through independent dealers, hardware chains, home centers, and company-owned stores; and in the UK and Ireland through a large home center customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10920">
    Lowe's
   </company>
   accounts for more than 10% of Valspar's revenues. The hardware and home repair giant has named Valspar paint supplier of the year over several years. Valspar uses its own brand at Lowe's (replacing generic-sounding store brands) in an effort to boost consumer recognition. Valspar has made a point to tailor its products to the needs of retail customers, to the point of placing in-store employees to answer paint questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's ten largest customers account for more than 30% of its total revenues. The five largest Paints segment customers accounted for more than 45% of net sales in that segment. The five largest customers in the Coatings segment accounts for about 20% of net sales in that segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valspar's primary brands include Cabot, DeBeer, House of Kolor, Huarun, Octoral, Solagard, Valspar, and Wattyl.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company spent $49.4 million on advertising in fiscal 2016, down from $56.7 million and $81.9 million, in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (October year end), Valspar's net revenues declined by about 5% to $4.2 billion due to lower consumer paints sales, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange and lower industrial product sales. The acquisition of the performance coating businesses of Quest Specialty Chemicals, and higher coil product sales, helped to partially offset this decrease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valspar's net income decreased by 12% to $353 million in fiscal 2016, due to by lower sales (coating sales were down by 4% and paints, by 6%) and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange (which had a 3% impact).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operating activities in 2016 was $482,712 in 2016 (compared to $383,200 a year earlier) thanks to working capital becoming a source of cash as accounts receivable fell as a result of lower sales.

  <p>
   Valspar has boosted its core business through buying smaller coatings companies around the world; in the past decade it made more than 20 bolt-on acquisitions, including joint venture interests. That strategy has made Valspar one of the top global industrial coatings makers. As part of its growth strategy, the company plans to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and products.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is also ramping up its research and development (R&amp;D) activities. In 2016 it invested $139 million in R&amp;D (3% of net sales).
  </p>
  <p>
   Outside of the US, Valspar continues to grow its business through the extension of its brands and channels of distribution and new retail partnerships. In the UK, it expanded its partnership with
   <company id="116281">
    B&amp;Q
   </company>
   (through which the D-I-Y chain store offers a full range of Valspar paints) both in terms of the numbers of stores served and through increased training and support.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by rival
   <company id="11350">
    Sherwin-Williams
   </company>
   for $11.3 billion.

  <p>
   Extending Valspar's manufacturing footprint in Europe, in 2016 Valspar acquired ISVA Vernici, a European coil coatings manufacturer headquartered in Turin, Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it purchased the performance coating businesses of Quest Specialty Chemicals, which include automotive refinish, aerosol and related specialty paint products.

  <p>
   Samuel Tuck began the company as Paint and Color in Boston in 1806. It was known as Valentine &amp; Co. by 1866. Then-owner Lawson Valentine hired chemist Charles Homer (brother of artist Winslow Homer), who perfected finishing varnishes. In 1903 Valentine's grandson, L. Valentine Pulsifer, invented the first clear varnish -- dubbed Valspar -- which became the company's name in 1932. Valspar grew by mergers including Rockcote Paint (1960) and Minnesota Paints (1970). CEO Angus Wurtele became chairman in 1973. Valspar's sales tripled by the time it acquired Mobil Oil's packaging coatings business in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
   Valspar formed a joint venture with China Merchants in 1994 (packaging coatings) and then bought US-based Sunbelt Coatings (auto refinishing, 1995), Gordon Bartels (packaging coatings, 1996), and Sureguard (industrial coatings, 1997). Valspar swapped its maintenance coatings business in 1997 with
   <company id="10106">
    Ameron International
   </company>
   's product finishes unit and formed a joint venture in Brazil with Renner Herrmann SA.
  </p>
  <p>
   President and CEO Richard Rompala replaced Wurtele as chairman in 1998. Acquisitions that year included Plasti-Kote (consumer aerosol and specialty paints), Australia-based Anzol (packaging and industrial coatings), and Dyflex Polymers (specialty water-based polymers).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company began divesting noncore businesses, selling its functional powder coatings unit in 1998 and its marine and packaging coatings product lines in 1999. Also in 1999 it bought the packaging coatings business of
   <company id="10454">
    Dexter Corporation
   </company>
   (now a part of
   <company id="58766">
    Life Technologies
   </company>
   ) and its subsidiary in France and the Netherlands-based resins maker Dyflex. The next year Valspar bought rival coatings maker
   <company id="13963">
    Lilly Industries
   </company>
   in a $975 million deal, which made Valspar a top global maker of coatings for wood, mirrors, and coils (used in doors and appliances).
  </p>
  <p>
   From 1996 to 2001, in a four-phase deal, the company acquired packaging coatings firm Coates Coatings, which operated in North America, Europe, Australia, Africa, and Asia. This acquisition boosted Valspar into the top of the market for metal packaging coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company acquired Dutch automotive coatings maker De Beer Lakfabrieken, as well as the Forest Products division of wood coatings firm Associated Chemists.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company made a major move into the China market in 2006, acquiring an 80% stake in Chinese coatings manufacturer Huarun Paints, a maker of wood and furniture coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 Valspar acquired leading industrial coatings manufacturer Inver Holding S.r.l. (Inver Group), boosting its presence in the $6 billion European industrial coatings market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boosting its pipe coating portfolio, in 2014 the company acquired Ontario-based coatings maker Madison Chemical Industries, which has developed a global reputation for its technically-advanced products used for critical infrastructures such as water transmission pipelines, water and wastewater management, and potable water storage.
