  <p>
   Flex divides its business into four segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Communications &amp; Enterprise Compute segment, 36% of revenue, makes equipment that includes radio access base stations, remote radio heads, and small cells for wireless infrastructure; optical, routing, broadcasting, and switching products for the data and video networks; server and storage platforms for both enterprise and cloud based deployments; storage and security products; and data center servers and software defined networking products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Consumer Technologies Group, 29% of revenue, is oriented toward the user side of electronics. It turns out mobile devices such as smart phones; consumer electronics, including wearable electronics; and computing products, including notebook computers, tablets, and printers. Besides supplying supply chain services to those product groupings, the CTG group has expanded its supply chain domain to non-electronics such as shoes and clothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The High Reliability Solutions group, 19% of revenue, makes products for medical application including consumer health, digital health, disposables, drug delivery, diagnostics, life sciences and imaging equipment; automotive uses, including vehicle electronics, connectivity, and clean technologies; and defense and aerospace in commercial aviation and military.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operations under the Industrial &amp; Emerging Industries segment, 16% of revenue, include semiconductor and capital equipment, office equipment, industrial automation and kiosks, energy and metering, and lighting.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Flex operates a network of more than 100 facilities in 30 countries. Its manufacturing facilities are Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Customers in China account for about 35% of sales with customers in Mexico and US accounting for 15% and 11%, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Flex's top 10 customers account for 46% of its revenue. Lenovo/Motorola is the only Flex customer that provides more than 10% of its revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Flex's revenue shifted downward 6.6% in 2016 (ended March) to $24.4 billion from $26 billion in 2015. The consumer technologies group's revenue tumbled 22% (a $1.9 billion drop) in 2016 because of less business from a large mobile customer. The big communications segment's sales slipped 4% from less demand for servers and storage systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income dropped 26% to $4.4 billion in 2016, hurt not only by the sales declines but higher selling, general, and administrative costs related to research and design, stock-based compensation, and acquisitions. Cash from operations rose to $1.1 billion in 2016 from $794 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Flex maintains standardized instruments and processes that are flexible in that they can be used in multiple ways. At the heart of Flex's strategy is its systematic process for innovation in its operations including manufacturing and logistics. That approach enables it to offer customers a set of common technologies that can be applied in endless combinations across industries. This extends the company's reach beyond electronics and into new industries. In one example, Flex works with
   <company id="14254">
    Nike
   </company>
   to get its products to customers more quickly. In 2015 the company emphasized its expansion to new areas by dropping "tronics" from its name.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Flex acquired Mirror Controls International (MCi) from the private equity firm Egeria for â‚¬457 million. MCi manufactures glass and powerfold mirror actuators for the automotive market and should improve Flex's prospects in that arena. In another 2015 deal Flex bought NEXTracker, a designer and builder of single-axis PV trackers, for $330 million. The acquisition expanded Flex's capabilities for solar processes in commercializing smart and connected energy technologies.

  <p>
   Flextronics International, formed in 1990, followed two earlier contract manufacturers named Flextronics formed in 1969 and 1980. The latter iteration used acquisitions to expand throughout Asia and the US. In 1988 it opened the first US-managed contract electronics plant in China, and that year sales topped $200 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   But acquisitions burdened Flextronics with debt and left it with disparate operations. It divested its US-based manufacturing operations and laid off 75% of its workforce. The company brought in a management team to sell its healthy Asian operations to pay off debt. These operations formed the current incarnation of Flextronics International.
  </p>
  <p>
   A revitalized Flextronics, based in Singapore, went public in 1994. It quickly joined the industry rush toward consolidation and globalization. Acquisitions included nCHIP (California, 1996), FICO Plastics (Hong Kong, 1997), Neutronics Electronic Industries (Austria, 1997), and Kyrel EMS Oyj (Finland and France, 1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Flextronics acquired rival The DII Group, which propelled the company to the #4 spot in contract manufacturing (behind
   <company id="14296">
    Solectron
   </company>
   , SCI Systems, and
   <company id="56411">
    Celestica
   </company>
   ). The company was also selected by
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   to build the software juggernaut's Xbox video game console. Later that year Motorola and Flextronics signed one of the largest outsourcing deals ever, worth an estimated $30 billion over five years. The company expanded further in Asia when it acquired JIT Holdings, a Singapore-based electronics manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Flextronics announced a deal with telecommunications giant
   <company id="41776">
    Ericsson
   </company>
   ; under the pact Flextronics assumed management of Ericsson's mobile phone manufacturing operations worldwide. Later that year the company announced that it would cut its workforce by about 10%, and that the multibillion-dollar deal with Motorola unraveled due to a continuing market slowdown. Flextronics also repurchased Motorola's 5% stake in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Flextronics bought Telcom Global Solutions, a supplier of planning and design services for telecommunications providers. Flextronics later announced a deal with
   <company id="11657">
    Xerox
   </company>
   to acquire Xerox facilities in Brazil, Canada, Malaysia, and Mexico for about $220 million, and to provide manufacturing services to Xerox for five years. Later that year the company laid off 10,000 workers -- about 15% of its staff -- in a cost-cutting move. Flextronics also acquired a 91% stake in Orbiant, a telephone network services spinoff of Swedish telecom giant
   <company id="44746">
    Telia
   </company>
   , for $100 million in cash (along with future payments pegged to the unit's performance).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company made a deal with
   <company id="41863">
    CASIO COMPUTER
   </company>
   , under which Flextronics bought two CASIO plants in Asia, then supplied the Japanese electronics maker with finished products in a three-year pact. Also that year the company significantly expanded its presence in southern China with the purchase of Hong Kong-based NatSteel Broadway (printed circuit boards, plastic and metal components) for about $367 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Flextronics took over optical, wireless, and enterprise manufacturing, as well as optical design operations from
   <company id="41824">
    Nortel Networks
   </company>
   in a four-year supply deal generating about $2.5 billion in annual revenues. Flextronics later closed several former Nortel facilities in Canada, France, and Northern Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flextronics also acquired a majority ownership stake in India-based software services provider Hughes Software Systems (HSS) in 2004. The following year Flextronics purchased
   <company id="60896">
    Agilent
   </company>
   's mobile communications camera module business. The company sold its semiconductor division to
   <company id="106505">
    AMIS Holdings
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="60890">
    ON Semiconductor
   </company>
   ), and its Flextronics Network Services division was merged with a company called Telavie and renamed Relacom; Flextronics retained a 30% stake.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flextronics set plans in 2005 to build an industrial park in Chennai, India, to supplement its existing operations on the subcontinent, where it previously employed more than 5,000 people. The development added to the two manufacturing facilities and three design centers Flextronics had in India.
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus on its core electronics manufacturing services business in 2006, Flextronics sold its Flextronics Software Systems business (renamed
   <company id="123642">
    Aricent
   </company>
   ) to an affiliate of
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   for about $900 million in cash and notes. Flextronics retained a 15% equity interest in the software development business, which was primarily based in India (it sold the remaining stake in 2009). Divestitures of its software and semiconductor businesses took a small chunk out of the company's revenues -- $278 million in fiscal 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   Flextronics then acquired
   <company id="138006">
    International DisplayWorks
   </company>
   , a contract manufacturer of small LCDs and LCD modules for cell phones and other consumer electronics, for stock valued at approximately $243 million. International DisplayWorks became a wholly owned subsidiary of Flextronics, operating within the company's Components Group. Also in 2006, nLight Corp. acquired the assets of Flextronics Photonics, including a line of fiber-coupled and hybrid microelectronic devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Flextronics purchased rival contract manufacturer Solectron in a deal valued at $3.6 billion. The combination vaulted the company into the position of the second-largest contract electronics manufacturer in the world, trailing only
   <company id="58638">
    Hon Hai Precision Industry
   </company>
   , the maker of products for
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13193">
    Dell
   </company>
   , and many other companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year it bought contract disposable device maker Avail Medical Products, a private company with around $250 million in sales, to further the expansion of its Flextronics Medical segment. Also in 2008 Flextronics inked a deal to acquire
   <company id="118041">
    Elcoteq
   </company>
   's ZAO Elcoteq subsidiary and plant in St. Petersburg, Russia. Flextronics, however, later terminated the transaction and was forced to pay a fee for noncompletion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 it sold its stake in
   <company id="123642">
    Aricent
   </company>
   , a privately held communications software company, to investment firms
   <company id="40268">
    KKR
   </company>
   and CPP Investment Board for about $250 million. The sale was part of a plan to sell noncore assets as Flextronics tried to bolster its balance sheet during the economic downturn. At the end of the year it bought SloMedical S.R.O., a leading maker of disposable medical devices for the European market. In addition to adding disposable devices for the medical and surgical market in Eastern Europe, SloMedical (based in Slovenia) gave Flextronics an
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -compliant, clean room-enabled production site with low production costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Flextronics acquired Stellar Microelectronics, an EMS provider based in California that specializes in custom packaging services for the aerospace, defense, and medical manufacturing markets, as part of a plan to expand services for the highly regulated markets. Also that year, Flextronics sold its Vista Point camera module business to
   <company id="102216">
    Tessera Technologies
   </company>
   ' subsidiary DigitalOptics; the sale included the brand, intellectual property, and China-based manufacturing assets.
