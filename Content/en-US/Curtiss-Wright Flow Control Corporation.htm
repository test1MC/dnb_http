   Curtiss-Wright Flow Control (CWFC) knows how to blow off a little steam. As the flow control business segment of
   <company id="10425">
    Curtiss-Wright
   </company>
   , the company manufactures a slew of valves (such as ball, butterfly, and pressure relief), pumps, motors, generators, instrumentation, shipboard systems, and control electronics. These products manage the flow of liquids and gases, generate power, provide electronic operating systems, and monitor critical functions. CWFC also provides installation services. Its offerings are geared primarily at the naval defense, power generation, oil and gas, and general industrial markets. The company has a global customer base with principal manufacturing operations in the US, Canada, and the UK.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   CWFC operates through four divisions:  Electro-Mechanical Systems, Nuclear Group, Oil and Gas Systems, and Marine &amp; Power Products. The Electro-Mechanical Systems division provides power and propulsion technologies, instrumentation and control systems, auxiliary systems, and other control and pumping systems to its defense, oil and gas, power generation, and industrial customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The

   and the
   <company id="150268">
    US Coast Guard
   </company>
   are also customers of CWFC's Marine &amp; Power Products division, which produces pressure relief, ball, and solenoid valves for aircraft carriers and submarines. It also designs and manufactures electro-mechanical systems for securing and moving helicopters aboard naval vessels.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Nuclear Group supplies nuclear power plants, nuclear equipment manufacturers, hydroelectric energy producers, and the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   with an array of pumps, valves, pressure vessels, fastening systems, doors, hatches, and OEM components and spare parts, as well as training, on-site support, and engineering services. It also provides diagnostic equipment, inspection, and testing services that support extension of plant life and power upgrades on more than 100 operating reactors in the US.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company sells its products globally from key manufacturing facilities in the US and Canada with other offices in the US, China, Canada, Mexico, Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, and the UK.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Government sales, mainly to the US Navy, have been steadily growing and now generate about one-third of CWFC's sales. The Coast Guard and other parts of the Department of Defense are also key customers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2013 CWFC reported a year-over-year sales increase of $204 million, or 19%, primarily due to a series of acquisitions. Sales to defense customers rose 6% from increased and new production while commercial sales jumped 24% partly based on the contributions of the new acquisitions. The purchases also contributed to a nearly 50% rise in net income; discounting that effect, net income was flat as gains in the oil and gas sector were offset by higher compensation costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   CWFC is responsible for a little more than half of its parent's revenue.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Historically, CWFC has grown via an aggressive acquisition strategy and that continues to this day. It looks for opportunities to acquire companies whose product portfolios complement its own in order to expand its customer base and geographic footprint. It also works to develop new products and expand product lines for key customers, particularly those working in difficult or harsh environments.
  </p>
  <p>
   To that end, in 2012 and 2013 it purchased five companies specializing in products and software for the nuclear power generation and oil and gas industries. It also bought two product lines for nuclear power generation customers.

  <p>
   In 2013 CWFC purchased nuclear power generation software company OvalPath for about $3 million, valve repair and services firm Gulf33 for $4 million, and valve and valve system maker Ph√∂nix for $108 million. The year before it had picked up oil and gas production equipment maker Cimarron Energy for $135 million, valve and gasket maker AP Services for $30 million, and nuclear power generation nozzle dam and related products maker Advanced Engineering Products for $1.85 million.
