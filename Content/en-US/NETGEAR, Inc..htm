(Manufacturing is outsourced to contractors in Asia.) NETGEAR also supplies network-attached storage (NAS) systems, VPN firewalls, and digital media receivers.

   Five straight years of revenue growth halted in 2015 when NETGEAR's sales dropped 6%  to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in 2014. The boig hit in revenue came in the service provider business, which dropped 27% in 2015 from 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   NETGEAR's net income rose a startling 450% in 2015 to reach $48 million from $8.8 million in 2014. In 2015, the company didn't carry the goodwill impairment charges it took in 2014. All the impairment charges were related to the service provider unit.

   NETGEAR is restructuring its service provider business with the goal of reducing costs and revenue, but strengthening profit. The company has decided to focus on the most profitable accounts in the business. The restructuring meant reducing headcount.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company will put direct more attention on developing sophisticated software for running its devices, a move made other hardware-oriented companies. NETGEAR can make more frequent upgrades to equipment through software changes and do it less expensively that shipping new hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   Committed to expanding internationally, the company uses third-party manufacturing services contractors in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam to produce its equipment.
