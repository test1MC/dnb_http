   TMC is different from some other pharmaceutical companies in that it performs its own manufacturing, exporting, importing, marketing, research and development, distribution, and sales of its medical devices around the world.

   TMC expands its offerings primarily through researching and developing new products at its Tacura R&amp;D division in California. Some of its successes include a series of products for its Glidewire Advantage guidewire and Pinnacle Destination Guiding sheaths lines. TMC also developed a complete line of coronary diagnostic catheters through its Terumo Interventional Systems business unit.
