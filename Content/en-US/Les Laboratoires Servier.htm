Annually, more than 800 million boxes of drugs are produced by Servier. Its pharmaceutics can be found in about 150 countries; 80% of its sales are generated internationally.

   The company has entered several partnerships to advance its product line and bring new medications to the market. In 2014 Servier entered a partnership with
   <company id="102645">
    Intarcia

   to develop ITCA 650, a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Also that year, Servier began a collaboration with
   <company id="163199">
    Celladon
   </company>
