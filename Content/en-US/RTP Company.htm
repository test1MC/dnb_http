   Miller Waste Mills (doing business as RTP) is a custom compounder of engineering thermoplastics. The family owned global company manufactures specialty compounds from more than 60 engineering resins that can affect color, level of conductivity, high-temperature performance, and wear resistance in engineered plastics. Its compounding starts with a base resin or polymer. Miller Waste Mills also produces engineered bioplastic specialty compounds that use resins derived from renewable sources, not petroleum. Subsidiary Wiman Corp. makes specialty plastic film. Miller Waste Mills' products are used in a wide array of markets, including electronics, automotive, consumer, medical, industrial, and sports.

  <p>
   Miller Waste Mills has been rapidly growing both its product lines and its geographical presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its very long fiber-reinforced polypropylene portfolio in 2014 to include a range of low-emission products.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Miller Waste Mills also improved the mechanical properties of its high-temperature structural products to include new ultra-performance compounds based on carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK, PPA, PPS, and PEI resins.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company expanded its thermoplastic compounding facility in Mexico to better service automotive, and consumer goods global customers operating in Mexico, Brazil, and other South and Central American countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet the growing demand from the building industry for plenum rated materials, in 2013 Miller Waste Mills developed a new set of flame retardant compounds which allow OEMs to design products using thermoplastics in applications that previously relied on metal to comply with industry design standards.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has a full line of polylactic acid bioplastic-based compounds that can be used in new materials to make products such as injection-molded covers, structural components for appliances and consumer electronics, and medical devices. It has also expanded its line of biocompatible compounds for medical devices to include thermoplastic elastomer bondable grades.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 Miller Waste Mills acquired three production facilities (in Richmond, Virginia, and in Crockett and Orange in Texas) from Alloy Polymers, Inc. The plants will continue to provide high-volume compounding production services for contract manufacturers.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2012 Miller Waste Mills introduced new thermally conductive compounds targeted at replacing metal components in automotive heating and cooling systems to automotive industry engineers as they seek to reduce vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company expanded its bioplastics products in 2012 by adding more options for its polylactic acid bioplastic compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, that year Miller Waste Mills expanded its line of antimicrobial compounds and additive master batches to include new products using BactiBlock technology from NanoBioMatters of Valencia, Spain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 Miller Waste Mills acquired a conductive compound product line from Swiss specialty chemicals maker
   <company id="54062">
    Clariant
   </company>
   . The purchase enhanced Miller Waste Mills' position in the plastics compounding industry and boosted its capability to supply its European and global customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also been upgrading its facilities to keep pace with demand. In 2012 the company began expansion at its Ladenburg, Germany plant that will nearly double the location's footprint to help Miller Waste Mills meet the growing demand for engineered thermoplastic compounds in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Miller Waste Mills also opened a technical center in Shenzhen, China to provide technical support and color functions along with production of select products to meet the growing needs of global OEMs and product designers in southern China and Hong Kong.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its distribution network, in 2011 the company signed a distribution agreement with US-based M. Holland Company, for that company to market, stock, and distribute thermoplastics elastomer products through its extensive sales network in the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   Miller Waste Mills was founded in 1980 by Ben Miller and is owned by the Miller family.
