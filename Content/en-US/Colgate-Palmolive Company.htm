  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive comprises two product segments: Oral, Personal, and Home Care (86% of 2015 sales); and Pet Nutrition (14%). Within the larger segment, oral care products account for 46% of sales, while personal and home care account for 21% and 20%, respectively. Colgate is a leader in the global oral care market with the leading toothpaste and manual toothbrush brands in many parts of the world. The oral care business also includes dental floss and pharmaceutical products for dentists and other oral health practitioners.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment ia  managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia, and Africa/Eurasia.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its Hill's Pet Nutrition segment, Colgate-Palmolive is a world leader in specialty pet nutrition products for dogs and cats with products marketed in more than 80 countries worldwide.

  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive markets its products through advertising, including TV and print, and other promotional activities. It has a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and also uses distributors or brokers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's advertising investment was $1.5 billion in 2015, down from $1.8 billion in 2014, and $1.9 billion in 2013.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oral, Personal, and Home Care sales to
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   represented 11% of the company's total sales in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company announced a partnership with American stock car driver Cole Whitt to market its Speed Stick GEAR product. As part of the arrangement, Colgate-Palmolive agreed to film a documentary series chronicling Whitt's participation in the Daytona 500.

  <p>
   In 2015, the company's net revenues decreased by 7% due to a decline in Oral, Personal, and Home Care product segment revenues, especially n Europe and the South Pacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Oral, Personal, and Home Care product segment decreased as volume growth and net selling price increases of 3% were more than offset by a negative foreign exchange translation of 12%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income decreased by 37% due to lower net sales and the presence of a charge for Venezuela accounting changes related to Venezuela remeasurements and foreign competition law revisions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Colgate-Palmolive's operating cash inflow decreased by 11%.
  </p>

  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive's strategy is to increase its market share in key product categories; the company is organized to achieve this goal. Its management teams function along geographic lines and are accountable for each region's business and financial results. Colgate-Palmolive points to its geographic diversity as a way to reduce its risk in any one part of its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive's management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance like market share, net sales, organic sales growth, gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital.
  </p>
  <p>
   A major restructuring helped tighten Colgate-Palmolive's global supply chain and realign its sales, marketing, and new product organizations to serve both mature and developing markets. This and other cost-saving initiatives have freed up additional funds to invest in product research and support. (The company's growth is reliant on the success of its existing product line, as well as the successful development and launch of new products.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses on wide distribution network through a very strong network of distributors, wholesalers, and retailers and new manufacturing facilities. In 2015 it made substantial investments in two new manufacturing facilities in India at Sanand, Gujarat, and in Sricity, Andhra Pradesh.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014, the company announced a plan to expand its 2012 restructuring program in the areas of expanding commercial hubs extending shared business services; streamlining global functions; and optimizing global supply chain and facilities.

  <p>
   William Colgate founded The Colgate Company in Manhattan in 1806 to produce soap, candles, and starch. Colgate died in 1857, and the company was passed to his son Samuel, who renamed it Colgate and Company. In 1873 the company introduced toothpaste in jars, and in 1896 it began selling Colgate Dental Cream in tubes. By 1906 Colgate was making 160 kinds of soap, 625 perfumes, and 2,000 other products. The company went public in 1908.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1898 Milwaukee's B. J. Johnson Soap Company (founded 1864) introduced Palmolive, a soap made of palm and olive oils rather than smelly animal fats. It became so popular that the firm changed its name to The Palmolive Company in 1916. Ten years later Palmolive merged with Peet Brothers, a Kansas City-based soap maker founded in 1872. Palmolive-Peet merged with Colgate in 1928, forming Colgate-Palmolive-Peet (shortened to Colgate-Palmolive in 1953). The stock market crash of 1929 prevented a planned merger of the company with
   <company id="10722">
    Hershey
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1930s the firm purchased French and German soap makers and opened branches in Europe. Colgate-Palmolive-Peet introduced Fab detergent and Ajax cleanser in 1947, and the brands soon became top sellers in Europe. The company expanded to Asia in the 1950s, and by 1961 foreign sales were 52% of the total.
  </p>
  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive introduced a host of products in the 1960s and 1970s, including Palmolive dishwashing liquid (1966), Ultra Brite toothpaste (1968), and Irish Spring soap (1972). During the same time, the company diversified by buying approximately 70 other businesses, including Kendall hospital and industrial supplies (1972), Helena Rubinstein cosmetics (1973), Ram Golf (1974), and Riviana Foods and Hill's Pet Products (1976). The strategy had mixed results, and most of these acquisitions were sold in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reuben Mark became CEO of Colgate-Palmolive in 1984. The company bought 50% of Southeast Asia's leading toothpaste, Darkie, in 1985; it changed its name to Darlie in 1989 following protests of its minstrel-in-blackface trademark. Both Palmolive automatic dishwasher detergent and Colgate Tartar Control toothpaste were introduced in 1986. That year Colgate-Palmolive purchased the liquid soap lines of Minnetonka, the most popular of which is Softsoap. In 1992 the company bought Mennen, maker of Speed Stick (the leading US deodorant).
  </p>
  <p>
   Increasing its share of the oral care market in Latin America to 79% in 1995, Colgate-Palmolive acquired Brazilian company Kolynos (from
   <company id="10093">
    Wyeth
   </company>
   for $1 billion) and 94% of Argentina's Odol Saic. The company also bought Ciba-Geigy's oral hygiene business in India, increasing its share of that toothpaste market. At home, however, sales and earnings in key segments were dismal, so in 1995 Colgate-Palmolive began a restructuring that included cutting more than 8% of its employees and closing or reconfiguring 24 factories in two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced a record 602 products in 1996 and continued to expand its operations in countries with emerging economies. In 1997 Colgate-Palmolive took the lead in the US toothpaste market for the first time in 35 years (displacing P&amp;G).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 the company sold the rights to Baby Magic (shampoos, lotions, oils) in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico to
   <company id="16745">
    Playtex Products
   </company>
   , retaining the rights in all other countries. Two years later the company sold its heavy-duty laundry detergent business in Mexico (primarily the Viva brand) to
   <company id="41028">
    Henkel
   </company>
   , one of Europe's leading detergent producers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Colgate-Palmolive introduced a teeth-whitening gel, Simply White, to compete with rival P&amp;G's Crest Whitestrips. The company saw success that year when its Hill's Pet Nutrition subsidiary launched new specialty foods for cats and dogs; one of its dog foods reportedly slows brain aging in canines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2004 Colgate-Palmolive implemented a four-year restructuring plan. Its three primary objectives were to increase profit, reallocate resources to promising growth areas, and leverage global market efficiencies. It implemented the plan by reducing its global workforce by some 12%, closing about 25 of its 78 factories, and focusing on core units. Colgate-Palmolive also built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the US and Poland. The company believed that its savings, estimated at $500 million altogether, would allow it to fund investments in its key businesses, as well as provide for new product development.
  </p>
  <p>
   By selling its North American laundry detergent brands in 2005, Colgate-Palmolive began focusing on the high-margin pearly whites (with bite) of its portfolio -- oral care and pet care. The company's purchase of natural oral-care products maker Tom's of Maine in 2006 marked its effort to target the natural niche. It bought some 84% of the firm for about $100 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman and CEO Reuben Mark handed over the title of CEO to then-president and COO Ian Cook in July 2007 and the title of chairman to Cook in January 2009; Mark retired at the end of 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Colgate-Palmolive in early 2010 sold its Code 10 brand, which boasted about a 10% market share. Indian consumer goods maker Marico acquired the Malaysian hair-styling name; the move was intended to allow Colgate-Palmolive to focus on its oral, personal, and pet care businesses.
