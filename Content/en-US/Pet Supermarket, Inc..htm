   Pet Supermarket has it all for your furry and feathered friends. The company sells more than 10,000 pet care products, including food, toys, medicine, and clothing, through its website and more than 135 stores in a dozen states, primarily Florida. Stores also offer vaccinations for dogs, cats, and ferrets, and sell a variety of small animals such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, and tropical fish. In addition, Pet Supermarket works with area organizations to host adoptions and related events for cats and dogs. Like its pet superstore competitors, customers can take their pets shopping with them. Founded in 1973 by Chuck West as Pet Circus, the family-owned company became Pet Supermarket in 1986.

   To strengthen its brand, the retailer has rolled out e-commerce capabilities on its website. This helps to bring the Pet Supermarket name to customers who may not live near one of its retail stores. With its e-commerce operations in place, the retailer is aggressively growing its store count in Florida, where the bulk of its stores are located, and throughout the Southeast. Stores typically measure between 7,000 square feet and 11,000 square feet. In 2013 Pet Supermarket expanded in North Carolina by adding a store in Greensboro, between its Winston-Salem and Charlotte stores.

   The company also has its eye on growth opportunities in other parts of the country and hopes to expand its existing base in the central and western US, including in California, Ohio, Nevada, and Wisconsin, where it has a limited presence.
