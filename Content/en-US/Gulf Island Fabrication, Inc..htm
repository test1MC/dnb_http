   Through its subsidiaries, holding company Gulf Island Fabrication makes metal islands for use in the Gulf of Mexico. Its subsidiaries, which operate under Gulf Island and Gulf Marine monikers, make offshore drilling and production platforms. Products include jackets and deck sections of fixed production platforms, hull and deck sections of floating production platforms, piles, subsea templates, wellhead protectors, and various production, compressor, and utility modules. Gulf Island also produces and repairs pressure vessels and refurbishes existing platforms. Reliant on a few key customers, in 2015 some 76% of its backlog was accounted for by five customers.

  <p>
   The company operates in three segments -- Fabrication, Shipyards, and Services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Fabrication segment includes Gulf Island, L.L.C. and Gulf Marine Fabricators, L.P., both of which perform fabrication of offshore drilling and production platforms and other specialized structures used in the development and production of oil and gas reserves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Shipyards segment includes Gulf Island Marine Fabricators, L.L.C., and Gulf Island Shipyards, L.L.C., both of which perform marine vessel fabrication, construction, and repair services.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Services segment includes Dolphin Services, L.L.C., which performs interconnect piping services on offshore platforms and inshore steel structures, and Dolphin Steel Sales, L.L.C., which sells steel plate and other steel products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's primary activity is the fabrication of offshore drilling and production platforms and other specialized structures, including jackets and deck sections of fixed production platforms, and/or deck sections of floating production platforms (such as TLPs, SPARs, FPSOs and MinDOCs), piles, and utility modules. Gulf Island also produces and repairs pressure vessels used in the oil and gas industry, refurbish existing platforms, fabricate various other types of steel structures, fabricate living quarters for installation on such platforms ranging in size from 4 to 250 beds, and provides onshore and offshore scaffolding and piping insulation services. In addition, the company fabricates towboats, barges, lift boats, dry docks, offshore support vessels, other marine vessels, and mid-body sections for offshore supply vessels. Its dry dock has the capacity to lift 9,000 tons to 12,000 tons and is used to maintain and repair third party marine vessels, as well as to launch vessels fabricated at its facilities.

  <p>
   Through its subsidiaries, Gulf Island provides customers with a complete range of design, construction, and maintenance services from four adjacent fabrication yards located in Houma, Louisiana, and from two yards in Ingleside, Texas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gulf Island has more than 212 acres devoted to fabrication activities (in Texas), a large assembly capacity allowing it to work on both shallow water units and complex deepwater structures. Its Louisiana unit resides on 140 acres, and has a water frontage along the Houma Navigational Canal, only 30 miles from the central Gulf of Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company serves customers in the US Gulf of Mexico, North Africa, West Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Canada, the Caribbean and the North Sea. The US accounted for 94% of its 2015 revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 Gulf Island's revenues decreased by 40% to $306 million a result of depressed oil and gas prices and the corresponding reduction in activity in the Gulf of Mexico. The company's revenues also decreased due to contract losses during 2015 related to a deck and jacket for one of its large deepwater projects and projected increases in its unit labor rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   US revenues decreased by 37%; international, by 63%, due to the drop in fabrication yards revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported net loss of $25 million in 2015 after reaching a peak of $15 million net income in 2014. The net loss was due to lower revenues and higher interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow decreased by 67% to $11 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Gulf Island's 's primary focus is to manage contract costs, particularly labor force costs), as it and its customers face increasing challenges associated with developing and fabricating complex projects. T
  </p>
  <p>
   As the result of oil prices hitting a 30-year low and exploration and production companies slashing capital expenditures and deferring the timing of new projects, the company is focusing on consolidating its structure by implementing cost-cutting measures. It decreased its contract laborers to 71 in 2015 from to 247 in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   That said, it is also seeking acquisition opportunities to expand in the Gulf of Mexico.
  </p>

  <p>
   In 2016 the company spent $20 million to acquire LEEVAC Shipyards, L.L.C. and its affiliates through its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Gulf Island Shipyards, L.L.C. The deal expanded Gulf Island's marine fabrication and repair and maintenance presence in the Gulf South market and further diversified its fabrication capabilities.
