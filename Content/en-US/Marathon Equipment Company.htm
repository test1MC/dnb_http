   Marathon Equipment sells its products under the RamJet (compactors), NEXGEN (balers and conveying systems), BlokPak (high-volume waste compactors), and TrashMinder (monitoring systems that measures a container's fullness) brands. Acknowledging the environmental concerns of the 21st century, the company has unveiled its GreenBuilt line of products, equipment that can run on solar power (with its own solar panels) and using biodegradable oil for lubrication.

   The company uses national advertising campaigns and equipment exhibits at major industry trade shows to sell its products. It also leverages its internal telemarketing and an in-house literature department to respond to hauler and distributor sales material needs.  Two of its customers include Greenwood Leflore Recycling and Durango Recycling Center.
