   Impax Laboratories is betting that its pharmaceuticals will make a positive impact on the world's health. The company makes specialty generic pharmaceuticals, which it markets through its Global Pharmaceuticals division and through marketing alliances with other pharmaceutical firms. It concentrates on controlled-release versions of various generic versions of branded and niche pharmaceuticals that require difficult-to-obtain raw materials or specialized expertise. Additionally, the company's branded pharmaceuticals business (Impax Pharmaceuticals) is developing and improving upon previously approved drugs that target Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other central nervous system disorders.

  <p>
   Impax earns the majority (more than 75%) of its revenue through its Global division, which produces dosage variations of about 40 generic compounds including fenofibrate (generic Lofibra for high cholesterol), midodrine HCI (generic ProAmatine), and generic Adderall XR (for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD). Several of those compounds are sold through licensing or collaboration partnerships with companies including
   <company id="52434">
    Teva
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="56567">
    Shire
   </company>
   , and Tolmar. Revenues for the unit fluctuate from year to year due to competitive conditions (how many additional generic versions of a product are on the market) and shifts in consumer demand for certain medications.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its smaller Impax Pharmaceuticals division invests heavily in R&amp;D costs and has historically brought in few earnings, though the unit produces some revenues through development partnership income. However in 2012 the division grew rapidly to account for more than 20% of sales as it launched its first commercial branded product, orally disintegrating and nasal spray versions of migraine drug Zomig (licensed from
   <company id="59531">
    AstraZeneca).

  <p>
   Impax's Global Pharmaceuticals division sells its generic products to wholesalers, chain drug stores, and mail order pharmacies. Impax also works through strategic alliances that include co-promotion, licensing, third-party marketing, or manufacturing and supply agreements with other generic and branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.

  <p>
   To expand the operations of its main Global Pharmaceuticals division, Impax works to develop new generic versions of drugs that have lost (or are about to lose) patent protection, with a focus on controlled-release and specialty products. It also develops medicines that come in alternative-dosage forms, such as nasal sprays, inhalers, ointments, injectables, and patches. The company's generic development programs are conducted both independently and through research or licensing partnerships with other drugmakers. Impax seeks to gain first-to-file and first-to market status with its new products, and in some cases, Impax enters agreements with branded pharmaceutical firms to make authorized generic versions of off-patent drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Impax Pharmaceuticals division has products in clinical stages of development, including treatments for multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. The division also focuses its development efforts on other central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, and migraines. The company hopes to build its portfolio of branded products through internal development, acquisitions, and licensing agreements, with the ultimate goal of selling some products commercially.

   In 2016, Impax agreed to buy a portfolio of generic drugs from Teva and
   <company id="12311">
    Allergan
   </company>
   for $586 million. The deal includes about 20 marketed, pending, and development products, as well as the commercial rights to the generic equivalent to Concerta. Teva and Allergan are unloading some of their products as mandated by the
   <company id="139112">
    FTC
   </company>
   ahead of their planned merger.
