   Contract electronics manufacturing is key for Key Tronic. The company, which does business as KeyTronicEMS to highlight its focus on electronics manufacturing services, provides printed circuit board assembly, tooling and prototyping, box build (completely built) systems, and plastic injection molding. In addition, Key Tronic offers such services as product design, engineering, materials management, and in-house testing. The company also makes customized and standard keyboards for PCs, terminals, and workstations.

  <p>
   Though the company maintains facilities in the US, most of its manufacturing takes place in Mexico and China. Customers located in the US account for two-thirds of Key Tronic's sales.

  <p>
   A majority of Key Tronic's sales are to the communications, consumer device, and printer industries; its top five customers account for nearly 60% of sales.

  <p>
   After posting milestone revenues of $361 million in 2013, Key Tronic saw its revenues fall 15% to $305 million in 2014. The declines for 2014 were driven by decreased demand from its current customer programs and a $5 million decrease in revenues related to program losses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key Tronic's profits fell 40% from $13 million in 2013 to $8 million in 2014. This was fueled by a dip in US sales and spike in research, development, and engineering expenses. The company's operating cash flow has fluctuated over the years, peaking at $29 million in 2013, but dropping to nearly $1.5 million.

  <p>
   To move beyond its single-product emphasis -- keyboards once accounted for almost all of sales -- and overcome years of spotty profitability, Key Tronic rapidly expanded its contract manufacturing service offerings. As price erosion in the keyboard market made that segment less profitable, the company continued its manufacturing push, increasing the range of electronic products it can manufacture.

   In 2014 Key Tronic paid $47 million to acquire CDR Manufacturing, a provider of printed circuit board assembly and other EMS services. CDR caters to a diversified customer base, including a number of large multi-national companies.

   In 2013 the company purchased Texas-based Sabre Assembly &amp; Manufacturing, a sheet metal fabrication company with facilities located in Juarez, Mexico, offering metal fabrication, plastic molding, PCB assembly, complete product assembly, design engineering, and testing engineering services.

   Lewis Zirkle, who had worked for more than 20 years at
   <company id="10634">
    General Electric
   </company>
   in various engineering and manufacturing positions, founded Key Tronic in 1969. In 1975 Key Tronic became the first independent supplier to develop and market keyboards for heavy-duty office use. By 1981 the company was a leader in manufacturing ergonomic keyboards. It went public two years later. In 1987 Key Tronic developed a membrane switch technology that integrated switching points into a custom-designed structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hard times hit in 1991 and 1992 as overseas competition and a failed attempt to produce a computer notebook contributed to losses. Turnaround artist Stanley Hiller stepped in as CEO in 1992. Key Tronic acquired
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   's keyboard operations in 1993, and the following year it moved much of its production to Honeywell's former plant in Mexico to reduce expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1995 more efficient operations and new products pushed Key Tronic's sales above the $200 million mark for the first time; net income also hit a 10-year high. Former Honeywell manager Jack Oehlke replaced Hiller as CEO in 1997, the year Key Tronic launched a fingerprint scanning line that let a user's fingerprints function as a password. In 1998 the company intensified a push into contract manufacturing. To reduce costs, Key Tronic cut about 200 jobs at its Washington plant and moved those operations to its facility in Mexico. It also closed its manufacturing plant in Taiwan. After a profitable fiscal 1997, a decline in keyboard sales caused a loss for fiscal 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Key Tronic agreed to manufacture circuits for glucose-monitoring devices made by
   <company id="13378">
    Cygnus
   </company>
   and make point-of-sale printers for Axiohm Transaction Solutions (now
   <company id="13156">
    TPG IPB
   </company>
   ). During the first half of 2001, the company began doing business as KeyTronicEMS, as part of a company-wide transition to firmly plant itself in the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry. Later that year the company was ordered to pay $16.5 million in damages when a jury found that it had misappropriated trade secrets and breached a confidentiality agreement with F&amp;G Scrolling Mouse in 1993.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key Tronic returned to profitability in fiscal 2003, although profits were typical of the razor-thin margins in the EMS industry. Lewis Zirkle, who retired from Key Tronic in 1993, died in 2005 at the age of 90.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keyboards continued to dwindle as a business in the early 21st century, from one-quarter of sales in 2001 to about 4% in fiscal 2006 and around 3% in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   After closing its Las Cruces, New Mexico, plant in 2005, Key Tronic sold the facility in 2007 to Adevco Corp. for about $4 million, including nearly $3 million in cash. Jack Oehlke retired as president and CEO in 2009. EVP/GM Craig Gates succeeded him.
