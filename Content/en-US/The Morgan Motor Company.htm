   If you like the curvaceous sheet metal on cars of the 1930s and 40s, you will thrill to the retro styling of the cars made by The Morgan Motor Company. The oldest independent car company in the world, and still family-owned, Morgan makes a number of models with exterior styling that harkens back to the industry's glory days. Models and brands include the Plus 4, Plus 8, 4/4, 4 Seater, 3 Wheeler Pedal Car, Aero Coupe, and Roadster. The company's Aero 8 model was the first Morgan model sold in the US. Morgan builds more than 1,300 cars per year. Africa.

   The UK is the company's largest market, but growing sales in Germany are threatening to overtake that title. The company's growth strategy involves selling cars in China (it hopes to sell about 30 to 50 three-wheel cars there a year), and it is also looking at other emerging markets such as Brazil, India, and Turkey.

   In 2014 the company opened its first showroom in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Shandong provinces in China, and a dealership in Taiwan (which will sell a full range of Morgan cars, including the Morgan Aero Coupe).

   It also opened a Morgan showroom in the Middle East with the launch of Morgan Motor Company in the UAE.
