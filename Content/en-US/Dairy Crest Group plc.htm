   Dairy Crest Group processes cheese, spreads, and fresh milk for sale to major retailers and the food service industry, as well as supplies an array of milk by-products to food manufacturers. Its products are distributed across the UK (it has exited the French market) under brand names including Country Life milk, Cathedral City (a #1 UK cheese), Clover (dairy spread), Country Life (butter), and FRijj (flavored milk drink). The company, which is supplied by 1,250 British dairy farmers, offers doorstep delivery by 1,800 milkmen to some 850,000 residential customers in England and Wales.

  <p>
   Headquartered in Esher, Dairy Crest has about a dozen locations throughout England, including offices, distribution centers, and manufacturing sites. The UK accounts for 97% of the group's sales.

  <p>
   Dairy Crest Group's Dairies segment is its core business, accounting for more than two-thirds of its sales. The Dairies unit primarily sells non-branded fresh milk in the UK to customers that include retail, food service, and residential customers. The Spreads segment (14% of sales) includes the MH Foods business (acquired in 2011). The Cheese unit (17% of sales), manufactures predominantly branded cheese for sale in the UK to mainly retail customers. The company's doorstep delivery service, called milk&amp;more, serves a declining customer base of some 850,000.

  <p>
   After four consecutive years of revenue growth, Dairy Crest's sales declined 9% in fiscal 2013 (ended March), compared with the prior year, to £1.38 billion ($2.1 billion). The decline resulted from the sale of the St. Hubert spreads business in August 2012. The company reported a profit of £69.3 million ($82.8 million) for the year, versus a steep loss in fiscal 2012.

  <p>
   In a bid to become a more UK-focused, less complex business, Dairy Crest reorganized in 2013. Actions included board and senior management changes, the creation of a unified Dairies business (which it subsequently sold to
   <company id="134912">
    Müller Dairy
   </company>
   in 2015) and the prior sale of its French spreads subsidiary, St. Hubert, for £341 million. The new organization is focused on UK consumers and customers and profitability. Also, in 2013 the company sold its depot-based milk delivery business in Northwest England to Creamline Dairies Ltd. for £1.1 million, reducing its exposure to the mid-tier milk market. It's also expanding its Dairies business via acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amid declining volume sales of doorstep milk delivery of milk (down 12% in fiscal 2013 versus 2012), Dairy Crest closed 28 local depots, finishing the year with 92. The company also closed its residential delivery product distribution center in Sunbury, moving the operation to its national distribution center in Nuneaton.

  <p>
   In 2013 Dairy Crest acquired the small specialist milk business Proper Welsh Milk out of administration for £325,000. Proper Welsh Milk was created in 2011 and invested more than £1 million in a new dairy on the site of the former Whitland Creamery in Carmarthenshire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dairy Crest in 2011 acquired cooking oil and salad dressings maker MH Foods in a £13 million ($21 million) deal that added the Fry Light brand of "one-calorie" spray cooking oils to its product portfolio.

  <p>
   In 1934 the Milk Marketing Board was established to buy and sell milk in the UK and to provide price stability for dairy farmers hit by recession. The board formed Dairy Crest Group as its processing arm in 1981; it became a separate company six years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dairy Crest introduced its Clover imitation butter spread in 1984. In 1991 it joined forces with
   <company id="59011">
    SODIAAL
   </company>
   , the French parent of Yoplait, to make yogurt and fromage frais in the UK. Also that year John Houliston was named chief executive.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1992, with Dairy Crest running 14 creameries and 11 dairies, farmers, milk consumers, and members of the EU (which the UK joined in 1973) were pressuring the Milk Marketing Board to end its monopoly.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Milk Marketing Board was replaced in 1994 by a voluntary cooperative for English and Welsh farmers named Milk Marque. Dairy Crest cut about 12% of its workforce to prime itself for a public offering. The offering was delayed while the government argued about milk market reforms. The company went public in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later the company bought Raines Dairy Foods and merged its operations with Yoplait Dairy Crest. In 1999 Dairy Crest bought Longs Dairies, a leading supplier of milk to retailers and through doorstep deliveries in East Anglia. Also that year the company bought Millway Foods and its Stilton-brand cheese products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dairy Crest's purchase of Unigate's milk and cheese businesses in 2000 neatly doubled the size of the company. In 2002
   <company id="90449">
    Uniq
   </company>
   (neé Unigate) sold its margarine business to Dairy Crest. In keeping with its strategy of building up its branded and value-added dairy products, Dairy Crest sold off its juice business in 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the company's investment in expanded capacity, in mid-2004
   <company id="90031">
    ASDA
   </company>
   announced it was dropping Dairy Crest as a supplier in favor of
   <company id="57771">
    Arla Foods
   </company>
   . A similar loss of milk supply contracts with
   <company id="90426">
    Tesco
   </company>
   threatened to sour company sales. However, by late 2005 Dairy Crest was supplying all of the milk to
   <company id="115637">
    Waitrose
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41199">
    Marks &amp; Spencer
   </company>
   , and half the milk to both
   <company id="40427">
    J Sainsbury
   </company>
   and
   <company id="90499">
    Morrisons
   </company>
   . That same year, Dairy Crest acquired Starcross Foods and the dairy business of the Midlands Co-operative Society.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to concentrate on its name brand cheeses, the company sold its retailer-brand cheese operations to
   <company id="135444">
    First Milk
   </company>
   in 2006 (the sale did not involve the popular UK brand, Cathedral City); it also acquired home-milk-delivery business, Express Dairies, from
   <company id="57771">
    Arla Foods
   </company>
   for almost $61 million that year, making it the UK's leading milk-delivery company. Later that year, the company increased its presence in continental Europe with the acquisition of St Hubert (margarine and other non-dairy spreads) from Uniq for $473 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   President and CEO Drummond Hall retired from the company at the end of 2006. He was replaced by Mark Allen, formerly the executive managing director of Dairy Crest's dairies division.
