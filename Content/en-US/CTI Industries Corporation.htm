   CTI Industries is full of hot air, and that's just fine considering its best-selling product is usually filled with helium. The company designs, produces, and distributes foil balloons and latex balloons for parties, fairs, amusement parks, and other entertainment-related venues. In addition to its novelty products, CTI makes flexible containers, primarily zippered bags and pouches for food and household use, and film products, including specialty film for medical applications and laminated, coated, and printed films that are sold to industrial and commercial customers who generally convert them into flexible packaging for liquid food products. CTI's largest market is the US, followed by Mexico and the UK.

   ' Anagram International, CTI produces more than 500 designs, shapes, and sizes of foil balloons, with a number of new ones introduced each year.

   CTI's flexible film containers include re-sealable pouches with valves that permit air to be removed to protect and extend the freshness of foods and storage bags for clothing, linens, and other household items that may be vacuum sealed. These flexible bags and pouches are sold to various companies for commercial packaging purposes and to consumers through the retail channel. Under a supply agreement, for instance, CTI produces a line of zippered, vacuumable pouches for

   . CTI also sells through a network of distributors who sell to mass merchandise, discount, drugstore, and grocery chains, as well as card and gift shops, party goods stores, and florists. They are sold in the US, Canada, Mexico, and various other markets in Europe and Latin America.

   CTI's printed, laminated, and specialty films are sold directly and through independent sales representatives in the US. Its largest customer for film products is packaging maker Rapak, to which it provides a patented embossed film. Rapak accounts for about 12% of CTI's total net sales.

   CTI saw its total sales remain static in 2011 after posting the highest revenue total in its history for 2010 (around $47 million). Profits, however, decreased by 74% due to an increase in administrative expenses at the company's foreign subsidiaries. The company's total sales in Mexico increased by 21% in 2011.
