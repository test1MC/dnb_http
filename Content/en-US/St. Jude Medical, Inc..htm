   St. Jude Medical is available to help if your heart has trouble catching the beat. The company is a global medical device manufacturer focused on improving the treatment of some of the world's most expensive epidemic diseases. St. Jude Medical operates in one segment producing seven principal product categories: ICD (implantable cardiac defibrillator) systems (the largest category, 28% of earnings), pacemaker systems, atrial fibrillation products, vascular products, structural heart products, Thoratec products, and neuromodulation products. The firm sells its products in more than 100 countries; the US is its largest market. In early 2017, St. Jude Medical was acquired by
   <company id="10030">
    Abbott Laboratories
   </company>
   for $25 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Abbott purchased St. Jude Medical as part of its mission to focus extra efforts on chronic pain management and cardiovascular care (which now make up about a third of its business).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in a single segment with five major areas of focus: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, traditional cardiac rhythm management, and cardiovascular.
  </p>
  <p>
   St. Jude Medical started out making mechanical heart valves, but half of its revenue these days comes from pacemakers and ICDs. ICDs (the company's single largest product category, representing 28% of net sales in fiscal 2016, ended January) correct for tachycardia, or overly fast heartbeats. Pacemakers, in contrast to ICDs, are used to treat patients whose hearts beat too slowly. St. Jude developed one of the industry's first pacemakers with wireless telemetry -- which in this case allows the patient to be monitored by his physician from a distance from the time of implantation all the way through to his follow-up. In fiscal 2016, pacemakers accounted for 17% of net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's atrial fibrillation products (20% of net sales) include electrophysiology introducers and catheters; cardiac mapping, navigation, and recording systems; and ablation systems. The company also makes vascular products such as pressure management guidewires, tomography imaging products, vascular plugs, heart failure monitoring devices, and other accessories. Structural heart products include heart valve repair or replacement products and structural heart defect devices, while neuromodulation products use spinal cord or brain stimulation to treat chronic pain or movement disorders.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thoratec products include ventricular assist devices and percutaneous heart pumps. These help the flow of blood throughout the body.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In addition to the US, which accounts for about half of revenues, St. Jude's largest markets include Europe and the Asia/Pacific region (especially Japan, which accounts for 8% of revenues).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has US manufacturing facilities and research and development facilities in California, Michigan, Minnesota, Arizona, South Carolina, Texas, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Georgia. It has foreign plants in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Israel, Switzerland, and Malaysia.
  </p>
  <p>
   St. Jude's has more than 100 sales and administration offices around the globe. Its products are sold in more than 100 nations.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   St. Jude's key geographic markets are the US, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region (including Japan). It sells directly to health care professionals in the US, Canada, and Japan. It also has direct sales organizations in 21 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, five countries in Latin America, and 10 countries in the Asia/Pacific region. The company uses a combination of direct sales and independent distributors in other markets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Revenue has remained pretty steady for the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended January), net sales fell 1.4% to $5.5 billion as sales of ICD systems and pacemakers dropped. These products felt the competition from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ICDs and pacemakers. Further affecting earnings was the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by an increase in atrial fibrillation products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell 12% to $122 million that year, largely due to the drop in product sales. Cash flow from operations fell $265 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2016.

  <p>
   The company aggressively introduces new cardiac rhythm management (CRM) products in a bid to take market share from its main competitors in the field,
   <company id="10981">
    Medtronic
   </company>
   and
   <company id="15683">
    Boston Scientific
   </company>
   . It invests more than 10% of its annual income in research and development of new products, and also conducts vigorous marketing campaigns to boost sales of existing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even as St. Jude has been busily introducing new CRM products, it hasn't forgotten about its other lines. The company looks to strengthen all of its product groups through acquisitions and organic product development. In 2014 it launched two ablation catheters to strengthen its atrial fibrillation offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also been buying up other companies to access new technologies. In 2014 it bought CardioMEMS and NeuroTherm, boosting its heart failure and chronic pain programs. The company is particularly excited about the potential of CardioMEMS HF system, a heart failure monitor which has reduced hospitalizations. In 2016 St. Jude launched its Quadra Assura cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company made its largest acquisition to-date, buying
   <company id="51442">
    Thoratec Corporation
   </company>
   for $3.4 billion and adding a new category of products to its pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
   St. Jude's other initiatives for growth include improving its manufacturing processes and enhancing its existing product offerings. In late 2015, it began restructuring itself to drive cross-functional synergies.
  </p>
  <p>
   St. Jude Medical, like most other companies operating in the health care industry, is still working out how new health care laws will impact its operations. The company faces legislative challenges including proposed new excise taxes on all US medical device sales and potential reimbursement changes through Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has also encountered challenges in the ICD market, which is experiencing declining implant procedure volumes due to negative publicity over their use.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 the company agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories in a deal valued at $25 billion. The merger of St. Jude Medical and Abbot Labs will create one of the world's largest heart-related device makers, combining the former's products including heart catheters and defibrillators with the latter's coronary intervention and valve repair products.

  <p>
   The company bought cardiac device maker
   <company id="51442">
    Thoratec Corporation
   </company>
   for $3.4 billion in 2015. The move invigorates its pipeline of products, helping it gain access to new technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2015 St. Jude acquired Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System. That deal made St. Jude the only medical device maker to offer radiofrequency ablation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation treatments for chronic pain.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 St. Jude purchased the 80% of
   <company id="155361">
    CardioMEMS
   </company>
   it didn't already own. The company makes a wireless implant that helps physicians remotely manage chronic cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and aneurysms. The device was approved by the
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   in 2014. St. Jude had bought a 20% stake in CardioMEMS previously and exercised its option to buy the company outright when its implant was approved. That year it also acquired NeuroTherm, a maker of pain management devices, for approximately $200 million in cash.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Manuel Villafana, who started Cardiac Pacemakers in 1972, founded St. Jude Medical four years later to develop the bileaflet heart valve. In 1977 patient Helen Heikkinen received the first St. Jude heart valve. The firm also went public that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Villafana left in 1981 and established competitor Helix Biocore. St. Jude expanded into tissue valves with its purchase of BioImplant in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the mid-1980s St. Jude gained market share when devices from Pfizer and Baxter International had problems. Concerns that the company hadn't diversified led to a joint venture in 1992 with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to develop a bioprosthetic (constructed of animal tissue) heart valve. In 1994 it bought Siemens' pacemaker unit, doubling revenues and tripling its sales force.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm continued diversifying, buying Daig (cardiac catheters) in 1996 and Ventritex (cardiac defibrillators) in 1997. In 1997 the FDA approved St. Jude's Toronto SPV tissue valve, marking its entry into that market. In 1999 St. Jude landed on CalPERS's list of worst-performing companies as it lagged behind rivals Guidant and Medtronic. A management shake-up followed, and the firm strengthened its product lines, buying Tyco International's Angio-Seal subsidiary (cardiac sealant) and Vascular Science (artery connectors). The next year the FDA stepped up its regulatory oversight after the company and its competitors recalled or issued warnings regarding defective or potentially defective devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 St. Jude bought Getz Bros., its largest distributor in Japan. The firm scooped up two other firms,
   <company id="58795">
    Irvine Biomedical
   </company>
   and Epicor Medical, in 2004.
