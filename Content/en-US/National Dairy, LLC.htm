   Don't cry over spilt milk; National Dairy has more, and cream as well. A leading US producer and distributor of fluid milk and cream, the company also makes and distributes a broad range of national and proprietary food brands, including butter, cheeses, cultured products, frozen desserts, and juices. The milk producer operates about a dozen regional and local dairies mostly in the southern US. Its lineup is sold under brands Borden, Coburg Dairy, Flav-O-Rich, Dairy Fresh, Dairymen's, Promised Land, and Velda Farms. National Dairy is part of Mexican dairy giant

   .

   The revenue derived from US operations accounted for 1% of the parent company's revenues in 2012, a 5% decline on the previous year.

   At the time of the 2009 acquisition, National Dairy was one of the largest milk processors in the US, despite having sold dairy producers Crowley Foods and Marigold Foods (now
   <company id="113214">
    Kemps
   </company>
   ) in 2004 to
   <company id="52150">
    H.P. Hood
   </company>
   . National Dairy's clout peaked following its acquisition of two dairy operations from
   <company id="93546">
    Wessanen
   </company>
   and, later, the dairy plants of Suiza, which merged and morphed into

   The purchase of National Dairy from
   <company id="40314">
    Dairy Farmers of America
   </company>
   benefited both
   <company id="161526">
    Lala
   </company>
   and National Dairy. The Mexican company gained an entry vehicle to the US market, a priority prompted by the US's growing Hispanic population. In turn, the deal allowed National Dairy to invest in new opportunities. Following Lala's takeover, National Dairy bought San-Antonio-based Promised Land Dairy.
