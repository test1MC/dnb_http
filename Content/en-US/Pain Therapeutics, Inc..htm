   Pain Therapeutics is providing opiates for the masses. The development-stage pharmaceutical company is working on abuse-resistant painkillers, including Remoxy, a version of the frequently abused Oxycontin. Pain Therapeutics is developing Remoxy in partnership with
   <company id="11175">
    Pfizer
   </company>
   , which holds all of the commercialization rights to the drug except in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to its chronic pain candidates, Pain Therapeutics has other development products in early stages. Because many of its drug candidates already contain
   <company id="144161">
    FDA
   </company>
   -approved components, the firm hopes for a faster approval process for its lead candidate.

  <p>
   The company plans to use third-party manufacturers to formulate, make, and ship its products once they are approved. A key supplier is
   <company id="100787">
    DURECT
   </company>
   , the company from which Pain Therapeutics originally licensed the rights to REMOXY.

   Pain Therapeutics hasn't seen any revenue except its payments from Pfizer; revenue was $41 million in 2013. The company, however, continues to spend heavily on R&amp;D like any development-stage company. At the end of 2013, Pain Therapeutics had an accumulated deficit of $104.1 million.

  <p>
   In order to begin making money, Pain Therapeutics needs to get REMOXY or one of its other candidates approved for sale in the US or elsewhere. The company plans to retain the rights to its drugs, other than REMOXY, though it may seek marketing partners for niche products. It also plans to continue outsourcing it trials and manufacturing.
