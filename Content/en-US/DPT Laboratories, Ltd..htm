The contract manufacturer and developer makes prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, with an emphasis on semi-solid, liquid, and sterile formulations. Its products include aerosol foams, nasal sprays, eye drops, and creams, as well as metered inhalers, dosage vials, and prefilled syringes. The firm works with conventional and biological compounds and can manufacture small quantities for clinical trials or large batches for commercial production.

   DPT was formed in 1938 as Texas Pharmacal Company and is known as the first US-based dermatology company. The company was renamed Dermatological Products of Texas in 1980. Then, in 1990, DFB Pharmaceuticals acquired the firm and renamed it as DPT Laboratories. The company's focus was then expanded into drug development and manufacturing services. Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, a portfolio company of RoundTable Healthcare partners, acquired DPT in 2012.
