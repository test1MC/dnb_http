   In 2007 the company created a Health and Nutrition business division in order to speed up product innovation in order to meet the growing global emphasis on health. It also combined its cultures and enzymes operations into a new division called Innovation. This move was made in conjunction with the 2008 retirement of  Peter Olesen as the company's EVP of corporate research in order to assure a smooth transfer of knowledge. Olesen continues to work for Chr. Hansen as chief science officer with a focus on functional foods and probiotics.

   That year it sold its Spanish and Indian paprika businesses in order to focus on its core value-added products such as natural color and flavor pigments and compounds, for the food and beverage industries, as well as culture and enzyme products. The sale included paprika and spice oleoresin, rosemary extract, paprika powder, turmeric, and chlorophyll products.
