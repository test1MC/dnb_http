   This alien makes sure you

   get abducted. Alien Technology makes low-cost, high-volume radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and ultra high frequency (UHF) tags using its Fluidic Self Assembly (FSA) manufacturing process. (FSA allows for large quantities of small components to be placed on a surface during a single operation.) The company also makes the chips used in the tags and readers used for detection and tracking. Alien's tags and readers are used for inventory management, logistics, security systems, supply chain management, and vehicle asset tracking. Its products are compatible with supply chain software from vendors such as

   For the most part, customers come from the retail, consumer goods, manufacturing, defense, transportation/logistics and pharmaceutical industries. Other applications that use Alien RFID tags and systems include self-service kiosk automation, automotive components assembly, evidence tracking in crime labs, and blood bag tracking within blood banks. The company also works with channel partners around the world to expand use of its RFID products to new industries.
