   Purina counts two dozen manufacturing plants among its operations. Purina has litter plants, dry plants, and wet plants. US facilities that make litter are located in California, Virginia, and Missouri. The company maintains two litter plants in Canada. Dry plants are located in the US in Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia, Denver, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, and a pair in Canada.

   The company works to capture an increasing share of the pet food market while boosting its sources of revenue. To this end, Purina focuses on product research and development. It has followed the wave of companies that market functional foods -- in its case, foods with health-promoting or wellness-maintaining properties for pets. The company launched Purina ONE beyOnd, a natural food with real meat, fruits, and vegetables, for adult dogs and cats in 2011, and Purina ONE SmartBlend, a nutrient-rich blend to satisfy more active pets, in 2010. Other product developments include Chef Michael's (2009), a super-premium food for small dogs, and Breeze litter box (2008) for cats. Produced under the Tidy Cats name, the litter box features a rack lined with non-absorbent pellets to separate solid waste from liquids, which collect in an odor-controlling pad below.

   Operationally, Purina is trimming its manufacturing expenses. The company sold its steel can-making assets to packaging giant
   <company id="41494">
    Silgan Holdings
   </company>
   for $25 million. The 2011 deal, which included a long-term agreement to supply Purina with cans for its products, followed a pilot program between Silgan and the pet food producer.

   As part of its business, Purina offers insurance coverage for pet-related accidents and illnesses. Domestic animals have become an integral part of many families and their proper care can cost their owners more than they can spend at any given time. To this end, Purina has added insurance coverage as an extension of its brand and as another revenue vehicle. The company's PurinaCare Insurance Services is available to dog and cat owners in most US states, and is offered as a benefit by a growing list of employers and member organizations. Coverage is underwritten by Central States Indemnity Co. of Omaha, a subsidiary of

   .

   Purina has agreed to buy Petfinder, an online pet adoption website from
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications LLC
   </company>
   . The deal is expected to close in July 2013. The purchase will allow Purina to broaden support for pet welfare organizations and strengthen its role as a leading provider of online pet-related information. It also positions Purina further as an advocate for pet well-being and adds yet another avenue for potential sales.
