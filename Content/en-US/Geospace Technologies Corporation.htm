   Geospace Technologies (formerly OYO Geospace) analyzes the spaces below the earth's surface to help companies find gas and oil. It makes instruments and equipment used by seismic contractors and oil and gas companies to gather and process seismic data to zero in on hydrocarbons. The company's geophones detect energy from the earth's subsurface, and its hydrophones detect changes in pressure and gather seismic data in water. Other products include seismic leader wire, geophone string connectors, seismic telemetry cable, and thermal imaging equipment; all are compatible with most seismic data-acquisition systems. Geospace also makes its thermal printers available for the commercial graphics industry.
  </p>

  <p>
   Geospace sells products to customers around the world. It is headquartered in Houston, Texas. International offices are located in Canada, China, Russia, and the UK. International manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and Russia.

  <p>
   The company has two business lines: seismic products (71% of total 2015 revenues) and thermal solutions products. Geospace's seismic product lines consist of land and marine nodal seismic data acquisition systems, high-definition reservoir characterization products and services, geophones and hydrophones (including multi-component geophones and hydrophones), seismic leader wire, geophone string and acquisition system connectors, seismic telemetry cables, marine seismic cable retrieval and steering devices, and specialized data acquisition systems targeted at conventional and niche markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geospace's thermal printers include both thermal imagesetters for graphics applications and thermal plotters for seismic applications. In addition, its thermal solutions products include direct-to-screen systems, thermal printheads, dry thermal film, thermal transfer ribbons, and other thermal media. The company also distributes private label high-quality dry thermal media for use in its thermal printers and direct-to-screen systems.

  <p>
   The company's principal seismic customers are seismic contractors and major independent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument and equipment preferences to contractors. Geospace's customers deepwater reservoir characterization products are generally large international oil and gas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Geospace's thermal imaging customers are direct users of its equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the newsprint, silkscreen, and corrugated box printing industries.

  <p>
   The company's net revenues have been decreasing sharply over the last three years (2013-15). In 2015 Geospace's net revenues decreased by 64% to $84.87 million (compared to $236.91 million in 2014) primarily due to a drop in seismic segment sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The seismic segment decreased due to lower traditional exploration product sales, reflecting lower demand for geophone and marine products due to the soft oil and gas exploration market.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing growth, the company posted a net loss in 2015 of $32.64 million (compared to net income of $36.91 million in fiscal 2014), mainly due to lower net revenues and charges of goodwill impairment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted an operating cash outflow of $11.37 million in 2015.

  <p>
   Geospace relies on a broad base of customers in a wide swath of countries to protect it from dramatic downturns in particular markets. While it has about 50 seismic contracting companies (about 20 of which specialize in marine activities) it also sells thermal printer products as part of its product diversification strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company focuses on investing in research and development and in the expansion of its manufacturing and engineering capacity.

   In 2011 the company sold to
   <company id="13183">
    Dawson Geophysical Company
   </company>
   14,850 channels of its galvanic skin response (GSR) wireless data acquisition system for $15.6 million. This transaction aids Geospace's plans of making GSR wireless technology available to their customers under a rent-to-own strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company dropped OYO from its corporate name in 2012 following the sale of Japanese conglomerate
