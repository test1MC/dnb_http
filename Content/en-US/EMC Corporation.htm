   EMC helps businesses build Web-based computing systems with its data storage products and services. Its hardware and software platforms enable enterprises to store, manage, protect, and analyze massive volumes of data. EMC also offers data security products through its

   business and virtualization software through majority-owned
   <company id="102605">
    VMware
   </company>
   . The company serves both large,
   <em>
    FORTUNE 500
   </em>
   organizations and smaller businesses across many industries. Banks, government agencies, ISPs, and manufacturers are among its customers. EMC serves a global client base from facilities and partners worldwide; about 45% of sales are from outside the US. In September 2016, EMC became part of Dell Technologies in a $67 billion deal.

  <p>
   The combination of Dell and EMC creates a nearly full-service IT operation. The company would provide PCs, services, IT services, and storage, filling gaps for each company. The deal does carry risk. It is highly leveraged with debt, although the money to finance the deal is being borrowed when interests rates are at rock bottom. And while getting a major storage provider the reason for the deal for Dell, it exposes the company to the volatility of the storage market. The deal closed in September 2016, less than a year after it was announced.

  <p>
   No matter how it's sliced, EMC makes most of its money from systems for information storage, data centers and cloud computing. Those products and services generate 73% of the company's revenue. VMware Virtual Infrastructure, which includes EMC's stake in publicly traded VMware, accounts for the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   EMC make its machines at facilities in US and Ireland; it also used third-party manufacturers for some products. The company operates software development facilities in the US and overseas.

  <p>
   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for 55% of sales. The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Asia-Pacific regions contributed about 28% and about 13%, respectively. EMC saw growth in the US, but sales fell across the board elsewhere.

  <p>
   EMC markets its products directly, as well as through a network of distributors, systems integrators, resellers, and OEMs. Participants in the company's selling partner program generate more than half of sales. The company's advertising expenses have risen in the past three years, hitting $29 million in 2015, compared to $25 million and $23 million n 2014 and 2013.

  <p>
   EMC managed to maintain its string of increasing sales in 2015 with a 1% rise from 2014. The company added just some $300 milion to its top line, reaching $24.7 billion. Services revenue rose 8% while revenue associated with products fell 4%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Profit fell about 27% to $2 billion in 2015 from $2.7 billion in 2014.  Higher expenses cut deeply into EMC's profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations dropped to $5.4 billion in 2015 from $6.5 billion in 2014.

  <p>
   The growing trends of cloud computing and big data are transforming information technology, requiring companies to find new partners and invest in new products. EMC sees this as a huge growth opportunity and is focused on creating a product and services portfolio to meet these emerging needs. Research and development expenses in 2014 were about 12% of revenue, on par with spending from the previous two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has generated new products and services aimed at helping customer make an easier transition to cloud computing. The Isilon scale-out NAS Data Lake allows enterprises to scale easily to edge locations as well as public clouds. With VxRACK, EMC looks to aid enterprises and service providers in simplifying deployment of mobile, cloud, and distributed Tier 2 applications.

   Shortly after finalizing the EMC deal, Dell Technologies sold EMC's Enterprise Content Division (ECD) to
   <company id="47792">
    Open Text
   </company>
   for $1.62 billion. The sale of ECD, which includes the Documentum unit, eliminates an area that would have been a sideshow in the combined Dell-EMC enterprise. The transaction also provided cash, which could help defray some of the cost of the EMC deal.

  <p>
   In July 2015 EMC acquired Virtustream, which develops technology that helps customers move their applications to cloud-based IT environments. The deal was valued at about $1.2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   EMC acquired another seven companies for a total of $120 million in 2015. The acquirees included other developers of software for porting applications to the cloud.

  <p>
   Former
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   executive Dick Egan and his college roommate, Roger Marino, founded EMC in 1979. (Their initials gave the company its name.) Egan, a feisty entrepreneur whose first job was shining shoes, served as a Marine in Korea and later worked at
   <company id="40300">
    MIT
   </company>
   on the computer system for
   <company id="54834">
    NASA
   </company>
   's Apollo program. Egan also helped found Cambridge Memory Systems (later
   <company id="15396">
    Cambex
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   EMC was started with no business plan, only the idea that Egan and Marino would be better off working for themselves. At first, they sold office furniture, which in short order led to contacts at technology companies and recognition of the niche market for add-on memory boards for minicomputers.
  </p>
  <p>
   EMC grew steadily throughout the early 1980s and went public in 1986. Two years later Michael Ruettgers, a former COO of high-tech publishing and research company Technical Financial Services, joined the company as EVP of operations. Ruettgers spent his first year and a half at EMC dealing with a crisis that almost ruined the company: Defective disk drives in some of its products were losing customers' files. Ruettgers stepped up quality control and guided EMC through the crisis period. In 1989 he became the company's president and COO.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1980s EMC expanded into data storage, developing a system that employed small hard disks rather than larger, more expensive disks and tapes used in
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   mainframes. EMC then separated itself from competitors by providing systems with a large cache -- a temporary storage area used for quicker data retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 EMC pioneered redundant array of independent disks (RAID) storage and eliminated nearly a dozen major product lines, focusing on storage for large IBM computers in a bid to beat Big Blue by undercutting prices. The company introduced its original Symmetrix system, based on the new integrated cached disk array technology that held data from a variety of computer types. Marino left the company in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ruettgers became CEO in 1992. The next year the company acquired Epoch Systems, a provider of data management software, and in 1994 it bought storage products company Array Technology as well as Magna Computer, a leader in tape storage technology for IBM computers. EMC also introduced its first storage product for open systems, the Centriplex series, and its sales passed the $1 billion mark.
  </p>
  <p>
   EMC increased its presence in this fast-growing data switching and computer connection market with the 1995 acquisition of
   <company id="60232">
    McDATA
   </company>
   . The next year it launched a digital video storage and retrieval system for the TV and film industry and introduced software that let its systems work on networks instead of requiring file servers for data storage management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1997 the company began managing Web sites for customers. Expanding its international service presence, EMC in 1998 bought French technology services provider Groupe MCI and in 1999 opened an Internet services office in Ireland. Also that year the company moved into the market for midrange storage when it acquired data storage and server specialist
