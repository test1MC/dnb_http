   General Chemical Industrial Products (which also does business as Tata Chemicals North America) makes soda, but don't be tempted to take a drink. The
   <company id="139415">
    Tata Chemicals
   </company>
   subsidiary produces soda ash, a raw ingredient in the manufacture of everything from glass to soap and detergent to textiles. General Chemical's lone production facility and mine, General Chemical (Soda Ash) Partners, are located in Wyoming; the company owns 75% of General Chemical (Soda Ash) Partners, with glass container manufacturer
   <company id="15483">
    Owens-Illinois
   </company>
   owning the rest. General Chemical (Soda Ash) Partners is a member of the American Natural Soda Ash Company (ANSAC), an export cooperative representing four of the five US soda ash producers.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   General Chemical exports about 40% of the soda ash it produces. Major exports markets include Asia, Europe, and Latin America. ANSAC sells soda ash to all global export markets except Western Europe and Canada (General Chemical has local sales representatives and terminaling operations in both of these geographic markets). It has sales and distribution offices across the US as well as in Canada, the UK (Immingham), and Belgium (Antwerp).
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's Green River facility (with a capacity of 2.8 million tons) is one of the largest soda ash facilities in North America. Its estimated recoverable trona ore reserves stand at 600 million tons, enough to provide 100 years of supply.
  </p>
  <p>
   General Chemical annually mines more than 4.5 million tons of trona ore, which is then converted to soda ash in a multi-step purification process. Trona ore is crushed and screened and the crushed trona is heated in a kiln to remove unwanted gases and transform the ore to crude sodium carbonate. Water is added to remove impurities. Water is then evaporated from the purified solution to form a soda ash crystal slurry from which the remaining water is removed in a centrifuge. The soda ash crystals are then processed through rotary driers and the finished soda ash is sent to storage bins awaiting shipment by truck and train.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company makes several grades of high quality soda ash, and as well as GCH Hydrator System, which unloads dry soda ash and forms a soda ash solution without dusting, using little labor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its supply deal with the Canada Lithium project makes General Chemical the major supplier of soda ash to the growing lithium carbonate market in Canada. The lithium carbonate plant produces annual volumes of more than 35,000 tons of processed soda ash.

  <p>
   General Chemical provides soda ash to a wide variety of markets. One of its largest markets is the glass manufacturing industry, where it is used to manufacture flat glass and mirrors, bottles for beverages, jars for food, insulation, televisions, lighting, glassware, and labware. Soda ash is also used by the chemical industry as a source of sodium ions in the production of sodium phosphates, sodium silicates, chrome chemicals, and photographic chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 29% General Chemical's soda ash products are used by the US glass industry, another 15% is used by chemical manufacturing, and the rest goes to pulp and paper, soap and detergent, and other industries.

  <p>
   The company's sales increased by 13% in 2013. Global soda ash sales prices declined during the year primarily due to lower realized sales prices into the Asian and Latin American markets due to increased competition, lower capacity utilization in China, and reduced demand in Europe.

  <p>
   In 2012 General Chemical signed a three-year agreement to supply dense soda ash from the Green River, Wyoming plant to Canada Lithium's mine and processing plant in northern Quebec. The partnership with
   <company id="123307">
    Univar
   </company>
   strengthened General Chemical's position supplying into the lithium market. The partners are also exploring logistical opportunities from by-products which come off the lithium carbonate production stream.

   In 2008 General Chemical acquired the mica production assets of

   . Soon after that deal,

    Tata Chemicals

   bought the company for about $1 billion, at which point Zemex was spun off to General Chemical's shareholders. The company sold its electronic chemicals unit to

    KMG Chemicals
   </company>
   for $26 million in 2010.
