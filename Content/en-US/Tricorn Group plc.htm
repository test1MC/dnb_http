  <p>
   Tricorn has experienced fluctuating revenues over the last last five years. In 2015 (ended March) its revenues decreased by 28% primarily due to the selling of its aerospace business and to a decline in Transportation segment sales resulting from lower demand in the UK. The decline in 2015 was partially offset by a spike in Energy division sales from the US. In addition, Tricorn has posted straight years with a net loss due to declines from discontinued operations and additional restructuring and China start-up costs.

  <p>
   Throughout 2014 and 2015, Tricorn sold off its Redman Fittings (pipe jointing systems) and RMDG Aerospace (aerospace fittings) operations in order to focus solely on its Transportation and Energy divisions.
