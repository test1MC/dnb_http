   Steel giant Ampco-Pittsburgh keeps its worth by never losing its temper. Among the leaders in steel producers, the company divides its work in two segments: The Forged and Engineered Cast Products segment -- comprising subsidiaries
   <company id="114823">
    Union Electric Steel
   </company>
   and Union Electric Steel UK -- makes forged hardened-steel rolling mill rolls and cast rolls for steel and aluminum manufacturers. The Air and Liquid Processing unit has three divisions:
   <company id="129421">
    Buffalo Pumps
   </company>
   , which makes centrifugal pumps for refrigeration, marine defense, and power generation industries; Aerofin, highly-engineered heat-exchange coils, and Buffalo Air Handling, air-handling systems for defense, power generation, and construction customers.

  <p>
   The US generates 53% of Ampco-Pittsburgh's total sales; all other countries account for the remaining 47%. It has operations in Canada, the UK, and the US.

  <p>
   Forged and Engineered Cast Products accounted for about 65% of the company's revenue in 2015, while its Air and Liquid Processing unit accounted for 35%.

  <p>
   The Air and Liquid Processing segment offers its products to industries including fossil fuel and nuclear power generation, automotive, industrial process and HVAC, in addition to the marine defense, refrigeration and power generation sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buffalo Air Handling produces large custom-designed air handling systems for the commercial, institutional and industrial building markets. The segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout Canada and the US.

  <p>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh has experienced four straight years of revenue declines. Its revenues dropped 13% from 2014 to 2015 due to decrease in sales from both its segments. After posting a net loss of $1.2 million in 2014, the company posted positive net income of $1.4 million in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Primarily, Forged and Cast Engineered Products sales decreased by 15% in 2015 due to a decrease in the volume of traditional roll shipments and weaker pricing for the segment's products. Air and Liquid Processing sales decreased by 8% due to lower levels of shipments to the fossil-fueled utility and industrial markets impacted by reduced demand and increased competition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh's recent positive net income was due to an increase in credit for asbestos litigation (which represents the estimated additional insurance recoveries expected to be available to satisfy asbestos liabilities through 2022, resulting from settlement agreements reached with various insurance carriers in 2015).

  <p>
   Ampco-Pittsburgh's strategy hinges upon the launching of new products in addition to its annual cost-cutting initiatives. It is also on the look-out for acquisitions. In 2015 the company for $75 million acquired Akers AB, a producer of cast and forged rolls and its certain affiliates. Collectively called Union Electric Akers, the transaction included Akers Sweden AB (located in Sweden); National Roll Company (located in Pennsylvania); Shanxi Akers TISCO Roll Co. Ltd. (located in China); Akers Valji Ravne d.o.o. (Slovenia), and Vertical Seal Company (located in Pennsylvania). The acquisition enabled the company to offer a more robust product line to customers in every global region it serves.
