   ARC Group puts a modern twist on making old-fashioned parts. The company makes industrial parts for aerospace, automotive, and medical uses with a 3D manufacturing process. The 3D process reduces times to prototype and make a part and helps the customer get its product to market faster. ARC offers more traditional manufacturing processes such as metal injection molding, plastic injection molding, and metal stamping. Those processes are ARC's biggest moneymaker, accounting for more than four-fifths of revenue. The US is, by far, the company's biggest market. It has added to its portfolio of manufacturing processes through a series of acquisitions.

  <p>
   ARC's precision components group generates 82% of its revenue. The 3DMT group supplies 8% with flanges and fittings adding 7%. The company's wireless unit, which makes antennas, radios, and related accessories for broadband and other wireless networks, provides 3% of revenue.

  <p>
   ARC is headquartered in Florida. It has manufacturing facilities at its headquarters facility and in Hungary. Customers in the US generate 82% of revenue.

  <p>
   The company's top four customers account for about 40% of revenue. ARC sells through a number of distributors including Microcom, Xagyl Communications, Double Radius, Lamatel, and IntellCom Group.

  <p>
   Revenue growth at ARC has blasted off over the past five years - increasing from $3 million in 2010 to $112 million in 2015 (ended June). Revenue rose 36% in 2015 from 2014. Revenue from the Precision Components Group increased about 29%, abetted by the acquisitions of Thixoforming and Kecy in 4Q 2014. Lower sales at ARC's MIM facilities were attributed to reduced orders from firearms and defense customers as well as medical device customers. The 3DMT Group posted a sales gain of 153%, also helped by the acquisition of Advance Tooling Concepts in 2014. The Flanges and Fitting Group reported a 7% sales increase. Lower revenue from the Wireless Group was blamed on a production delay at a contract manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARC reported a net loss of $212,000 due to higher costs, which included a bigger tax bill for the year.

  <p>
   Speed is key to ARC's strategy. With 3D printing it can accelerate making prototypes for customers, which speeds up the subsequent manufacturing process. The company is betting that offshore manufacturing is losing its luster and cost advantage and conducting most its manufacturing in the US. ARC also is developing modular tooling of parts so that it doesn't have to recreate a tool for each order.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aerospace is ARC's strongest market, while other key markets are automotive and medical, especially as medical device makers become more comfortable with the 3D process.

  <p>
   ARC expanded its manufacturing capabilities with acquisitions in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   With Advance Tooling Concepts, ARC gained plastic injection molding capabilities. Advanced Tooling's customers are in the medical and dental device, electronic, consumer, and defense industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The acquisition of Thixoforming added magnesium injection molding to ARC's portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Kecy Corp., ARC acquired a precision metal stamping company that also does value-added secondary design and production processing.
