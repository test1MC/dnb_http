   Norit knows carbon. The company is the world's largest producer of activated carbon, a highly porous chemical used to absorb impurities from the air, water, and other liquids and gases, as well as from food and beverages and pharmaceuticals. Available in both granular and powdered form, Norit offers more than 150 different grades of activated carbon made from bituminous and lignite coal, coconut shells, olive pits, peat, and wood. The company operates 10 production plants in Brazil, Canada, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, the UK, and the US; its products are sold in more than 100 countries but the US and Canada accounts for almost half of sales. In 2012 US-based

   Norit began producing activated carbon in The Netherlands in 1918 as N.V. Algemeene Norit Maatschappij. It bought another activated carbon production facility in The Netherlands in 1924. By 1933 it formed American Norit, Inc. to produce and sell activated carbon in the US. Fast forward five decades to 1985, when it bought the production plant and lignite mine in Marshall, Texas, which had been in operation since 1922.
