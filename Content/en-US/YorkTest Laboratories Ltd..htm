   YorkTest Laboratories wants you to know that what goes down may be what comes up on its tests. The UK-based company makes non-invasive diagnostic tests, which are marketed under the foodSCAN and First Step Food Intolerance Test brand name, among others, used to determine to which foods a patient may be allergic. Its LiverCheck test checks liver health, while its Allergy Check test  identifies possible environmental allergens. The company's Homocysteine test checks blood levels of Homocysteine, a key indicator of the risk of heart disease, dementia, Alzheimer's, and infertility. Founded in 1982, YorkTest Laboratories makes its home health tests available for sale on its website and via telephone.

   YorkTest Laboratories' tests are also designed to determine whether you are actually allergic to a food, drink, pollen, etc., or if you are simply
   <em>
    intolerant
   </em>
   to such things. Often allergy symptoms are the same as intolerance symptoms, meaning people could be limiting themselves from delicious foods and warm Spring days for no reason. YorkTest Laboratories hopes to reopen those worlds for those who have been avoiding foods and areas to which they are "allergic." The company employs a team of nutritional therapists who consult with food intolerance and Gut Health clients via telephone.
