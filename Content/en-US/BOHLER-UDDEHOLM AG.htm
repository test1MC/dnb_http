   For most of us, steel is steel, but BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM prefers to get more specific. The company makes tool steel products, which have improved durability, strength, and corrosion-resistance characteristics. It is also a leading maker of high-speed steel, strip steel, cutting and creasing lines, and forged turbine blades. BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM produces special long steel (including tool steel) in bar, profile, and wire form. Customers include the aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, and electronics industries. In 2008 Austrian steel maker
   <company id="116111">
    voestalpine
   </company>
   bought BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM, making the company it's specialty steel unit.

  <p>
   Two established specialty steel makers, Austria-based Böhler Group and Sweden-based Uddeholm Group merged in 1991, forming Vienna, Austria-based BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM, one of the largest tool steel manufacturers in the world. The company was wholly owned by Österreichische Industrieholding AG (ÖIAG), an Austrian government holding company until 1995, when it was taken public as part of Austria's privatization program. ÖIAG still held 72.7% of the company, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   A secondary offering in 1996 reduced ÖIAG's stake in BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM to 25%. After disposing of peripheral operations, the company focused on four areas: special steel long products, strip steel, welding consumables, and forging technology. That year BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM moved its welding consumables operations into Böhler Thyssen Schweisstechnik, a 50/50 joint venture with Thyssen Stahl (now Thyssen Krupp). BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM acquired Austrian strip steel manufacturer Martin Miller and brought two new electro slag remelting units online in 1997. The next year BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM bolstered its operations by acquiring the high-speed steel business of US-based Allegheny Teledyne.

  <p>
   In 1999 BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM made the decision to withdraw from the welding consumables business by putting its Böhler Thyssen Schweisstechnik on the selling block. The company added to its powder metallurgy capacity with a new production facility for high-speed steels in Kapfenberg. BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM agreed in 2000 to acquire Thyssen-Krupp's tool and special steels unit, Edelstahl Witten-Krefeld, but the deal collapsed when a price could not be agreed upon.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company increased its market share by purchasing a number of smaller heat-treating, machining, and steel production companies. BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM formed a joint venture with Fileur S.A. (an Italian welding company) and bought a 50% stake in Dan Spray A/S (a Danish spray forming company) in 2002. The following year, BÖHLER-UDDEHOLM acquired Brazilian-based Villaries Metals -- maker of tool steel, high-speed steel, and valve steel.
