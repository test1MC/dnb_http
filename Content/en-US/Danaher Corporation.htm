   Danaher is a well-diversified industrial and medical conglomerate whose products test, analyze, and diagnose. Its subsidiaries design, manufacture, and market products and offer services geared at worldwide professional, medical, industrial, and commercial markets. Danaher operates through five segments: Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostics (research and clinical tools), Test &amp; Measurement (electronic measurement instruments), Industrial Technologies (product identification, motion control equipment, and sensors), Environmental (turbine pumps and air/water analysis and treatment equipment), and Dental (orthodontic bracket systems and lab products). In a milestone transaction, Danaher acquired
   <company id="12221">
    Pall Corp.
   </company>
   for $13.6 billion in 2015.

   Danaher acquired
   <company id="12221">
    Pall Corporation
   </company>
   , a major supplier of filtration, separation, and purification technologies, for $13.6 billion in mid-2015. Danaher plans to separate the combined company into two independent, publicly traded companies: a science and technology company, which will retain the Danaher name (and will include Pall); and a diversified industrial company, which will comprise Danaher's test and measurement instruments operations. The spin-off is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2016.

  <p>
   Danaher has around 335 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide. Almost 160 of these facilities are located in the US in more than 25 states; roughly 175 locations reside outside the US in over 50 other countries throughout Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Australia. The company generates almost half of its revenue from North America, primarily the US (44% of sales).

  <p>
   Built largely through acquisitions, Danaher's five business segments reflect a well balanced portfolio. Top segments Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostics and Environmental accounted for 40% and 18% of revenues in fiscal 2015, respectively. Life Sciences products include imaging systems, acute care equipment (blood gas measurement devices), pathology diagnostics (tissue embedding and chemical reagents), and instrumentation (microscopes).

  <p>
   Danaher has enjoyed five straight years of unprecedented growth. Its revenues rose by 3% from $19.9 billion in 2014 to peak at a record-setting $20.1 billion in 2015. Profits also surged 29% from $2.6 billion in 2014 to reach $3.4 billion in 2015, another company milestone.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's historic growth for 2015 was led by a 14% bump in Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostics sales due to higher demand of its existing businesses across China and other high-growth markets, along with additional revenue from the Pall Corporation acquisition. Dental sales spiked by 25%, resulting from demand for dental treatment units and consumable products, including orthodontic products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Environmental segment sales increased by 2% in 2015, resulting from growth in its analytical instrumentation product lines within North America, China, and Europe, and growth within its business' chemical treatment solutions product line in Latin America.

  <p>
   Already its top segment, Danaher is working to get an even larger foothold in the life sciences sector, whose growth is being driven by such factors as aging populations, increased preventive health care, and US health care reforms. It is also seeking opportunities to beef up its industrial business. To this end, Danaher uses a combination of divestitures and acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Danaher bought molecular diagnostics firm
   <company id="100633">
    Cepheid
   </company>
   for some $4 billion. Cepheid's GeneXpert and SmartCycler platforms perform molecular testing for a variety of issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   In its largest acquisition to date, Danaher acquired
   <company id="12221">
    Pall Corporation
   </company>
   , a major supplier of filtration, separation, and purification technologies, for $13.8 billion in mid-2015. Pall now operates as a subsidiary in Danaher's portfolio and maintained its brand. During the third quarter of 2016, Danaher will also separate the combined company into two independent, publicly traded companies: a science and technology company, which will retain the Danaher name (and will include Pall); and a diversified industrial company, which will comprise Danaher's test and measurement instruments operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Danaher purchased
   <company id="142281">
    Nobel Biocare Holding
   </company>
   for $2.2 billion. The deal is expected to significantly widen Danaher's market presence in the global dental industry. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, Nobel Biocare serves customers in 80 markets globally, supplying dental implant systems, high-precision individualized prosthetics, and biomaterials and digital diagnostics products.

  <p>
   Danaher (from the Celtic word
   <em>
    dana
   </em>
   meaning "swift flowing") is named for a fishing stream off the Flathead River in Montana. The term is also an appropriate description of the spotlight-averse Rales brothers. The two have proven to be fishers not only of trout but also of companies, buying underperforming companies with strong market shares and recognizable brand names.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once dubbed "raiders in short pants" by
   <i>
    Forbes,
   </i>
   Steven and Mitchell Rales began making acquisitions in their 20s. In 1981 they bought their father's 50% stake in Master Shield, a maker of vinyl building products. The brothers bought tire manufacturer Mohawk Rubber the following year. In 1983 they acquired control of publicly traded DMG, a distressed Florida real-estate firm; the next year they sold DMG's real estate holdings and folded Mohawk and Master Shield into the company, which they renamed Danaher.
