   SunCoke Energy Partners is a master limited partnership formed by its parent and one of the largest coke producers in the Americas
   <company id="162236">
    SunCoke Energy, Inc.
   </company>
   SunCoke Energy Partners was formed in 2012 for the purpose of owning a majority interest in SunCoke Energy's Ohio-based Haverhill and Middletown cokemaking facilities. Today, the partnership owns a 65% interest in each of those facilities, which make metallurgical coke, a raw material used in steelmaking. Together, they have 300 cokemaking ovens with a capacity of 1.7 million tons per year. The company's two main customers are
   <company id="17195">
    AK Steel
   </company>
   and
   <company id="138179">
    ArcelorMittal USA
   </company>
   . SunCoke Energy Partners went public in early 2013 with an offering worth $256.5 million.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is using proceeds from the offering to repay loan debt, replenish working capital, and make a distribution to its parent (or what it calls its sponsor), SunCoke Energy, to reimburse it for money spent on expanding and improving the Haverhill and Middletown facilities.

  <p>
   Although a large majority of SunCoke Energy Partners' revenues are made from cokemaking, the company also uses waste heat to produce steam and generate electricity. Both are sold to third-parties under the company's energy segment.

  <p>
   SunCoke Energy Partners generates sales from long-term take-or-pay agreements, in which customers are contractually obligated to buy the coke it produces. Its primarily markets these contracts to steelmakers that require coke for use in blast furnaces. Currently, the company sells substantially all of its coke to AK Steel and ArcelorMittal, two of the largest blast furnace steelmakers in North America. Demand for coke in blast furnace steelmaking in the US and Canada is expected to grow by about 11% by 2016.

  <p>
   Total revenues rose 25% in fiscal 2011 compared to 2010 thanks in part to the start up of Middletown operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 but also attributable to higher pricing driven by the pass-through of higher coal costs. Revenues were also slightly aided by a 1% increase in coke sales volumes in 2011 over 2010.

  <p>
   A key part of the company's strategy is to renew current customers under its take-or-pay contract model and, as it builds up capacity, win new customers. SunCoke Energy Partners benefits from the strength and experience of its parent/sponsor SunCoke Energy. It also believes that opportunities are around the corner as US coking facilities age and steel producers look for alternatives to imported coke. Financial liquidity and pursuit of select acquisitions are also key for SunCoke Energy Partners.
