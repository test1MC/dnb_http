   Prime time is anytime with TiVo. That's the idea behind TiVo and its digital video recorder (DVR). The DVR (similar to a VCR, but using a hard drive instead of videocassette) allows more than 7 million subscribers to record standard- and high-definition TV (broadcast, cable, or satellite). The company sells DVRs online and through electronics retailers such as
   <company id="10209">
    Best Buy
   </company>
   . In addition to buying a DVR, customers pay for TiVo's subscription service, which is essentially a high-tech TV listing. TiVo reaches cable and satellite viewers by licensing its technology to

    DIRECTV
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="103320">
    Comcast
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="134371">
    Virgin Media
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="144400">
    Vodafone
   </company>
   , and other service providers worldwide. In 2016 TiVo agreed to be bought by
   <company id="52934">
    Rovi
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Although Rovi is paid $1.1 billion for TiVo the combine company took the TiVo name, which is more familiar to consumers.

  <p>
   The deal with Rovi should help both companies navigate the quickly changing landscape of viewing programs on TVs, tablets, smartphones or PCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   To extend its cloud-based service to beam content to multiple devices, TiVo acquired the video technology company Digitalsmiths to enable it to offer elements of its service through non-TiVo branded user experiences.

  <p>
   In addition to expanding from when to where in terms of devices, the company is also looking to expand beyond the US market. TiVo currently has subscribers in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan. TiVo has made headway in international markets. In 2016 sales in Europe rose 91% and were up 155% in other international markets.

   As part of its plans to expand internationally, TiVo in 2015 acquired Cubiware, a Polish company that makes software to connect cable company software and set-top-box hardware. Cubiware brings with it about 40 customers in 25 countries in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. The company says its products have been integrated into more than 4 million STBs.
