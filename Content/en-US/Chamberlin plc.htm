   Though it's not in the movie business, Chamberlin does its share of casting. The company produces iron castings and other metal products at five manufacturing factories based in the UK. Subsidiaries include Russell Ductile Castings and Chamberlin &amp; Hill Castings (industrial castings for use in the automotive, construction, steel, rail, and power generation industries), Petrel (lighting, switchgear, and electrical installation products for the petrochemical and construction industries), and Exidor (emergency-exit hardware). Chamberlin traces its historical roots all the way back to 1890.

  <p>
   The company operates five manufacturing locations in the UK, which serve its customers across Europe, the US, and Asia. The UK represents 61% of total sales, while Germany generates 17%. The rest of Europe generates 16%, while other countries account for the remainder.

  <p>
   The company operates through two segments. The Foundries segment supplies iron castings, in raw or machined form, to a variety of industrial customers who incorporate the castings into their own products or carry out further machining or assembly operations on the castings before selling them on to their customers. The Engineering segment provides manufactured and imported products -- including door hardware, hazardous area lighting, and control gear -- to distributors and end-users operating in the safety and security markets.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company's net revenue increased by 6% due to a 9% spike in Engineering sales, followed by a 5% jump in Foundries revenues. Geographically, major increases were achieved from European countries except for the UK (which declined by 2%).
