   Throw whose steak on the barbecue? Maybe it was from Agri Beef, a company established in 1968 that raises cattle on its ranches and fattens them up on its four feedlots in Idaho, Kansas, and Washington. Its processing plant located in Washington offers both fresh and processed meats. Agri Beef's brands include Snake River Farms, Double R Ranch, St. Helens Beef, and Rancho El Oro Beef. The company also raises cattle for other companies and offers such services as cattle procurement, partnership arrangements, competitive financing, accounting, on-site inspections, trucking schedules, and inventory management. In addition, the family-owned business operates Performix, a cattle-feed and -supplement manufacturer.

  <p>
   Agri Beef is focused on three initiatives. In 2013 it opened a new grinding operation inside its packing plant, which it purchased in 2003, to make this part of its business more efficient and cost-effective. With nearly 50% of the beef category being grinds, Agri Beef was looking to better serve its customer base. Its second initiative is a new value-added facility, which is attached to the packing facility. It takes beef products into specialty production to make sliced meats and marinated items. The move reduces transport costs and speeds shipping. It has since earned certification from the Global Food Safety Initiative. The company's third initiative is giving consumers a more convenient way to purchase its products through the development of e-commerce sites for each brand.

   To extend the reach of its handful of brands, Agri Beef developed specialty branded websites with e-commerce functionality. The company offers customers overnight shipping.
