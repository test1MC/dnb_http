  <p>
   Cenveo's revenue spiked 10% from $1.78 billion in 2013 to $1.95 billion in 2014. The growth for 2014 was fueled by a 24% bump in envelope sales driven by additional revenue from a previous acquisition, higher paper prices, and increased demand from certain direct mail customers (mainly financial institutions). In addition, its print segment revenue increased by 1% in 2014 primarily due to increased demand from media and telecommunication customers and the addition of new customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the spike in revenue, the company has posted seven straight years of net losses. Its most recent loss of $84 million in 2014 was attributed to higher restructuring charges affiliated with the closure and consolidation of several envelope facilities related to the integration of an acquisition with its existing operations. Cenveo's operating cash flow has also declined the last few years, dipping from $80 million in 2011 to $24 million in 2014.

  <p>
   To become profitable, Cenveo has been closing and divesting under-performing operations. In 2013 it completed the sale of its Custom Envelope Group and decided to exit the San Francisco market and close a manufacturing facility located there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cenveo's strategy has also focused on engaging in acquisitions that aid in the company's product expansion, or enhance its market position. The company has been investing in digital and variable print technology as a result of increased demand for such technologies from its customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company acquired
   <company id="44164">
    National Envelop Corporation
   </company>
   , a manufacturer and distributor of envelope products for the wholesale, billing, financial, direct mail, and office products markets. Cenveo spent $20 million of cash and $5 million of Cenveo common stock on the transaction. As a result, Cenveo gained an enhanced portfolio of products and services and an increased geographic presence.

  <p>
   Mail-Well (later Cenveo) evolved from Denver's Rockmont Envelope, founded in 1921. The company was owned by paper mill Great Northern Nekoosa (GNN) until 1990 when GNN was acquired by Georgia-Pacific. Then in 1994, in an effort to get back to its roots in its core forest business, Georgia-Pacific sold Mail-Well to investment firm Sterling Group. Sterling merged the company with its Pavey Envelope business and initiated an aggressive acquisition strategy. Mail-Well went public in 1995 and changed its corporate name to Cenveo in 2004.
