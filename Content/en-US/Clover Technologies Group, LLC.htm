  <p>
   Clover makes more than 2 million cartridges a month. To maintain its momentum, Clover has been expanding its facilities. It built a 15,000-sq.-ft. technology center at its Ottawa, Illinois, facility, and expanded its Canadian operation located in Oakville, Ontario. The latter move involved relocating a warehouse and distribution center to a 100,000-square-foot facility that was three times the size of its predecessor.
