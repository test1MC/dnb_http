   American Woodmark has more cabinet selections than the prime minister of Russia. A top maker of home cabinets in the US, the company makes and distributes about 500 styles of low- to mid-priced kitchen cabinets and vanities. Styles vary by finish (oak, cherry, hickory, maple, as well as laminate) and door design. Brands include American Woodmark, Shenandoah Cabinetry, Timberlake, and Waypoint. Targeting the remodeling and new home construction markets, American Woodmark sells its lineup through home centers and independent dealers and distributors; it also sells directly to major builders. American Woodmark was established through a leveraged buyout of

   's cabinet division.

  <p>
   Business is divided between two markets -- remodeling and new home construction. Products are distributed through four assembly plants and a third-party logistics network.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through its seven service centers nationwide, American Woodmark offers complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company keeps in stock about 85 door designs in more than 20 colors.

  <p>
   Virginia-based American Woodmark operates nine manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Its coast-to-coast service centers expand its customer reach beyond the Sun Belt construction market.

   Through three primary channels -- home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors -- American Woodmark services the remodeling and new home construction markets. Its brand names include American Woodmark, Timberlake (sold to major home builders), Shenandoah Cabinetry (Lowe's), Potomac (Lowe's), and Waypoint Living Spaces.

   In fiscal 2015, advertising expenses totaled $34.3 million, up from $30.4 million in fiscal 2014 but down from $36.5 million in fiscal 2013.

  <p>
   American Woodmark has enjoyed rising revenue since 2009. In fiscal 2014 (ended April), the cabinet maker reported sales of $825.5 million, a 14% increase versus the prior year. The double-digit growth was largely driven by increased sales in the new construction market, as well as higher per-unit revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   After experiencing losses in 2011 and 2012, the company's profits have rebounded. Higher revenues helped net income rise 73% to $35.5 million in fiscal 2015 (although increased income tax expense partially offset those gains). Cash flow from operations also rose, growing 45% to $58.7 million that year.

  <p>
   Alvin Goldhush in 1951 started cabinet company Form Laminates, which lumber giant
   <company id="10222">
    Boise Cascade
   </company>
   acquired two decades later. Four senior managers of Boise Cascade's cabinet division -- William Brandt, Jeff Holcomb, Al Graber, and Donald Mathias -- engineered an LBO of the unit in 1980 and named it American Woodmark after a popular line of cabinets. The company started selling cabinets nationwide through distribution centers and went public in 1986.
  </p>
  <p>
   American Woodmark spent the first half of the 1990s diversifying its product and brands. In 1990 it introduced Timberlake, a cabinet line for the construction industry. Other brands, including Coventry and Case, Crestwood, and Scots Pine, were added and quintupled its product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   President and COO Jake Gosa became CEO in 1996. The sales cupboard was rather bare that year from a downturn in the closely linked home centers industry. The market surged in 1997, causing American Woodmark's profits to nearly triple, and new equipment and manufacturing techniques boosted output. In 1998 the company began offering hickory cabinets (its first new wood species in a decade), kitchen accessories, and high-quality ready-to-assemble framed cabinets (Flat Pack).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 American Woodmark expanded its hickory cabinet offerings (adding the Newport and Charleston brands). The company began operations at its new assembly facility in Gas City, Indiana, in 2000. To both preserve and increase market share in a slow-growth economy, in 2001 American Woodmark initiated plans to expand two plants and open two more in Kentucky and Oklahoma.
