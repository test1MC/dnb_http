   Acer has more than one PC brand up its sleeve. Besides the flagship Acer line (one of the world's top sellers), it markets
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   , eMachines, and
   <company id="154320">
    Packard Bell
   </company>
   computers. Other Acer products include servers, storage systems, smartphones, projectors, LCD televisions, digital cameras, and computer displays. The company has branched out into connecting devices through the cloud through a program it calls Build Your Own Cloud. Acer, which outsources its manufacturing, sells through resellers and distributors worldwide.

  <p>
   About 80% of Acer's revenue comes from its PC segment with the rest supplied by its other products.

   Acer generates about a fifth of sales in the Americas and another fifth in Taiwan and China.

   In 2015 Acer experienced drops in revenue and net income as well as negative cash flow. Revenue tumbled 20% in 2015 to $7.98 billion from 2014. The company posted lower revenue from PCs and other products and in every geographic region. Net income dropped to $18.3 million in 2015. The company also reported a net cash outflow of $26 million for the year, compared to cash flow of $177 million in 2014.

  <p>
   Finding new products and markets is something of a pressing need for Acer and other PC makers. PC sales are trending down around the world as consumers and business spend more money on and time with mobile devices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acer has built up its cloud offerings in a program it calls Build Your Own Cloud (BYOC). With it the company offers connections on any device (including those from other manufacturers) from anywhere through its cloud capabilities. BYOC is similar to online storage offered by companies such as
   <company id="163317">
    Box
   </company>
   and online storage and apps such as
   <company id="59101">
    Google
   </company>
   Drive. Diving further into the cloud, Acer has formed alliances with partners with offerings for the internet of things (IoT) for smart home, healthcare apps, connected vehicles, and smart classroom apps. Acer went further than an alliance in forming a joint venture with Starbreeze to develop, make, and market a virtual reality headset. The venture was named Acer Starbreeze Corp. and capitalized with $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016 Acer said that it would divide its core and new businesses into two groups in order to address the diverse development needs of IT hardware products and those of cloud services, smart devices, and e-businesses. The move is to better allocate operational resources, fuel organic growth, and accelerate the company's transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acer maintains a steady pace of new product releases and the introduction of its smartphones to new markets. In 2016, it released the TravelMate X349, a loaded notebook that runs Windows 10.

  <p>
   Acer founder and chairman Stan Shih, respected enough for his business acumen to once be considered for the premiership of Taiwan, designed that country's first desktop calculator in the early 1970s. The company's precursor, Multitech International, was launched in 1976 with $25,000 by Shih and four others who called themselves the "Gardeners of Microprocessing." In 1980 Multitech introduced the Dragon Chinese-language terminal, which won Taiwan's top design award; in 1983 it introduced an Apple clone and its first
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   -compatible PC. Multitech set up AcerLand, Taiwan's first and largest franchised computer retail chain, in 1985.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name to Acer (the Latin word for "sharp, acute, able, and facile") in 1987 and went public on the Taiwan exchange the next year. Acer got into the semiconductor market in 1989 when it entered into a joint venture with
   <company id="11462">
    Texas Instruments
   </company>
   (named TI-Acer) to design and develop memory chips in Taiwan. In 1990 Acer's US subsidiary, Acer America, paid $90 million for Altos Computer Systems, a US manufacturer of UNIX systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the prosperous 1980s Acer increased its management layers and slowed the decision-making process. In late 1990 the company restructured, trimming its workforce by 8% (about 400 employees), including two-thirds of headquarters. The layoff was unprecedented -- being asked to resign from a job in Taiwan carries a social stigma. Shih wrote a letter to all those affected, explaining the plight of the company. The following year Acer began its decentralization plan to create a worldwide confederation of publicly owned companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acer suffered its first loss in 1991 on revenues of almost $1 billion, partly because of increased marketing budgets in the US and Europe and continuing investment in TI-Acer. The company bounced back in 1993, with 80% of its profit coming from that joint venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Aspire PC, available in shades of gray and green, was unveiled in 1995. In 1996 the company expanded into consumer electronics, introducing a host of new, inexpensive videodisc players, video telephones, and other devices in order to boost global market share. In 1997 Acer purchased TI's notebook computer business. A slowdown in memory chip sales, plus a financial slide at Acer America, cost the firm $141 million, but Acer finished the year in the black.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shih stepped down as president in 1998 to focus on restructuring. The company ended its venture with TI, buying TI's 33% stake and renaming the unit Acer Semiconductor Manufacturing. The company also began making information appliances, introducing a device able to play CD-ROMs via TV sets and perform other task-specific functions. Continued losses due to a highly competitive US market caused a drop in profits for 1998.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Acer sold a 30% stake in its struggling Acer Semiconductor Manufacturing affiliate to
   <company id="43493">
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
   </company>
   (TSMC completed its purchase of the remaining 70% of the business, which was renamed TSMC-Acer Semiconductor Manufacturing, the following year.) The competitive heat and the rise of under-$1,000 PCs took a toll that year when Acer cut US jobs, streamlined operations, and withdrew from the US retail market. The company intensified its focus on providing online software, hardware, and support for users, launching a digital services business and a venture capital operation to invest in promising Internet startups.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company suffered a financial blow in 2000 when large customer IBM cancelled an order for desktop computers. Late that year, after continued losses in a slowing PC market, the company announced it would cut more jobs in the US and Germany and close an unspecified number of plants worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acer saw major streamlining in 2001, when it spun off its contract manufacturing operations (renamed
   <company id="106315">
    Wistron
   </company>
   ), as well as its consumer electronics and peripherals business (renamed
   <company id="105321">
    BenQ
   </company>
   ). Slumping sales in a weakening computer hardware market prompted Acer's restructuring efforts. In addition to clarifying the structure of Acer's sizable operations, the separation of Acer's branded operations and Wistron served to eliminate possible customer concerns about a conflict of interest between the two businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 president J. T. Wang succeeded Shih as CEO. In 2007 Acer sold its electronic components distribution subsidiary, Sertek, to
   <company id="149880">
    Yosun Industrial
   </company>
   . It also acquired
   <company id="16706">
    Gateway
   </company>
   for $710 million that year. President Gianfranco Lanci took over for Wang as CEO in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   Acer acquired E-TEN, a Taiwan-based developer of smartphones, also in 2008. E-TEN markets products under its own brand and designs devices for OEMs.
