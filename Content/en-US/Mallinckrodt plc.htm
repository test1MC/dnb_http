   Mallinckrodt, spun off by
   <company id="105411">
    Covidien
   </company>
   in 2013, develops and distributes drugs for autoimmune and rare diseases in areas including neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, and pulmonology. While Covidien renews its focus on the design and manufacture of medical devices and supplies, Mallinckrodt continues to develop, manufacture, and distribute specialty drug products to wholesalers and retail pharmacies. In the US it is a top producer of bulk acetaminophen and supplier of opioid pain medications. In 2016 the firm sold its global nuclear imaging business to IBA Molecular for some $690 million. With offices across the globe, Mallinckrodt sells its goods worldwide.

  <p>
   Mallinckrodt's pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products are focused on autoimmune and rare diseases in areas including neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, and pulmonology.
  </p>
  <p>
   Until early 2017, the company operated in three segments: Specialty Brands (about half of its total sales), Specialty Generics (some 40% of sales), and Nuclear Imaging (about 10% of sales). Branded products include drugs for pain management, neonatal critical care respiratory therapeutics and immunotherapy, and biopharmaceuticals for autoimmune and rare diseases. The Specialty Generics segment produces generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Meanwhile, Nuclear Imaging makes and markets radioactive isotopes and associated pharmaceuticals. However, the company sold that segment to IBA Molecular in January 2017.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mallinckrodt has operations in the Asia/Pacific, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It has eight manufacturing locations in the US and additional sites in Canada, Ireland, and the Netherlands.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company markets its products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific. The US accounts for about 90% of its revenue.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Mallinckrodt sells its branded products to physicians through its direct sales force of more than 550 members. Its APIs are marketed through independent channels such as drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, and retail pharmacy chains. Nuclear radiopharmaceutical products are marketed to nuclear radio pharmacies in the US and to hospitals in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the company's top customers are
   <company id="54457">
    CuraScript
   </company>
   (31% of sales in fiscal 2015),
   <company id="10977">
    McKesson
   </company>
   (18%),
   <company id="12894">
    Cardinal Health
   </company>
   (14%), and
   <company id="40016">
    AmerisourceBergen
   </company>
   (9%).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   After three years of slow growth, sales shot up in fiscal 2014 and 2015. In fiscal 2015 (ended September), revenue increased 32% to $3.3 billion, largely on growth of Specialty Brands which reported its first full year of sales of the recently acquired Acthar and Ofirmev. Another recent acquisition, Inomax (which treats hypoxic respiratory failure in term and near-term infants), also led to the growth that year. In Specialty Generics, the recent acquisition of specialty contract manufacturer BioVectra contributed to the revenue growth; this was partially offset by a decline in sales of nuclear imaging products.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, net income has taken a downward turn and, in fiscal 2014, the company lost a net $319 million. This was primarily due to non-restructuring impairment charges, as well as losses related to discontinued operations. The following year, Mallinckrodt returned to the black on the absence of impairment charges; it made a net $324 million that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operating cash flow, which has been growing for a couple of years, more than doubled in fiscal 2015 to $896 million.

  <p>
   Mallinckrodt focuses on organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions to expand its product portfolio and enter new geographic markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold its global contrast media and delivery systems (CMDS) business to
   <company id="92852">
    Guerbet
   </company>
   for some $270 million. It will continue to supply certain related products under an agreement with Guerbet.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company then sold its smallest business, nuclear imaging, to IBA Molecular for $690 million in early 2017. That business had seen a decline in sales; by divesting the unit Mallinckrodt is now better able to focus on high-growth specialty pharmaceuticals.

  <p>
   In early 2016, Mallinckrodt bought a portfolio of three commercial-stage hemostatis drugs from
   <company id="101014">
    The Medicines Company
   </company>
   for a potential total consideration of $410 million. The deal included Recothrom Thrombin topical, PreveLeak Surgical Sealant, and Raplixa, and broadens Mallinckrodt's hospital portfolio. Also that year, the company acquired regenerative medicine company Stratatech Corporation, which focuses on the development of skin substitute products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired
   <company id="161753">
    Ikaria
   </company>
   in fiscal 2015 for approximately $2.3 billion. Ikaria's primary product is INOMAX for inhalation, a treatment used in neonatal critical care. It also acquired
   <company id="103992">
    Therakos
   </company>
   for some $1.3 billion, expanding its immunotherapy portfolio.

   Mallinckrodt has come a long way from its German-American origin in the mid-19th century. Acquired in years past by the likes of
   <company id="10152">
    Avon
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11516">
    Tyco International
   </company>
   , it's now an Irish company, spun off by Covidien in 2013.

  <p>
   Catering to the growing shift from traditional medicines to pharmaceutical treatments, brothers Edward, Otto, and Gustav Mallinckrodt in 1867 formed G. Mallinckrodt &amp; Company in St. Louis, the only chemical maker west of Philadelphia. In 1882 it was incorporated as Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. By 1885 the company had an office in New York City and a manufacturing facility in New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Edward's leadership, Mallinckrodt became the largest producer of anhydrous ammonia, a primary material for the refrigeration industry. In 1913 the firm introduced the first commercial barium sulfate for X-ray diagnosis. When WWI curtailed the European supply of basic drugs and chemicals, US chemists quickly filled the vacuum. Mallinckrodt became a major supplier of potassium bromide. By the early 1930s, its products included iodinated contrast media, ether, bismuth salts, and mercurials.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1940s Mallinckrodt purified all of the uranium oxide used in the world's first nuclear reactor. (The US Atomic Energy Commission made the company use food code names -- cocoa, oats, juice -- for its uranium products.) Mallinckrodt exited the uranium business in 1967.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1950s the firm developed the UROKON compound, used in kidney X-rays. Mallinckrodt went public in 1954, after which it launched iodinated X-ray contrast medium CONRAY (1962), and BAROSPERSE, a dispersed barium sulfate used for studying the intestinal tract (1963). Also in 1962 Mallinckrodt acquired therapeutic-drug maker Van Pelt and Brown, and in 1964 it bought The Calsicat Company, a manufacturer of catalysts. Further expansion activities included the acquisition of Pioneer Plastics (laboratory plasticware, 1966) and the formation of subsidiaries to make and market radiopharmaceuticals in Germany (1967) and Japan (1968).
  </p>
  <p>
   Mallinckrodt's acquisitions in the 1970s included Fries &amp; Fries (natural and synthetic flavors and fragrances), Bowers Printing Ink, Basic Foods (specialty bakery ingredients), National Catheter (catheters and other hospital disposables), and Forma Scientific (biomedical laboratory equipment).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1982 cosmetics powerhouse Avon Products bought Mallinckrodt, which was by then a leading supplier of health care products, specialty chemicals, food products, flavors, and fragrances. Four years later Avon sold Mallinckrodt to International Minerals and Chemical Corp., which later changed its name to IMCERA Group. Mallinckrodt decentralized in 1989, forming two independent companies, Mallinckrodt Medical and Mallinckrodt Specialty Chemicals. Both units expanded in the 1990s; among their acquisitions were Novatech Laboratories, a top European maker of polyurethane medical devices, and Catalyst Resources, purchased from Phillips Petroleum. In 1992 Mallinckrodt formed a joint venture with chemicals heavyweight Hercules to create Tastemaker, which became the #2 food flavors company in the US. IMCERA changed its name to Mallinckrodt in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a major repositioning, in the late 1990s Mallinckrodt began to divvy up and sell its non-health care operations. It bought Nellcor Puritan Bennett, one of the world's leading makers of oxygen monitoring and critical care ventilation products in 1998, but later decided to sell the medical gas business acquired in the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Mallinckrodt was sold to Tyco International, which was looking to further boost its Healthcare and Specialty Products group.
