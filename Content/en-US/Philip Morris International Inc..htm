   Philip Morris International (PMI) knows how to light up a room. The company makes seven of the world's top 15 tobacco brands, laying claim to more than 15% of the international cigarette market outside the US. The company's brands by sales volume are Marlboro (the world's #1-selling cigarette), L&amp;M, Bond Street, Philip Morris, Chesterfield, and Parliament. (Marlboro accounts for about a third of PMI's total shipment volume.) Top local brands include Fortune, Morven Gold, and Dji Sam Soe. PMI's portfolio spans the price spectrum with premium, mid-priced, and value-priced products. Formerly part of

    Altria
   </company>
   , PMI has grown through acquisitions and alliances with cigarette and smokeless tobacco makers.

  <p>
   The company operates four segments according to the company's top geographic markets. PMI's European Union segment generated more than 35% of PMI's total revenue during 2015, while the Eastern Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA) segment made up another 25%. Asia made up more than 25% of revenue, while Latin America and Canada brought in the remainder.PMI's international brands made up 73% of its shipment volume during 2015, while the Marlboro brand made up 34%. PMI's other tobacco products (OTP) primarily include tobacco for roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars, and cigarillos.
  </p>
  <p>
   The cigarette maker's largest factories are based in Argentina, Czech Republic, Germany, Indonesia, Lithuania, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Turkey. It also maintains contract manufacturing relationships with more than 20 third-party manufacturers in 20-plus markets. In addition, the company manufactures its hand-rolled cigarettes through 38 third-party operators in Indonesia. In 2015, PMI's 24 facilities each manufactured more than 10 billion cigarettes, while six produced more than 30 billion units.

  <p>
   New York-based PMI's products are sold in more than 180 markets worldwide. The European Union and the EMEA region are its largest markets, together accounting for more than 60% of sales. PMI operates nearly 50 manufacturing facilities located in Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   PMI products are marketed and promoted through several channels including: point of sale communications, brand events, access-restricted Web sites, print and direct communication to verified adult smokers (via mail, e-mail and other electronic communication tools). The company spent $448 million on advertising in 2015, up from $439 million and $435 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   PMI distributes its products directly to retailers, single independent distributors, Zonified distribution, and national or regional wholesalers. The company also directly supplies key accounts, which include gas stations, retail chains, and supermarkets.

  <p>
   PMI's annual revenues and profits have been in steady decline over the past few years due to heightened regulations on tobacco products and consumers becoming more health conscious.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue fell 8% to $73.91 billion during 2015 mostly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and price increases, which led to double-digit sales declines in European Union and the EEMA regions and small sales declines in the Latin America &amp; Canada and Asia regions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales declines in 2015 caused PMI's net income to plunge 8% to $6.87 billion. The cigarette maker's operating cash levels rose 2% to $7.9 billion after adjusting its earnings for unfavorable currency exchanges and thanks to favorable changes in working capital.

   With traditional cigarette sales being threatened as the world becomes more health conscious, Philip Morris International has partnered with its former parent,
   <company id="11179">
    Altria Group
   </company>
   , to transition its product commercialization toward more reduced-risk products, such as e-cigarettes. PMI recently launched its smokeless IQOS system (a hybrid between analog and e-cigs) in Kiev, Ukraine with plans to launch the product in 20 more markets through 2016. The company introduced IQOS to customers in Japan, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, and Switzerland during 2015. In 2014, the company agreed to market Altria's e-vapor products internationally through a strategic licensing and distribution agreement. In exchange, Altria agreed to market two of PMI's heated tobacco products in the US. In mid-2014, PMI acquired the UK-based Nicocigs Limited to help expand its e-cig product line further.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, PMI competes for smokers' loyalty with the international tobacco giants

    British American Tobacco

   ,
   <company id="52399">
    Imperial Brands

   , and
   <company id="52305">
    Japan Tobacco
   </company>
   , several regional and local tobacco companies, and also state-owned companies in Algeria, Egypt, and several Asian countries, by offering a range of premium, mid-price, and low-price brands. Its American blend cigarettes, Marlboro, L&amp;M, and Chesterfield are its most popular brands, with the Marlboro brand alone making up 34% of the company's 2015 shipment volume. Indeed, by the end of 2015, PMI boasted at least 15% market share in 103 of its markets, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Thailand, among others.

  <p>
   To turn around its slowly declining profit situation, the company has also pursued a number of cost cutting measures in recent years to streamline operations and boost margins. During 2014, the company spent roughly $300 million on productivity and cost savings initiatives designed to enhance production processes, harmonize tobacco blends, streamline product specifications and brand variants, provide supply chain improvements, and improve spending efficiency. To this end, in 2014 the company made several production-boosting moves, including: changing its buying model and purchasing tobacco directly through contracts with US growers through two suppliers (

    Alliance One International
   </company>
   and
   <company id="11564">
    Universal Corporation
   </company>
   ), which created better supply chain efficiency; restructuring its business in Egypt to enhance profitability and growth in North African and Middle Eastern markets; ceasing and transitioning its costly cigarette manufacturing operations in Australia to an affiliate in Korea; and closing a factory in Canada.

   In June 2014, PMI purchased UK-based e-vapor company Nicocigs Limited for $103 million.

   PMI is a result of a spinoff from Altria in 2008. The separation positioned PMI as an independent publicly traded company, free from its US branch
   <company id="55933">
    Philip Morris USA
   </company>
   . Altria simultaneously avoided an entanglement in various US legal and regulatory issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   PMI has made a number of acquisitions to enhance its brand-rich portfolio and geographic presence. In mid-2011 PMI took over a cigarette manufacturer in Jordan. The purchase followed PMI's acquisition of a cigar business, comprising trademarks in Australia and New Zealand. During 2011 PMI also revised its joint venture with Vietnam National Tobacco Corp. (Vinataba) in Vietnam, opening the door to licensing the Marlboro label as PMI established a local branch to build its brands.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009, PMI acquired the South African tobacco branch of
   <company id="51536">
    Swedish Match
   </company>
   for 1.93 billion ZAR (about $256 million), giving PMI a leg up in producing smokeless tobacco products and builds upon a joint venture between PMI and Swedish Match to market Swedish style snus and other smokeless tobacco lines outside of Scandinavia and the US. (Altria moved to dominate the rapidly rising niche by taking over
   <company id="11533">
    UST
   </company>
   , a leader in the US market for smokeless products, including the Copenhagen, Husky, and Skoal brands.) In the same month PMI purchased the Petterøes tobacco business for $209 million, pocketing fine-cut brands popular in Sweden and Norway.
