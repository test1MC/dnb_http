   Aptalis Pharma knows its ABCs when it comes to treating CF and GI ailments. The company develops and sells drugs mainly to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) and gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Its Urso line treats liver disease; Carafate and Sulcrate treat ulcers; and Canasa and Salofalk offer relief for inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Aptalis Pharma markets Zenpep and other digestive drugs for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition associated with CF. The firm's products are primarily sold in North America and the European Union. Aptalis Pharma was a subsidiary of Axcan Holdings, which is controlled by
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   , but it was acquired by
   <company id="11951">
    Forest Labs
   </company>
   in 2014.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Change in Company Type.flsnp" />
        <p>
   In early 2014 Aptalis accepted a purchase offer of $3 billion from US specialty pharma company Forest Laboratories. Forest sought the deal to diversify, and to realize an estimated boost of $700 million in revenue. For Aptalis, which reported revenue of $688 million in 2013, the deal fills the coffers and give it access to cash needed for drug acquisitions and development.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Aptalis Pharma has operating locations in the US and Canada, including offices in Birmingham, Alabama; Bridgewater, New Jersey; Vandalia, Ohio; and Yardley, Pennsylvania. It operates manufacturing plants in the US, Canada, and Europe (though it outsources the manufacturing of some products).
  </p>
        <p>
   Customers in the US account for about three-fourths of sales; the company also markets its offerings in other countries in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region.

        <p>
   Aptalis uses its proprietary technology platforms to formulate and develop its pharmaceuticals. Its platforms include custom release profiles, taste-masking formulations, orally disintegrating tablets, and bioavailability enhancement of drugs with poor solubility.  Altogether, the company markets more than 40 products in various dosage strengths to customers around the world.

        <p>
   The company markets its products mainly to gastroenterologists and other specialists, using an inside sales force in North America (which accounts for the majority of its sales) and some markets in Europe. Aptalis Pharma uses a network of distributors to dispense its drugs to other export markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   In the US, drug wholesalers and large pharmaceutical chains are the company's primary customers. In Canada, it sells to hospitals and wholesale drug companies.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Aptalis has seen a 15% rate of annual compound growth over the last decade.

        <p>
   The company is focused on increasing sales of existing drugs through distribution, sales, partnership, and geographic expansion efforts. In addition, Aptalis Pharma adds new drugs to its portfolio by developing its own proprietary drug candidates, as well as by acquiring or licensing new medications. Areas of research and development include bowel, liver, and pancreatic disorders. New product launches include the introduction of Pylera, a medication for ulcer disease patients experiencing
   <em>
    H. pylori
   </em>
   bacterial infections, during 2012. The company also licensed rights to market anal fissure-related pain medication Rectiv from
   <company id="134881">
    ProStrakan Group
   </company>
   in 2012.
  </p>
        <p>
   On the flipside of its growth strategies, the company also occasionally sells products that fall outside of its core therapeutic areas or that are experiencing unsatisfactory sales results. For instance, in 2011 Aptalis Pharma sold off the global rights to Photofrin and Photobarr, two photodynamic drugs (activated by light) used in the treatment of certain cancers, to Pinnacle Biologics after experiencing a lower demand for the drugs.
  </p>
        <p>
   Formerly named Axcan Intermediate Holdings, the company changed its name following the 2011 acquisition and integration of specialty pharmaceuticals firm
   <company id="156720">
    Eurand
   </company>
   . The acquisition of Eurand (and its Zenpep product offering) came after Aptalis Pharma had to stop marketing its own exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treatments, Ultrase and Viokase, in 2010 after the FDA reclassified the drugs. The company gained approval to relaunch the drugs (now known as Viokace and Ultresa) in 2012.
  </p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The company completed its purchase of specialty drug firm Eurand for about $583 million in 2011, adding research-stage and commercialized products (including Zenpep) for CF and GI diseases. It also added Eurand's SourceCF unit, which developed and marketed multivitamin products for use by patients with CF.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a move to further expand its line of CF-related treatments, in 2011 Aptalis acquired Mpex Pharmaceuticals -- or more specifically, its lead CF development candidate Aeroquin. However, in an intricate do-si-do, the rest of the Mpex assets (facility, staff) were spun off into a new company called Rempex which then resumed the clinical development of Aeroquin in collaboration with Aptalis. Aeroquin is an aerosol formulation of the antibiotic levofloxacin, in development to treat pulmonary infections in patients with CF.
