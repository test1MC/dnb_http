   Amidst the wash of manufacturers marketing their concern for the environment, True Textiles is pushing its expertise in eco-friendly textile engineering. The company purchases energy from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, landfill gas, biomass, and hydroelectric, to power its mill production.
  </p>
  <p>
   Operations are guided by objectives for zero waste, zero harmful emissions, and efficient transportation. Targeting consumers looking to make a difference with their purchases, the company's Terratex brand fabrics are made from recycled polyester or renewable materials (such as corn derivatives).
