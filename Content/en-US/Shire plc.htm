   Shire is one of the world's largest specialty biopharmaceutical companies. It operates through one operating segment and deals in specialty pharmaceuticals, human genetic therapies, and regenerative medicine. Shire's drug roster includes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatments Vyvanse and Adderall XR, ulcerative colitis drugs Pentasa and Lialda and HAE treatments Cinryze and Firazyr. The company's rare disease drugs include Elaprase and Replagal. Shire does most of its business in North America. In a blockbuster merger deal, Shire acquired US-based
   <company id="163373">
    Baxalta
   </company>
   for $32 billion in mid-2016.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Shire operates one reportable segment, which it terms One Shire. One Shire is supported by three functions: Pipeline, which develops products and conducts pre-clinical trials in rare diseases; Technical Operations, which looks after the global supply chain; and a marketing function that focuses on hereditary angioedema, neuroscience and gastrointestinal medicine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire's top selling drug is ADHD medication Vyvanse, accounting for around 27% of annual revenue, and its other best sellers are Liada (ulcerative colitis), Cinryze and Firazyr (HAE treatments) and Elphrase (Hunter syndrome). The five combined make around 62% of revenue. Its other medications treat neurological and gastrointestinal conditions, as well as genetic diseases like Gaucher disease (Vpriv).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates an R&amp;D division, which researches neuroscience, GI/metabolic diseases, renal/fibrotic diseases and ophthalmic diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Geographic Reach
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the majority of its sales are made in the US (about 70%), the company is intent upon becoming geographically diverse through additional development and commercialization programs, especially in Europe. It has direct operations in about 50 countries, including major operating facilities in Ireland, Switzerland, the UK, and the US and branch locations in Canada and other countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and South America. Products are sold in more than 72 countries around the globe.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales and Marketing
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has an established sales and marketing infrastructure in Canada, the UK, and the US, as well as several other Western European nations, and makes use of sales forces that target specialist physicians. It sells some of its products in other countries through distributors. In addition to sales of its proprietary drugs, Shire receives revenue in the form of royalties (to a sum of 5% of total revenue) on products licensed to other drugmakers such as
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   . Shire also occasionally enters co-marketing agreements with other drugmakers. Major customers include drug wholesalers

    AmerisourceBergen Corp
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="104517">
    Cardinal Health

   and

  <p>
   Financial Performance
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire's revenues increased 7% in 2015 to $6.4 billion. Top-selling Vyvanse grew nearly 20% on prior year and felt the benefit of price increases and 8% prescription growth in the US. HAE treatments Cinryze and Firazyr also grew strongly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell 62% in 2015 on prior year to $1.3 billion. This sharp fall is explained by extraordinary items in 2014 relating to the terminated takeover by
   <company id="162908">
    AbbVie
   </company>
   that brought a gain of $1.6 billion, and a settlement with the Canadian revenue authorities worth $400 million. For these same reasons, cash flow from operating activities was down 45% to $2.3 billion in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategy
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire has taken steps since 2014 to re-focus as a rare diseases specialist. To this end it has consolidated its three legacy operating segments into one segment. Part of this involved shutting down operations that showed inadequate growth trajectories, and job losses hit the R&amp;D operation in the UK particularly hard.
  </p>
  <p>
   Significantly in 2016, Shire acquired
   <company id="163373">
    Baxalta
   </company>
   , a biopharmaceuticals company specializing in haemophilia treatment, for $32 billion. Shire hopes the acquisition will strengthen its position in the rare diseases market, and the combined company will have the added benefits of a lower tax rate, as well as being more difficult to buy out by larger companies (in 2014 Shire weathered a takeover attempt by AbbVie. This acquisition should help the company reach its 2020 revenue goals of $10 billion; in fact, Shire expects to be earning $20 billion annually by that time. The addition of Baxalta also immediately boosts its rare disease earnings to some 65% of total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire continues to expand its geographic reach, especially as its existing US treatments begin to face generic competition. Partnerships and acquisitions are also key contributors to Shire's growth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mergers and Acquisitions
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire is a highly acquisitive firm. The acquisition of Baxalta for $32 billion in 2016 was the biggest in Shire's history, and is hoped to bolster its rare diseases offering. In addition, the company has made other large acquisitions that play into the company's strategy to strengthen in the rare diseases market. These include Gattex/Restive maker
   <company id="20068">
    NPS Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   ($5.2 billion, 2015),
   <company id="56497">
    Dyax
   </company>
   ($5.9 billion, 2015) which makes angioedema treatment Kalbitor, and
   <company id="105796">
    Meritage
   </company>
   (up to $245 million, 2015), which produces eosinophilic esophagitis treatments.

  <p>
   In 1986 veterans from established drug firms founded Shire Pharmaceuticals to target niche markets. An early project was marketing calcium supplements for osteoporosis. Shire went public in 1987 and started to pursue its trademark strategy: finding new applications for existing compounds. One of its first drug candidates was a memory-enhancing chemical derived from daffodil bulbs. Together with
   <company id="10824">
    Johnson &amp; Johnson
   </company>
   , Shire developed it into galantamine, one of the first drugs to combat the mind-blurring effects of Alzheimer's disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire expanded into ADHD treatments in 1988 with its purchase of Richwood Pharmaceuticals. With Richwood came the rights to Adderall, which had been previously marketed as an obesity drug under the name Obetrol.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marketing man Rolf Stahel joined Shire as CEO in 1996 and directed the company's focus toward making drugs targeted to specialized markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company introduced Carbatrol, a controlled-release epilepsy treatment reformulated from an existing drug; galantamine continued Phase III FDA trials. Later that year shockwaves rocked Shire's ADHD operations as an explosion destroyed a third-party plant that supplied Shire with ingredients for Adderall. Shire's stock dropped as the company announced it might not be able to keep up with demand for the drug, but Shire later arranged for
   <company id="91087">
    Boehringer Ingelheim
   </company>
   to take over production of the ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Lambda drug for kidney ailments joined galantamine in Phase III trials in 1999. Later that year Shire found its match in another niche drug-maker,
   <company id="15195">
    Roberts Pharmaceutical
   </company>
   , and acquired the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company launched new subsidiary Shire Pharmaceuticals Ib√©rica, marking the drug-maker's move into Spain, and bought Canada's BioChem Pharma. The following year Shire launched a once-a-day version of its ADHD treatment, called Adderall XR. Meanwhile, its Alzheimer's drug galantamine, since dubbed Reminyl, received FDA approval. (J&amp;J markets the drug in the US.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Shire sold its portfolio of over-the-counter drugs, which it had acquired with Roberts Pharmaceutical, in 2002.
   <company id="60941">
    Purdue Pharma
   </company>
   bought the drugs for about $70 million.
