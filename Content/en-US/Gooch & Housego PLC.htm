   Business at Gooch &amp; Housego (G&amp;H) requires a touch of light, it not a light touch. The company's products are designed primarily for use in light measurement instrumentation and crystal manufacturing. It makes precision optics, such as coatings, lenses, and prisms. G&amp;H was founded in 1948 to make precision glass and crystalline materials. G&amp;H also offers acousto-optic devices, such as frequency shifters, tunable filters, and fiber-coupled modulator. The company does much of its business in North America.

  <p>
   The industrial business segment is G&amp;H's biggest money maker, accounting for 59% of revenue. The unit makes lasers for the semiconductor and microelectronic industries and metrology and telecommunications.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Aerospace and Defense unit brings in a quarter of the company's revenue. It transfers fiber optic and semiconductor laser technology to uses in defense applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   G&amp;H's Life Sciences division products, 11% of revenue include Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for retinal imaging to detect glaucoma and macular degeneration, and laser surgery, prostate surgery, scar correction, and cataract surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Scientific Research segment, which covers academic and government funded research, accounts for 5% of sales.

  <p>
   In 2015 increased 12% compared to 2014 on higher life science sales, up 22%. The unit benefited from sales of electro-optic products for the laser surgery market and of fiber optic assemblies for OCT. Revenue retreated in the Scientific Research unit because of softness in the general research market
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue increase helped drive net income 38% higher in 2015 from 2014.

  <p>
   G&amp;H is moving and expanding its Silicon Valley location, its base for acousto-optic R&amp;D, design and device manufacture. It moves from Palo Alto to a Fremont that's 50% larger. The space can accommodate customer growth and absorb operations from G&amp;H's closed Melbourne, Florida facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Cleveland, G&amp;H is significantly renovating its electro-optic device and crystal-based precision optics manufacturing plant. The renovation is to improve process flow and product quality (using Lean manufacturing and continuous improvement techniques), as well as increase capacity.
