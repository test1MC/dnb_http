   Starched shirts and starchy foods are only the beginning at Roquette Frères. The company specializes in taking corn, wheat, potatoes, and peas apart into their macromolecular bits. The resulting starches and sugars are then turned into more than 700  industrial ingredients for use in the food, pharmaceutical, paper, textile, animal feed, chemicals, plastics, and fermentation industries. The firm is the world's largest producer of the artificial sweetener sorbitol, but it also has time to make dextrose, maltitol, maltose, and xylitol. Its starches thicken up toothpaste and cardboard, and its sugar substitutes help deliver drugs. Family-owned Roquette has operations in about a dozen countries around the world.

  <p>
   Altogether, Roquette makes more than 650 products from its four raw materials -- corn, wheat, potatoes, and peas. Its products fall into one of five categories -- native starches and proteins, physically and chemically modified starches, hydrolysed and isomerised products, hygrogenated products, and fermentation process derivatives and fine chemicals. Half of all the company's products are used by the food industry. It divides its operations into two divisions: plant-based chemistry and food, nutrition, and health.
  </p>
  <p>
   Every year Roquette processes tens of thousands of tons of peas, a small amount compared to its other raw materials -- 3.3 million tons of corn, 1.7 million tons of wheat, and 1 million tons of potatoes.

   Next up in the company's research and development pipeline is new uses for microalgae (single-celled algae) in the health and nutrition industry. A common example of microalgae is the dietary supplement spirulina. To strengthen its efforts in this sector, Roquette bought Bioprodukte Steinberg (BPS), a German producer of chlorella and the owner of the world's largest freshwater photobioreactor. In 2014 it introduced industrial microalgae production at its Lestrem, France plant.

  <p>
   Roquette Frères was founded by two brothers ("brother" in French is "frère"). Dominique and Germain Roquette were grain traders who opened a potato starch plant in 1933 following WWI.
