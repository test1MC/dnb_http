   Buckman Laboratories International defends the world against tiny invaders. The global specialty chemicals manufacturer originated as a producer of chemicals that control the growth of microorganisms such as mold and fungi. Today the company's more than 5,000 products are key to aqueous industrial processes used in manufacturing and treating pulp and paper, leather, paint, coatings, plastics, and wood. They include bactericides, chemical intermediates, coagulants, corrosion inhibitors, defoamers, dispersants, flocculants, microbicides, polymers, and scale inhibitors. The family of founder Stanley Buckman owns the company through Bulab Holdings.

  <p>
   Parent Bulab reported double­-digit growth in Asia in 2012 and strong growth in the US (where it took additional market share in the pulp and paper market). Europe's double­ dip recession was a drag on revenues. Canada also experienced slowdowns and closures, particularly in the pulp and paper industry.

  <p>
   Innovation is a key strategic asset for the company which each year introduces as many as 12 new products globally and several others on a local level.
  </p>
  <p>
   To strengthen its value to customers, in 2012 Buckman launched Buckman On­Site, a secure portal that offers system status monitoring and document management.
  </p>
  <p>
   Buckman sees the establishment of its environmental credentials as also benefiting its bottom line. It has been focusing on its environmental and social sustainability performance, reducing its total carbon emissions and water and energy usage since 2000. The company seeks to cut its 2010 usage rates by 15% in five years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the company's strategies is a Continuous Improvement initiative (CI), which it has implemented to assess business tasks and functions to determine which ones have added real customer value.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   The company was founded in 1945 by Stanley Buckman.
