   Interface provides a soft place to land. The company is a leading global producer and seller of modular carpet. The tiles and rolls, used in offices and many institutional facilities, are sold under brand names Interface, Heuga, and
   <company id="119131">
    FLOR
   </company>
   . Interface's other offerings include an antimicrobial chemical, Intersept, which it blends in its carpet as well as licenses for use in air filters, and the TacTiles carpet tile installation system. Core markets are the Americas, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific region; the Americas represent more than 50% of sales.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is based in Atlanta and has manufactures carpet at two locations in the US and at facilities in the Netherlands, the UK, Thailand, China, and Australia. Interface has marketing offices in over 70 locations in over 30 countries and distribution facilities in 40 locations in six countries.
  </p>

  <p>
   Interface distributes its products through direct sales to end users. Its indirect sales are sold through independent contractors or distributors. In each case, the company targets architects, engineers, interior designers, contracting firms, and other specifiers who influence purchasing decisions.

  <p>
   Interface's revenues remained consistent the last two years, hovering around the $1 billion mark for both 2014 and 2015. The flat revenue for 2015 was mainly fueled by the significant devaluation of foreign currencies against the US dollar. On a geographic basis, Interface experienced a sales increase in the Americas of 3% and decreases in Europe of 5% and Asia-Pacific of 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its net income, however, has fluctuated wildly; after declining in 2014, net income skyrocketed by more than 190% to peak at $72 million in 2015. The explosive growth in net income was due to the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges and debt retirement expenses in conjunction with a decrease in interest expenses.

  <p>
   Interface plans to expand its modular carpet presence from primarily corporate office spaces to non-office settings, such as government, hospitality, education, retail, and healthcare. In 2015 Interface's non-corporate office modular carpet segment represented 56% of sales compared with 44% for corporate office sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Capacity to provide digital samples and quick turnaround has enabled Interface to target demand for customized products as well as minimize inventory levels; some 60% to 85% of modular carpet for the US and Asia/Pacific markets are made-to-order, and the company is ramping up its made-to-order production in Europe as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interface is also aiming to extend its manufacturing and marketing footprint into developing regions, such as China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Middle East. It has successfully established manufacturing operations on four continents (in the US, UK, and Netherlands, Australia, and Thailand), supported by a global sales and marketing force.

  <p>
   In 1973 textile maker
   <company id="40317">
    Milliken &amp; Company
   </company>
   sent employee Ray Anderson (1934-2011) overseas to study fabrication of carpet tiles. Seeing potential in fusion-bonded carpet tiles made by the UK firm Carpets International (CI), he returned to the US and started Carpets International of Georgia (CI-Georgia), a joint venture with CI. Growth in the US white-collar job market in the late 1970s caused a huge demand for easily installed office furnishings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stiff competition from the UK in the 1980s was offset by an increase in domestic sales of an innovative carpet tile that could be installed without glue. In 1982 CI-Georgia bought 10% of CI's equity in the joint venture. The company changed its name to Interface Flooring Systems and went public the next year.
