   TreeCon is trying to turn over a new leaf. Previously known as Overhill Corporation (and Polyphase before that), the company was created when Overhill spun off its
   <company id="106623">
    Overhill Farms
   </company>
   frozen food subsidiary in October 2002. TreeCon's Texas Timberjack subsidiary makes logging machines that cut timber (shears), stack logs onto trucks (loaders), and transport logs out of the forest and onto loaders (skidders). The company primarily serves East Texas and western Louisiana. It is also involved in sawmill operations and the sale of lumber products. In addition, its Texas Timberjack subsidiary also leases and finances industrial farming equipment.
Aptly named Polyphase has been through many phases, from

   magazine's fastest-growing company one year to a heavy loss and a period of halted trading the next. The Addison, Texas-based company operates through three subsidiaries: Food processing group Overhill Farms (about 65% of sales) produces frozen entrees and other foods for the airline, food service, health care, and retail industries; its forestry group, Texas Timberjack, distributes, leases, and finances timber and logging equipment; and Polyphase Instrument, its transformer segment, makes power and communications transformers. Harold Estes, president of Texas Timberjack, owns about 25% of Polyphase.
