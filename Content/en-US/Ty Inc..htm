   Take some fabric, shape it like an animal, fill it with plastic pellets, and you've got a big business that later funds the purchase of luxury hotels. That's the lesson taught by Ty Warner, sole owner of Ty Inc., the company behind Beanie Babies and their worldwide cult following. Since 1993 Ty has produced more than 370 different Beanie Babies with colorful names such as Feder Bear (current) and Cheeks the baboon (retired). Other products include Beanie Buddies (bigger versions of traditional Beanies), Ty Classics (stuffed animals), Ty Girlz (cloth dolls), and Bow Wow Beanies (pet toys). Beanie money enabled Warner to buy a half-dozen luxury hotels (mostly in New York and California).

  <p>
   Ty Warner, the son of a plush-toy salesman, started his toy career selling stuffed animals to specialty shops for stuffed-bear manufacturer Dakin. Warner left Dakin in 1980, moved to Europe for a few years, and in the mid-1980s returned to the US and founded Ty Inc. The company first designed a line of understuffed Himalayan cats.
  </p>
  <p>
   Beanie Babies first debuted at a 1993 trade show. In January 1994 the first nine Beanies went on sale -- at prices low enough for kids to afford -- in Chicago specialty stores. As Warner had learned at Dakin, selling stuffed animals through specialty retailers rather than through mass merchandisers meant bigger profits for suppliers and longer-term popularity. By 1995 there were about 30 different Beanies, and Ty's estimated sales were $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   The popularity of Beanies exploded in 1996, first in the Midwest, then along the East Coast, and then across the US. By midyear, Beanies -- and the public's mania for getting them before they sold out -- were receiving widespread media coverage. Ty heightened the frenzy among collectors when it started announcing Beanie retirements on its Web site in 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year, McDonald's got on the bandwagon: The fast-food giant issued some 100 million "teenie" Beanie Babies in a Happy Meal promotion. McDonald's ran out of the toys and had to end the promotion early, causing a public relations mess. McDonald's doubled its toy order in 1998 and teamed up with Ty again in 1999 and 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Warner paid $10 million for a 7% stake in marketing company Cyrk. In return, Cyrk developed the Beanie Babies Official Club, which turned stores that sell Beanies into "official headquarters" offering club membership kits. Ty introduced its Attic Treasures and Beanie Buddies lines that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   By spring 1998 Beanies had become a customs issue at the Canadian border, where Ty's limit of one imported Beanie per person into the US resulted in tears and fisticuffs. (The company later raised the personal limit to 30.) That summer the crowds at Major League Baseball games featuring Beanie giveaways were 26% bigger than average.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warner bought the Four Seasons hotel in New York City in 1999. He also provided auditing documents and correspondence to
   <i>
    The New York Post
   </i>
   indicating that Ty had 1998 profits of more than $700 million -- more than

   </company>
   and
   <company id="10966">
    Mattel
   </company>
   combined.
  </p>
  <p>
   After an August 1999 announcement that it would retire the Beanies at the end of the year, the company held a New Year's vote to determine their fate. In the most shocking outcome since
   <i>
    Rocky IV,
   </i>
   the public voted overwhelmingly in favor of continuing the Beanies. Ty introduced its humanoid Beanie Kids line in early 2000. Later that year Warner bought the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel and the San Ysidro Ranch -- the hostelry where JFK and Jackie honeymooned; both are near Santa Barbara, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Ty debuted its pre-teen Beanie Boppers (boy and girl dolls designed for kids from 8 to 12 years of age). To round out his Four Seasons Hotels and Coral Casino properties in California, in 2003 Warner purchased nearby Sandpiper Golf Course. Also that year, the Beanie Baby celebrated its 10th anniversary, and Ty marked the event with the introduction of the Decade Beanie Baby.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company introduced Beanie Babies 2.0, plush animals that come with codes to an online world where owners can interact with other Beanie owners.
