   Just ask Cantel Medical -- cleanliness is second to nothing when it comes to medical and scientific equipment. Through its subsidiaries, the firm sells infection prevention and control products to hospitals, dentists, drug makers, researchers, and others in the US and abroad in the field of health care. Its diverse offerings include medical device reprocessing systems and disinfectants for dialyzers and endoscopes, water purification equipment, masks and bibs used in dental offices, and therapeutic filtration systems. Fast-growing Cantel Medical employs an active acquisition strategy.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cantel Medical's major subsidiaries include: Mar Con Purification (water filtration and purification); Medivators (disposables, disinfection, sterilization); Crosstex (infection control and prevention); and Saf-T-Pak (packaging, medical shipping systems). International units include Cantel Medical (UK), Cantel Medical Asia/Pacific, Cantel Medical Devices (China), Biolab Equipment, Medivators, and Cantel Medical (Italy).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates through four segments: Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration, Healthcare Disposables, and Dialysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Endoscopy products include medical device reprocessing systems, disinfectants, detergents, and other supplies for disinfection. The segment also provides technical maintenance services. Endoscopy is Cantel Medical's largest segment, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Water Purification and Filtration offerings include filtration and separation products, disinfectants, and sterilization and decontamination products for the medical, biotech, pharmaceutical, beverage, and commercial industrial industries. That segment accounts for about a quarter of total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, Healthcare Disposable offers single-use products such as face masks, sterilization pouches, towels and bibs, tray covers, saliva ejectors, wipes, and disinfectants, as well as products for maintaining safe dental unit waterlines. Healthcare Disposables contributes about 15% of Cantel's total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   The smallest segment, Dialysis (about 5% of sales) provides medical device reprocessing systems, sterilants and disinfectants, dialysate concentrates, and other supplies used in renal dialysis.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cantel Medical rings up about 80% of its sales in the US. Foreign markets include Canada, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South America, and the Asia/Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cantel's customers include diagnostic, clinical, and university laboratories; pharma and biotech companies; US and Canadian government agencies; hospitals; and medical research facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the US, the company uses its own sales force to market its products; in international markets it employs independent distribution companies
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended July), Cantel Medical spent $3.3 million on advertising, in line with what it spent in 2015 and up from the $2.7 million it spent in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cantel Medical's revenues and net income have been steadily rising for the past five years. In fiscal 2016 (ended July), revenue rose 18% to $664.8 million as organic product sales and service income increased. Growing demand in the endoscopy market was a primary driver of the higher sales; additionally, in the health care disposables business, the company's profits increased as Cantel sold more higher margin product and demand for its products grew in response to the Ebola virus. Overall, net income rose 25% to $60 million, thanks to the higher revenue but partially offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses (including growth initiatives).

  <p>
   Cantel Medical intends to double its sales and profits within the next five years. It has seen strong growth in its endoscopy and healthcare disposables businesses, thanks partly to acquisitions of other firms that have added to its product portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has grown and diversified by employing an active acquisition strategy. It targets companies in the infection prevention and control market, health care disposable products, and water purification and filtration markets, among others. More recently, Cantel has focused on endoscopy, its largest segment. It supplements acquisitions with occasional product launches, such as the recently introduced SECURE FIT earloop face mask.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company sold its specialty packaging business, a non-core operation.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Cantel Medical's biggest purchase of late was the 2015 purchase of Medical Innovations Group for $79.5 million. That acquisition expanded Cantel's endoscopy infection prevention product line.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2016 Cantel bought the Sterility Assurance Monitoring Products division of North American Science Associates for $13.5 million. That unit makes biological and chemical indicators to monitor sterilization effectiveness for the industrial market, and the deal gave Cantel entry into a new end-market for its health care disposables business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year, the company bought certain assets of Vantage to expand distribution and sales of its Medivators endoscopy products in Canada, one of its largest non-US markets. It then acquired Accutron, a private manufacturer of nitrous oxide conscious sedation equipment and single-use nasal masks for use in dental procedures. That $52.5 million deal further broadened the health care disposables portfolio and created opportunities for cross-selling existing products.
