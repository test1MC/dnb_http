   Even if Goodman Fielder cleans out half its pantry, it'll still be well stocked for any meal. Australia's largest food company, its offerings include consumer brands such as Leaning Tower frozen pizza, Meadow Fresh milk, White Wings cake mixes, and Praise salad dressings. The company also caters to the foodservice market with a platter of products, including oils, condiments, cheeses, and desserts. Its Country Life, Edmonds, Nature's Fresh, and Pampas units make it the largest baker of breads and pastries in Australia and New Zealand. National Nominees Limited owns 22% of the company, J. P. Morgan Nominees Australia Limited owns 19%, and HSBC Custody Nominees (Australia) Limited owns 17%.

   Three companies -- a miller, a baker, and a margarine maker -- merged in 1986 to create Goodman Fielder. Fielder Gillespie Davis, which initiated the merger, brought cake mixes, animal feeds, and ingredients to the table. The Goodman Group had risen from a New Zealand bakery cooperative-turned-corporation to include margarine, animal feeds, and farm products. Australian flour, cake mix, bread, and margarine maker Allied Mills was the smallest player and chose to merge with dignity rather than be swallowed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company trimmed some margarine brands to satisfy the government and began divesting itself of several Asian and European businesses. It was briefly merged with Australian food maker Watties during the late 1980s. During the early 1990s a revolving door led in and out of Goodman Fielder's executive offices -- the company went through three CEOs in four years until snack food veteran David Hearn was named CEO in 1995. Hearn set about turning the company around slowly, selling off noncore businesses and acquiring a string of food and ingredients companies throughout the late 1990s.

   In 1998 the company took over
   <company id="11977">

   </company>
   's share of a gelatin business joint venture -- including the world's largest gelatin plant -- hoping to thicken up its ingredients unit, but worldwide oversupply turned profits runny. Also that year it sold off its half of Dynagel (US, ingredients) to the other shareholder, Germany's DGF Stoess.

   During 1999 the company's acquisitions of Bunge's Defiance baking operations and Ernest Adams -- New Zealand's biggest baker -- helped reshape the baking and milling industries. However, the company was still dogged with weak performers, and during 2000 it saw another ingredients business, Starch Australia, sold to

    Penford Corporation
   </company>
   , a US-based starch company, for more than $54 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company began reorganizing its divisions, merging its big brands, Uncle Tobys and Meadow Lea, and separating its milling operations from its retail baking businesses. Around the same time a buyout offer from an investment banker was rejected for being too low. Continuing to unload its food ingredients businesses, Goodman Fielder worked to complete the sale of its US gelatin business, Leiner Davis, to DGF Stoess and prepared its US dairy ingredients business, Germantown, for future sale. In 2002 sold its flour milling and mixing business to a joint venture named Allied Mills made up of GrainCorp and

   's unsolicited takeover bid (at $1.85 per share and worth more than $2 billion) was rejected by Goodman in early 2003. Goodman subsequently considered other unnamed companies for a takeover but rejected them as not being a tax-efficient move. However, in April 2003 Burns Philp acquired 95% of Goodman's voting power and took over the company. Goodman's CEO and board member Tom Park, along with Chairman Jon Peterson and one other board member, immediately stepped down from their positions. Burns Philp closed eight Goodman bakeries in 2003. The next year saw Goodman acquiring Nature's Oven Limited and selling its yeast business.

   The year of its spin-off (2005) saw the company retaining ownership of The Uncle Tobys Company and Bluebird Foods. It acquired New Zealand Dairy Foods that year as well. In 2006 it acquired Country Life Bakery.
  </p>

   Goodman Fielder saw shifts in its top management beginning in late 2010, when CFO David Goldsmith departed; CEO Peter Margin stepped down in early 2011.
