   AutoGenomics maps out molecules to drive the diagnosis of disease. The company developed a genetic testing system called INFINITI that scans patient samples for genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer, as well as for pharmacogenomics (a patient's genetic likeliness to have an adverse reaction to a drug). The INFINITI system has about 50 compatible diagnostic assays that are approved for research laboratory use, as well as a handful of genetic tests approved by the FDA for commercial use by hospital and clinical labs. The firm has additional tests under development, some through collaborations with research firms. AutoGenomics was founded in 1999 as Neuron Technologies.

  <p>
   AutoGenomics filed an IPO in 2012 but withdrew it a year later. It's the second time it has withdrawn an IPO. The company hoped to raise $65 million to expand its sales and marketing resources in the US and increase its international distribution partnerships. The IPO proceeds would also have supported R&amp;D programs and the growth of its manufacturing capacity, as well as for debt reduction and general corporate purposes. The company had previously filed to go public in 2008, but it later canceled due to poor market conditions.

   AutoGenomics sells its INFINITI molecular diagnostic systems through a direct sales force in the US market. Its customers include such hospitals and research institutions as
   <company id="112784">
    Johns Hopkins Hospital
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="110186">
    ARUP Laboratory
   </company>
   , and the
   <company id="110057">
    Cleveland Clinic
   </company>
   . It also markets its systems and tests through independent distributors in international markets.

  <p>
   As it has introduced new diagnostic tests and installed INFINITI systems at a larger range of institutions, AutoGenomics has seen a corresponding increase in annual revenues over the years. However, the company is still in its infancy (reporting only about $8 million in annual revenues) and has a ways to go before it achieves profitability.

  <p>
   The company is focused on increasing commercialization of its products, both in the US and overseas, as well as on broadening the range of its product offerings through R&amp;D efforts. One core area of development for AutoGenomics is in the field of companion diagnostics. Such tests are developed alongside pharmaceutical drugs with the intention of providing a personalized medicine regimen, where patient treatments are tailored to genetic makeup based on what drug a person will respond to best.
