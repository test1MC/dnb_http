  <p>
   Challenging economic conditions in 2009 spurred Broan-NuTone's parent
   <company id="11086">
    Nortek
   </company>
   to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy that year; it quickly exited. The reorganization, which eliminated some $1.3 billion in company debt, did not disrupt product distribution or availability. What prompted Nortek to file for bankruptcy was a mountain of debt and declining residential new construction and remodeling.
