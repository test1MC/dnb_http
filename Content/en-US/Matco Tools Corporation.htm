        <p>
   Matco is looking to grow in the automotive aftermarket tools sector by adding some 500 distributors who will wholly own and operate mobile distribution centers in select US markets, including Portland, Oregon, in 2014. This new franchise strategy is part of the toolmaker's initiative to double the annual growth rate of new distributors. In 2013 the company added more than 200 new distributors.
