   Haggar is hooked on classics. A leading maker and marketer of men's casual and dress apparel, the company's products include pants, sport coats, suits, shirts, and shorts. Haggar's clothes (including its "wrinkle-free" shirts and tab-waist expandable pants) are sold through about 10,000 stores in the US, Canada, Mexico, and the UK. Its Haggar brand is sold&#160;in department stores, such as
   <company id="40061">
    Belk

   ,
   <company id="105457">
    J. C. Penney

   ,
   <company id="11339">
    Kohl's

   ,
   <company id="12493">
    Macys
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   , and at more than 70 Haggar outlet stores. The men's apparel maker invented the word "slacks" and has sold plenty of them in its 80-plus years in business.

        <p>
   In general, Haggar's lines consist of styles that are more basic and less susceptible to the vagaries of fashion;&#160;the focus is more on innovations in the fabrics used. For example, a new line of chinos is made from fabric that includes fibers made from recycled plastic water bottles, to appeal to ecologically-conscious younger men. The company has also emphasized quality, adding a "Quality for Life" guarantee that its clothing will last for the life of its owner.

   Haggar has attempted to elevate&#160;its brand&#160;by expanding its offerings through licensing agreements. To this end,&#160;Haggar launched a collection of casual and dress apparel&#160;that's sold in more than 800 Sears stores nationwide. In spring 2010, it then launched an online store and refocused its energy on its core business of suits and pants.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its 2011 purchase of Neema Clothing&#160;strengthened Haggar's position in the men's dress and tailored category. The deal also gave Haggar a licensing agreement with Global Licensing Company for the Bert Pulitzer trademark, which allows it to make, market, and sell a variety of apparel items such as&#160;men's suits, sport coats, blazers, topcoats, tuxedos, vests, and tailored slacks.

        <p>
   J. M. Haggar Sr., an immigrant from Lebanon, started his clothing business near Dallas in 1926. His son E. R. became president in 1948 and helped popularize the word "slacks" to describe pants worn after work. Haggar pioneered finished-bottom pants (ending the need for alterations) in the 1950s and was a big promoter of permanent-press pants in the 1960s. The company introduced its lower-priced Reed St. James brand in 1983.
  </p>
        <p>
   Joseph Haggar III, E. R.'s nephew, became CEO in 1990, just as the popularity of Levi's Dockers was shrinking the dress pants market. Haggar launched the immediately popular Wrinkle-Free cotton pants (no ironing or dry cleaning needed) in 1992, the year it went public. Riding the fashion trend of natural fibers and casual clothing, its cotton products soon racked up almost a third of sales.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1995 the company introduced Wrinkle-Free cotton shirts and opened the first Haggar retail store. Storm damage of $40 million at its Dallas distribution center and a $14 million restructuring charge to consolidate its US operations and shift more production to other countries caused a $2 million loss the next year. In the late 1990s Haggar introduced the Ultimate Pant for the casual market, its more upscale Black Label line, and Cotton Flex fabric, a wrinkle-free, stretchable cotton. In 1997 and 1998 Haggar opened its subsidiaries in the UK and Japan.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1999 Haggar purchased women's apparel maker Jerell, which is distributed through major department stores as well as catalog suppliers such as Coldwater Creek, and established a Canadian subsidiary, Haggar Canada. In 2000 the company formed an alliance with Donna Karan International to make the fashion company's DKNY brand of men's pants. In 2001 Haggar formed an alliance with Liz Clairborne to make the Clairborne brand of men's pants and shorts. In 2002 the company introduced the novel Haggar comfort fit waistband pants, which include a hidden paunch panel (a style that was immediately copied by Haggar competitors).
  </p>
        <p>
   Haggar finished the Jerell&#160;integration process in 2004 by changing the company's name to Haggar Women's Wear, Ltd. It also added a new line called WXRLD clothing, a junior fashion line; and Crey, a junior bottoms line. E. R. Haggar Sr. died in September 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   In September 2004, the company announced a licensing agreement with BMB Group to develop its men's wear business in the UK and Ireland.
  </p>
        <p>
   The California-based private equity firm Infinity Associates acquired Haggar for about $210 million in November 2005.&#160;Following the buyout, CEO J.M. Haggar&#160;III&#160;was replaced by&#160;industry veteran Jim Lewis.
  </p>
        <p>
   Two years later Terry Lay, who had logged more than 30 years at companies such as
   <company id="11572">
    VF Corporation
   </company>
   , succeeded Lewis in October 2007 as&#160;the company's&#160;CEO. To grow, Lay targeted the middle-market for menswear.
  </p>
        <p>
   When Lay retired in early 2009, Paul Buxbaum, president and CEO of the liquidation and appraisal firm Buxbaum Group, was tapped to take the helm. Buxbaum brought with him more than 30 years of&#160;experience in the retail industry, logging time as chairman of&#160;Ames Department Stores&#160;and head of the Rampage clothing brand overhaul. During that year Haggar also exited two money-losing businesses in 2009: its women's division and a private-label clothing business for
   <company id="11600">
    Wal-Mart
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Michael Stitt was named as Haggar's new CEO.
