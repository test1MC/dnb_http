   Dig this: J C Bamford Excavators, commonly known as just JCB, is such a popular brand in the UK that its residents often substitute "JCB" for the word digger, the same way Americans use "
   <company id="10856">
    Kleenex
   </company>
   " for tissue. Best known for making backhoes, JCB produces a variety of heavy equipment used in construction and farming, including crawler excavators, backhoe loaders, front-end loaders, material handlers, and the speed tractor (the Fastrac, which moves at about 45 mph). JCB is Europe's largest maker of construction equipment. Subsidiaries JCB Finance and JCB Insurance Services, respectively, provide equipment financing and insurance for equipment and workers.

   JCB has a presence in six continents and sells its products in 150 countries through 2,000 dealer depot locations. The company has its manufacturing facilities at 22 locations in the UK, Brazil, Germany, China, North America, and India.

  <p>
   JBC's financial foundation is also supported by a vertically integrated cost-saving business model -- more so than most construction equipment makers. One plant, for example, makes transmissions for JCB machinery as well as for other OEMs, enabling competitive volume part pricing. JCB also supplies such related machinery parts as lubricants, tires, and batteries.

  <p>
   On the day his son, Anthony, was born (October 23), Joseph Cyril Bamford founded his namesake company in 1945 from a rented garage in Uttoxeter, England. His first manufactured piece of equipment was a Â£45 trailer Bamford welded together from army surplus materials. The company began making trailers with hydraulic lifts in 1948 and soon developed other attachments for farm and construction equipment. Bamford leveraged the company's hydraulic expertise by launching the world's first backhoe loader in 1953, the same year the company began using the JCB logo.
