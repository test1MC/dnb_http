   NCI's buildings could be considered quite a "steel." NCI Building Systems, also known as NCI Group, engineers, designs, manufactures, and distributes metal components (doors, roofs, walls, and trim) and engineered building systems for nonresidential construction markets in North America. It sells its products to contractors, developers, and builders. The group also provides metal coil coating, which is used by manufacturers of HVAC systems, lighting fixtures, and appliances. NCI has more than 40 manufacturing facilities in the US, China, and Mexico and operates distribution and sales offices in the US and Canada. Investment firm
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   owns NCI Group.

  <p>
   NCI operates three business segments. Its Metal Components segment, which generated 50% of its total revenue during fiscal 2015 (ended November 1), makes and sells metal roof and wall systems, as well as metal partitions, trims, doors, and related accessories for use in industrial, commercial, institutional, agricultural, and rural markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Engineered Building Systems segment (37% of revenue) makes structural members and heavy-gauge plate steel panels designed to reinforce a building's framing from the stresses of the roof and walls to the external load pressures. The group's Metal Coil Coating segment (13% of revenue) cleans, treats, and paints different types of flat-rolled metals. It also provides metal embossing and slitting services.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Houston, Texas-based group operates 42 manufacturing facilities in the US, Mexico, and China (as of early 2016), and has sales and distribution offices across the US and Canada. About 94% of its revenue came from sales in the US during 2015, while another 5% came from sales in Canada and less than 1% came from Mexico and other countries.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The majority of NCI's engineered building systems are made through its authorized builder networks, and are mostly sold to builders, general contractors, developers and end users working in the commercial, industrial, agricultural, government, and community markets (non-residential markets).
  </p>
  <p>
   NCI's Metal Components business, which targets the same markets, sells to regional building manufacturers, general contractors and subcontractors, as well as to lumberyards, and cooperative buying groups. The Metal Coil Coating segment sells its products mostly to original equipment manufacturer customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group has been ramping up its advertising spend in recent years. It spent $8.6 million on advertising in fiscal 2015 (ended November 1), up from $7.6 million and $6.6 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NCI's annual revenues have risen more than 60% since 2011 as the construction and commercial real estate markets have boosted demand for its products. It's also come back from losses in 2011 and 2013 as it's managed to keep its operating and overhead costs in check.
  </p>
  <p>
   The group's sales climbed 14% to $1.5 billion during fiscal 2015 (ended November 1, 2015) mostly thanks to the Metal Components segment's acquisition of CENTRIA, which also added increased tonnage sales volumes (specifically for single-skin products). The group's Metal Coil Coating segment sales declined 6% while Engineered Building Systems sales were down less than 1% for the year. Most of the sales growth came from the US, where sales grew 17%, while the rest came from double-digit sales growth in Mexico. Sales in Canada fell by 21%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strong revenue growth in FY2015 drove NCI's net income up 59% to $17.8 million. The group's operating cash levels more than tripled to $105 million in FY2015 mostly on strong cash earnings growth and positive working capital changes mainly related to a rise in accounts payable balances.

  <p>
   With its eye toward a stronger market position and increased sales and profitability, NCI Group planned in 2016 to push four main initiatives, including: leveraging automation and supply chain efficiencies to become "one of the lowest cost producers"; pushing its Engineered Building Systems segment to provide a "total value building solution" for customers; grow its customer base to expand on its top position in the Metal Components business; and diversify its Metal Coil Coating segment's external customer base and national footprint with plans to become a low-cost producer and grow its non-construction sales as a supply chain partner to national manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   NCI also looks for opportunistic acquisitions that expand its service lines and bolster its market share.

  <p>
   In January 2015, NCI Building Systems strengthened its market position after purchasing Pennsylvania-based
   <company id="109624">
    CENTRIA
   </company>
   , which made architectural insulated metal panel (IMP) wall and roof systems and provided coil coating services. The $245 million deal added CENTRIA's four manufacturing facilities in the US and another in China.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NCI Building Systems' founder Johnie Schulte Jr. began his career in the mid-1950s when he landed a job punching and shearing metal building pieces in Houston.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1984 he founded NCI. The enterprise made only metal building components until 1987, when it began making metal buildings. That year NCI had sales of about $2 million. The company went public in 1992, and a year later its sales had reached more than $130 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   While competitors were shuttering plants in the soft market of the early 1990s, NCI was buying companies -- including its 1992 purchase of A&amp;S Building Systems, a metal building maker based in Caryville, Tennessee. NCI later expanded its product line to include self-storage buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
   It entered the market for roll-up steel overhead doors in 1995 when it bought Doors &amp; Building Components (also a maker of interior steel parts) and started its own line of steel-frame homes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to make acquisitions in 1996, picking up a metal stud plant in Texas from Alabama Metal Industries, the equipment of Carlisle Engineered Metals, and Mesco Metal Buildings. The next year it bought the rest of Carlisle, including a manufacturing plant in Alabama, and began a 51%-owned joint venture in Mexico to manufacture framing systems. NCI bought the US metal building components business of UK-based BTR in 1998 for $593 million, doubling its size and adding painting and coating capabilities. The company spent 1999 integrating the large business.
  </p>
  <p>
   NCI bought out Consolidated System's share in their DOUBLECOTE metal coil-coating joint venture for $26 million in 2000. Later that year NCI bought Midland Metals, a maker of metal building components. The move strengthened NCI's presence in the Midwest.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 NCI sold its 50% interest in Midwest Metal Coatings to its joint venture partner. The company closed five manufacturing facilities during the first quarter of fiscal 2002. NCI launched into direct selling to the public by opening a series of NCI Metal Depot retail factory stores that offer commercial and residential metal components (metal roof and wall panels, light structural and tubing shapes, and accessories) and a variety of small metal building packages (carports, storage sheds, and other metal buildings).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company opened two retail stores in Texas in fiscal 2003. Also that year, NCI entered the residential garage door market by acquiring Texas-based Able Manufacturing and Wholesale Garage Door Company for about $3.3 million. NCI shortened the company's name to Able Door Manufacturing. Able operates distribution centers in the Dallas, Atlanta, and Oklahoma City areas, and Ontario, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   Founder, president, and CEO Johnie Schulte Jr. retired as an executive in November 2003 and retired as a director the next year; he was succeeded by A. R. Ginn. The following year NCI filed a suit against Schulte, alleging he had violated non-competitive agreements. Schulte filed a countersuit; an undisclosed settlement was reached in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its retail and builder distribution channels for its small engineered buildings, NCI bought North Little Rock, Arkansas-based Heritage Building Systems and Steelbuilding.com for approximately $30 million in 2004. NCI also acquired the 49% minority stake held by its partners in its manufacturing plant in Monterrey, Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year NCI bought the intellectual property rights of metal building and components maker STEELOX Systems of Ohio, gaining the patents and trademarks, copyrights, common law rights, names, logos, websites, and customer lists of the established (by more than 70 years) company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 NCI paid $370 million in cash for metal buildings maker
   <company id="10122">
    Robertson-Ceco Corporation
   </company>
   and its Robertson Building Systems, Ceco Building Systems, Star Building Systems, and Steelspec divisions. Late that year Ginn stepped down as CEO, with president and COO Norm Chambers becoming president and CEO. The next year Chambers assumed the chairmanship. NCI also bought Garco Building Systems in 2007.
