   Why test each microchip one by one, when you can test them all in one place? That's the question FormFactor answers with its interconnect technology called MicroSpring. The companyy makes wafer probe cards that test semiconductor circuits (especially memory chips) while they are still part of semiconductor wafers -- before the wafers are cut into individual chips. FormFactor touts the process for its cost-effectiveness, since it allows testing of many chips at once across a range of scales and temperatures. While the most of the company's products are made in the US, the majority of sales are to customers in the Asia/Pacific region.

   FormFactor primarily manufactures its products in California, but it also has smaller manufacturing facilities in China and Japan. It also has sales and services offices in China, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. South Korea is the biggest market for FormFactor products, accounting for 20% of revenue, followed by Taiwan with 18%. About 28% of sales come from customers in North America.

   Sales to its largest customer,
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , accounted for about 20% of 2014 sales, up from about 18% in 2013. Another top customer,
   <company id="57841">
    SK Hynix
   </company>
   , accounted for about 15% of sales in 2014.
   <company id="14116">

   Sales jumped 16% higher in 2014 to$268.5 million, boosted by increases in the System-on-a-Chip (SOC) and DRAM markets. Flash memory revenue were down 34%. SOC sales were driven by demand from the mobile, PC, and automotive microcontroller markets. FormFactor cut its loss to $19 million in 2014 from $57.6 million in 2013. Stronger revenue and lower operating costs combined to reduce the loss. Cash flow improved $17 million in 2014 from a negative $5.8 million in 2013.

   The company responds to changes in the global semiconductor market by restructuring, including several rounds of minor workforce reductions. Following workforce reductions in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the company cut about 50 jobs in 2014.

   Looking to improve its business in the flash memory market, FormFactor introduced a new product for testing NAND flash devices in 2014. Gaining a foothold in the growing flash storage sector is important for the company's  growth.

  <p>
   Like all semiconductor equipment manufacturers, FormFactor makes substantial investments in R&amp;D in order to develop next-generation process, architecture, and testing products. The company is focused on new product development for the SoC market, which is less volatile than the memory market. It also invests in technology through acquisitions.
