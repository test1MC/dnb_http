   Hot cereal is the new power breakfast. Formerly Malt-O-Meal, MOM Brands still makes its original hot wheat staple and a line of Better Oats instant oatmeal, but it has grown to 11 cereal brands, half of which are ready-to-eat. Founded in 1919, MOM Brands is the nation's largest family-owned cereal company. Under the Malt-O-Meal, Mom's Best Naturals, and other brands, it makes affordable kid-friendly cereals under names Coco-Roos, Cinnamon Toasters, Frosted Mini-Spooners, Honey Buzzers, and Tootie Fruities. Its cereals are distributed to food retailers and foodservice operators across the US, including

   . In mid-2015, MOM Brands was acquired by cereal giant

   Before it was acquired by Post Holdings in May 2015, MOM Brands worked to increase its production capacity as part of the company's push into big-box retailers, such as
   <company id="11600">
    Sam's Club
   </company>
   and discount stores like
   <company id="10546">
    Family Dollar
   </company>
   . In mid-2013 MOM Brands wrapped up a 50,000-sq.-ft. renovation at its Lakeville, Minnesota, campus. The company then relocated its corporate headquarters from downtown Minneapolis.
