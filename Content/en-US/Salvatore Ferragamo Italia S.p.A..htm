   Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. knows the value of Italian style. It's the parent company of Ferragamo Group, a mainstay of the luxury goods industry that makes and sells footwear, leather goods, and apparel and accessories, including eyewear, scarves, and watches. Ferragamo has a reputation for elegance -- outfitting popes and presidents. The Ferragamo shoe line still generates most of its sales, while handbags, belts, luggage, and small leather goods account for about a third of sales. The company distributes its high-end products through about 620 department stores and boutiques in Italy and 90-plus countries. Family-owned since its founding by Salvatore Ferragamo in 1914, the company went public in 2011.

   The Italian luxury goods company raised about €344 million ($487 million) in the June 2011 offering, valuing the group at €1.5 billion. (The move came a week after rival
   <company id="56418">
    Prada
   </company>
   listed in Hong Kong.) The proceeds will be used to fuel Ferragamo's expansion, particularly in high-growth markets in Asia. CEO Michele Norsa, who joined the company from
   <company id="139260">
    Valentino
   </company>
   in 2006, says Ferragamo sells more products in Hong Kong than any other city in the world.

   Under Norsa, Ferragamo has been expanding its store count. In the US it has opened stores in Atlantic City and NorthPark Center in Dallas and has renovated shops in California and Hawaii. Following the Milan listing, the Ferragamo family will own 56% of the company through its holding company, Ferragamo Finanziaria.

   Norsa is one of the few executives outside the Ferragamo family. Her appointment spurred several other moves: Wanda Ferragamo, Salvatore's widow who had directed the design company for 45-plus years, stepped down as chairman of Salvatore Ferragamo Italia and managing director. Family member Ferruccio Ferragamo took her top spot. Wanda became Salvatore Ferragamo Italia's honorary chairman and remains chairman of Ferragamo Finanziaria, the holding company that controls it. A son of the late Salvatore Ferragamo, Massimo, stepped down as head of the US unit, but remains plugged into the company's strategic decisions.

   In recent years, Ferragamo has been logging licensing deals to extend its portfolio and diversify its revenue streams. In 2009 the company partnered with eyewear leviathan

    Luxottica
   </company>
   in an agreement that extends through December 2011 (with an option for a two-year extension beyond that under the same terms). Luxottica designs, produces, and distributes prescription frames and sunglasses under the Salvatore Ferragamo brand. It's also extending its portfolio into timepieces through 2020, thanks to a 13-year agreement with iconic watchmaker

   . The deal represents its entrance into watch licensing. Ferragamo sees watches as a natural progression as it continues to serve the luxury market and attempts to expand its customer base in Asia.
