  <p>
   In 2012 the joint venture approved a $115 million plan to expand production of hot rolled sheet piling. The project is scheduled for completion in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Completion of the expansion will add several new sheet piling sections and will increase the single sheet widths by 22% to produce a stronger sheet. The new sections will also provide piling distributor customers a broader range of American-made piling products. The project also is in line with Nucor-Yamato Steel's strategy for building its piling and foundation products, which are serviced by its Skyline Steel and Harris Rebar businesses.

   In 2012, German plant maker SMS Meer revamped Nucor-Yamato Steel's No. 1 Steel rolling mill to enables the rolling of wider sheet piling products. The revamp included the installation of three-stand finishing mill and two more stands.
