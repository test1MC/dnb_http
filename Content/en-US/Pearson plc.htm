   Pearson would like to teach the world a thing or two. The company, which previously owned British newspaper
   <em>
    The Financial Times
   </em>
   before selling it off to Nikkei in late 2015, has rebranded and refocused entirely on education. Education has long been the company's largest segment: Pearson is the world's top educational publisher of textbooks and related material. The company provides education materials for schools, higher education and professionals, as well as internationally recognized qualifications. Beyond educations, Pearson retains a 47% stake in one of the most famous brands in book publishing,
   <company id="43807">
    Penguin Random House
   </company>
   , which accounts for about 15% of the company's revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Pearson divides its operations into three segments: North America, the largest at some two-thirds of revenue and which covers School, Higher Education (HE) and Professional businesses in US and Canada; Core School, which covers School, HE and Professional in mature markets including the UK, Australia and Italy; and Growth School, which focuses on high-growth countries like China, Brazil, India and South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company provides textbooks through brands including BTEC, Bug Club, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. In the UK it operates exam board Edexcel, which is the UK's only privately owned exam board; qualifications from Edexcel, which include GCSEs and A-Levels, are internationally recognized.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its Professional services is broken into Pearson English and Pearson VUE. The former includes English language textbooks and learning, e-learning for large corporations, and English language schools for business professionals. Pearson VUE provides electronic testing for regulatory and certification boards in over 150 countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schools-related activities are Pearson's most significant activity by sales, bringing in over 40% per year; Higher Education and Professional bring in some 39% and 19% each.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Though it operates in more than 80 countries around the world, Pearson's largest markets are North America (66% of sales) and the UK (around 10% of sales). The Asia-Pacific region accounts for around 15%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2015 the company worked with brand design agency Together Design to refocus the Pearson brand around the idea of curiosity and the excitement that comes with learning. The company's new logo combines an exclamation mark and question mark (the "interrobang") to form the letter 'P'.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pearson provides services to institutions, governments and individuals, mostly through textbooks and online.

  <p>
   <em>
    Note: Growth rates may differ after conversion to US Dollars.
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, revenue fell 2% on prior year to £4.5 billion, due to weakness in Schools revenue. The segment was hurt by declining revenue from UK qualifications as the end of a period of policy change approaches (Pearson stands to benefit from changes in education policy as textbooks need refreshing). The Growth segment failed to live up to its name as sales in Brazil were negatively affected by disposals, and in South Africa sales fell due to a smaller textbook adoption cycle and the negative impact of fewer qualified high school graduates and tightening consumer credit on re-enrolment rates. In the Middle East, the business was impacted by Pearson's withdrawal from the Saudi Arabian Colleges of Excellence.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the weakness in Schools was counterbalanced to an extent by the Higher Education and Professional segments, which both recorded positive growth figures (of 2% and 4%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income increased 75% to £823 million due to proceeds from disposals. Cash flow from operating activities fell £244 million due to changes in tax paid and trade and other liabilities.

   Pearson is shedding its non-education activities. In late 2015, it sold of
   <em>
    The Financial Times
   </em>
   , one of the UK's most reputable newspapers, for around $1.3 billion to Nikkei, and before that Pearson sold its half of
   <company id="140262">
    FTSE
   </company>
   to the
   <company id="100694">
    London Stock Exchange
   </company>
   for £450 million in cash in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of product delivery, Pearson is reducing its exposure to large, direct delivery operations to focus on online, virtual, and blended services, in order to focus on fewer but larger commercial opportunities.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1844 Samuel Pearson became a partner in a small Yorkshire building firm. When he retired in 1879 his grandson Weetman took over, moving the company to London in 1884. The business enjoyed extraordinary success -- building the first tunnel under New York's Hudson River and installing Mexico City's drainage system. By the 1890s the company (incorporated as S. Pearson &amp; Son in 1897) was the world's #1 contractor.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1920s the company bought newspapers and engaged in oil exploration. Weetman died in 1927, and so did the construction business. His heirs then bought into several unrelated businesses. Pearson bought control of
   <i>
    The Financial Times
   </i>
   newspaper in 1957, a deal that also brought it 50% of
   <i>
    The Economist
   </i>
   (
   <i>
    The Financial Times
   </i>
   had acquired half of
   <i>
    The Economist
   </i>
   in 1928). The company later added stakes in vintner Chateau Latour (1963, sold 1988) and publisher Longman (1968). The firm went public in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1970s Pearson bought Penguin Books (1971) and Madame Tussaud's (1978). In 1989 it added Addison-Wesley (educational publisher, US) and Les Echos (financial newspaper publisher, France).
  </p>
  <p>
   Concentrating on media interests, the company bought Thames Television in 1993 and Grundy Worldwide (game shows and soap operas) in 1995. It acquired HarperCollins Educational Publishing from News Corp. in 1996, as well as US publisher Putnam Berkley from MCA, gaining such authors as Tom Clancy and Amy Tan. By the mid-1990s, however, Pearson's holdings still lacked focus, and earnings were depressed. Marjorie Scardino, a Texan who had been CEO of The Economist Group since 1992, replaced Frank Barlow in 1997, becoming the first woman to lead a major UK company. She rounded out Pearson's TV holdings with the purchase of
   <l1>
    All American Communications
   </l1>
   that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Pearson bought Simon &amp; Schuster's reference and educational publishing divisions from Viacom (now
   <company id="12435">
    CBS Corporation
   </company>
   ) for $4.6 billion and sold Tussaud's amusement business. In 1999 Pearson shed $58 million in college textbooks and instructional programs to John Wiley &amp; Sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of a long-term plan to build
   <i>
    The Financial Times
   </i>
   brand online, Pearson bought 60% of Data Broadcasting Corporation (now called
   <company id="42114">
    Interactive Data Corporation
   </company>
   ) in 2000. It began to cross-promote the FT.com Web site with MarketWatch.com (Data Broadcast sold its 34% stake in the now-called MarketWatch to Pearson in 2001) as part of a $35 million marketing campaign. MarketWatch was later sold to
   <company id="10472">
    Dow Jones &amp; Company
   </company>
   in 2005. Pearson bought troubled UK publisher
   <company id="43502">
    Dorling Kindersley
   </company>
   for nearly $500 million and later combined the firm with its Penguin unit. It also launched a German version of
   <i>
    The Financial Times
   </i>
   with Bertelsmann's
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner + Jahr
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2000 Pearson combined its TV operations with CLT-Ufa, co-owned by German media company Bertelsmann and Audiofina, into a new publicly traded broadcasting firm called RTL Group. Pearson took a 22% stake in RTL. In addition, Pearson bought educational test processing firm National Computer Systems (later called
   <company id="14200">
    NCS Pearson
   </company>
   before being integrated into operations).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 Pearson expanded its educational operations, announcing plans for a joint venture with Telefónica to distribute online educational content in Latin America. That year the company also formed a joint venture with an arm of Chinese state television to produce programming for a Chinese audience. In late 2001 Pearson sold its stake in RTL to Bertelsmann. Spain's
   <company id="41840">
    Telefónica
   </company>
   divested its 5% stake in the company in late 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its 79% stake in
   <company id="101604">
    Recoletos Grupo de Comunicacion
   </company>
   containing its Spanish media holdings in 2005 to Retos Cartera. Also that year the company acquired special needs publisher AGS Publishing from WRC Media (which later became
   <company id="115611">
    RD School &amp; Educational Services
   </company>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result of shareholders pressuring Scardino to focus more on the company's over-performing education unit, the company acquired professional testing unit
   <company id="128000">
    Promissor
   </company>
   from
   <company id="10748">
    Houghton Mifflin
   </company>
   in 2006.  Other assets acquired in 2006 and added to the company's education business included Paravia Bruno Mondadori (PBM), National Evaluation Systems (NES), PowerSchool, and Chancery.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sold its Pearson Government Solutions unit in 2006 to Veritas Capital for some $560 million. Additionally in 2006 Pearson bought Mergermarket Group, a news and data firm, for $191 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 Pearson sold its French newspaper
   <em>
    Les Echos
   </em>
   to French luxury goods conglomerate
   <company id="41804">
    LVMH
   </company>
   for €240 million.  Pearson next bolstered its US assessment and international textbook holdings with the purchases of exam-testing company Harcourt Assessment and textbook publisher
   <company id="138807">
    Harcourt Education Ltd.
   </company>
   from
   <company id="41830">
    Reed Elsevier
   </company>
   for $950 million. The deals closed in 2008.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2008 sold its Data Management business, which manufactured scanners, printed forms, and provided support services for customers in education and in commercial and government organizations. Pearson sold the unit to
   <company id="51674">
    M&amp;F Worldwide
   </company>
   for some $225 million in cash. Also that year the company sold its 50% stake in the
   <em>
    Financial Times
   </em>
   ' German edition,
   <em>
    FT Deutschland
   </em>
   , to
   <company id="58233">
    Gruner + Jahr
   </company>
   . Amid previous speculation. Pearson denied plans to sell off the entire FT Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2010 the company sold its stake in
   <company id="42114">
    Interactive Data Corporation
   </company>
   to US-based private equity firms
   <company id="99669">
    Silver Lake
   </company>
   and
   <company id="103796">
    Warburg Pincus
   </company>
   for $2 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the proceeds, Pearson made several education-related acquisitions that year. It purchased training business Wall Street Institute from
   <company id="42166">
    The Carlyle Group
   </company>
   for £65 million (some $92 million). The deal expanded Pearson's education business in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as Wall Street Institute provides spoken English training in 25 regions across the globe. Also that year Pearson acquired the learning systems business of Brazilian firm Sistema Educational Brasileiro (SEB) for £326 million ($499 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its Wall Street Institute and SEB acquisitions, Pearson in 2010 acquired Melorio, a UK-based vocational training group, for £99 million (about $142 million), and school improvement services provider America's Choice for £65 million (about $80 million).
  </p>
  <p>
   At its FT Group, the company in 2010 acquired Medley Global Advisors, a provider of macroeconomic intelligence to hedge funds and banks. FT made the purchase in order to grow its investments in premium services, therefore reducing its reliance on advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company completed the sale of its 50% stake in FTSE. In 2015 Pearson sold off
   <em>
    The Financial Times
   </em>
   to Nikkei for about $1.3 billion and rebranded itself as the "world's learning company".
