  <p>
   Although the company is dealing with dwindling demand in some sectors, it holds leadership positions in all of the key markets it serves. JM continues to develop new products and address environmental concerns. For instance, JM has initiated a change in its entire line of fiberglass insulation from a traditional phenol-formaldehyde base to a a greener formaldehyde-free line, which uses an acrylic resin as its binder. The company caters to the solar energy roofing market with its JM E3co. As part of JM's strategy to offer more energy efficient products, the company partnered with SolarFrameWorks to provide crystalline solar panel products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 2014, JM added CI Max White insulation to its building insulation product portfolio. CI Max White is a high-efficiency polyisocyanurate (polyiso) foam sheathing designed specifically for exposed interior applications, suitable for wall or ceiling applications in commercial, residential, agricultural and industrial buildings. CI Max White provides a continuous layer of insulation to reduce thermal bridging. That year, the company also launched ENRGY 3.E, the next generation of its polyiso product line. ENRGY 3.E is inherently fire-resistant and meets all current fire tests and codes without added halogenated flame retardants.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its ability to serve increasingly global needs in the composites, filtration, and energy storage markets, in 2014 the company announced that it would merge its American, European, and Asian Engineered Products operations into one global business unit.

  <p>
   After some 25 years of asbestos-related lawsuits (including a period of bankruptcy), Johns Manville was acquired by
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   in 2001. The company had established an asbestos trust fund to pay victims of asbestosis and other diseases, but the fund was soon depleted. JM has since re-established the fund but no longer pays out dollar for dollar to recipients.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   H. W. Johns founded a roofing-materials business in Brooklyn, New York in 1858. In 1868 he patented a line of asbestos products. The company merged in 1901 with Manville Covering, which had been founded in 1886 in Milwaukee to make pipe coverings and insulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas Manville headed the new company, named Johns Manville (JM), until his death in 1925. His brother Hiram bought most of the stock and in 1927 sold 53% of the company to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. for about $20 million. Under Morgan the company focused on building materials and moved away from earlier diversification ventures into markets for such items as automobile horns, fire extinguishers, and spark plugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   JM moved to Colorado in 1972. Two years later 448 WWII shipyard workers filed the first major asbestos health suits against the company. (Inhaled, asbestos causes asbestosis, a serious lung disease.) JM bought paper producer Olinkraft in 1979 and in 1981 shortened its name to Manville.
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1982 it had settled more than 4,100 suits, but it still faced a backlog of nearly 17,000 more. Bankruptcy ensued. While in bankruptcy, Manville closed its plastic pipe and residential roofing operations and stopped all asbestos-related activities. In 1985 Manville acquired Eastex Packaging (forest products). A reorganization plan finalized in 1988 created a trust fund to cover asbestos-related claims filed before mid-1985 and to bar any future claims. Manville began paying the trust $75 million a year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm purchased carton and paperboard companies in three countries in 1990. Manville's US and European filtration and minerals groups were combined as Celite in 1991. That year Alleghany Corporation bought Celite, and Manville became a holding company. Its Manville Forest Products and Manville Sales divisions were renamed Riverwood International and Schuller International and became subsidiaries. In 1991 Riverwood bought packaging, equipment, and marketing companies in Brazil (M.E.A.D.), Spain (Jorba and Syspack), and the US (Minnesota Automation) and (Jak-et-Pak, New Jersey).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1992 Manville sold 19.5% of Riverwood International in a $172 million public offering. It bought Steinachglas, a glass-mat maker in eastern Germany, in 1993 and swapped its residential roofing business for
   <company id="11132">
    Corning's
   </company>
   commercial roofing unit. Manville sold its remaining 80% of Riverwood to investors
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   for $1.1 billion in 1996 and renamed itself Schuller Corporation. That year the company acquired Dibiten USA and Dibiten Mexico, makers of bitumen roofing products. It also bought foam insulation manufacturers NRG Barriers and IMCOA.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company changed its name back to Johns Manville in 1997 and bought Mitex (the world's #1 maker of fiberglass wall fabric), HPG International's roofing business, and Ergon Nonwovens, a maker of filtration products. To expand its fiberglass roofing business, the firm bought four Hoechst polyester-fiber factories in South Carolina, Northern Ireland, and China in 1999. Also that year JM bought back $167 million of stock from its asbestos-claim trust fund after the fund failed to find a third-party buyer.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 JM agreed to be acquired by a group of investors (led by affiliates of
   <company id="40216">
    HM Capital
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10191">
    Bear Stearns
   </company>
   ) in a deal worth around $3 billion. Late in the year the company pulled out of the deal, citing the economy and financing markets. In early 2001, however, Warren Buffett's
   <company id="10206">
    Berkshire Hathaway
   </company>
   bought the company for about $1.8 billion. Also that year JM acquired Skloplast (Slovakia), a producer of fiberglass materials used mainly in fiber glass-reinforced plastics for the construction and transportation industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   JM partnered with
   <company id="11285">
    Rohm and Haas Company
   </company>
   in 2002 to develop a formaldehyde-free acrylic binder in order to switch its entire line of fiberglass building insulation from its traditional phenol-formaldehyde-based chemistry to the new binder. Advantages of the converted line included the elimination of formaldehyde emissions during manufacturing as well as environmental concerns about fiberglass insulation being a formaldehyde source indoors. By November 2002, the company had settled nearly 500,000 asbestos-related personal injury claims and paid out more than $3 billion to claimants through a trust fund it created in 1998. (JM anticipated as many as 2.4 million more claims yet to be filed.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the next few years, the company added a roofing systems facility in Fernley, Nevada, and developed new technology that increased capacity across its formaldehyde-free building insulation product lines. In 2004 JM made plans to build a new pipe insulation facility to recoup the production capacity it lost due to a fire in 2003 at its Defiance, Ohio, plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jerry Henry retired as JM's chairman and CEO in June of 2004, and former president and COO Steven Hochhauser took his place. Todd Raba, a former exec at Mid-American Energy Holdings (a fellow Berkshire Hathaway company) became president and CEO in 2007.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 JM opened a new $30 million plant to manufacture thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roofing systems used in commercial applications. The company inked a deal to become the exclusive supplier of fiberglass insulation products to home improvement chain
   <company id="10920">
    Lowes
   </company>
   the following year. That year JM also acquired spray foam insulation maker Corbond Corp. Corbond fit in with JM's line of fiberglass building insulation products.
