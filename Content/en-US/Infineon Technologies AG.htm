   It sounds as if Infineon Technologies took its three business focuses from the headlines: Energy efficiency, mobility and security. In some ways it did as the company zeroes in on markets with rising demand for technology now and tomorrow. The company's semiconductors help vehicles, factories, and electronics run more efficiently. On the road, they improve vehicle safety, security, and efficiency. And, in various uses such as ID cards, they protect information. Automotive accounts for the biggest share of revenue followed by power management. Based in Germany, Infineon has research and manufacturing operations around the world. It moved to solidify its position in semiconductors for managing power with its acquisition of
   <company id="10801">
    International Rectifier
   </company>
   , which closed in early 2015.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Leading the way in Infineon's business segments is automotive, which brings in about 45% of sales. The power management and multimarket segment is next with 25% followed by industrial power control at 18%, and chip card and security at 11%.

  <p>
   China is Infineon's largest single country market, accounting for about 28% of revenue. With a 22% sales increase in 2014, China surpassed Germany as the company's top source of sales. Customers in other parts of the Asia-Pacific region were 16% of Infineon's sales. The European market made up 39% of sales (Germany alone was 20%) with the Americas coming in at 11%. Besides China, Infineon posted strong sales increases in A-P, up 18%, and Japan, 25% higher. Sales in the Americas dropped 1%. It operates six manufacturing sites in Asia and four in Europe.

   Infineon's products go to a variety of customers, from government agencies to car manufacturers to electronics companies. Industrial and consumer manufacturers integrate Infineon products to enhance applications from appliances to lighting, and medical and consumer electronics, wireless phones, and radar devices. In security applications, Infineon's radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices are embedded into American passports, adding a higher level of protection. Customers include

   Infineon posted its third straight year of revenue growth in 2014 (ended September). The automotive and industrial power control segments drove Infineon's revenue 5% higher in 2014 from 2013. In both areas, the company's sales increases came from higher demand from auto makers and other manufacturers looking to make products more efficient and smarter. Net income rose 84%, which was attributed to higher revenue and greater utilization of manufacturing capacity and efficiency improvements. Infineon has the cash to make more improvements with cash flow from operations rising a robust 52% in 2014 from 2013.

  <p>
   Infineon has spent big on new equipment (capital costs were 77% higher in 2014 over 2013) to move production of its power semiconductors to 300-millimeter wafers from 200-millimeter wafer, but it appears to be reaping benefits from the switch. By making chips on bigger wafers (a 300-millimeter wafer is about the size of a 12-inch pizza), the company can harvest more chips per wafer. This increases yield while reducing costs, which will be 20%-30% lower than competitors using 200 millimeter technology. It has ramped up 300-millimeter production over several years and it faces the risk of competitors catching up or leapfrogging the technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also continues to implement the plan it calls 'systematic growth.' Under the plan, Infineon concentrates on growing markets for semiconductors, hence its focus on energy efficiency, mobility, and security. Then the company plans to harness factors like its 300-millimeter production capacity to grow faster than the markets. In developing new products, the company follows a 'product to system' approach, leveraging its expertise to design better products for its current markets and new ones.

  <p>
   In early 2015, Infineon closed on its acquisition of International Rectifier, a US-based maker of power semiconductors. The $3 billion deal gives Infineon entr√©e to parts of the power semiconductor that its products don't address. Infineon plans to move much of International Rectifier's production from the US to 300-millimeter plants in Germany and Austria. International Rectifier has $1 billion in sales in 2014.

  <p>
   Infineon Technologies was formed in 1999 from German industrial and electronics giant
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   ' semiconductor operations. Siemens, which was founded in 1847, began its semiconductor R&amp;D program in 1952 -- just five years after scientists at Bell Laboratories invented the transistor. During the 1960s, Siemens' semiconductor operations developed chips for consumer electronics. By the early 1970s the company's facilities included chip factories in Malaysia and the Philippines. In 1985 Siemens released one of the first chipsets to comply with the ISDN communications standard. Five years later it released the first chipset for the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phone standard.
  </p>
  <p>
   Siemens in 1998 became one of the top 10 semiconductor companies by sales, despite falling DRAM prices that contributed to a loss for the year. In 1999 Siemens formed OSRAM Opto Semiconductor, an optoelectronics joint venture with its own subsidiary OSRAM. (Infineon subsequently sold its stake in the joint venture back to Siemens and exited the optoelectronics business.) Also in 1999, Siemens organized its semiconductor operations into a subsidiary, Infineon Technologies. Ulrich Schumacher, who had headed the semiconductor business, became Infineon's chairman and CEO. That year Infineon's alliance with IBM was converted into a joint venture, ALTIS Semiconductor.

   In 2011 Infineon sold its wireless unit to
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   for about $1.4 billion in cash. Intel is looking to expand its offerings in the wireless market by purchasing what amounts to a complete portfolio of wireless chips, while Infineon wants to improve its results by concentrating on its core automotive, industrial, and security chip segments. The company had hoped to get around $2 billion for the wireless unit, which makes up around 30% of Infineon's total sales, but continues to lag behind wireless sector leaders
