   Next time you watch a Hollywood blockbuster on the silver screen, give GDC Technology credit for the high-tech experience. The company is a leading manufacturer of digital cinema servers, which enable movie theaters to screen digital video formats. Its digital cinema servers are sold alone or in a package with projectors, lamps, screens, and software from third-party companies. Its systems are sold to movie theaters, and more than half of its customers come from Asia. (The US has its second-largest customer base.) Since its founding in 1999, the company has sold more than 25,000 digital cinema servers. GDC Technology, which is owned by investment firm
   <company id="42166">
    Carlyle Group
   </company>
   , filed an IPO seeking up to $75 million.
