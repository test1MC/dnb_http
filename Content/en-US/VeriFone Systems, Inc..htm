  <p>
   VeriFone's 2016 revenue (ended March) was flat from 2015 at about $2 billion. A 9% increase in services sales nearly balanced a 6% drop in systems sales. In systems, sales of countertop and pinpad devices dropped on reduced demand in the Asia/Pacific region and Latin America because of economic weakness and competitive pricing. Sales of devices for chip cards (EMVs) fell because many top retailers had already made the switch from swipe card. The company did see EMV-related revenue increase with the increasing adoption of EMV-capable devices by gas stations. In services, revenue increase about 11% from the acquisitions of InterCard and AJB. The company's increased emphasis on expanding its service offerings generated more than $11 million for payment-related services in North America in 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   VeriFone posted a net loss of $9 million in 2016, a turnaround from a $79 million profit in 2015. Higher 2016 expenses included $41 million that went toward a restructuring that reduced headcount, consolidated facilities, and paid for a terminated contract.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash from operations was $194 million in 2016 down from about $250 million in the prior year. The change from net income to net loss was partially tempered by an improvement of about $35 million improvement from better working capital management.

  <p>
   VeriFone has benefited from a general trend away from cash and check transactions toward electronic credit and debit payments. In addition to credit and debit card readers, the company has developed systems that handle radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards, mobile phone transactions, gift cards, electronic bill payments, signature capture, and benefits transfers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2016, restructured by reducing the number of employees and contractors, reassigning some employees, and consolidating facilities, including data centers. VeriFone recorded write-downs totaling $41 million that included charges for employee termination benefits and facility-related costs as well as termination costs for a service the company ended. The restructuring's purpose was to reduce in expenses in some areas and refocus investment in other, faster growing areas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company plans to more closely align its systems and services and will operate just one business segment that combines the two beginning in 2017. The company believes the switch will help it provide a broader range of services. The plan involves connecting its terminal systems to its network, which would allow VeriFone to leverage its network of terminals in its services offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has rolled out two new payment platforms. The Carbon iPOS (for integrated Point of Sale) is a comprehensive electronic point product that includes value-added services for small and medium-businesses. The Engage platform replaces VeriFone's multilane, portable, and countertop devices as well as pinpads. It has capabilities for running applications and multimedia for a richer consumer experience.
  </p>
  <p>
   VeriFone was disappointed when regulators delayed the required shift for EMV at-the-pump for three years, which could slow down those sales. However, VEriFone's partnership with

    Gilbarco
   </company>
   , the maker of gas pumps, will help it capture significant revenue over the next several years.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the US market has largest adopted electronic POS transactions, other parts of the world still rely mostly on cash. VeriFone is using acquisitions to increase its penetration of international markets.

  <p>
   Scholar William Melton founded VeriFone in Hawaii in 1981 to develop electronic mail systems that would keep traveling employees in touch with their offices. By 1984 the company had diversified into transaction automation systems, introducing the first low-cost electronic credit card and check verification terminal. Former Sperry (now Unisys) executive Hatim Tyabji joined as president in 1986 and moved the company to California. He guided VeriFone away from hardware and toward software-driven systems to connect computers, printers, operating systems, and terminals.
  </p>
  <p>
   VeriFone went public in 1990. The next year it released transaction systems that incorporated point-of-service tasks with inventory control and other functions. In 1992 VeriFone introduced an electronic cash register that verified checks and accepted credit and debit card payments. Melton devoted his energies in 1994 to founding (now defunct) Internet payment services company CyberCash.
