   Grifols doesn't grimace when it comes to working with blood. The company provides products and services through three primary divisions: bioscience, diagnostic, and hospital. The bioscience division processes plasma from Grifols' collection centers into therapeutic derivative products such as coagulation factors and trauma products. Its diagnostic division sells testing instruments and reagents for laboratories, including blood bags, separators, incubators, and refrigerators. Grifols provides equipment, software, nutritional products, and IV preparations for hospitals and pharmacies through its hospital division. The firm serves as a holding company for the US operations of Spain-based

  <p>
   The company operates some 150 plasma collection centers around the US through its Biomat USA, PlasmaCare, and Plasma Collection Centers subsidiaries. The blood is then processed by fractionation facilities of PlasmaCare and then turned into therapeutic products by derivatives maker Grifols Biologicals. Grifols also provides transfusion medicines, hemostasis products, and immunoassay solutions for clinical laboratories and blood banks and transfusion centers.

   Grifols works to grow its sales of plasma-derived products to optimize raw material costs and manufacturing capacity. Its product portfolio also includes other plasma proteins including specific hyperimmune immunoglobulins for the treatment of such infections as rabies, tetanus, and hepatitis B.

   The company has undertaken a number of construction projects in effort to keep pace with its growing businesses. In addition to opening new plasma collection centers, the company invested about $150 million to build new purification and sterile filling areas at its Los Angeles facilities. In 2014 the company opened a fractionation facility in Clayton, North Carolina, nearly doubling its plasma production capacity to some 6 million liters per year. The expanded lab capacity allows the company to handle the growing amount of plasma samples needing to be analyzed and reduces the company's dependence on a single facility.
