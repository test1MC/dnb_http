   Candelis (formerly Procom Technology) has an image of its future -- and it's in the health care arena. After years of focusing on general networked-attached storage (NAS) technology, Procom has shifted its interests to its Candelis division and its ImageGrid appliance for storing and retrieving medical images. ImageGrid incorporates NAS technology to help clinics, medical imaging centers, and hospitals access and manage their archives of patient images. Candelis also provides image processing workstations to help physicians view and interpret X-ray and mammogram images. In 2006 an investment group led by Procom's CEO, Alex Razmjoo, took the company private.

   Procom Technology was founded in 1987 by four Iranian-born electrical engineers who studied at the
   <company id="127480">
    University of California at Irvine
   </company>
   : chairman and CEO Alex Razmjoo and Frank Alaghband, Nick Shahrestany, and Alex Aydin. They originally developed Sledgehammer software, which expanded the amount of hard drive memory available on computers running
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   's MS-DOS. They formed Procom to make an external 5 1/4-in. floppy disk drive for
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   's PS/2 PC, which came with a 3 1/2-in. drive. Procom introduced the storage industry's first CD server and array products in 1993. By 1995 CD-based products accounted for about 60% of the company's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Procom went public in 1996. The following year the company introduced the first DVD-ROM server and formed an alliance with
   <company id="41131">
    Kingston Technology
   </company>
   to develop high-capacity removable hard drive storage systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its European presence through acquisitions, the company bought Swiss distributor Pera (renamed Procom AG) and German reseller Megabyte Computerhandels in 1998. Price cuts and market oversupply contributed to a drop in Procom's earnings in fiscal 1998. The company bought Italian distributor Gigatek (renamed Procom Technology, SPA) in 1999, the same year it agreed to provide NAS systems to
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   for its systems. In 2000 Procom began supplying the information technology division of the massive
   <company id="58192">
    Hyundai
   </company>
   conglomerate with NAS appliances for internal use and resale.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Procom sold its NAS intellectual property rights and related assets to
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   for around $50 million in cash. The company distributed around $20 million to its shareholders as a result of the sale. Following the sale, Procom Technology refocused on its Candelis division and ImageGrid product line.
