   Smiths Medical's manufacturing facilities are primarily located in the US, the UK, Mexico, and Italy. Though the company sells its products in more than 120 markets worldwide, the US is its largest single market, accounting for half of its annual sales. Smiths Medical is expanding its operations in emerging markets, such as India, Brazil, and China.

   Smiths Medical comprises about 30% of its parent company's sales. Lead brands include Portex for pain management, Medex for pressure monitoring and interventional imaging, and the Pneupac range of ventilators. The company has a number of industrial medical products designed for single-use purposes such as tubing, aspirators, connectors, and adaptors. Smiths Medical also offers up a number of online educational resources, including medical equipment training videos and continuing education (CE) activities.

  <p>
   Smiths Medical increased revenues by 5% in 2013 due to weaker sales in developed markets and underperformance in emerging markets. The first half of the year was particularly tough with revenue actually growing 3% in the second half. Sales of ambulatory infusion pumps were up 16% but consumables, the company's largest segment, were down 2% due to a host of issues including pricing pressures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Smiths Medical contributes about 27% of its parent's revenue.

  <p>
   Smiths Medical bolsters its product offerings by introducing new items, as well as by offering next-generation versions of existing products. New product launches in 2014 included two new infusion pumps, three new catheters, a ventilatory, and new tracheostomy tubes in various markets around the globe. It also began registering existing products for sale in Brazil and India.

   In addition to direct R&amp;D efforts, Smiths Medical also collaborates with other companies in the industry to develop and market products; for instance, Smiths Medical has cross-promotional agreements with
   <company id="132482">
    Hospira
   </company>
   and Nexus Medical.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also optimizing its distribution organization to maximize efficiencies; in 2012 it brought the operations of its European distribution center (located in the Netherlands) in-house to improve performance and reduce operational expenses in the region.
