   If customers are wearing its protective boots, LaCrosse Footwear doesn't care who steps on their toes. It offers sturdy footwear for hunting and snowmobiling and for such occupations as farming, general utility, and construction. LaCrosse makes rubber, vinyl, and leather footwear, as well as rainwear and protective clothing, for adults and children. Brands include LaCrosse, Danner, Burly, Camohide, and Iceman, among others. Besides selling its products in Asia and Europe, LaCrosse's items are sold across North America to catalog and online merchants, retailers, wholesalers, and the US government, as well as through company websites and outlet stores. LaCrosse was acquired by Japanese rival ABC-Mart in 2013.

   LaCrosse's Danish subsidiary provides retailers in Europe and Asia with its products.

   The company sources about two-thirds of its products through a network of contract manufacturers in Asia, primarily in China and Thailand. The remaining one-third is produced in the US. This setup helps to shorten product development timelines and improve the company's production processes.

   LaCrosse is a multichannel marketer. The company markets its products through employee field and national accounts' sales staff, independent distributors, sporting goods and outdoor retailers, general merchandise and independent shoe stores, wholesalers, industrial distributors, Internet websites, a factory store in Portland, and through (federal, state, and other) government agencies.

   Nearly two-thirds of LaCrosse's sales are generated by the work footwear market, which comprises people in law enforcement, mining, oil and gas exploration and extraction, construction, and military services. The balance is attributed to the outdoor market, whose customers are active in hiking, hunting, and other outdoor recreational activities.

   LaCrosse offers about 325 styles of footwear and protective clothing, and it's quick to purge underperforming brands. In 2009 the company discontinued the END brand of sustainable footwear for athletes and integrate its lightweight designs into the Danner brand. LaCrosse had acquired the END brand earlier that year from Portland, Oregon-based Environmentally Neutral Design Outdoor and had intended to continue selling END shoes as a stand-alone brand. In addition to strengthening Danner's lineup, LaCrosse opened a new factory and factory store for the footwear brand in 2010.
