   InvenSense is ready to move technology beyond point and click. The semiconductor manufacturer offers motion, sound, and directional interface sensors used to detect, track, and assess a user's position and other physical characteristics. Its MotionTracking sensors, which include MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) gyroscopes and motion measurement processing units, are used in consumer devices such as smartphones, tablets, wearables, gaming consoles, and smart TVs to provide a more immersive user interface. InvenSense outsources manufacturing to contractors. It generates the majority of sales in Asia. In 2016 InvenSense agreed to be bought by
   <company id="54088">
    TDK
   </company>
   for $1.3 billion. The deal is expected to close in 2017.

  <p>
   The $1.3 billion acquisition of InvenSense by TDK adds InvenSense's wide range of sensor technology to TDK's lineup of magnetic sensors, which it developed over the years with its work with hard disk drives. The acquisition is to strengthen TDK's product line of sensors for the internet of things (IoT), automotive, and information and communications technology applications.

   InvenSense's revenue rose 12% to $418 million in 2016 (ended April). The company received boosts from increased adoption of its optical image stabilization technology in smartphone cameras and the increasing adoption of devices for internet of things (IoT) market. The IoT market was particularly strong, growing 115% year-to-year. The smartphone business suffered a 20% revenue drop because of a fall off in 2016 sales from a key customer that introduced a new smartphone in 2015.

   The company posted a net loss of $21 million in 2016 up from a $1 million net loss in 2015. The company had higher costs in research and development from additional headcount from acquisitions and in sales and marketing. The company also paid about $12 million to settle patent litigation brought by

   , a competitor.

   Putting on its marketing hat, InvenSense has given a different name to the internet of things. It's calling it the internet of sensors, which fitst with it product line, but is accuratet. Sensors are the devices that connect the things -- toasters, digital assistants, smart home devices, appliances, weather buoys, autos, and more -- to the internet. InvenSense's products fit that bill, capturing and translating real world data to digital bits. InvenSense's sales for the internet of things market surged 115% in 2016 and the company has laid plans to provide sensors for more devices. It is developing products for automotive applications in electric vehicles and self-driving vehicles, industrial robots, drones, and virtual and augmented reality devices.

   The company has expanded its product portfolio to include software, fingerprint, and automotive technology offerings and has set up two entities to develop and sell them. UltraPrint is its ultrasonic fingerprint authentication product, which is uses InvenSense's proprietary MEMS fabrication platform for Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers. Coursa is a cloud-based motion data platform that enables analysis and understanding of user activities and retail shopper behavior.
