   Maybe, baby? Not if Bayer Pharma (formerly Bayer Schering Pharma) can help it. Operating as Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the global drug unit of health care giant
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   is a leading maker of women's health products, including birth control pills (YAZ and Yasmin) and hormone therapies (Mirena). The company also offers primary and specialty care drugs such as Betaferon/Betaseron (multiple sclerosis), Kogenate (hemophilia), and Nexavar (kidney and liver cancer). The firm makes contrast media for diagnostic imaging and drugs for treating infections, vascular conditions, and diabetes. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals markets its products to health care providers and consumers in more than 100 countries.

  <p>
   In 1851 German chemist Ernst Schering opened Gr√ºne Apotheke (German for "Green Pharmacy") in Berlin to sell drugs and chemicals. His first success was a gout treatment. Within 20 years Schering was selling his products across Germany and Europe. By the end of the century, he was exporting products around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the early 1900s Schering added electroplating, agrochemicals, hormones, photography, and other specialties. During WWI the company lost its Russian factories, along with patents there and in the US. After the war Schering had to reestablish its foreign subsidiaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1937 Schering merged with a coke company and became Schering AG. Its business areas were chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, electroplating, and photography) and mining (including coke, coal, and steel). As war broke out, it once again lost its overseas subsidiaries and patents (including the former US subsidiary that later became Schering-Plough, now part of
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   ). By war's end its German factories were in ruins.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schering lost several factories when Germany was split. Headquarters remained in West Berlin, but Schering created a second West German home base, which helped the company weather the Cold War. Nonetheless, Schering struggled: The Iron Curtain hampered Eastern European business, and the West was placed out of reach by severe competitive restrictions (Schering was barred from using its name in the US and some other markets). After spending most of the 1950s and 1960s buying back or reestablishing overseas subsidiaries, Schering reemerged as the company it is today. Its first contraceptive pill was released in 1961, and Schering sold its mining, cosmetics, and other operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Schering focused on re-entering the US market. It began the decade by taking a stake in Knoll Pharmaceutical (sold 1980) and ended it by forming
   <company id="57526">
    Berlex Laboratories
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Schering spent the 1980s further refining its operations; by the end of the decade it had four units (cardiovascular and central nervous system; diagnostics; fertility control; oncology and dermatology). It also reestablished its name overseas. In 1986 the company listed on the
   <company id="100694">
    London Stock Exchange
   </company>
   . Two years later former subsidiary Schering-Plough sued over the use of the Schering name. The two companies agreed Schering could use its name in North America and certain Latin American countries, and Schering-Plough could use the name worldwide, excluding Austria, Switzerland, and (then) West Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1990 the company tried to merge its agricultural business with Sandoz (now
   <company id="52941">
    Novartis
   </company>
   ), but the deal was called off when Sandoz wanted a total merger. (Schering and Hoechst later formed AgrEvo.) Meanwhile, Schering expanded its biotechnology holdings, acquiring US firms Codon and Triton Biosciences (from which it obtained Betaseron, which helped boost its bottom line).
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1990s the company grew through acquisitions and by entering ex-Eastern Bloc markets. Although Schering increased its research and development spending, it primarily relied on licensing agreements to expand its offerings. Agreements included a collaboration with
   <company id="15321">
    Vertex Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   to develop therapies for neurological diseases (1998) and a licensing deal with
   <company id="53402">
    Peregrine Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   (formerly Techniclone) for a lymphoma treatment (1999).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 Schering announced plans to boost its market presence and launch new products in Japan and the US. The following year the company started a joint venture between its Finnish subsidiary, Leiras, and Nycomed Pharma. It also planned to streamline costs by closing plants in Argentina, Austria, the US, Germany, and Finland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Schering AG then began narrowing its focus on gynecology, oncology, diagnostics, and specialty therapeutics, and divesting non-core businesses. It had sold its stake in
   <company id="104861">
    Aventis CropScience
   </company>
   to Bayer in 2002 and sold biotech firm Metagen Pharmaceuticals the following year. It sold its
   <company id="56944">
    Collateral Therapeutics
   </company>
   unit, which developed cardiovascular gene therapy, to
   <company id="146280">
    Cardium Therapeutics
   </company>
   in 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Schering AG was acquired by
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   for about $20 billion. The company's name was changed to Bayer Schering Pharma AG. The acquisition deal came after a bitter battle with
   <company id="11326">
    Merck
   </company>
   . As part of the consolidation process, Bayer merged Schering AG's US subsidiary Berlex with its existing stateside operations to establish
   <company id="57526">
    Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc
   </company>
   . Bayer Schering Pharma and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. then made up Bayer's pharmaceutical business, which operated under the broader Bayer HealthCare division. Bayer also cut about 5% of its workforce as part of the Schering integration efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company decided in 2007 to abandon its efforts to develop a hormone-based contraceptive for men. Partner
   <company id="112102">
    Organon
   </company>
   had dropped out of the project the year before. Bayer Schering Pharma also stopped marketing blood-clotting drug Trasylol in 2007 due to increased risks noted in patient studies. Bayer Schering's Nexavar drug was approved for liver cancer treatment that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   A new medicine, clot-prevention drug Xarelto, was launched in Canada and Europe in 2008. Also that year, Bayer acquired private German firm DIREVO Biotech for $300 million. DIREVO's protein engineering and drug development programs boosted Bayer Schering Pharma's biotech R&amp;D organization. Bayer also expanded the pipeline that year by purchasing hemophilia assets worth $90 million from
   <company id="61815">
    Maxygen
   </company>
   , as well as two oncology candidates from
   <company id="159478">
    Nycomed
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Bayer rebranded the Bayer Schering Pharma unit as Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals to unify its health care operations under the Bayer brand. It also changed the legal entity name from Bayer Schering Pharma AG to Bayer Pharma AG.
