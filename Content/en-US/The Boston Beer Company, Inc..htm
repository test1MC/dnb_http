   , The Boston Beer Company holds a distinction all its own -- it is the US's largest craft brewer. The company produces more than 50 seasonal and year-round varieties of craft beers at breweries in Boston and four other states. Annually, it sells around 4.2 million barrels of lagers and ales (including its flagship Samuel Adams Boston Lager and other Sam Adams brand beers), and Twisted Tea malt beverages. it also brews beer for third parties. Founded in 1984 by its chairman James Koch, The Boston Beer Company has grown along with America's increasing thirst for better beer.

   In addition to Boston, The Boston Beer Company owns breweries in Cincinnati; Breinigsville, Pennsylvania; and Los Angeles. The company distributes its brews primarily in the US, but they are also sold in Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the UK, Israel, Mexico, and the Pacific Rim.

        <p>
   Beyond beer, the company makes 12 flavored malt beverages under the Twisted Tea brand name, and 10 hard ciders under the Angry Orchard brand. The Boston Beer Company's A&amp;S Brewing Collaborative (dba Alchemy &amp; Science) subsidiary makes 40 beers under four brand names. A&amp;S recently formed House of Shandy (since renamed Traveler Beer Co.), which brews shandy style beers (beer mixed with citrus, flavored soda, carbonated lemonade, ginger beer, or cider).
  </p>
        <p>
   In addition to production at its own breweries, the company contracts some of its production to brewers, among them Wisconsin-based City Brewing Company and New York-based Pleasant Valley Wine.

        <p>
   The company's media campaigns include TV, radio, billboards, and print. The brewer complements is media buying by sponsoring cultural and community events, local beer festivals, industry-related trade shows, and promotional events at local establishments.

        <p>
   Boston Beer Company achieved record-setting revenues in 2015, with sales reaching almost $960 million. Profits reached a milestone, peaking at $98 million during 2015. Cash flow from operations has also trended upwards the last five years, jumping 19% in 2015.
  </p>
        <p>
   The historic growth for 2015 was fueled by increased shipments and increased revenue per barrel due primarily to price spikes and changes in product and package mix, due to a shift in the mix from bottles and cans. Shipment volume for core brands also climbed by 4% due primarily to increases in shipments of Coney Island, Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard, and Traveler brand products that were partially offset by shipment declines in Samuel Adams brand products.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The domestic beer industry is dominated by two major brewers,
   <company id="47435">
    Anheuser-Busch InBev
   </company>
   and
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   , which together account for more than 85% of all US domestic beer production (excluding exports). Boston Beer -- along with a growing number of craft brewers -- competes in the Better Beer (as opposed to mass-produced) category.
  </p>
        <p>
   However, in order to growth further the beer giants have begun developing their own specialty beers and acquiring craft brewers to compete in this small, growth market. To keep adventurous drinkers brand-loyal, Boston Beer follows a strategy of frequently offering new beverages and discontinuing others. During 2015 the company launched specialty variety six-packs under the Samuel Adams Rebel Rider IPA, Samuel Adams Grapefruit IPA, and Samual Adams Rebel Raw names.

        <p>
   Management consultant James Koch started The Boston Beer Company with his former secretary, Rhonda Kallman, in 1983. With Koch's $100,000 in life savings plus $300,000 raised from family and friends, the company contracted with Pittsburgh Brewing to make beer using Koch's great-great-grandfather's recipe. (Louis Koch had brewed beer in Germany before opening a St. Louis brewery in 1860.)
