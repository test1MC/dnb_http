  <p>
   On the heels of a significant acquisition, Berry experienced a monumental year in 2016, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $6.49 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The historic revenue growth for 2016 was fueled by a massive 350% upsurge from its Health, Hygiene &amp; Specialties segment, primarily due to additional net sales from an acquisitions made, which amounted to $1.9 billion. The company also successfully penetrated the South American market in 2016, as sales in that region soared from a paltry $6 million to $336 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Berry's profits also surged by 174% to $236 million in 2016 primarily due to the higher net revenue and a decrease in debt payments made. In addition, Berry's operating cash flow has steadily grown over the years; it increased by 20% in 2015 and by 35% in 2016.

  <p>
   Berry views buying and allying as the path to survival and prosperity. It uses its acquisitions to build and hold market positions, expand product lines, and reduce manufacturing and overhead costs through complementary operations and the introduction of advanced processes. Since 1990, the company has completed more than 30 acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 Berry acquired
   <company id="51239">
    Avintiv
   </company>
   for $2.45 billion. Avintiv is a global producer of nonwoven specialty materials used in hygiene, infection prevention, personal care, and high-performance products with 23 locations in 14 countries. The combination created a global leader in plastics packaging and engineered specialty materials, extending Berry's overall footprint.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the summer of 2016, Berry agreed to acquire
   <company id="12492">
    AEP Industries
   </company>
   in a deal valued at $765 million, a price that includes AEP's debt load. AEP is a major manufacturer of flexible plastic packaging films in North America and will be combined with Berry's Engineered Materials Division.

   After about five years of being backed by private equity firms, Berry filed to go public in March 2012 and began trading in October. Berry ultimately raised $470 million to repay debt (it owed roughly $4.5 billion in long-term debt) and fund working capital and general corporate purposes.
