   Luxottica Group puts its competitors firmly in the shade. As the world's largest eyewear firm, Luxottica designs, makes, and sells eyeglass frames and sunglasses, offering more than 20 licensed designer brands (

   ) and a dozen house brands (Ray-Ban and REVO). The group's 7,000-store (about 615 stores are franchises) retail arm,

   group. It owns US sport sunglasses maker

    Oakley

   , as well as China's Modern Sight Optics. The company announced an agreement to merge with France-based lens-maker

   in 2017.

  <p>
   The group's retail operations account for about 60% of Luxottica's sales. Its wholesale distribution network covers more than 130 countries on five continents. Luxottica makes nearly 300,000 frames a day of its house brands, plus the licensed frames, and sells them worldwide through about 30 wholly- and majority-owned distributors and about 100 independent distributors.

  <p>
   The company has six design and manufacturing facilities in Italy, as well as three plants in China, one each India and Brazil, and one in the US, Oakley's sports and performance eyewear. Its products are sold in about 130 countries.

   Luxottica has reported growing revenue for the past five years. In 2014 it rose another 4% to €7.65 billion due to modest gains in the retail segment, especially LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut, and larger increases in wholesale with Ray-Ban, Oakley, and fashion designer brands Prada and Armani doing particularly well. Net income, which has also been rising steadily, picked up another 15% in 2014 to hit €646 million due to the higher revenue.

  <p>
   Luxottica is set to merge with France-based lens maker
   <company id="90714">
    Essilor International
   </company>
   after an agreement was reached between the two firms in early 2017. The two eyewear giants have been eyeing each others' turf for some time, as Luxottica has made moves into the lens space and Essilor into frames. Rather than going head-to-head, the two companies will merge, forming EssilorLuxottica with combined revenue of around €15 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luxottica has looked to its international holdings for growth in recent years and is actively extending its global reach through acquisitions. Through a string of purchases in China, including Modern Sight Optics, Xueliang Optical, and Ming Long, in recent years the Italian eyewear giant has cobbled together a network of about 900 stores, all of which have been renamed LensCrafters.

  <p>
   In 2014 Luxottica signed licensing agreements with

   , and tech giant

   . The deal will incorporate Google Glass technology in Oakley and Ray-Ban eyewear. The same year it signed a wearable tech agreement with

   Luxottica is due to merge with Essilor International in a €50 billion mega-deal that will see the combined company named EssilorLuxottica with €15 billion in annual revenue and 140,000 staff.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its strategy to continue acquiring sunglasses retailers in sunny, well-traveled locations, Luxottica in 2014 purchased Spanish firm Inveroptic, which operates a network of 10 Cottet Sol stores mostly in Barcelona.

  <p>
   Luxottica was founded in 1961 by Leonardo Del Vecchio, Italy's "King of Spectacles," who flies to work in his helicopter to avoid the tortuous mountain road that leads to the company's manufacturing headquarters. Del Vecchio owns about 70% of the firm.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The story of Luxottica Group begins with Leonardo Del Vecchio, the son of a Milanese street merchant. Leonardo's father died before he was born, so Leonardo spent seven years in an orphanage before beginning his apprenticeship in a tool and die factory. After attending art school, in 1961 he founded the company in the Agordo region of Italy with two partners he later bought out. The firm's initial business was the production of eyeglass components for Italian frame manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Del Vecchio soon realized he could command more profit if the company made all the components. He renamed his venture Luxottica Group and expanded his factory. He kept current with the latest technology, devised his own equipment, and adopted techniques from the jewelry industry to improve his product and minimize price increases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Interestingly, the company's first frames were not sold in Italy, but in the US when the company gave US distribution rights to Avant Garde in 1970. (The Luxottica line became available in Italy in 1975.) The company became the #1 eyewear maker in the US in the early 1980s after taking control of Avant Garde. During that decade it acquired nine of its 12 international distributors. In late 1988 it launched its Giorgio Armani designer eyewear line, later followed by Valentino and Yves St. Laurent (1990).
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1990 US sales accounted for more than half of the company's revenue. Luxottica went public in 1990, the first Italian company to bypass the Milan stock exchange in favor of the NYSE -- a move designed to emphasize its international scope. Since the company was debt-free, the $80 million proceeds from the IPO went straight into Del Vecchio's pockets.
  </p>
  <p>
   As part of its commitment to cut out the middleman and become vertically integrated, the company acquired US Shoe for $1.4 billion in 1995. US Shoe's big prize was LensCrafters, then a 600-store mall-based chain specializing in eyeglass frames and prescription lenses. The company, uninterested in US Shoe's apparel division (
   <company id="58454">
    Casual Corner
   </company>
   , August Max, and Capezio, among others), transferred the unprofitable division to a separate Del Vecchio interest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luxottica continued to emphasize designer eyewear and sunglasses. It bought Italian sunglass manufacturer Persol in 1995. In early 1999 Del Vecchio's son, Claudio, became co-CEO with Roberto Chemello. (David Browne, who was also named a co-CEO at the time, resigned in late 1999.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's 1999 purchase of Bausch &amp; Lomb's sunglasses business added top lines such as Ray-Ban, Arnette, Killer Loop, and Revo to its lineup. In April 2001 Luxottica acquired US specialty sunglasses retailer Sunglass Hut International for about $650 million ($462 million in cash and the assumption of more than $190 million in debt). Later that year Luxottica spent $25 million on behalf of its EyeMed Vision Care managed care division, buying Arizona-based First American Health Concepts, which markets and administers vision care plans; First American Health Concepts was subsequently absorbed into EyeMed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luxottica also acquired OPSM, Australia's biggest optical retailer, in 2003 thereby expanding its presence in the Australian and New Zealand markets. Luxottica's takeover of OPSM cost the company some $580 million, and the deal left the eyewear group with 481 stores in Australia, 80 in Hong Kong, 34 in New Zealand, and 12 each in Singapore and Malaysia. Following the termination of its agreement with
   <company id="54529">
    Giorgio Armani
   </company>
   in 2003, Luxottica signed a license agreement with
   <company id="54069">
    Gianni Versace
   </company>
   to produce its Versace, Versus, and Versace Sport sunglasses and prescription frames.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luxottica acquired Cole National (since renamed
   <company id="138031">
    Luxottica Retail
   </company>
   ) in 2004 to increase its US presence. Further expanding its US retail operations, the company also purchased D.O.C. Optics, an optical retail chain of about 100 stores in the Midwest. Also that year, the company signed a licensing agreement with LVMH darling
   <company id="42555">
    Donna Karan International
   </company>
   , for DKNY-branded eyewear.
  </p>
  <p>
   In May 2006 the company acquired Shoppers Optical, a 75-store Canadian optical chain. In June it signed a five-year franchising agreement with Azai Group to open 50 Sunglass Hut stores in the Middle East. It also acquired China's Modern Sight Optics with 28 stores in Shanghai. In September the firm sold its
   <company id="109655">
    Things Remembered
   </company>
   gift retail chain to private-equity investors GB Merchant Partners and Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Co. for about $200 million. In December Luxottica signed a 10-year licensing agreement with Tiffany &amp; Co., marking the luxury jeweler's entry into the eyewear market.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2007 the sunglasses manufacturer acquired rival Oakley, which specializes in sports eyewear and performance optics. The more than $2 billion deal boosted Luxottica's presence in the US.
