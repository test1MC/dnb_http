   , Redpath, Jack Frost, and Tate &amp; Lyle. Fanjul's other holdings include more than 400,000 acres of land, the 7,000-acre Casa de Campo resort, an airport, and a renewable-energy power plant, among other operations. The company boasts operations in some 20 US states, Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. Founded in 1987 by CEO Alfonso Fanjul, its origins go back through five generations of the Fanjul family, which began sugar farming in Cuba in the 1850s.

   Fanjul's two largest subsidiaries include Florida Crystals and its American Sugar Refining. As part of its business, it farms 187,000 acres in Palm Beach County, Florida, where it owns a pair of sugar mills, a sugar refinery, a packaging and distribution center, a rice mill, and North America's largest renewable power plant. The plant powers its sugar operations and about 60,000 homes.

   The company's Florida Crystals business has three processing plants: Okeelanta processes about 22,000 tons of sugar a day; its Osceola mill processes 13,500 tons a day; and the Sem-Chi rice mill handles rice products. In addition to refined sugar, the company holds an estimated 10 million tons of sugar cane, 50 million gallons of molasses, 2.3 million crates of corn and 50 million pounds of rice. The corn and rice are grown as part of the company's crop-rotation system. Its Florida Crystals plant produces the only certified organic sugar cane harvested in the US.

   Fanjul's group of companies includes Central Romana Corporation, the Dominican Republic's largest privately held company. Aside from its Casa de Campo resort, the holding consists of 240,000 acres of land for sugar production, real estate, and cattle. Central Romana Corporation's efforts are supported by Fanjul offices in Western Europe and Asia.
