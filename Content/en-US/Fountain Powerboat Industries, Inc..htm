   Fountain Powerboat Industries builds a range of sport boats, sport fishing boats, and express cruisers for aquatic speedracers with deep pockets. Overall, the company produces nearly a dozen Fountain-branded models, which range in length from 29 feet to more than 47 feet, and in speed from about 78 to 100-plus miles per hour. It offers, as well, several sports boats under its Baja brand acquired from rival

   In 1979 powerboat racer Reggie Fountain founded Fountain Powerboat Industries in a former tractor showroom to build speedboats. After going public in 1986, the firm was hit hard by a penny stock scandal that revealed inflated Fountain stock. In the early 1990s recession and a 10% luxury tax on cars, boats, and planes with $100,000-plus prices gutted demand for expensive watercraft, and Fountain was forced to sell 8% of the company to a group of European investors. In 1993 the tax was repealed, but the next year Fountain was again set back, this time by the cost of retooling its entire boat line to install new "positive-lift" bottoms to increase hull speed, acceleration, and fuel economy. A shortage of high-performance engines almost stopped Fountain's assembly lines, but completion of a new factory in 1995 put things back on course.

   In 1997 Fountain and boat-racing champ Fabio Bruzzi allied to design a new type of surface drive. Also that year Fountain ran into legal trouble with basketball star Michael Jordan, who claimed that an "Air Reggie" ad featuring a powerboat vaulting over the water was an infringement on his "Air Jordan" trademark. The company settled the lawsuit in 1998, agreeing to pay an undisclosed amount to Jordan.

   Fountain entered the yacht market after spending $9 million on plant expansion in 1998 to make its new 65-foot high-speed Supercruiser. The company also set up a defense-related unit that year and won a contract to make pursuit boats for the US Coast Guard. The company recorded a loss for fiscal 1998, in part from restructuring costs. Fountain ended its direct racing program and discontinued some of its tooling products in 1999.

   In 2000 the company began development of a wide-beam series of cruisers and fishing boats intended for the family-oriented, mid-range market.
