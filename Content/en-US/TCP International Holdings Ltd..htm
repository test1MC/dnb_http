   TCP International has a bright idea - let's make light bulbs! The company makes energy-efficient light bulbs such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, and halogen bulbs under the brands TCP, DuraBright, EcoSave, Fresh
   <sup>

   </sup>
   , and n:vision. It also offers fluorescent bulbs and fixtures, exit and emergency lighting, CFL fixtures, and ballasts. Organized as a holding company, TCP International operates through subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. It generates most of its sales in the US, where it operates through
   <company id="103932">
    Technical Consumer Products, Inc
   </company>
   . TCP International went public in 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company plans to use the bulk of its proceeds of $78.6 million from its July 2014 IPO to expand and improve its manufacturing process, as well as for research, development, and to commercialize LED products and other new technologies. Any remaining proceeds will be used to pay down debt or go toward other general corporate purposes. Following the offering, CEO Ellis Yan held about 41% of the company; President Solomon Yan, 24%.

  <p>
   Altogether the company offers more than 3,500 types of CFLs, more than 275 LEDs, and a dozen types of halogen bulbs. CFLs represent the largest product line, accounting for 67% of sales 2013. TCP International manufactures its products at four factories in China but uses third parties to make halogen bulbs. (It also has a product development and R&amp;D center in China and one in Ohio at Technical Consumer Products, Inc.)
  </p>
  <p>
   While the US accounts for the majority of sales, TCP International also sells its bulbs through more than 20,000 outlets from sales offices in Brazil, Canada, China, France, the Netherlands, Russia, and the UK. Its largest customer for the consumer market is

  <p>
   TCP International revenues grew by 36% in 2013 led by a 400% increase in LED product sales, a 21% rise in CFL product sales, and incremental net sales of $8.6 million from its acquisition of TCP B.V. in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
   It posted a net income of $8.2 million in 2013 (compared to a loss of $6.2 million in 2012) largely due to low much lower litigation costs than were reported in 2012.

  <p>
   TCP International has enjoyed strong sales in the US due to legislation designed to phase out inefficient incandescent bulbs. Not wanting to put all of its eggs in one basket, the company is working to increase sales in emerging markets where similar legislative efforts are under way. It has also set up shop in Brazil to put its products on major retailers' shelves.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company historically sold its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original lighting manufacturers (OLMs), but decided to shift away from this sales channel to focus on direct retail customers that offer higher margins.

  <p>
   The company was founded by CEO Ellis Yan, who was born in China but came to the US to study in the 1980s. Ellis and his brother, company president Solomon Yan, established Technical Consumer Products in China in 1989 and formed a US sales subsidiary in 1993. The US office of Technical Consumer Products filed to go public in 2000 but withdrew the IPO in 2002. Because Chinese law forbids direct foreign investment, TCP reorganized in 2010 to establish a registered office in Switzerland to act as a holding company for its operations in other countries. TCP International is owned by Ellis and Solomon Yan.
