   MRV has completed a number of asset divestitures in recent years to streamline its operations. It continued in 2015 with the sale of Tecnonet, its Network Integration subsidiary based in Rome, to Maticmind for about $21 million. MRV had begun investing in Tecnonet in 1998 and upped its stake in the unit in subsequent years.

   Competition in the networking equipment markets is intense, with MRV going up against such heavyweights as
   <company id="41751">
    Alcatel-Lucent
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13494">
    Cisco Systems
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="59788">
    Huawei Technologies
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   . The company must continually develop, introduce, and market new products to remain competitive. Product development and engineering expenses totaled about $21 million in 2014.
