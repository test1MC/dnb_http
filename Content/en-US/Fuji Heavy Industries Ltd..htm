   Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI) is the parent of
   <company id="113548">
    Subaru of America
   </company>
   , the automotive company known for its all-wheel-drive (AWD) technology found in cross-over vehicles (a sedan drive with SUV looks), such as the Forester and Outback, and in the Impreza, Legacy, and Tribeca models. Through some 80 subsidiaries, FHI has manufacturing operations in China, Japan, Taiwan, and the US, where it operates through Subaru of America. Other FHI businesses include Aerospace (aircraft and structural components), and Industrial Products (general-purpose engines, agricultural machinery, and machine tools). However its core business is Subaru automobiles, representing more than 90% of sales.

   Strong momentum at Subaru of America, the company's core business, is driving sales and profit growth for Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI). Indeed, in fiscal 2014 (ended March) FHI reported sales of $23.4 billion, up 15% versus the prior year. Net income rose 59% to $2 billion over the same period. Subaru sold 424,683 vehicles in the US in 2013 and the company expects to sell at least 500,000 in 2014, marking its fifth straight year of record sales here. Subaru represented 93% of FHI's total fiscal 2014 revenue, while the Aerospace business accounted for 5%.
  </p>
  <p>
   FHI's Aerospace arm posted a 40% increase in sales in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year, while the Industrial Products division saw its sales dip 1%. The company credited increased sales to Japan's Ministry of Defense and

  <p>
   The company is focused on advancing transportation technology with innovations that include the horizontally-opposed Boxer Engine, Symmetrical All-Wheel drive, the advanced driving support system "EyeSight" in the automotive business, and the unmanned aircraft system in its aerospace business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji Industrial Products holds a large share in the global general-purpose engine market with more than 2,000 models, one of which is the Robin engine, which is sold in more than 70 countries. Fuji's Eco Technologies supplies vehicles (Fuji Mighty sanitation truck) used to collect and transport waste products, as well as wind-power systems. Its Clean Robot division was the first to commercialize floor-cleaning robots for high-rise buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji Aerospace manufactures main wings and other structural aircraft components. It is the primary contractor of the AH-64D combat helicopter to the Japan Defense Agency (JDA). Fuji Aerospace also supplies JDA with fixed-wing aircraft and primary trainers, and manufactures components for
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   aircraft (767/777); its center wing box is part of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Other technology includes unmanned aircraft and development of a Fuji Aerial Robot (FABOT) system that uses GPS navigation and handles takeoffs and landings by small, fixed-wing aircraft.

  <p>
   Chikuhei Nakajima started the Aircraft Research Laboratory north of Tokyo in 1917, renaming it the Nakajima Aircraft Company in 1931. Amid the ashes of WWII, Nakajima formed Fuji Sangyo to make products with aircraft technology in 1945. His motor scooters used bomber tail wheels, and he later added buses with unibody frames. Nakajima died in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji Sangyo joined four other firms in 1953, and Fuji Heavy Industries was born. The Subaru car division debuted in 1958, and FHI went public two years later. The firm expanded product lines throughout the 1960s, and in 1968 Nissan Motor invested in FHI. The relationship lasted more than 30 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Subaru expanded to the US in 1968 with the help of furniture retailer Harvey Lamm. Lamm, visiting Japan, saw Subaru's utilitarian front-wheel-drive station wagon and recognized its potential. He convinced FHI to make him its US importer, and he set up Subaru of America. Lamm ultimately became chairman and CEO of the US subsidiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1975 FHI exported the four-wheel-drive Subaru GF to the US; it was the country's first four-wheel-drive car for the mass market. High energy prices and the appeal of a four-wheel-drive car drove sales in the 1970s and early 1980s. By 1986 Subaru achieved 12 straight years of record sales and profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next year, however, a rising yen boosted Japanese car prices, and sales dips fueled round after round of incentives. Profits tanked, and Subaru responded by expanding trim levels and power train choices. The misstep confused shoppers and sales nose-dived.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1987 FHI and Isuzu teamed up to build an assembly plant (Subaru-Isuzu Automotive) in Indiana while other makers introduced minivans and sport utility vehicles. Focusing on cars, Subaru missed the start of the SUV boom. Even the arrival of the Legacy in 1989 failed to jumpstart sales. Lamm left Subaru in 1990, and two years later Subaru's US arm posted a record loss of $250 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Veteran CFO George Muller took over as president and COO of Subaru of America in 1993. Saddled with inventory, plummeting sales, and a poor brand image, he promptly launched one of the greatest turnarounds in US automotive history.
  </p>
  <p>
   Muller refined the niche Lamm carved out in the 1970s. He cut every product from the lineup that lacked all-wheel-drive. Enlisting the Legacy, a car-SUV hybrid (Outback) was created in 1995 by lifting the body a few inches and adding beefy-looking body attachments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Muller took aggressive steps at the corporate level to cut costs and build a culture of risk-taking, initiative, and speed. By 1999 profits were back to record levels. In Japan, though, trouble at parent FHI overshadowed Subaru's rejuvenation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 revelations surfaced that FHI bribed legislator Yojiro Nakajima (a former official in Japan's defense agency and grandson of Chikuhei) to secure government contracts for a sea rescue aircraft. FHI had also illegally funneled cash to Nakajima to help his 1996 election bid. Nakajima, along with FHI's chairman and several former executives, was arrested. He later committed suicide, and FHI was barred from bidding on defense contracts for one year.
  </p>
  <p>
   GM bought 20% of FHI for $1.5 billion in 1999. The deal included the 4% held by FHI's largest investor, Nissan. GM won access to FHI's all-wheel-drive technology and provided FHI resources to develop more-efficient fuel systems. Midway through 2000 Muller resigned from Subaru.
  </p>
  <p>
   FHI struck a deal with Airbus in 2001 develop the company's new

   <company id="10640">
    GM
   </company>
   also unveiled plans to jointly produce an all-wheel-drive sport wagon to be built at the Subaru-Isuzu plant in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   FHI announced in 2002 that it would cease production of bus bodies and railway cars by March 2003. Later that year FHI bought
   <company id="43868">
    Isuzu Motors
   </company>
   ' 49% stake in the companies' carmaking joint venture, Subaru-Isuzu Automotive. FHI renamed the company
   <company id="120065">
    Subaru of Indiana Automotive
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That same year FHI implemented sweeping changes in an effort to focus on its core business -- building cars. The Fuji Dynamic Revolution-1 plan (FDR-1) aimed to increase sales by 35% by 2007 and to remake Subaru as a luxury brand. Part of the original plan was for the company to leverage its relationship with GM to reduce procurement and purchasing costs. GM, however, decided largely to terminate its relationship with FHI and has sold its 20% stake in the Japanese manufacturer, about 9% of it going to
   <company id="41889">
    Toyota Motor
   </company>
   . It sold the remaining 11% through Fuji's open-market share-buyback program and through regular market sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the first product tie-up since Toyota became FHI's largest shareholder, the two companies announced in early 2006 that Toyota Camrys would be built at FHI's Subaru of Indiana plant. That production began the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 FHI made a few adjustments to its FDR-1 plan. The company restructured its sales networks, and layed off about 700 workers to meet its cost reduction goals. The notion of transforming into a luxury brand, however, was deemed to be infeasible from a cost standpoint. FDR-1's successes were mixed. FHI managed to increase sales, but profits were hurt by poor sales at home in Japan and meager sales of higher-end Subaru models in the US, which were likely slowed by high fuel prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2007 FHI established its Overseas Sales and Marketing Divisions I &amp; II. The first overseas division is dedicated to centralizing control of manufacturing and sales activities in the US. The move aimed to bring refinement and sophistication to the Subaru brand in the US while capitalizing on its reputation of offering affordable, compelling AWD vehicles.
