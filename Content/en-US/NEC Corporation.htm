   NEC knows a little something about Networking, Electronics, and Computers and the convergence thereof. The Japanese tech giant provides a broad range of IT products and services through software, hardware, integration, and consulting. It offers system integration, maintenance and support, outsourcing, cloud services, and equipment for government, healthcare, finance, and media markets. For telecom customers it provides network infrastructure, services, and management. NEC's thick portfolio also includes system platforms with hardware, software, enterprise networks, and services. NEC does most of its business domestically.

  <p>
   NEC gets nearly 80% of its revenue from three segments of its business.
  </p>
  <p>
   The public segment accounts for 28% of revenue. It handles system integration, maintenance and support, outsourcing and cloud services, and equipment systems geared towards government, healthcare, finance, and media.
  </p>
  <p>
   About 26% of revenue comes from the system platform segment. It develops and sells hardware (including servers, mainframes, supercomputers, storage, PCs, tablet devices, ATMs, control equipment, wireless LAN routers, displays, and projectors), software (integrated operation management, application servers, security, and database software), enterprise network products (IP telephony systems, WAN and wireless access equipment, and LAN products), and services (data center infrastructure, maintenance, and support).
  </p>
  <p>
   Another segment supplying around a quarter of revenue (24%) is telecom. It provides network infrastructure (optical transmission systems, submarine cable systems, routers and switches, mobile phone base stations, and mobile backhaul) and services and management (telecom operations and management services.
  </p>

  <p>
   Japan accounts for 80% of NEC's revenue. The remaining 20% is somewhat evenly split between Europe, the Americas, and China and the Asia-Pacific region.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   NEC posted 3.5% lower revenue in 2015 from 2014 despite 15% growth in its public segment. It lost ground in platform, enterprise, and its mixed product and services segments. Net income, however, jumped 70% higher. A combination of gains in foreign exchange and a decline in impairment costs boosted the bottom line. Cash flow from operations dropped 7% because of a change in inventories and an increase in cash used in notes.

   NEC hopes to take advantage of several initiatives in Japan to drive business in the coming years. It will seek to sell systems to the national and local governments as a national ID number system is implemented in Japan. The company will market itself for inclusion in efforts to put on the 2020 Olympic games and Paralympic Games in Tokyo. NEC wants to expand in software define networks (SDN), cloud services, and big data.

  <p>
   A group of Japanese investors, led by Kunihiko Iwadare, formed Nippon Electric Company (NEC) in a joint venture with Western Electric (US) in 1899. Starting as an importer of telephone equipment, NEC soon became a maker and a major supplier to Japan's Communications Ministry. Western Electric sold its stake in NEC in 1925. The company became affiliated with the Sumitomo
   <i>
    keiretsu
   </i>
   (industrial group) in the 1930s and went public in 1949.
  </p>
  <p>
   After

   </company>
   (NTT) was formed in 1952, NEC became one of its four leading suppliers. The post-WWII need to repair Japan's telephone systems and the country's continuing economic recovery resulted in strong demand from NTT for NEC's products. In the 1950s and 1960s NTT business represented more than half of sales, even though NEC expanded overseas, diversified into home appliances, and formed a computer alliance with
   <company id="10062">
    Honeywell
   </company>
   . NTT, which began acquiring shares in the company decades earlier and owned as much as 59% of NEC, sold its stake in the 1960s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the 1970s Honeywell's lagging position in computers hurt NEC; the company recovered through in-house development efforts and a mainframe venture with Toshiba. In 1977 CEO Koji Kobayashi articulated his revolutionary vision of NEC's future as an integrator of computers and communications through semiconductor technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   NEC invested heavily in R&amp;D and expansion, becoming the world's largest semiconductor maker in 1985. Despite its proprietary operating system, NEC garnered more than 50% of the Japanese computer market in the 1980s. NEC entered into a mainframe computer partnership with Honeywell and France's

   in 1987.
