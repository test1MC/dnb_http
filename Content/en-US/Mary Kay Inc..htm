   Celebrating more than 40 years in business, Mary Kay is in the pink as one of the top direct sellers of beauty products in the US. It offers more than 200 products in six categories: body care, color cosmetics, facial skin care, fragrance, nail care, and sun protection. Some 3.5 million independent sales consultants demonstrate Mary Kay products in the US and about 35 other countries; the company also sells products through its website. Consultants vie for awards each year that range from jewelry to its trademark pink Cadillac (first awarded in 1969). The Mary Kay Ash Charitable Foundation funds cancer research and domestic violence programs. The family of founder Mary Kay Ash owns most of the company.

   The beauty company's headquarters is located in Addison, Texas, north of Dallas. It tests, manufactures, and packages most of its own products in facilities in Dallas, China, and India.

   Mary Kay works hard to retain the feel of a small company, despite its more than 2-million-strong independent sales force and the company's growing international reach. As part of this initiative, each beauty consultant receives the option to buy his or her own website to use for selling to clients. More than 90% of its revenue is generated through online orders by the company's independent sales force. In recent years, Mary Kay began rolling out e-commerce capacity on its websites. The company has said that it doesn't see selling products from its MaryKay.com website as a threat to cannibalize sales from independent representatives, citing that most of its customers buy Mary Kay products as part of a relationship with their consultant.

   Founded by a woman for women, Mary Kay has an overwhelmingly female independent sales force. The company has seen its sales force grow by double digits during the past couple years, thanks to a fast-growing group of younger (age 24 to 35) representatives. Indeed, the average age of a Mary Kay consultant -- now 36 years old -- has been dropping. The company hopes that younger salespeople will attract younger customers and lure them away from competitors the likes of

   , Mary Kay is extending its reach into China as it chases after the huge potential upside to selling in the nation. It also establishing a third-party manufacturing facility in India (in Baddi and Uttaranchal) to develop products specifically for the Indian market. Product launches have included a bath bar, Mary Kay Lotus and Bamboo Indulgent. Mary Kay plans to invest some $20 million in India to tap the local market and diversify its business. The direct seller anticipates expanding its existing categories in India -- skincare, fragrances, and color cosmetics -- and supporting its about 4,000 independent sales representatives in the country by opening several additional regional warehouses and local offices.

  <p>
   Before founding her own company in 1963, Mary Kay Ash worked as a Stanley Home Products sales representative. Impressed with the alligator handbag awarded to the top saleswoman at a Stanley convention, Ash was determined to win the next year's prize -- and she did. Despite that accomplishment and having worked at Stanley for 11 years, a male assistant she had trained was made her boss after less than a year on the job. Tired of not receiving recognition, Ash and her second husband used their life savings ($5,000) to go into business for themselves. Although her husband died of a heart attack shortly before the business opened, Ash forged ahead with the help of her two grown sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   She bought a cosmetics formula invented years earlier by a hide tanner. (The mixture was originally used to soften leather, but the tanner noticed how the formula made his hands look younger, and he began applying the mixture to his face, with great results.) Ash kept her first line simple -- 10 products -- and packaged her wares in pink to complement the typically white bathrooms of the day. Ash also enlisted consultants, who held "beauty shows" with five or six women in attendance. Mary Kay grossed $198,000 in its first year.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company introduced men's skin care products in 1964. Ash bought a pink Cadillac the following year and began awarding the cars as prizes in 1969. (By 1981 orders were so large -- almost 500 -- that GM dubbed the color "Mary Kay Pink.")
  </p>
  <p>
   Ash became a millionaire when her firm went public in 1968. Mary Kay grew steadily through the 1970s. Foreign operations began in 1971 in Australia, and over the next 25 years the company entered 24 more countries, including nations in Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Central and South America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales plunged in the early 1980s, along with the company's stock prices (from $40 to $9 between 1983 and 1985). Ash and her family reacquired Mary Kay in 1985 through a $375 million LBO. Burdened with debt, the firm lost money in the late 1980s. Mary Kay took a number of steps to boost sales and income, doing a makeover on the cosmetics line and advertising in women's magazines again (after a five-year hiatus) to counter its old-fashioned image. The company also introduced recyclable packaging and lipstick in a tube (replacing brush-on palettes). In 1989 Avon rebuffed a buyout offer by Mary Kay, and both companies halted animal testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1993 Mary Kay opened a subsidiary in Russia, which later became the company's fourth-largest international market (behind Mexico, China, and Canada). Ash suffered a debilitating stroke in 1996.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 Mary Kay began selling through retail boutiques in China because of a government ban on direct selling. Changing with the times, Mary Kay added a white sport utility vehicle and new shades of pink to its fleet of 10,000 GM cars that year.
  </p>
  <p>
   Chairman John Rochon was named CEO in 1999. Also in 1999 Mary Kay launched
   <i>
    Women &amp; Success
   </i>
   (a magazine for consultants) and Atlas (its electronic ordering system).
  </p>
  <p>
   In June 2001 Richard Rogers, now the company chairman and son of Ash, replaced Rochon as CEO. A month later Mary Kay introduced the Velocity Products line, targeting girls ages 14 to 24. Ash died on Thanksgiving Day 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mary Kay Poland, headquartered in Warsaw, became the company's 34th international market in mid-2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Rogers became executive chairman and David Holl, previously president and COO, was named president and CEO.
