   Martek Biosciences' products promote the popularity of pond scum. The
   <company id="91357">
    Royal DSM
   </company>
   subsidiary has developed nutritional oils from microalgae and fungi for use in infant formula, pregnancy and nursing products, foods and beverages, dietary supplements, and animal feed. Its oils -- branded life's DHA and life's ARA -- are made from omega-3 fatty acid DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and omega-6 fatty acid ARA (arachidonic acid). Along with selling its products directly and through distributors, Martek licenses the oils to customers worldwide that include pharmaceutical companies, drug retailers, and nutritional supplement manufacturers.

   The company focuses on healthy and natural food ingredients for children, and other products, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is the major supplier of DHA used in infant formula in the US, and its products are used in about 75% of infant formulas globally.

   Some of Martek's competition comes from fish. Fish oil, that is. DHA can also be derived from fish-oil, so Martek has worked to differentiate itself from fish-oil based products by marketing its products as the vegetarian DHA option. The company doesn't seem to be losing too much market share to the fish-oil option, even though some of its clients, such as Abbott, have received clearance from the FDA to use the fish-oil derived products in their US infant formulas. Martek also seeks to beat the competition by researching additional applications for its products, such as investigating the benefits of DHA against neurological, cardiovascular, and vision disorders.

   The company made a bold move to enter the consumer products market when it acquired
   <company id="139433">
    Amerifit Brands
   </company>
   for $200 million in mid-2010. Amerifit makes over-the-counter nutritional products including Culturelle probiotic supplements and AZO for urinary tract infections. Martek planned to use Amerifit as a platform to commercialize its own consumer wellness products, which are still in developmental stages.
  </p>
  <p>
   Previous to that acquisition, Martek already had a presence in the consumer foods market through its ingredients business. The company licenses its
   <em>
    life'sDHA
   </em>
   product to some 200 food and beverage manufacturers including
   <company id="42651">
    Dean Foods
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10359">
    Coca-Cola/Minute Maid
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10811">
    JM Smucker
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="15745">
    Starbucks
   </company>
   , which have all launched products containing
   <em>
    life'sDHA
   </em>
   .

   Martek was acquired by Royal DSM in 2011 for $1.1 billion. Martek was previously focused on US sales; becoming part of Royal DSM immediately gave Martek (already a Royal DSM supplier) a presence in about 49 countries worldwide. Royal DSM, on the other hand, sought out Martek to help bulk up its existing nutrition holdings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to joining the Royal DSM family, the company was working to streamline all of its manufacturing operations to reduce costs. For example, in late 2010 Martek sold most of its manufacturing assets in Winchester, Kentucky, to Alltech, an animal health company, for $14 million. The deal bars the use of Winchester's assets to produce competing omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids for human use for a decade. The company also exited its contract manufacturing operations -- which included the production of enzymes, vitamins, and other specialty products for third parties at its South Carolina facility -- to focus on its more profitable oils business.
