   Don't confuse Kyocera's ceramics with teacups and pottery. The company, which began producing fine ceramic materials nearly half a century ago, makes a wide range of industrial ceramics and other electronic and semiconductor components for customers in the telecommunications, automotive, medical, electronics, and industrial manufacturing industries, among others. In addition to its components business, the company makes various types of finished electronics products, including wireless phones and office equipment. Kyocera's subsidiaries and affiliates around the world include Kyocera Mita,
   <company id="43608">
    Kyocera International
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="44083">
    AVX Corporation
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Kyocera's component business is its largest, at about 60% of sales. That business has four segments: electronic device (about 20% of overall sales), fine ceramics (manufacturing and processing applications), applied ceramics (medical implants, cutting tools, solar energy), semiconductor parts, and electronic device components. Its equipment business is divided into an information segment (more than 20% of overall sales) and a telecommunications segment. Equipment sales cover mobile phone handsets, LCD panels, office equipment such as printers, and more. The company's remaining segment provides business and management consulting and sells chemical materials.

  <p>
   The company generates almost 60% of sales outside Japan with Asia, Europe, and the US accounting for similar levels of sales.

   Kyocera's sales slipped 3% to about ¥1.5 billion in 2016 (ended March) from 2015. The company posted higher sales in the Electronic Device Group and Fine Ceramic Parts Group, boosted by demand for capacitors used in smartphone and camera modules used for automotive applications. However, sales fell in its other business units. In Semiconductor Parts Group, sales ticked down 1% from lower sales of ceramic packages for digital consumer equipment and reduced product prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's net income came in at ¥109 million in 2016, 6% lower than 2015. Kyocera reported higher costs for materials and labor in 2016, compared to 2015. Cash generated by operations jumped about 50% in 2016 from 2015 because of decreases in receivables and inventories in 2016.

  <p>
   Kyocera develops a number of technologies so its investment in research and development is key to growth. The company spent 6% more on R&amp;D expenses in 2016 (ended March), compared to 2015. It projected further increases in R&amp;D and overall capital spending inn 2017 with a good portion of the money going to expand the production capacity of its Semiconductor Parts Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Kyocera isn't among the top sellers of smartphones, it has staked a claim to rugged, military grade handsets. The latest in its line of rugged phones was the DuraForce PRO, a 4G LTE smartphone running on the Android operating system. It offers features for business and consumer users.
  </p>
  <p>
   Within the company, Kyocera  is merging two of its businesses to reduce costs and strengthen management. Kyocera Crystal Device and Kyocera Connector Products develop and make crystal components and connectors, respectively. The combination of the businesses are expected to bolster the crystal product lines while sharing manufacturing and consolidating marketing.

   Kyocera acquired Nihon Inter Electronics Corporation (NIEC), a manufacturer of power semiconductors, in 2015. Combining the companies' products should move Kyocera into new markets.

  <p>
   Born to a poor Japanese family in 1932, Kazuo Inamori never quite fit the mold. He went to work for Shofu Industries (ceramic insulators) in the mid-1950s, but quit three years later and started Kyoto Ceramic KK with seven colleagues in 1959. Their first product was a ceramic insulator for cathode-ray tubes. In the late 1960s the company developed the ceramic package for integrated circuits (ICs) that made it a world-class supplier.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kyoto Ceramic started manufacturing in the US in 1971. A few years later the company began to diversify its interests when it ventured into artificial gemstones (Crescent Vert, 1977) and dental implants (New Medical, 1978). In 1979 Inamori bought control of failing Cybernet Electronics (Japanese citizens-band radio maker), using it to move Kyoto Ceramic into the production of copiers and stereos.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company merged five subsidiaries in 1982, forming Kyocera Corporation. The 1983 acquisition of Yashica moved it into the production of cameras and other optical equipment. That year Kyocera ran into trouble. At the time, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (
   <company id="41780">
    NTT
   </company>
   ) was the only legal supplier of phones in Japan, and when Kyocera started marketing cordless phones without the required approval, the government forced it to recall the phones.
  </p>
  <p>
   The government abolished NTT's monopoly in 1984, and Kyocera joined 24 other companies to form Daini-Denden ("second phone company") -- now
   <company id="55288">
    KDDI
   </company>
   . In 1988 Inamori set up Kyocera regional offices in Asia, Europe, and the US. The company bought Elco (electronic connectors, US) in 1989 and
   <company id="44083">
    AVX
   </company>
   (multilayer ceramic capacitors, US) in 1990.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to diversify further, Kyocera entered into a series of alliances in the 1990s that included partnerships with
   <company id="41862">
    Canon
   </company>
   to produce video and electronic optical equipment, with
   <company id="59002">
    Carl Zeiss
   </company>
   (Germany) to make cameras and lenses, and with
   <company id="12986">
    Cirrus Logic
   </company>
   to make chips for a cordless phone project.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Guangdong-based optical instrument joint venture began making cameras and lenses for the Chinese market in 1996. The next year Inamori went into partial retirement. In 1998 the company took over failed copier maker Mita Industrial, which was a major buyer of Kyocera's electronic components.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1999 Kyocera acquired Golden Genesis (solar electric systems, US) and changed the company's name to
   <company id="46112">
    Kyocera Solar
   </company>
   . In the same year Kyocera's product line grew even more diverse as it entered the health food market and began selling mushroom products in Japan. Kyocera purchased the wireless phone business of
   <company id="11436">
    QUALCOMM
   </company>
   in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year the company's acquisition of failed copier maker Mita Industrial (which changed its name to
   <company id="108897">
    Kyocera Mita Corporation
   </company>
   ) was approved. The deal included the forgiveness (by Mita's creditors) of most of Mita's debt and a cash infusion in Kyocera Mita by Kyocera.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kyocera was hit hard in the early 21st century by weak demand for electronics and telecommunications gear, as more than 80% of its business came from customers in the information technology and telecom markets. In response, the company worked to diversify its customer base by developing products for new markets, such as components for the automotive industry.
