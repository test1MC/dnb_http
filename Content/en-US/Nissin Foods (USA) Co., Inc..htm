In 2012 the company launched Top Ramen Cucharealo, a product with Fideo-type noodles available in homestyle flavors. Its Top Ramen Short Cuts launched in 2012, as well. The pre-seasoned, spoonable noodles come in a multi-serving format that allows (for the first time) Nissin Foods (USA) consumers to choose how much of the product to prepare.
