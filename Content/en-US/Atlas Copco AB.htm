   Atlas Copco has the globe covered with products and services that enhance industrial productivity. Serving all major continents, the group is the world's largest manufacturer of air compressors. It also sells and rents such equipment as expanders and air treatment systems, drilling and rock excavation equipment, construction and demolition tools, and power tools and assembly systems. Its products are used by a wide range of industries, from aerospace and automotive to infrastructure and oil and gas. Additionally, Atlas Copco offers used equipment, maintenance and repair services, training, logistics, and aftermarket parts.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Atlas Copco's global reach spans more than 170 markets in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia/Pacific.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The group has more than 75 production facilities in 20 countries, though manufacturing is mainly concentrated in Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Italy, India, China, and the US. Its distribution centers, located in Europe and the US, handle outbound logistics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atlas Copco is organized into four main business areas: Compressor Technique, Mining and Rock Excavation Technique, Construction Technique, and Industrial Technique. These business areas each operate through divisions. The divisions are also separate operational units, each responsible for driving growth and profit in line with objectives set by the business area.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Atlas Copco's products are sold and rented under different brands through a worldwide sales and service network reaching 170 countries. The company has its own sales operations (customer centers) in about 80 countries, while in other countries its offerings are marketed through independent distributors and service networks.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2011 Atlas Copco reported record revenue and profit as demand for its products and services increased significantly, especially in the second half of the year. Revenue was up 16% and profit was up 31% over 2010, itself a record growth year. Growth was especially strong for compressors, mining equipment, and industrial tools. One of Atlas Copco's strengths is the diversity of its business, with its four business areas and five geographic territories contributing relatively balanced portions of revenue. Atlas Copco's 2011 and 2010 results follow a recession that impacted performance by more than 5% in 2009 and 40% in 2008. At that time, the company focused on cutting working capital and manufacturing overhead, including headcount by nearly 10%.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Atlas Copco's strategy is four-fold: organically increasing its presence in growth markets (this includes making select acquisitions that support organic growth); strengthening its aftermarket business (which includes consumables, parts, service, maintenance, and training); developing new and improved products through research and development; and maintaining operational efficiency. The aftermarket business in particular provides a steady revenue stream that helps the company stay resilient in difficult economic times.
  </p>
  <p>
   An established player in Europe, Atlas Copco is trying to match that market presence particularly in Asia and North America. In China and the US, for instance, the company is doing so through a combination of organic initiatives (new office and production facility openings) and acquisitions of smaller companies that are rounding out its product portfolio in each of its four business areas. Atlas Copco isn't abandoning Europe, however, as it continues to make select acquisitions in markets like Belgium, France, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. In other territories, Atlas Copco is winning large contract orders for equipment in South and Central America. It will deliver drilling rigs to a copper project in Panama in 2014 and 2015 and to a gold mining company in Venezuela in 2013. It is also supplying equipment for Colombia's largest hydropower project.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the product development side, Atlas Copco is launching a slate of energy-efficient products, such as oil-free screw blowers, large oil-injected screw compressors, centrifugal compressors, and a medical air vacuum system. It also unveiled various air products with a selection of dryers and a high-capacity filter.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Atlas Copco typically makes smaller, "bolt-on" acquisitions of manufacturers and distributors around the world to support the three stages of its growth strategy: extending its core business, building new businesses related to the core; and adding new technologies and markets. Among its recent acquisitions are distributors in the US, Spain, and Columbia; Gesan, a Spanish manufacturer of generators; GIA, a Swedish manufacturer of underground mining equipment; Houston Service Industries, a US manufacturer of energy-efficient blowers; and SCA Schucker, a German manufacturer of adhesive equipment for the automotive industry.

  <p>
   Eduard Fränckel, chief engineer of Swedish Rail, founded the company in 1873 to make railroad equipment. It had a successful start by making wagons and railroad carriages. By 1876, however, competition had forced the company to diversify into producing steel bridge structures and frames for buildings and church towers. While this strategy worked for awhile, by 1887 losses forced Fränckel to leave the company, and in 1891 the business went into liquidation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Financier A. O. Wallenberg, whose financial backing had helped found the company, was its largest shareholder. He restructured Atlas and provided the loans needed to keep it alive. When Wallenberg died in 1886, his son, K. A. Wallenberg, took his seat as a director and recruited Oscar Lamm as managing director. Lamm reversed the company's fortunes, shifting it into the production of steam engines and machine tools. In 1892 Marcus Wallenberg became a board member and ran Atlas alongside Lamm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Lamm and Wallenberg, the company bought the Swedish rights to produce Rudolf Diesel's engine and formed a new company (with Wallenberg's brother, Knut) -- AB Diesels Motorer. Lamm's nephew, Gunnar Jacobsson, became managing director of New Atlas in 1909. Demand increased for the company's diesel engines and machine tools before and during WWI. So in 1917 the company produced its last steam locomotive and merged AB Diesels and Atlas into one company -- AB Atlas Diesel -- with Jacobsson as its managing director.
  </p>
  <p>
   The diesel engine business slumped after the war. Marcus Wallenberg, who had claimed chairmanship in 1933, was forced to provide loans to Atlas to keep it afloat. When Jacobsson retired in 1940, Wallenberg hired Walter Wehtje as managing director and shifted the company away from its money-losing diesel engine operations and into producing air compressors.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII forced Sweden to increase its farm acreage in order to sustain its population. The effort utilized the company's compressors and air tools to remove large boulders from rock-strewn fields. After the war Atlas focused on increasing exports. To compete, it provided technical services with its products, and by the late 1940s business had increased tenfold. The company dropped its unprofitable diesel engine line in 1948, and in 1956 it changed its name to Atlas Copco.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developing ergonomic designs for its power tools provided rich dividends in the 1960s. In 1968 the company restructured into mining and construction, airpower, and tools segments. Tom Wachtmeister became CEO in 1975, and in 1980 the company made several purchases in the US to strengthen its revenues. Atlas Copco acquired Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. (1987) and became the world's largest maker of air compressors in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
   Michael Treschow, the managing director of Atlas Copco Tools AB, replaced Wachtmeister as CEO in 1991. He carried on the company's acquisition policy until he left in 1997 and was succeeded by Giulio Mazzalupi. In 1997 Atlas Copco bought Prime Service, one of the US's largest equipment rental companies, and in 1999 it bought US-based Rental Service Corporation (RSC) and its more than 290 equipment rental centers. The next year RSC bought 11 companies, as well. In early 2001 Atlas Copco acquired Masons Holdings Ltd., a UK-based generator manufacturer and renamed the company Atlas Copco Masons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atlas Copco expanded its construction and mining technique business in 2002 with the acquisitions of Krupp Berco Bautechnik GmbH (a Germany-based manufacturer of hydraulic demolition equipment for the mining and construction industries) and its sister company in France from ThyssenKruppTechnologies AG. Giulio Mazzalupi was succeeded as president and CEO that year by Gunnar Brock.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2004, citing limited synergies within the manufacturing and selling of electric tools versus Atlas Copco's other businesses, Atlas Copco announced the selling of Atlas Copco Electric Tools (Germany) and
   <company id="104030">
    Milwaukee Electric Tool
   </company>
   to Techtronic Industries for $713 million. The deal became official in January 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2006 Atlas Copco exited its Rental Service division when it sold most of its stake in
   <company id="51476">
    RSC Equipment Rental
   </company>
   to
   <company id="61408">
    Ripplewood Holdings
   </company>
   and Oak Hill Capital Management for about $3.4 billion. Atlas Copco retains about a 14% stake in RSC.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decision to explore options for its Rental Service unit came in early 2006 as the company determined its rental operations were not a good strategic fit with its manufacturing activities. With operations limited to North America, Rental Service needed international expansion to grow. Atlas Copco decided investing further in Rental Services was not the best strategy for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   While 2005 was a decent year for Atlas Copco -- with high raw materials and purchased goods costs offset by price increases and improvements in operating efficiency -- 2006 was the best year in the company's history. All of the company's major geographic markets turned in double-digit growth. Orders from continuing operations increased by 23%. Revenue grew by 20% and operating profit grew by 33%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atlas Copco grew its compressor business through targeted acquisitions in China and North America, but greater still was organic growth fueled by new products, improvements in its sales and distribution network, and focus on the aftermarket.
  </p>
  <p>
   The construction and mining division also grew through the acquisition of Swedish compaction and paving equipment maker Dynapac AB in early 2007. The division also experienced strong global demand for equipment, as well as consumables, such as drill bits and drill steel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 the company's multiple acquisitions included mining industry service company PT Fluidcom Jaya, in Indonesia, and the European air compressor rental business of
   <company id="57686">
    Aggreko
   </company>
   . Atlas Copco also invested in the southeastern US market, purchasing Industrial Power Sales, a distributor of tools, assembly systems, and material handling equipment, and Grimmer Industries' booster and portable compressor business.
  </p>
  <p>
   CEO and president Gunnar Brock stepped down in mid-2009. Ronnie Leten assumed the position to lead the company through recovery from the economic recession. Leten previously served as president of Compressor Technique.
  </p>
  <p>
   During 2010 Atlas Copco acquired Austria's Hartl, a maker of mobile crushing and screening equipment, and Netherlands-based Cirmac International, which specializes in renewable energy technologies, used to upgrade biogas to natural gas. More significant, Atlas Copco purchased Quincy Compressor from
   <company id="105543">
    EnPro Industries
   </company>
   for $190 million. Quincy complements Atlas Copco's core products with a portfolio of branded compressors (reciprocating and rotary screw) and vacuum pumps, as well as its presence in the US and China. Smaller acquisitions included H&amp;F Drilling Supplies in the UK; Servis. A.C., a compressor service provider in the Czech Republic; a remaining 75% stake in Indian companies Focus Rocbit and Prisma Roctools; and Compressor Engineering, a UK distributor and service provider for compressed air equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the bolt-on businesses that broaden Atlas Copco's network, in fall 2010 the company took over the sales and marketing operations of its distributor in Michigan, Kramer Air Tool. The deal followed acquisitions of distributors in the southern US, Tooling Technologies, the northwestern US, American Air Products, and Louisiana-based Premier Equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In mid-2011 Atlas Copco acquired Spain-based GESAN S.A., a manufacturer of diesel and petrol generators. The deal gives it a better foothold with a distributor network that reaches 85 countries, with Russia and other parts of Europe and Africa as principal markets.
