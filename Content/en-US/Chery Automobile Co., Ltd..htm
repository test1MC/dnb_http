   Founded in 1997, Chery Automobile quickly has grown to become one of China's biggest carmakers. The company currently builds about 15 models of passenger cars, minivans, and commercial vehicles, including the QQ compact, the A5 sedan, and V5 crossover. Chery sells about 800,000 vehicles a year and can produce about 900,000 cars and 450,000 transmissions per year. The company's cars are sold under the brands Chery, Eastar, and Tiggo. Its Tiggo5 brand of vehicles and transmission systems was launched in China in 2013.

   Headquartered in China, the company's service network covers some 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. It has operations in South and Central America, Middle East, and Asia.

   Chery serves customers through a network of distributors in China and as well as internationally through exports. Its customers include research institutes of key automakers and airplane makers, national research institutes and research institutes of universities and colleges (such as research institutes and laboratories of Benz, GM, Ford, Volkswagen, Boeing and Airbus).

  <p>
   Potential barriers on Chery's road to success include China's general lack of state-of-the-art design, engineering, and production expertise. To combat this, companies like Chery staff their engineering and design houses largely with former Chinese expatriates who return home after receiving educations in Western universities. These employees, however, can be hard to retain in industrial Chinese towns. For help in improving its R&amp;D and production capabilities, Chery is partnering with established car companies for parts sourcing and other support.

  <p>
   To boost its distribution base in the Middle East, in 2013 Chery formed a partnership with a top UAE automobile distributor, Al Habtoor, who now sells Chery's passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles in the emerging region. In 2012 Bosch (China) Investment Co.(Bosch China), Atech Automotive Electronics Co. (Atech), and Chery signed an agreement in Beijing to establish a joint venture to develop and manufacture car multimedia products, including combination instruments and information entertainment systems.
