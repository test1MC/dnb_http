   Mag Instrument was born from a bright idea. In the 1970s, the company invented the anodized aluminum flashlight and now counts police officers, firefighters, and mechanics among its fans and target audience. Mag Instrument's products appeal to a broad audience, with flashlight models ranging in size from as long as a police night stick to the size of a pencil. The company also makes rechargeable flashlight systems and accessories. Mag Instrument's products are sold in the US at outdoor goods retailers (
   <company id="14346">
    Oshman's

   ), hardware stores (
   <company id="11338">
    Sears
   </company>
   ), and discounters (
   <company id="10440">
    Target
   </company>
   ), as well as internationally. Founded in 1955, Mag Instrument is still run by founder Tony Maglica.
