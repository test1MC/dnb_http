   Toss an 850-page &#160;Harvard Bioscience catalog toward a bioscience researcher and it will keep him or her&#160;busy for hours. The company develops, manufactures, and markets the scientific gizmos and instruments used in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, and government labs worldwide. Its 11,000-item product line focuses on molecular biology and&#160;ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicology) testing.&#160; ADMET tests&#160;are used to screen drug candidates. Other products include spectrophotometers,&#160;multi-well plate readers,&#160;and protein calculators.&#160;Customers can shop directly online, from its printed
   <em>

   </em>
   catalog, or through distributors.

        <p>
   As part of its operations, the company has manufacturing facilities in the US, Germany, Sweden, Spain, the UK, France, and Canada. Its own manufactured products account for 65% of its sales, while complementary products made by other manufacturers account for the balance. The company operates part of its business through the Life Science Research Tools (LSRT) division and the Regenerative Medicine Device (RMD) division. LSRT primarily concentrates on developing, making, and selling apparatus and scientific instruments (such as ADMET testing and molecular biotechnology) used to advance life science research. It caters to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, and government labs. The RMD division develops, makes, and markets stem cell therapy injectors and bioreactors for regenerative medicine, catering to surgeons in the field.

   Harvard University is increasingly focused on the market for regenerative medicine. Through its regenerative medicine device business, Harvard Bioscience markets a handful of novel products, focusing on products associated with bioreactors for growing organs for human transplant. Its bioreactor products help engineer tissue for hollow organs, bronchus, trachea, and blood vessels. Harvard Bioscience's first bioreactor was used in 2010 to perform the world's first human transplant of a regenerated bronchus (airways of the lung). It also developed the first artificial organ -- a trachea -- using stem cells. Harvard Bioscience believes the regenerative market could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars. Until then it's counting on its catalog of devices to keep its sales healthy. Primary drivers of the company's organic growth are new product development and an expanding sales force. Like most other medical device companies, Harvard Bioscience introduces next-generation or improved versions of some of its best-sellers to gain new revenue.

   Harvard Bioscience logged a modest 1% revenue increase in 2011 vs. 2010. Its acquisitions of Coulbourne Instruments and CMA Microdialysis helped to prop up revenue, as well as positive currency fluctuations. Conspiring to erode gains for Harvard Bioscience were revenue decreases across its Biochrom and Hoefer businesses due to slow sales particularly to GE HealthCare as its Denville group worked to boost the business overall. Harvard Bioscience, meanwhile, saw its net income slip some 80% in 2011 as compared to 2010, attributable to higher operating costs due to rising sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Net interest expenses -- coming from higher average debt balances in 2011 vs. 2010 -- also contributed to increased net income expenses.

        <p>
   Through its wholly owned Biochrom Ltd. subsidiary, which makes plastic consumable laboratory products such as pipette tips, Harvard Bioscience acquired AHN Biotechnologie GmbH in 2012. The company plans to use AHN Biotechnologie as a foundation for the future expansion of its molecular biology business in Germany. The deal follows Harvard Bioscience's 2011 purchase of preclinical business CMA Microdialysis AB in an effort to expand its Life Science Research Tools segment.

        <p>
   Founded in 1901 by a Harvard University professor in need of better equipment, the private company was purchased in 1996 by a group of investors. Since then, it has grown through a steady string of acquisitions which have brought in new product lines, new technologies, and new distribution relationships.
