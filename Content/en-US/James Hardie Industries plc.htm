   James Hardie Industries takes the rap for wrapping homes in fiber cement siding. A pioneer in cellulose-reinforced fiber cement, building materials company James Hardie uses the material to create products for residential and commercial construction, including siding (Hardiplank), external cladding, walls, fencing, and roofing. The company's largest segment, USA Fibre Cement, has made substantial inroads into the US siding market, where it is now one of the largest siding producers. Hardiplank siding has gained popularity for its durability and low maintenance. James Hardie operates in the US, Canada, Europe, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.

  <p>
   James Hardie works in two segments based somewhat on geography. The North America and Europe Fiber Cement segment makes fiber cement interior linings, exterior siding products, and related accessories in the US. That segment generates 80% of the company's revenue. The other segment covers James Hardie's operations in the Asia/Pacific region and it accounts for the other 20% of revenue. Products are made in Australia and the Philippines and sold in those countries and in New Zealand, throughout Asia, and the Middle East.

  <p>
   James Hardie posted a 4% revenue gain for 2016 (ended March), hitting $1.73 billion, compared to $1.66 billion in 2015. In the US and Europe segment the company reported a 9% rise on higher volumes from the new construction and repair-and-remodel markets. A price increase set at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year also played a part in boosting revenue. In the Asia/Pacific market revenue dropped 10% for 2016, which the company blamed on the exchange rate between the strong US dollar and the weaker Australian dollar. The segment also had higher operating costs, which were related to the start of a new production facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income fell 16% in 2016 from 2015, dropping to $244 million from $291 million because of the impact of higher expenses and currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash inflow from operations was $260 million in 2016, compared to $179.5 million in 2015 because of changes in working capital from timing in accounts receivable and accounts payable.

  <p>

It spends around $30 million a year on research and development with some $7.5 million going to commercialization projects.
