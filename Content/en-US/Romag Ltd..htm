   Romag's glass products are virtually unbreakable. The company's Security and Transport glass made of polycarbonate laminates is blast resistant and used in limousines and security vehicles; it is also popular with military and government agencies, banks, courts, high-end retail shops, and police stations. Its specialty glass products offer safety, renewable energy, and windows on the world. The glass specialist makes customized PV (photovoltaic) panels under brand name PowerGlaz. Its Architectural glass (tinted or solar control coated) provides insulation and protection. In mid-2016, Romag was acquired by Clayton Glass Group.

   Romag in mid-2016 was acquired by Clayton Glass Group, a provider of insulated glass units for the domestic sector and specialist glass for conservatories. Like, Romag, Clayton is also based in the UK. Both companies continue to operate completely independently so that both can focus entirely on continuing to grow their specialist market share.

   Romag grows its business and enters new markets by introducing new glass products. In 2016 it entered the fire door glass market by launching a new fire resistant range, featuring two panes of glass separated by a transparent in-tumescent interlayer, that provides a flexible offering for fire door, fire partition, fire exit corridor, and fire exit staircase applications.
