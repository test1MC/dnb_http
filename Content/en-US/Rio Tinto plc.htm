   No, you are not seeing double. Rio Tinto plc, one of the world's largest mining operations (along with
   <company id="41757">
    BHP Billiton
   </company>
   and
   <company id="95034">
    Vale
   </company>
   ), is the British half of a tandem of dual-listed companies. Rio Tinto plc's Australian counterpart is
   <company id="52987">
    Rio Tinto Limited
   </company>
   , which has its headquarters in Melbourne. Rio Tinto explores for a variety of commodities: bauxite, coal, copper, diamonds, gold, iron ore, minerals (borates and titanium dioxide), nickel, and potash. Iron ore makes up about 46% of the group's sales. The company also produces aluminum through its
   <company id="42408">
    Rio Tinto Alcan
   </company>
   unit.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates in Australia and North America with significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. China is Rio Tinto's largest geographic segment, accounting for 38% of 2014 revenues.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Rio Tinto engages in the exploration and mining and processing of metals and other mineral resources. Its products include aluminum, copper, diamonds, thermal and metallurgical coal, uranium, gold, industrial minerals (borax, titanium dioxide and salt), and iron ore.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 2014 the company's net revenue decreased by 7% due to lower iron ore and energy sales as a result of lower prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Rio Tinto improved its net loss to $28 million (compared to a net loss of $2.8 billion in 2013) primarily due to lower operating expenses and impairment charges, and a decrease in losses on external debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 the company's cash flow decreased by 5% due to lower taxes and lower net interest paid.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   By focusing on a strategy of developing large-scale, long-life mining operations, Rio Tinto has tried to weather commodity prices that have dipped and risen over several years. Rio Tinto's tight-fisted operating style, while providing exceptional margins for its industry, has drawn the ire of unions, which have been critical of the company's employment and environmental records.
  </p>
  <p>
   To raise cash, in 2017 Rio Tinto agreed to sell most of its underperforming Australian coal assets to China-backed
   <company id="56571">
    Yanzhou Coal
   </company>
   in a deal worth up to $2.45 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it sold Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique to International Coal Ventures Private Limited and 50.1% of its Clermont Joint Venture to GS Coal Pty Ltd, a company jointly owned by
   <company id="101467">
    Glencore
   </company>
   and
   <company id="56930">
    Sumitomo
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That year, the company signed an option agreement with LNG Canada (a joint venture owned by Shell Canada Energy, Phoenix Energy Holdings Limited, Kogas Canada LNG Ltd, and Diamond LNG Canada Ltd) to buy or lease a wharf and associated land at its port facility at Kitimat, British Columbia.

  <p>
   Following a tough 2009 in which the global recession depressed commodity prices, Rio Tinto rebounded strongly in 2010, posting a 35% increase in overall revenues due primarily to increased sales volumes and prices generated by the beginnings of an economic recovery. Leading the pack for Rio Tinto was its Iron Ore segment, which saw an increase of 91% over the previous year, followed by the Copper segment with a hike of 24%, and the Energy unit with 15%. Profitability soared in 2010, as net income jumped more than 184% due to lower operating costs and significant reductions in debt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its failed effort the previous year to hike its 9% stake in Rio Tinto to 19%, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) formed a joint venture with Rio Tinto in 2010 to operate an iron ore project in Guinea, West Africa. A Chinalco subsidiary will hold 47% of Rio Tinto's Simandou project, which is expected to begin producing up to 70 million tons of ore per year by 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 Rio Tinto and Chinalco teamed up again on a new joint venture that will focus on mineral exploration in China. Chinalco is seeking to find and develop domestic sources of copper, coal, and potash to offset the cost of importing those raw materials. Chinalco will hold a 51% interest in the joint venture, Chinalco Rio Tinto Exploration, with Rio Tinto holding the remaining 49%.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the world's largest producers of copper, Rio Tinto operates the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, along with Canada's Ivanhoe Mines and the Mongolian government. Vancouver-based Ivanhoe controlled one of the world's largest untapped copper and gold deposits in Mongolia, and Rio Tinto expects the mine to be one of the world's top 10 copper producers, as well as one of the top gold producers, by 2018. In 2012, Rio Tinto upped its holding in Ivanhoe from 49% to 51% to become the majority owner.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in early 2012, Rio Tinto completed its offer for Canada-based uranium producer Hathor Exploration, valued at $578 million, after rival
   <company id="51623">
    Cameco Corp.
   </company>
   made a takeover bid for the company in 2011. Hathor supplies about a fifth of the world's uranium.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2011 the company also started slimming its aluminum operations. It placed 13 assets on the chopping block, allowing
   <company id="42408">
    Rio Tinto Alcan
   </company>
   to focus on its high-quality, tier one assets (mostly in Canada) and improve performance. The company also planned to transfer its stakes in six Australian and New Zealand operations to a new business unit, Pacific Aluminium.The new unit, managed and reported separately from Rio Tinto Alcan, would include the company's Gove bauxite mine and alumina refinery, Boyne Smelters and Gladstone Power Station, Tomago smelter, and Bell Bay smelter in Australia. In New Zealand it would include the New Zealand Aluminium Smelters.
  </p>
  <p>
   For at least a while longer the company is holding on to seven noncore assets managed by Rio Tinto Alcan, including operations in France, Germany, the UK, and the US. The company is in no hurry to sell and may wait until the economy improves before divesting certain operations. Rio Tinto has tried a similar divestment strategy before. It embarked on a divestment plan in the mid-2000s, with the long-term goal of turning out $15 billion from its divestments. By 2010, the company had gained more than $10 billion from the divestment program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rio Tinto was formed in 1972.
