   Aviat Networks makes data fly through the air. The company designs and manufactures wireless network transmission equipment -- primarily microwave and millimeter technologies sold under the Eclipse and CTR 8000 brands, among others -- used to link and manage both fixed and wireless voice and data networks. It also provides network management and turnkey support services and sells third-party networking equipment such as antennas and routers. Aviat's customers include mobile network operators, public safety agencies, private network operators, and utility and transportation companies in more than 170 countries; the company gets about 55% of its sales outside the US.

  <p>
   As part of its network management software offerings, Aviat has introduced AviatCloud, an application-based platform for automating and virtualizing networks and operations. The early version of the cloud product started with applications for cloud based-network management and microwave network design. The company plans to also offer further simplification of network planning, purchasing, and lifecycle management as it expands AviatCloud.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company outsources manufacturing of its hardware to contractors in Asia and the US.

  <p>
   North America is Aviat's largest market, accounting for more than 45% of sales. Africa and the Middle East contribute more than 30% of sales, with the remainder coming from Europe and Russia and Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.

  <p>
   Aviat's revenue plunged about 20% to $269 million in 2016 (ended July) from $336 million in 2015. Less business from wireless operators and a longer sales cycle with private network customers, despite an increase in volume, knocked sales lower for 2016. Revenue dropped in all geographic markets, led by a $28 million fall (18%) in North American sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aviat continue a decade-long string of net losses finishing 2016 $30 million in the red. The loss widened from the $25 million loss of 2015 despite reductions in sales and marketing and research and development expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company reported negative cash flow of $126,000 in 2016, down from about $9 million the year before and $29 million in 2014. The change came from changes in working capital and adjustments for non-cash items offset by the higher net loss.

  <p>
   Aviat has restructured over several years to reduce expenses, including headcount reductions. But through 2016 (ended July) restructurings and sales have not combined to bring the company to profitability. The 2016-2017 restructuring included reducing its headquarters space by some 100,000 sq. ft. in a move from Santa Clara to Milpitas, California. The company also moved to operate more efficiently by instituting lean management methodologies. In operational resource allocation, Aviat moved money to invest in its private network offerings in the near-term, which, it hopes, sets it up for longer-term sales with mobile operators.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company has cultivated relationships with private network operators -- government agencies and companies with their own networks -- to provide short-term revenue as it develop technologies for bigger network operators such as cell service providers. It has won contracts with state agencies in the US and with governments overseas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aviat's introduction of its cloud service gets it in the ballgame for newer network management systems. The industry is turning to software to manage communications networks and away from the routers and switches hardware that Aviat has produced. The company's services revenue, about 40% of the total, could use a boost. It fell about 20% in 2016 from 2015.
