Remaining production is primarily in the US and, to a small extent, through an investment in India.

  <p>
   Superior Industries' revenues have declined the last three years, falling 2% from $745 million in 2014 to $728 million in 2015. Profits, however, more than doubled from $9 million to $24 million during that same time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenues in 2015 were unfavorably impacted by a decline in the value of the aluminum component of sales, which it generally passes through to its customers and resulted in $11 million lower revenues. The average selling price of wheels also decreased by 2%.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its surge in profits for 2015 was fueled by a decrease in labor and other costs, due to the reallocation of production from the US to facilities in Mexico, as well as the decline in aluminum prices. In 2015 its operating cash flow skyrocketed by a massive 410% due to the spike in profits coupled with favorable changes in inventories.

  <p>
   Superior Industries' strategy for growth includes keeping a tight lid on costs and optimizing its operating structure. In 2014 it closed its manufacturing facility in Rogers, Arkansas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to the anticipation of continued growth in demand for aluminum wheels in the North American market. With the addition of a new facility in Mexico in 2015, it expanded its manufacturing capacity to allow for growth in the next couple of years. It is also working to expand this newest Mexico facility by augmenting its production capacity by 500,000 wheels, allowing the company to more efficiently meet elevated customer demand.
