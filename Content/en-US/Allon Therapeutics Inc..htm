   Allon Therapeutics wants to make Alzheimer's a distant memory and halt other progressive brain diseases. The company's primary focus is on developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that lead to memory loss and cognitive impairment. Its lead candidate Davunetide (aka: AL-408), is in development as a treatment for progressive supranuclear palsy. The candidate is also being considered as a treatment for an early form of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Other peptides in its pipeline are being considered as possible treatments for such mental disorders as fetal alcohol syndrome and schizophrenia. Allon filed for Canadian bankruptcy in 2013 and was acquired by

   </company>
   that July.

   In late 2012, after disappointing results in a Davunetide study, Allon cut about 40% of its staff. In mid-2013 it announced that it had filed a proposal with the Official Receiver under the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. It named Deloitte &amp; Touche Inc. as its trustee for the proposal. It also entered a non-binding agreement with Paladin Labs through which Paladin soon acquired Allon.

   The company was based in San Diego but moved to Vancouver after it was acquired in 2004 by Neuro Discovery, a venture capital firm that invested in Canadian biotechnology companies. After the merger, Neuro Discovery took the name Allon Therapeutics and a new venture capital firm was formed called Neuro Discovery Investment Management.
