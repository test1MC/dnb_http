   While not a household name, GCT Semiconductor enables activities most people are familiar with. The fabless semiconductor company's wireless communications chips include LTE-based radio-frequency (RF) transceivers for cell phones, WiMAX networking chips, and RF transceivers for WLAN equipment. Its single-chip LTE product for smartphones is used in mobile devices made by

    LG
   </company>
   and sold by
   <company id="102492">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="100576">
    Verizon
   </company>
   , among others. Unlike many chip developers, GCT has its semiconductors fabricated with a CMOS silicon process. GCT was co-founded in 1998 by CEO Kyeongho Lee. The company filed an IPO in 2011 but withdrew it in 2014.
