   Ocean Spray Cranberries has transformed that ubiquitous Thanksgiving side dish into a big business with beverages, cereals, and snacks. Known for its blue-and-white wave logo, Ocean Spray is a top US maker of canned, bottled, and shelf-stable juice drinks. Formed in 1930, the cooperative is owned by more than 700 cranberry and grapefruit growers in North America. It produces juice drinks by blending the cranberries with other fruits, typically ranging from apples to blueberries. Its other products include fresh and dried cranberries, sauces, trail mixes, and instant oatmeal, along with fresh citrus fruits. Ocean Spray sells its products through food retailers, foodservice providers, and food makers worldwide.

   Looking to diversify its products portfolio and further target health-conscious Baby Boomers, Ocean Spray has worked to expand beyond the cranberry's traditional role on holiday tables. The company's promotional efforts have been aided by research showing that cranberry juice can reduce urinary tract infections and fight stomach ulcers.
  </p>
  <p>
   To this end, Ocean Spray has introduced a "white juice" made from pre-ripened cranberries that have a less tart taste, as well as a line of pomegranate juice drinks (pomegranate being one of the superfruits touted for its antioxidant properties). It also has transformed dried cranberries into Craisins, which now show up in co-branded cookies and cereals, and expanded the line with the introduction of pomegranate- and blueberry-flavored Craisins.

  <p>
   Ocean Spray Cranberries traces its roots to Marcus Urann, president of the Cape Cod Cranberry Company. In 1912 Urann, who became known as the "Cranberry King," began marketing a cranberry sauce that was packaged in tins and could be served year-round. Inspired by the sea spray that drifted off the Atlantic and over his cranberry bogs, Urann dubbed his concoction Ocean Spray Cape Cod Cranberry Sauce.
  </p>
  <p>
   It didn't take long for other cranberry growers to make their own sauces, and rather than compete, the Cranberry King consolidated. In 1930 Urann merged his company with A.D. Makepeace Company and with Cranberry Products, forming a national cooperative called Cranberry Canners. During the 1940s it added growers in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington and, to reflect its new scope, changed its name to National Cranberry Association.
  </p>
  <p>
   Canadian growers were added to the fold in 1950. Urann retired in 1955, and two years later the co-op introduced its first frozen products. To take advantage of the popular Ocean Spray brand name, in 1959 the company changed its name to Ocean Spray Cranberries.
