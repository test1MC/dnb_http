   , and
   <company id="14337">

  <p>
   The company's storage products account for nearly two-thirds of its revenue. The tape automation systems is its biggest product unit, bringing in 27% of sales. Scale-out storage solutions provides 16% of sales with device and media and disk backup systems each accountinf or about 10%. The company's service business is 28% of sales.

   Quantum maintains sales offices in China, France, Germany, Singapore, the UK, and the US (in several states). It has research and development facilities in Australia and the US (in several states) and 24-hour, multi-language technical support centers in North America, Europe, and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The US is its largest single market, accounting for 62% of sales. Europe makes up about 27% of sales and Asia accounts for the remaining 11%.

   Quantum sells its products through resellers such as
   <company id="16199">
    CDW
   </company>
   and distributors (including
   <company id="48020">
    Ingram Micro
   </company>
   ) through its Quantum Alliance Reseller Program. OEM customers that resell its hardware under their own brand names typically assume responsibility for sales, service, and support. (A large percentage of sales come from a few customers, some of which are also competitors.) In addition, Quantum sells directly to some corporate clients and government agencies. Customers range from small businesses to multinational corporations.

  <p>
   Quantum arrested seven straight years of declining revenue, reporting $553 in revenue in 2015 (ended March), the same as 2014. Sales of the company's tape systems dropped 13% in 2015 as customers turned to other storage media. Sales of its scale-out storage systems jumped 62%, but the unit is not big enough to offset the tape decline. The 27% slide in royalty revenue in 2015 was in relation to higher revenue it posted in 2014 from an intellectual property settlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Along with stable revenue, lower R&amp;D and sales and marketing costs helped Quantum leap to a $16.7 million profit in 2015 from a loss of $21.5 million in 2014. The company also realized $13 million from the sale of its take in a privately held company. Cash flow from operations was $6 million in 2015 compared to $35.5 million in 2014.

  <p>
   New technologies have replaced demand for tape-based storage products, and Quantum has seen its business decline as a result. The company has kept up with disk products by emphasizing software solutions, branded disk systems, next generation object storage, virtual offerings, and cloud solutions. Notable new product introductions include StorNext 5 software, DXi 4700 disk systems, expansion of the Lattus Object Storage offerings, and adding new features to the Scalar i6000 enterprise library.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quantum has also expanded its strategic partnerships to combine Lattus with products from other partners to reach data center environment solutions, to provide an object storage-based private cloud solution, and to create an archiving solution that reduces the burden of unstructured data growth on primary storage.
  </p>
  <p>
   To remain competitive, the company has transitioned all of its manufacturing to contract manufacturers. Until 2014 some products were produced in China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and the US. Now its disk products, vmPRO appliances, StorNext appliances, tape automation systems, tape devices, and service parts are made by third parties in China, Hungary, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the US.

  <p>
   In 2014, Quantum acquired Symform Inc.'s cloud storage services platform and development team. The move provides Quantum with technology and expertise to leverage scale-out storage and data protection to expand its offerings.

  <p>
   Founded in 1980 by a group that included David Brown and James Patterson, Quantum was almost immediately successful. It began making 8-in. hard disk drives in 1981 and reported $14 million in sales its first year. Plus Development was founded in 1983 as Quantum's sales, marketing, and R&amp;D arm.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="12644">
    Apple
   </company>
   became a customer in 1986. The next year Plus Development won a patent for its Hardcard, a "hard-disk-on-a-card" that slid into floppy disk drives. Hardcard sales jumped from about $10 million in 1986 to more than $60 million in 1987. However, Quantum fell behind in the hard disk drive market in 1987, losing 8-in. and 5.25-in. drive sales as the industry began moving to 3.5-in. formats. To focus the company on this market, CEO Stephen Berkley turned over manufacturing to Japan's Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics (MKE), a leader in robotics manufacturing and a subsidiary of Matsushita Electric (now
   <company id="41873">
    Panasonic
   </company>
   ). The move helped Quantum get its first 3.5-in. models to market in 1988.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the strength of those drives, Quantum added such customers as
   <company id="14833">
    Sun Microsystems
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="10723">
    Hewlett-Packard
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   .
   <company id="41876">
    NEC
   </company>
   paid almost $3 million to Quantum in a patent infringement settlement in 1988. The company in 1989 introduced high-end drives for the larger servers that had begun powering corporate computer networks, but the products failed to generate interest. Another suit settled in 1990 called for
   <company id="12460">
    Western Digital
   </company>
   to pay Quantum $3.7 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   William Miller, formerly with Control Data Systems, succeeded Berkley as CEO in 1992. Quantum and MKE renewed their long-term agreement; Quantum had the exclusive right to design and market worldwide and MKE had the exclusive right to manufacture worldwide. Quantum lost market share as demand exceeded supply in 1992. When demand faltered less than a year later, a price war began.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Quantum bought the disk, tape, and solid-state drive and thin-film head operations of Digital Equipment Corp. The $348 million purchase expanded the firm's mainframe and minicomputer product lines. In 1995 Michael Brown, who rose through the ranks after joining Quantum's marketing team in 1984, became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trying to manage Digital's and Quantum's incompatible lines played havoc on operations and in fiscal 1996 Quantum lost $90 million. The company contracted its unprofitable high-end disk drive production to MKE, closing plants and laying off 2,250 workers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sales of the company's tape drive products for backing up large libraries of data, a small part of the 1994 Digital acquisition, nearly tripled in 1997. Augmenting its existing tape storage business, Quantum in 1998 bought high-end automated tape library system maker ATL Products for $300 million. In 1999 the company bought
   <company id="16061">
    Meridian Data
   </company>
   , a maker of network-attached storage (NAS) hardware and software. Costs associated with the ATL acquisition and the closure of an MKE joint venture led to a $30 million loss for fiscal 1999. Later in 1999 Quantum laid off as many as 800 employees. It also created separate tracking stocks for its two units -- the successful digital tape business and the struggling disk drive business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company announced more layoffs with plans to cut its DLT &amp; Storage Systems (DSS) Group workforce by about 20%. Quantum exited the hard-disk drive sector after more than 20 years when it sold its Hard Disk Drive Group to rival
   <company id="14049">
    Maxtor
   </company>
   in 2001. Quantum scrapped plans to spin off its network-attached storage (NAS) business as a separate public company called
   <company id="102606">
    Snap Appliance
   </company>
   , opting to merge those operations with its tape library business (formerly ATL Products) to form its Storage Solutions Group (SSG); Quantum later spun off Snap as a private company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Former
   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   COO Rich Belluzzo replaced Brown as Quantum's CEO in 2002. The company also acquired privately held tape drive maker Benchmark Storage Innovations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quantum acquired tape storage provider
   <company id="132333">
    Certance
   </company>
   for approximately $60 million in cash in 2005. The following year Quantum greatly expanded its product line when it purchased
   <company id="51733">
    Advanced Digital Information Corporation
   </company>
   (ADIC) for about $770 million. In addition to expanding Quantum's tape-based offerings, the ADIC purchase brought disk-based backup systems and data management software to its portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the ADIC acquisition boosted sales and brand awareness, it also left the company with a great deal of debt. Quantum owed about $186 million on a senior secured credit agreement with
   <company id="40794">
    Credit Suisse
   </company>
   , and refinancing of notes left it nearly $122 million in debt to EMC International Company.
