   In addition to a broad customer base, DIAM's equally broad product portfolio includes components for hybrid vehicles. Its entry into the hybrid market began about a decade ago with supplying a battery electronic control unit for Toyota's Prius. DIAM's lineup of battery monitoring technologies are used in high-voltage batteries (such as lithium-ion) to regulate fluctuating voltages. Other green products developed by DIAM range from a plant-derived resin radiator tank to DC-DC converter, an integrated starter generator, and an electric compressor.

   The company's parent company saw its North America revenue jump 29% from 2013 to 2014. Expansion was driven by steady growth throughout the continent, along with increased automobile sales in the Southeast Asia region and other emerging markets. North America accounted for 20% of its parent company's sales.

  <p>
   Earlier in 2013, the company's parent company announced an initiative to invest nearly $1 billion in North America over the next four years to expand its existing production lines, create new production lines, and open a new assembly and warehouse facility to support its heavy duty customers. Out of this total, $750 million will be invested in the US. It began investing around $45 million in its main Southfield, Michigan, operations and invested $105 million in the opening of a new thermal assembly plant in Urbandale, Iowa.

   In 2014 DIAM announced that its Mexican subsidiary will expand its plant in Apodaca, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, to increase production of transmission components in the North American region. The expansion represents an investment of $54 million and will add 8,200 sq. meters of space.

   In 2014 DENSO acquired 72% of EASE Simulation, a provider of vehicular diagnostic products and services. It made the deal in order to accelerate the research and development of DIAM's vehicle diagnostic and telematics business in North America.

   The parent company expanded into North America in 1965. DENSO's first sale in the US was a starter generator for a chainsaw product; its success paved the way for establishing DIAM's manufacturing and sales activities in 1985.
