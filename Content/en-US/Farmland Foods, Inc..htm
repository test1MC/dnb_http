   The tasty possibilities for pigs keep Farmland Foods in the pink. The company produces fresh pork and packaged meat products in the US and sells them at home and in Mexico, Canada, Russia, China, and Japan. Its packaged meats -- marketed under name brands Farmland, Roegelein, and Ohse, and private labels -- include ham, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, deli and luncheon meats, and specialty items, such as precooked bacon and sausage, and lower-fat/lower-salt meats. Farmland Foods sells a large portion of fresh pork (butts, loins, and ribs) to retail customers; packaged meats are also sold to grocery chains, as well as wholesale distributors, and the food service industry. It is a subsidiary of

    Smithfield Foods

   .

   As part of the effort to regain its footing, Smithfield Foods won funding from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic in 2010 to help replace and upgrade legacy operations at Farmland Foods' Monmouth, Illinois processing plant. On its heels, the parent company shuttered six plants, including Farmland Food's New Riegel, Ohio plant, and transferred production to other, more efficient facilities. Farmland's fresh pork sales force was also consolidated with

   's (another Smithfield pork subsidiary) and Farmland's food service business assimilated sister Smithfield subsidiary
   <company id="108562">
    North Side Foods

   . North Side supplies the quick-service restaurant market, including
