   Dentsply Sirona (formerly Dentsply International) makes a range of dental goods, from anesthetics, pastes, and tooth whiteners to artificial teeth, crown and bridge materials, and implants. It also makes dental equipment, including root canal instruments, ultrasonic polishers, X-ray viewers, and orthodontic appliances. The company manufactures its various products under more than 100 brand names; it also sells products made by third parties. More than half of its products are sold through domestic and international distributors, but the firm also sells directly to dentists, dental labs, and dental schools in more than 120 countries.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dentsply Sirona's product offerings in various geographic regions reflect the demand of local markets. Developed markets, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and Western Europe, require more technically advanced dental products used in preventive and cosmetic procedures. Less-developed countries in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East typically call for more basic equipment used to fill cavities and finish bridgework. Dentsply Sirona is focused on supplying products to both ends of this spectrum.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company operates in two business segments -- Dental and Healthcare Consumables, which designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes dental and medical device products; and Technologies, which designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes dental implants, imaging systems, and orthodontic products.Dental products represent the largest business for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prior to 2016, when the company restructured itself after the merger of Dentsply and Sirona, its three operating segments were Dental Consumables, Endodontic and Dental Laboratory Businesses (about half of net sales in fiscal 2015); Healthcare, Orthodontic, and Implant Businesses (around a third of net sales in 2015); and Select Developed and Emerging Markets Businesses (nearly 20% of net sales).
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   With products sold in 120 countries around the world, the US is Dentsply Sirona's largest single market, accounting for more than one-third of sales. Germany is its second-largest single market; in that country, and the rest of Europe, its sales are dependent upon government-sponsored reimbursement rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dentsply Sirona is headquartered in the US and has its internatinal headquarters in Salzburg, Austria. The company has offices in global locations including Canada, Mexico, France, Italy, Australia, and Hong Kong, and it has more than 25 manufacturing facilities around the world.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Dentsply Sirona delivers certain products, such as implants and crowns, directly to dental laboratories and dentists. It uses distribution partners in the US and abroad for other product offerings such as consumables.
  </p>
  <p>
   The largest markets for the company's urology products are the UK, Germany, and France, where Dentsply Sirona sells to urologists, urology nurses, general practitioners, and patients. Surgery products are sold directly and through distributors in about 35 countries (key markets are Australia, Norway, and the UK).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's two largest customers are Patterson Dental Company (13% of total revenue in 2015) and
   <company id="46904">
    Henry Schein
   </company>
   (12% of revenue).
  </p>

  <p>
   Revenue has fallen for the last couple of years, dropping less than 1% in fiscal 2014 and then 9% to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2015. This was due to sales declines in its two larger segments (Healthcare, Orthodontic and Implant Businesses and Dental Consumables, Endodontic and Dental Laboratory Businesses), which were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income, which has been fluctuating for the past five years, dropped 22% to $251.1 million in 2015. The company's lower sales led to that decline, but were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses. Cash flow from operations fell $63 million to $497.4 million that year.

  <p>
   To maintain a competitive edge, the company has invested in new product development through its own internal research centers and collaborations with research institutions and dental schools. It is also working to expand its implants operations and its non-dental medical equipment operations through organic and acquisitive growth measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also dedicated to improving operational efficiency, and it has embraced the use of technology to enhance procedures.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Acquisitions are also a key part of Dentsply's growth strategy. In 2016, the company bought
   <company id="53779">
    Sirona Dental Systems
   </company>
   (a manufacturer of dental technology including imaging systems) for $5.5 billion. The combined firm, which adopted the Dentsply Sirona name, offers dental offices products ranging from fluoride rinses to dental chairs. The transaction was deemed a merger of equals, but Dentsply shareholders gained a 58% stake of the combined firm upon completion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   DENTSPLY's roots go back to 1899 when dental business veterans Jacob Frantz, George Whiteley, Dean Osborne, and John Shepherd formed the Dentists' Supply Co. of New York. Facing a competitive market, the four bought a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the company's first innovations was to make ceramic teeth. In 1914 Dentists' Supply introduced different-sized teeth to allow custom fitting for patients.
  </p>
  <p>
   Between 1920 and 1950 the firm opened factories in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and the UK. Facing a mature denture market in the 1950s, Dentists' Supply began investing in other dental technologies. It collaborated with Dr. John Borden in the development of the Borden Airorotor, a high-speed dental drill that revolutionized dental practice. The firm changed its name to DENTSPLY in 1969.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1976 the company acquired its worldwide distributor, Amalgamated Dental; it purchased GE's dental X-ray division in 1983. During the 1980s and 1990s DENTSPLY opened operations in China, India, Japan, and Russia as part of its global expansion; it reorganized these operations in the late 1990s to achieve better efficiency.
