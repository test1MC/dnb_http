   Pharmacyclics wants to help cancer and other diseases cycle right out of your body. The clinical-stage firm develops small-molecule drugs to fight cancer and auto-immune diseases. Its key product, Imbruvica, is approved in the US to treat mantle cell lymphoma, a rare cancer, and is testing for three other cancers. Pharmacyclis has two other cancer treatments and an autoimmune disease cure in its pipeline. The firm has licensing and development agreements with

   in a bid to acquire Pharmacyclics in early 2015. AbbVie gained the rights to Imbruvica in the deal, boosting its pipeline and offsetting its dependence on its top drug Humira (which will lose its patent protection by late 2016). Pharmacyclics is now a subsidiary of AbbVie operating from its California headquarters.

   Pharmacyclics uses third-party manufacturers, one for individual sales and one for bulk sales, to produce Imbruvica.

   Since its product was approved and began marketing in late 2013, the company hasn't had a full year of product revenues yet. Since it's formation, Pharmacyclics has spent heavily on R&amp;D and as of December 2013 had a total accumulated deficit of $216 million. The company expects to see increased spending as it markets existing products and continues R&amp;D and trials on others.

  <p>
   Key aspects of Pharmacyclics strategy include maintaining a large pipeline and continuing to outsource both clinical development and manufacturing so it can work on keeping the pipeline stocked.
