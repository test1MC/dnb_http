   Clif Bar found a toehold in a niche market and has climbed steadily upward ever since. The company is a leading maker of natural energy, nutrition, and snack bars. Its high-carb CLIF- and LUNA-branded bars aim to refuel sports enthusiasts and busy folks and are distributed in bike shops, outdoor stores, and natural food markets, as well as grocery stores, convenience stores, and other retail outlets nationwide. In addition to its CLIF and LUNA bars, the company offers various iterations of its product, including MOJO and Builder's bars, along with children's versions called ZBar and Zfruit. The company also sells CLIF Shots -- energy drinks and gels fortified with electrolytes.

   As part of the company's effort to chase after the competitive $2 billion nutrition bar market, Clif Bar has been working to maintain the double-digit compounded annual growth it has enjoyed for the past decade. To this end, the food maker has introduced products for wee customers as a way to diversify and serve a niche market others don't. Product launches have included Zbar nutrition bars, an item that is formulated for children's nutritional needs.

        <p>
   With a new chief executive at the helm, Clif Bar is focused on expanding the company's growth in sports nutrition and the healthy snacks categories. Indeed, Clif Bar in 2013 began to expand its Builder's line with Builder's MAX, a protein bar developed for extreme athletes. Builder's MAX is made with TriBuild protein, a blend of whey, soy, and casein that is formulated to support muscle growth and recovery. The company in 2014 also rolled out CLIF Kit's Organic Fruit + Seed, a snack bar made with all organic fruit and seeds that's named after company owner Kit Crawford, following the 2013 debut of its new Sierra Trail Mix CLIF bar flavor.

   Bucking the consolidation trend sweeping the natural foods industry, Clif Bar remains stubbornly independent. (It claims to have turned down an offer to buy the company from Quaker Oats in 2000.) Rival bar makers PowerBar and Balance Bar were sold to

   and

   The business is named after Gary Erickson's late father and fellow outdoorsman, Clifford, who died in 2009 at the age of 83. In 1990 Erickson, together with his mom, set out to create a better tasting energy bar. Two years later, the CLIF bar came into existence.
