   This company gets in its last licks; Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream manufactures premium ice creams and other frozen dairy desserts. Products are marketed to food retailers and food service operators under the Dreyer's brand in the western US and Texas, and under the Edy's name across the rest of the country. Internationally, Dreyer's is distributed in parts of the Far East, and the Edy's brand, the Caribbean and South America. Dreyer's distributes

    Nestlé'
   </company>
   s Häagen-Dazs brand ice cream and frozen dairy novelties, too, along with operating the Häagen-Dazs Shoppe Company, which franchises ice cream parlors worldwide. Founded in 1928, Dreyer's is a subsidiary of Swiss food giant Nestlé.

   Dreyer's operates five ice cream manufacturing plants -- one each in Bakersfield and Tulare, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Laurel, Maryland. The ice cream business is supported by Nestlé USA's direct store delivery division, which manages direct store delivery operations using a fleet of company-owned freezer trucks.

   While

   doesn't break out sales for Dreyer's, the Swiss firm reported that its ice cream sales in North America increased by 6% in 2012 versus 2011. Also, higher-value products, such as super-premium and snacks, outperformed other ice cream categories.

  <p>
   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream was founded in 1928 by William Dreyer and Joseph Edy as an ice cream parlor in Oakland, California. Shortly after the stock market crash of 1929, the men created the popular Rocky Road flavor, naming it for the hard times. Edy left in 1947, and Dreyer led the company until his death in 1975.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fraternity brothers and struggling restaurateurs William Cronk and Gary Rogers bought Dreyer's in 1977 for $1.1 million. The company went public in 1981 and by the mid-1980s had expanded nationally. However, in response to objections from
   <company id="103392">
    Kraft
   </company>
   -- then the maker of the Breyer's brand of ice cream -- Dreyer's agreed to market its product as Edy's in the eastern US. In 1986 it agreed to distribute
   <company id="12763">
    Ben &amp; Jerry's
   </company>
   super-premium ice cream nationally.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company was the first premium ice cream maker to tap the "better-for-you" market, introducing Dreyer's and Edy's Grand Light in 1987 (frozen yogurt and fat-free ice cream lines followed). In 1994 Nestlé USA acquired about 30% of the company in a deal making Dreyer's the exclusive distributor of a number of leading
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   frozen novelties in selected markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year Dreyer's embarked on a five-year marketing plan in an effort to double sales by the decade's end. The company formed a joint venture with Starbucks in 1996 to make a line of coffee-flavored ice cream products. But before Dreyer's grand plan could reach fruition, in late 1997 dairy prices began to skyrocket, doubling costs in 1998. Also, consumers began to tire of healthy stuff, and sales dropped for the reduced-fat, sugar-free ice cream products.

  <p>
   A rejected bid by Dreyer's to buy
   <company id="12763">
    Ben &amp; Jerry's
   </company>
   in 1998 chilled relations between the two companies: Ben &amp; Jerry's announced that year that it would no longer use Dreyer's as its main US distributor. To counter the resulting loss of income, and newly unfettered from earlier non-compete agreements, Dreyer's introduced its own higher-margin products, starting with the 1999 launch of ultra-premium Godiva Ice Cream (through a licensing agreement with
   <company id="113462">
    Godiva Chocolatier
   </company>
   ), followed by the introduction of Dreyer's and Edy's Dreamery super-premium ice cream.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 the company launched a new line of premium ice-cream products featuring Snickers, M&amp;M's, and other popular
   <company id="40297">
    Mars
   </company>
   candies. Also in 2000 Dreyer's purchased several regional distribution companies, including Cherokee Cream Company, and specialty frozen products. Later that year the company signed a long-term agreement to distribute
   <company id="93845">
    Unilever
   </company>
   's US ice-cream brands nationally, including their newly acquired Ben &amp; Jerry's business.
  </p>
  <p>
   After much legal wrangling, in 2003 Nestlé purchased what amounted to 68% of Dreyer's in a stock swap. To appease antitrust worries and smooth the merger's progress, Dreyer's sold its Dreamery and Whole Fruit brands, along with its license to produce Godiva-brand ice creams, to rapidly growing
   <company id="56504">
    CoolBrands International
   </company>
   . As part of the transition, Dreyer's announced that 950 jobs moved over to CoolBrands and an additional 150 jobs would be cut. The deal also required the company to pull the plug on its joint venture with Mars (producing ice cream products featuring Mars candies).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Dreyer's acquired the US Häagen-Dazs ice cream shop franchise business from
   <company id="10639">
    General Mills
   </company>
   for an undisclosed amount. At the other end of the butterfat spectrum, later that same year the company acquired
   <company id="122966">
    Silhouette Brands
   </company>
   and its line of Skinny Cow and Skinny Carb frozen novelties. As the original co-packer, CoolBrands International continues to manufacture the Skinny Cow products. Bowing to consumers who watch their waistlines, the company introduced low-fat Häagen-Dazs ice cream in 2005.
  </p>
  <p>
   Already owning some two-thirds of Dreyer's, Nestlé acquired full ownership of it in 2006. The acquisition made Dreyer's the largest US ice cream company, its roster including all of Nestlé's US ice cream brands, including Häagen-Dazs; its own line of premium ice creams (Dreyer's and Edy's); and the
   <company id="15745">
    Starbucks
   </company>
   -licensed super-premium ice creams. (In 2008, Starbucks switched its branded ice-cream licensing agreement to
   <company id="41850">
    Unilever
   </company>
   .)
  </p>
  <p>
   Dryer's acquired the Eskimo Pie and Chipwich brands of ice cream treats from Canadian company
   <company id="56504">
    CoolBrands
   </company>
   for almost $19 million in 2007.
