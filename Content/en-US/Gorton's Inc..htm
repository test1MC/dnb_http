   As a leader in the US branded frozen seafood sector, Gorton's has lots of fish to fry. The company, which sells its products to food retailers and food service suppliers nationwide, makes frozen seafood products. Its portfolio includes fish sticks and fillets, fish tenders, and breaded, frozen popcorn fish and shrimp. Its Canadian unit, BlueWater Seafoods, is one of the country's top seafood brands. Gorton's was founded in 1849 in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Since 2001, the frozen fish giant has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of

   The company markets its products under the Gorton's brand in the US and the BlueWater name in Canada. It boasts one of the more well-known advertising slogans:
   <em>
    Trust the Gorton's Fisherman
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Gorton's sells its namesake products through a variety of food retailers and food service suppliers.

   Gorton's works to keep up with changing consumer tastes. In response to the fish-consuming public's demand for low-fat, healthier products, the company changed its manufacturing processes and removed all trans-fats from its food. It also added a line of grilled shrimp products as a lower-fat alternative. Although Gorton's has struggled amid fierce price competition in the retail market, its parent company has denied it is up for sale. (Nippon's US processed foods business, which includes Gorton's and King &amp; Prince Seafood, reported an operating loss of $2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2013, despite an increase in sales of 31% to $388 million.)

   In June 2014, Gorton's closed the Bluewater plant in Montreal, eliminating 124 jobs there. Gorton's said that the decision to close the plant was part of its "comprehensive strategy to consolidate its manufacturing operations in order to increase efficiency." The production of fish and seafood has been moved to other Nippon-owned plants in North America, including the Gorton's plant in Gloucester.
