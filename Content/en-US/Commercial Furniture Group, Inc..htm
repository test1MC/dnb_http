   A former Air Force captain, Franklin A. Jacobs founded Falcon in 1959, naming it after his fighter squadron. The company began by making pedestal table bases for the food service industry. It added laminated tabletops to its line in 1965 and wood chairs in 1970. The firm acquired William Hodges &amp; Co. (wire shelving) in 1973; then it went public. Falcon added foundry Fundiciones Tecnicas (Mexico) in 1975 and Bianco Manufacturing (wood chairs and booths) two years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jacobs turned over the reins to Robert Clark (from Allied Chemical) in 1981, but Falcon crashed shortly thereafter because of inventory controls and other problems. Jacobs returned in 1983 and got the company flying, again. Falcon entered the office furniture market in 1989.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand its offerings during the 1990s, buying a controlling stake in Mimon (fine wood furniture, Czech Republic, 1994) and several seating companies, including Charlotte Co. (high-quality chairs, 1994) and The Chair Source (hospitality seating, 1996).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1996 Falcon acquired a plant in Mexico to support its hospitality market business. The next year it boosted its international manufacturing presence with a new plant in China (opened primarily to outfit new McDonald's restaurants in China). Keeping an eye on costs, that year the company sold its William Hodges unit to Leggett &amp; Platt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Falcon in 1998 consolidated several plants and discontinued several wood seating lines and its hotel casegoods business. Falcon also bought Howe Furniture, which manufactures tables for the contract hospitality and office industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Falcon bought Shelby Williams Industries, one of the largest producers of banquet seating and hotel furniture, in 1999; the acquisition brought with it several other lines and brands, such as Sellers and Josephson (vinyl wallcovering) and Phillocraft (ergonomic work stations). In 2000 the company expanded into the high-end contract furniture market by forming a new company called Epic Furniture Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   A slowing economy and the events of September 11, which particularly hurt the hospitality industry and planned hotel remodelings, led to Falcon closing a plant and consolidating other manufacturing operations in 2001.
  </p>
  <p>
   Falcon filed for bankruptcy in 2005, and Jacobs resigned as chairman and CEO; he was replaced by John Sumner. The company emerged later that year as a private entity and changed its name from Falcon to Commercial Furniture Group.
