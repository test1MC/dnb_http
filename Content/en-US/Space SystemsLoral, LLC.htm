   For Space Systems/Loral (SS/L), business is up in the air. The company makes satellites and related accessories for commercial and government customers. Its fixed satellite services supplies satellites that beam TV, radio, and other communications from orbit to a fixed location on the ground. Its direct broadcast satellites send TV to
   <company id="44500">
    DISH
   </company>
   and
   <company id="42070">
    DIRECTV
   </company>
   subscribers' homes while broadband services facilitate Internet connections across North America. The mobile broadcast services and mobile satellite services groups send audio, video, and communications signals to cars and cell phones. SS/L is a subsidiary of
   <company id="106453">
    MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates
   </company>
   (MDA), which purchased it in 2012 from
   <company id="47548">
    Loral Space &amp; Communications.
   </company>

  <p>
   The company's Palo Alto, California, plant can build up to 13 satellites per year. (It takes about two to three years to build and launch a satellite). SS/L is currently contracted to build satellites for Skybox Imaging,

   , Indonesian Bank,
   <company id="159685">
    EchoStar
   </company>
   , HISPASAT Group, U.S. government, Bulgaria Sat, and others. SS/L also makes its own RF components and sub-assemblies to limit outsourcing. The company expects demand for new satellites to continue as the need for video (including HDTV and 3-D TV), Internet, and data bandwidth capabilities increases.

   SS/L provided the propulsion system for the Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft, which studied the moon's atmosphere before crashing, as planned, on the moon's surface. In the past, NASA has used SS/L's antennas, high-power batteries, microwave ranging systems, and power control equipment. NASA isn't SSL's only US government customer. About 25% of the federal government's leased commercial transponders are carried on SSL-built satellites.

   SS/L was founded in 1957 as the West Coast laboratory for the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company (Philco, now a brand of Philips). It was bought by Ford in 1961 and renamed Ford Aerospace until it was taken over by Loral in 1997. SS/L has built more than 250 satellites in its lifetime and is the exclusive supplier of batteries to the International Space Station.

   Loral in mid-2012 sold SS/L to rival satellite equipment maker MDA in a transaction valued at about $875 million. MDA makes ground-based and satellite-based observation systems along with airborne radar systems. Combining Canadian-based MDA with SS/L, now an LLC rather than Inc., creates a juggernaut in the North American satellite communications industry. The deal also enhances SS/L's potential for increased business with both commercial and government customers.
