   In fiscal 2016 (September year end) Treatt's revenue grew by 2.5% to £88 million due to the success of the company's focus on added-value products (sugar reduction, tea, natural distillates, and citrus), which was partially offset by the drag of low-margin products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net operating margin rose by 11% as the result of higher revenue, the strategic shift to higher value products, and a tighter control on costs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 the company's operating cash flow grew to £8.8 million (up from £7.2 million a year earlier) due to a change in working capital.
