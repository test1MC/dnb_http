  <p>
   James Middleton Cox, who dropped out of school in 1886 at 16, worked as a teacher, reporter, and congressional secretary before buying the
   <i>
    Dayton Daily News
   </i>
   in 1898. In 1905 he acquired the nearby
   <em>
    Springfield Press-Republican
   </em>
   and then took up politics, serving two terms in the US Congress (1909-1913) and three terms as Ohio governor (1913-1915; 1917-1921). He even ran for president in 1920 (his running mate was future President Franklin Roosevelt) but lost to rival Ohio publisher Warren G. Harding.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once out of politics, Cox began building his media empire. He bought the
   <i>
    Miami Daily News
   </i>
   in 1923 and founded WHIO (Dayton, Ohio's first radio station). He bought Atlanta's WSB ("Welcome South, Brother"), the South's first radio station, in 1939 and added WSB-FM and WSB-TV, the South's first FM and TV stations, in 1948. Cox founded Dayton's first FM and TV stations (WHIO-FM and WHIO-TV) the next year, and
   <i>
    The Atlanta Constitution
   </i>
   joined his collection in 1950. Cox died in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company continued to expand its broadcasting interests in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was one of the first major broadcasting companies to expand into cable TV when it purchased a system in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, in 1962. The Cox family's broadcast properties were placed in publicly held Cox Broadcasting in 1964. Two years later its newspapers were placed into privately held Cox Enterprises, and the cable holdings became publicly held Cox Cable Communications. The broadcasting arm diversified, buying Manheim Services (auto auctions, 1968), Kansas City Automobile Auction (1969), and TeleRep (TV ad sales, 1972).
  </p>
  <p>
   Cox Cable had 500,000 subscribers in nine states when it rejoined Cox Broadcasting in 1977. Cox Broadcasting was renamed Cox Communications in 1982, and the Cox family took the company private again in 1985, combining it with Cox Enterprises. The company also invested in upstart cable broadcaster Discover Channel (now part of
   <company id="43731">
    Discovery Communications
   </company>
   ) during the 1980s. James Kennedy, grandson of founder James Cox, became chairman and CEO in 1987.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expansion became the keyword for Cox in the 1990s. The company merged its Manheim unit with the auto auction business of Ford Motor Credit and GE Capital in 1991. It also formed Sprint Spectrum in 1994, a partnership with
   <company id="103483">
    Sprint
   </company>
   , TCI (acquired by AT&amp;T and later by
   <company id="13034">
    Comcast
   </company>
   ), and Comcast to bundle telephone, cable TV, and other communications services (Sprint bought out Cox in 1999). Then, in one of its biggest transactions, Cox bought Times Mirror's cable TV operations for $2.3 billion in 1995 and combined them with its own cable system into a new, publicly traded company called
   <company id="43269">
    Cox Communications
   </company>
   . The following year it spun off its radio holdings into a public company called
   <company id="51945">
    Cox Radio
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To expand its online presence, the company formed Cox Interactive Media in 1996, establishing a series of city websites and making a host of investments in various Internet companies, including Career Path, Excite@Home,
   <company id="52464">
    iVillage
   </company>
   (later acquired by
   <company id="128633">
    NBCUniversal
   </company>
   ), MP3.com, and
   <company id="60010">
    Tickets.com
   </company>
   (now part of
   <company id="127342">
    MLB Advanced Media
   </company>
   ). Cox also applied the online strategy to its automobile auction businesses, establishing
   <company id="61641">
    AutoTrader.com
   </company>
   in 1998 and placing the Internet operations of Manheim Auctions (now just
   <company id="126160">
    Manheim
   </company>
   ) into a new company, Manheim Interactive, in 2000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Cox dropped plans to expand its local Internet city guide business nationwide and moved its Interactive Media operations to other parts of the company. Two years later, fed up with the demands of running a publicly traded cable company, Cox bought the 38% of Cox Communications that it didn't already own for $8.5 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company in 2007 exchanged Cox Communications' 25% stake in Discovery Communications for $1.3 billion in cash. The deal also included cable broadcaster the Travel Channel. (Cox sold a 65% stake in the network to
   <company id="138273">
    Scripps Networks
   </company>
   in 2009.) Late the following year, Jimmy Hayes was promoted to replace James Kennedy as CEO. Cox Communications acquired the shares in Cox Radio it didn't already own for about $70 million, making the radio unit a wholly-owned subsidiary once again.
