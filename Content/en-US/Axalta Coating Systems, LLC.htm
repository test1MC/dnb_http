   's business segments, Axalta is one of the world's largest providers of automotive coatings. It supplies liquid and powder coatings to most of the major US OEM automakers, the automotive aftermarket, as well as general industrial customers (for heavy equipment, pipes, and electrical insulation). Brands include Standox and Spies Hecker products for high-end aftermarkets and Nason for economy coatings. The company went in public in 2014 with

  <p>
   In 2014 the company sold an aggregate of 50 million common shares at the IPO price of $19.50 per share. The underwriters also exercised their over-allotment option and an additional 7.5 million common shares. Axalta did not receive any proceeds from the IPO.

  <p>
   Axalta has two operating segments: Performance Coatings and Transportation Coatings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Coatings (58% of total 2014 revenues) provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings products to a fragmented and local customer base. Some 41% revenues came from Refinish (innovative coatings systems and color matching technologies for automotive collision repairs). Industrial offers a comprehensive range of specially-formulated waterborne and solventborne products and systems used by the global automotive repair industry to refinish damaged vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transportation Coatings (41%) provide advanced coating technologies to OEMs of light and commercial vehicles. The segment also develops and supplies a wide array of coatings systems for a broad range of commercial applications including HDT, bus, rail and ACE.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Axalta has a global footprint of 35 manufacturing facilities, 7 technology centers, and 45 customer training centers. It has customers in more than 130 countries. Its operations are primarily located in North America (Canada and the US), Latin America (Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico), EMEA (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,  and United Kingdom), and Asia Pacific (Australia, China, India, and Malaysia). It has joint venture plants in China, Colombia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Guatemala.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 EMEA contributed 38% of total revenues; North America, 30%; Asia Pacific, 16%; and Latin America, 16%.

  <p>
   The end markets within the Performance Coatings segment are refinish and industrial. The end markets within Transportation Coatings are light vehicle and commercial vehicle.
  </p>

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014, Axalta's net revenues increased by 10% to $4.4 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Coatings and Transportation Coatings segment sales increases were driven by higher average selling prices in all regions. In addition, volumes contributed to net sales growth on stronger performance within North America and Asia, offset slightly by continued weakness in Latin America, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange impacts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was $27.4 million, up 112% on 2013, due to higher net sales, and the absence of merger and acquisition related expenses and bridge financing commitment fees. Lower selling, general and administrative expenses also contributed to net income improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Axalta's cash from operating activities was $251.4 million (down 33% on 2013) due to the increase in receivables, inventory, and other assets, thanks to higher net sales and inventory builds.

  <p>
