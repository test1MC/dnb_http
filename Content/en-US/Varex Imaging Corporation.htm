   Varex designs and manufactures X-ray imaging components for the medical, industrial, and security markets. Its products include X-ray tubes (it has distributed more than 100,000 tubes in the past five years), flat panel detectors, and imaging software, as well as high-energy inspection accelerators and high-voltage connectors -- all key elements of X-ray systems. Customers include radiology original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which make systems for medical diagnostic radiology applications, airport baggage inspection systems, manufacturing quality control devices, and other systems. Varex Imaging was spun off from
   <company id="59192">
    Varian Medical Systems
   </company>
   in early 2017.

  <p>
   Varian spun off its imaging components operations to focus on its oncology systems and particle therapy operations. As a public stand-alone company, Varex Imaging is better positioned to target growth in the imaging components market.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Varex has manufacturing centers in Illinois, Nevada, New York, and Utah, as well as in the Netherlands and the Philippines. It has regional service centers in South Carolina, Germany, and China.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company sells its products in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia/Pacific region. The Americas and the Asia/Pacific region each account for about 35% of total sales, while EMEA accounts for about 30%.

   Varex's five largest customers are
   <company id="138634">
    Toshiba Medical Systems
   </company>
   (which brings in about a quarter of total revenue),
   <company id="138056">
    Carestream Health
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="13907">
    Hologic
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="55063">
    Shimadzu
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="59192">
    Varian
   </company>
   . They collectively account for about 40% of its total sales.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2016 (ended September), revenue decreased 2% to $620.1 million. This was driven by a 5% decrease in sales to medical customers -- flat panel and X-ray tube product sales dipped that year -- but offset by a 17% increase in industrial customer sales. Also helping offset the decline were gains from the company's 2015 acquisitions of Claymount Investments and MeVis Medical Solutions.

  <p>
   Varex maintains an active R&amp;D program to stay current in the X-ray imaging market and to promote the industry's transition from analog to digital systems. It typically spends between $40 million and $55 million in R&amp;D annually.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company is also an acquisitive operation, seeking to buy companies that will add to its component portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
   Varex sees great potential for growth in its target medical, industrial, and security markets. For example, in the medical field, there is less tendency to see dips in demand as the needs for health care and diagnostics continue to grow. And as manufacturers implement such modern innovations as 3D printing, the call for quality control inspection expands. Varex is focused on providing lower-cost products that are more cost-effective for its manufacturing customers than it would be to make those components in-house.

  <p>
   In fiscal 2015 (ended September), Varex Imaging acquired Claymount Investments, a Netherlands-based supplier of X-ray imaging components. Also that year, it acquired a majority stake in MeVis Medical Solutions, a German firm that provides image-processing software for cancer screenings.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2016 the company agreed to buy the medical imaging operations of
   <company id="10490">
    PerkinElmer
   </company>
   for some $276 million.
