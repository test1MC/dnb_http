  <p>
   Merck operates through three divisions: Healthcare, Life Science and Performance Materials. At around 55% of sales, Healthcare is the largest segment, and is made up of four businesses, Biopharma, Consumer Health, Biosimilars and Allergopharma. The Biopharma division makes and markets treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, infertility and growth disorders. Its top selling product is Rebif, a MS treatment. Consumer Health sells OTC wellness brands such as Floratil, Neurobrion and Apaisyl. Biosimilars works to create drugs that have similar properties to pre-existing branded drugs, mostly aimed at the developing world. And Allergopharma makes hayfever and allergic asthma treatments. Europe and North America generate between them 60% of revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Life Sciences product portfolio numbers some 300,000, with products including ultrapure reagents, ingredient synthesis, filtration systems and products that support cell growth. The division absorbed Sigma-Aldrich Corporation in 2015 in a $17 billion mega-deal, making it a major player in the $100 billion Life Sciences market.
  </p>
  <p>
   Performance Materials deals in high-tech chemicals for use in consumer electronics, lighting, coating, printing, paints, plastics and cosmetics. The division pulls in 20% of net sales.

  <p>
   Merck is headquartered in Germany with operations spread across around 65 countries. Emerging markets contribute about 45%, and the Asia-Pacific region is the company's single largest region by revenue (closely followed by Europe).

   Merck had a good year in 2015. It recorded strong growth in North America and the Asia-Pacific region, of around 23% each, bringing total company revenue for the year up 10% to €12.8 billion. Merck is benefitting from an increase in biopharmaceutical sales as a proportion of overall pharmaceutical sales globally. Growth in the Life Sciences segment was the highest, at around 25%, but all three segments recorded positive results. Healthcare remains the largest segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income was flat on prior year at €1.1 billion as an increase in income from sales was cancelled out by an equivalent increase in operating expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operating activities was down 20% to €2.2 billion, due to changes in assets and liabilities.

  <p>
   Merck has completed its transformation, begun in 2007, from a classic pharmaceuticals and chemicals supplier company to a science and technology company. In 2015, high-tech materials and life science tools made up around 80% of revenue, versus 30% in 2006. The most significant event in 2015 was the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich, a pharmaceutical equipment maker, for $17 billion. The acquisition positioned Merck as a leader in the life science industry. The company has racked up acquisition and divestment volume of €38 billion since 2004; other major acquisitions include AZ Electronic Materials, a supplier of high-tech materials for the electronics industry, for $2.5 billion in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company intends to shore up its transformation through further acquisitions and by continuing to expand in the high-growth markets of the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. The two regions pulled in a combined 43% of revenue in 2015. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for around 60% of total growth across the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merck backed up its completed transformation with a complete re-branding in 2015, which included a re-naming of the separate division names such as Merck Serono and Merck Millipore in all geographies (bar the US and Canada, where the Merck name is owned by unaffiliated Merck &amp; Co.), and bringing them under one Merck umbrella. The move is partly intended to boost awareness of the difference between the rival companies.

  <p>
   In 2015 the company acquired US-based pharmaceutical company Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion, the last foundation stone in the re-building of Merck from a classic pharmaceutical and chemicals company into a science and technology company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it announced plans to acquire virus-focused drug company Idenix for about $3.85 billion. The smaller company's hepatitis C candidate is expected to fit nicely with Merck's work on an oral, once-daily hep-C treatment. Earlier that year Merck purchased AZ Electronic Materials for about €2 billion, which expanded its presence in Asia and positioned it to capitalize on the growing popularity of mobile devices.

  <p>
   The German firm is ancestor to US drug giant Merck &amp; Co., but the American firm broke away during WWI. Subsequently, the company's current North American operations can't use the Merck name; they instead operate under the name EMD, including EMD Millipore, which operates as Merck Millipore in the rest of the world. Likewise, the Merck Serono division operates as EMD Serono in the US market. Legal tussles over the use of the name flare up sporadically as globalization brings the two into shared markets
  </p>
  <p>
   Merck was founded in 1668 as a pharmacy and is the oldest pharmaceutical business in the world.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 History.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In 1668 apothecary Friedrich Jacob Merck bought the
   <i>
    Engel-Apotheke
   </i>
   (Angel Pharmacy) in Darmstadt, establishing the family's presence in the drug business. Some 150 years later, descendant Emanuel Merck inherited the company; an experienced chemist, Merck transformed it into a drugmaker by 1827, producing morphine, codeine, cocaine, and other bulk pharmaceuticals. By the time Merck died in 1854, the company had sales around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two years later the company headed to the US. By the turn of the century, Merck had a production facility in New Jersey run by Emanuel's grandson George. When the US joined WWI, George turned over Merck's control of the US subsidiary (
   <company id="11326">
    Merck &amp; Co.
   </company>
   ) to the Alien Property Custodian, which sold the stock after the war. Merck lost its other overseas subsidiaries after WWI.
  </p>
  <p>
   WWII left Merck struggling for supplies and labor, and its factories were decimated by Allied air raids. After the war, the military government allowed the firm to make drugs, then pesticides, food preservatives, reagents, and laboratory chemicals. Merck struggled along until the
   <i>
    Wirthschaftswunder
   </i>
   (economic miracle) in 1948 that turned around the German economy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The war had lingering effects that cost the firm during the later half of the 20th century. Although Merck rebuilt its presence around the world, product development (particularly its ventures into biotechnology in the 1980s) was hampered by an exodus of talent to other countries and by certain protectionist policies of the German government.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite a sluggish economy and Germany's health care system reforms, Merck began an acquisition spree in 1990 that continued for several years. The firm diversified its pharmaceuticals and chemicals operations but drove itself into debt. In 1995 Merck offered a quarter of its stock to the public to pay its debt and continue its spree.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of its purchases in the late 1990s helped it establish itself in the cancer treatment niche; these buys included Lexigen Pharmaceuticals (1998). The next year the Merck family had to inject money into the company again to pay off debt from the acquisitions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 the company sold its laboratory supplies distribution subsidiary,
   <company id="120668">
    VWR International
   </company>
   , to
   <company id="40093">
    Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice
   </company>
   for $1.65 billion. VWR has since been sold to
   <company id="98988">
    Madison Dearborn Partners
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 Merck made a failed $18 billion bid for
   <company id="91276">
    Schering
   </company>
   , which was instead acquired by
   <company id="41808">
    Bayer
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   That failed purchase was made up for through the $13 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech firm Serono (later
   <company id="90988">
    Merck Serono
   </company>
   ) in 2007. The purchase made Merck the largest biotech company in Europe, adding biological operations focused on reproductive health, neurology, metabolism, and other areas. Following the acquisition, Merck combined Serono with its Merck Ethicals Division to form a new prescription pharmaceuticals division named Merck Serono. The Ethicals Division contributed cancer, cardiovascular, and other therapies, including marketing rights for
   <company id="15468">
    ImClone
   </company>
   's cancer drug Erbitux outside of the US and Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
   In support of its status among the biggest players in the biotech field, Merck offloaded its generics unit, which had accounted for nearly 30% of the company's overall sales, that same year in order to pay down its debt from the Serono acquisition. Merck sold the unit to
   <company id="11030">
    Mylan
   </company>
   for a robust price of about $6.7 billion. Along with paying down debt, Merck used the money to fund additional acquisitions, targeting the over-the-counter medicine and chemical industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Merck moved to gain a tighter foothold in the Chinese chemical market in 2009 when it purchased pigment manufacturer Suzhou Taizhu Technology Development for $40 million. That same year the company increased its bioscience holdings in India by acquiring Bangalore Genei Private, an India-based company that specialized in making and selling genomics and proteomics research products, from the Sanmar Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite making some broad strokes at expansion, the company was hit by a decline in demand for its chemicals (including pigments) in 2009 and was forced to initiate some cutbacks in the division's manufacturing operations early in the year, primarily due to economic conditions and an ensuing lower demand for liquid crystals.
