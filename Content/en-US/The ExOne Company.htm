   ExOne wants to be THE one when it comes to non-traditional manufacturing. The company "prints" three-dimensional (3D) parts and materials -- literally creating a prototype or part quickly from a computer model by laying down successive layers of material to form the part. It prints in silica sand, ceramic, stainless steel, bronze, and glass. ExOne also sells 3D printing machines and makes casting molds from silica sand and ceramics from production centers in the US, Germany, and Japan. The company's key customers,

   The company plans to use its $95 million in IPO proceeds to improve its manufacturing capacity, expand its production service center (PSC) locations, and pay down debt.

   ExOne spans the gap between traditional prototype machining and 3D printing by offering laser micromachining services where a laser is used to shave off layers of a material to create an object. Machining in this manner, or with traditional tools, is called subtractive manufacturing since material is removed to form a part as opposed to 3D printing, which is also called additive manufacturing since layers are added during machining.

   ExOne reports sales figures for the US, Germany, and Japan. Sales are about evenly split between the three countries, though Germany has a slight lead.

        <p>
   The company posted a net loss of $7.6 million in 2011 and had total losses of about $15.6 million, raising doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. As of its IPO filing, the company had not posted 2012 year-end numbers, but there was no indication of a change in its financial situation, though revenues have improved slightly.

   Going forward, ExOne plans to expand it PSCs from five to 15 locations by the end of 2015. First up are locations in South America (the country's first in the region) as well as additional locations in the US, Asia, and Western Europe.

   The company also hopes to gain new customers by expanding its printable materials to include titanium, tungsten carbide, aluminum, and magnesium. ExOne is bringing new machines online that can print products faster and more efficiently. To bring additional customers into the fold, the company has provided its 3D printing equipment to universities and research centers and it plans to continue efforts to train and educate the manufacturing marketplace on the benefits of 3D printing.
