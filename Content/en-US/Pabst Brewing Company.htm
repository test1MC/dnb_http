   The Pabst Brewing Company is a 19th-century brewer retooled for the 21st century. The company, founded in Milwaukee in 1844, today is something of a "virtual" brewer. Pabst owns no breweries, but instead, it contracts with
   <company id="159739">
    MillerCoors
   </company>
   to actually manufacture its beers, while Pabst retains the brand ownership of and does the marketing for its stable of blue-collar brands (including Pabst Blue Ribbon, Blatz, Pearl, Lone Star, Old Milwaukee, Old Style, Schlitz, and Colt 45). Pabst Brewing sold itself to Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings, a partnership between beer entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and TSG Consumer Partners, in 2014.

   The Pabst Brewing Company was founded in 1844 in Milwaukee by Jacob Best and his four sons. Expansion came 10 years later when Jacob's son Philip opened a sales office in Chicago. Philip's daughter Maria married Frederick Pabst in 1862, and he bought a half interest in the brewing company two years later. Frederick went on to become the company's president, and under his direction the brewery began selling nationwide.

   Pabst was the #1 beer in the US through the turn of the 20th century, with sales throughout the US, across Europe, and as far afield as China. By the 1970s Pabst had fallen to #3. Its decline was partly attributed to its failure to introduce new brands. In 1983 Pabst acquired Olympia Brewing Co. (founded 1896).

   In a 1985 takeover, Paul Kalmanovitz and his S&amp;P Company acquired Pabst. Kalmanovitz plowed the profits of Pabst and other beer interests into real estate until he died in 1987. His wife, Lydia, died seven years later. After her death, relatives attempted to gain larger shares of the estate, charging, among other things, trustees of the Kalmanovitz family had influenced her to change her will and had kept her isolated. Financial information obtained from court filings revealed that Pabst was losing money. S&amp;P closed the antiquated Milwaukee plant in 1996 and farmed all Pabst production out to rival brewer Stroh, throwing about 400 Pabst workers out of their jobs. In 1998 S&amp;P moved Pabst brewing back to Milwaukee via a five-year contract with

    Miller Brewing
   </company>
   .

   In 2001 the company agreed to move production of the Pabst-owned brands to Miller Brewing's plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Pabst's historic Pearl brewery in San Antonio shut down that year as well. In 2003 Pabst had about 3% of the US beer-drinking market, still exceeding many premium imports such as

    Heineken
   </company>
   and
   <company id="55181">
    Guinness
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2006 the company moved its corporate headquarters from San Antonio to the Chicago suburb of Woodridge, Illinois. The state is one of Pabst's largest markets.
