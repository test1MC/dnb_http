   In 2015 Advanced Energy Industries' revenue dropped 29% to $14.8 compared to 2014, reflecting the disposal of its inverters business in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company posted a $158.5 million loss in 2015 compared to a $49 million profit in 2014. It wrote off $242 million from production of the inverters business, which made components for solar energy arrays.
  </p>
  <p>
   Advanced Energy Industries generated cash flow from operations of $105 million in 2015, up from 75 million in 2014 because of decreases in accounts receivable.

   In 2015 Advanced Energy Industries got out of the inverters business, which accounted for 38% of revenue in 2014, to focus on its power products. The company made acquisitions in 2014 to bolster the power operations.

   Douglas Schatz (chairman), a veteran of
   <company id="12647">
    Applied Materials
   </company>
   , and Brent Backman, who had worked for Hughes Aircraft (sold to
   <company id="10640">
    General Motors
   </company>
   in 1986), founded Advanced Energy Industries in 1981. The company's first product replaced a refrigerator-sized power source with one the size of a bread box. Also during the 1980s the company introduced its first direct-current system for use in semiconductor deposition processes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1995. The following year, sales growth slowed as the chip industry went through one of its periodic slumps. To cushion its dependence on the volatile semiconductor market, in 1997 and 1998 Advanced Energy acquired power supply firms Tower Electronics (products used in the telecommunications, medical, and non-impact printing industries) and MIK Physics (power supplies used in industrial vacuum coating), among others. Advanced Energy also bought one of its main rivals, RF Power Products. In 2000 Advanced Energy bought Noah Holding, a privately held maker of temperature control systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2001 the company acquired Engineering Measurements Company (EMCO), a maker of flow meters and other precision measurement equipment. During 2001 the company twice cut its workforce -- by a total of one-fourth -- in response to a sharp decline in the worldwide electronics industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Advanced Energy acquired Aera Japan (mass flow controllers) for about $80 million in cash and debt assumption. Later that year it acquired Germany-based Dressler HF Technik (power systems for plasma-based production equipment), and the e-diagnostics applications of privately held Symphony Systems (Web-based software used to control wafer manufacturing processes).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005 Doug Schatz said he would retire as president and CEO once a successor could be found. Hans-Georg Betz, CEO of West STEAG Partners (a German venture capital firm) and a director of Advanced Energy since 2004, was named president and CEO later that year. Schatz remained as nonexecutive chairman of the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, Advanced Energy raised around $92 million in a secondary stock offering. The company marked its 25th anniversary in business during 2006.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company closed its plant in Stolberg, Germany, in 2007. Manufacturing was shifted to Advanced Energy's high-volume plant in Shenzhen, China, and to its advanced manufacturing facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. The company said the decision came down to deciding whether to expand the plants in Stolberg and Shenzhen, with the Chinese facility getting the nod. Advanced Energy acquired the Stolberg location through the acquisition of Dressler HF Technik in 2002. The German plant employed about 65 people.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bolstering its power conversion products for the solar market, in 2010 Advanced Energy acquired PV Powered, a maker solar inverters for the commercial, residential, and utility-scale markets. Later the same year, the company sold its Aera mass flow control and related product lines to
   <company id="119640">
    Hitachi Metals
   </company>
   for about $44 million, in order to focus on its core power product lines.
