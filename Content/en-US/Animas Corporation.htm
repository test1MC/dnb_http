   Animas' pumps help diabetic patients to stay animated. The company's computerized insulin pumps are pager-sized devices that diabetes patients "wear" and which continuously deliver rapid-acting insulin into the body. The infusion pumps, which are connected to a tube with a needle at the end that's inserted under the skin, replace the use of periodic insulin injections. Animas also sells diabetes management software, monitors, and various pump accessories. Key products include the Animas 2020 insulin pump and the OneTouch Ping glucose management system. The company is a subsidiary of

   While the company is focused on marketing its OneTouch Ping offering, Animas has several other insulin pumps on the market, including the Animas 2020. Earlier models include the Animas 1250 and 1200 versions. The firm is also the exclusive distributor of the inset and inset 30 line of insulin infusion sets made by Unomedical (a

   unit); the sets connect to the Animas pumps as well as pumps made by other manufacturers. It also distributes the Seven CGM (continuous glucose monitor) made by

   Animas markets its products worldwide through a combination of direct sales representatives and distributors. Its sales teams are aligned with the LifeScan organization, as the companies both target diabetes care customers.

  <p>
   Animas is a positive growth contributor in J&amp;J's diabetes care operations, and together with glucose monitor maker LifeScan it contributes about 4% of the parent's annual revenues, or some $2.6 billion (out of $67 billion in total J&amp;J sales) in 2012.

  <p>
   Sales of Animas' insulin pumps have also expanded through additional product development efforts, as well as entries into new international markets. Current R&amp;D projects include the development of an artificial pancreas system. Some of the company's product development operations are conducted in partnership with the LifeScan organization or other partners.

  <p>
   Animas is working with DexCom to integrate DexCom's glucose monitoring technology into the Animas insulin pumps. In 2011 the company received European approval for Animas Vibe, a CGM-enabled insulin pump system. The CGM system, which continuously reads glucose levels through a small sensor inserted just below the skin, transmits readings to the pump, which automatically administers insulin as needed. The companies are working to launch this product in addition markets.

  <p>
   Following the acquisition of Animas in 2006, Johnson &amp; Johnson combined the Animas and LifeScan OneTouch technologies to create the Ping system, a glucose management system that includes a meter/remote that monitors and controls the system's insulin pump.
