   Coupon clippers can thank W/S Packaging Group for helping them save. Coupons are the printing and packaging company's core product, although it also manufactures decals, folded cartons, labels and tags, printed tape, and specialty packaging. W/S Packaging has printed up and provided flexible packaging materials for such food and consumer product customers as

   ,
   <company id="10864">
    Kroger
   </company>
   , and
   <company id="104156">
    Sara Lee Food
   </company>
   . The medical, security, and tobacco industries are also among its diverse customer base. The privately-held group formed out of the merger between Wisconsin Label and Superior Label Systems in 2000.

   W/S Packaging also provides logistical services such as tracking, shipping, and receiving, as well as development, design, and other pre-press services. Its WebFlex offering is an online service for the production process, providing real time project status and information, as well as the organization of client graphics inventory in an electronic portfolio.

   In 2014  W/S Packaging invested $43 million to expand its current operations in Innovation Valley. The company will open a new location in the PBR Building in the Westbridge Business Park. WS Packaging Group will consolidate its existing Knoxville facilities to this more centralized location.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2012 W/S Packaging expanded its product portfolio to include flexible packaging. The new flexible packaging line offers a wide range of products for a variety of markets and end-user applications. In addition, the flexible packaging line offers paper and film-faced lidding for dry, powdered, and liquid applications. Flexible packaging allows the company to further leverage packaging as a primary point of differentiation for its customers' brands.

  <p>
   In 2012 the company expanded through the acquisition of Boelter Industries in order to boost its folding carton product portfolio. Boelter specializes in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of folding cartons and converted paperboard products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year W/S Packaging acquired Business Graphics Printing, a Knoxville, Tennessee-based provider of offset printing and production of instructional booklets and inserts. The deal adds capabilities in technical literature, as well as materials that must meet regulatory requirements for product information, such those made for the pharmaceutical industry.
