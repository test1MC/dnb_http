   Sequenom develops and manufactures tests for the molecular diagnostics market. Its lab-developed tests are primarily focused on prenatal and ophthalmological diseases and conditions. Tests include MaterniT21 Plus (screen for fetal chromosomal abnormalities), HerediT CF (screen for cystic fibrosis genetic mutations), and SensiGene RHD (screen for fetal Rhesus D factor), as well as RetnaGene AMD (predictive test for age-related macular degeneration). The firm formerly offered technology and tools (principally based on its MassARRAY sequencing system) used by researchers, but sold that business in 2014. Sequenom generates about a quarter of sales outside the US.

    LabCorp

   acquired Sequenom for $371 million in mid-2016.

  <p>
   With the acquisition of Sequenom, LabCorp boosted its own portfolio of non-invasive diagnostics for women's health, prenatal care, and reproductive genetics. Sequenom is now an operating subsidiary of LabCorp.

  <p>
   The US is the company's largest market, accounting for 75% of revenue. Sequenom has office and laboratories in Australia, China, and the US. Its wholly-owned subsidiaries are located in Germany, Hong Kong, and Japan.

   Sequenom sells its products directly in the US, Europe, and select Asian countries, as well as through distributors in other regions. Customers include hospitals and medical labs.

  <p>
   Sequenom has watched its sales climb back from a recession-related drop in 2009. In 2013 it brought in revenue of $162 million, up from about $90 million in 2012. Sales from its former research segment (called Sequenom Bioscience) remained somewhat consistent, while sales from its larger diagnostic tests segment (Sequenom Laboratories) have risen rapidly. The company is, however, a research and development company and has accumulated a deficit of some $1 billion. In 2013 it posted losses of $107 million as a result of its ongoing research and development spending, as well as selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Along with its net losses, the company has traditionally reported losses in cash from operations, including a loss of $86 million in 2013.

  <p>
   The company's focus is on continued development of prenatal diagnostic tests, as well as entry into other areas such as oncology, neurology, infectious diseases, and autoimmunity. Sequenom sold its bioscience business in mid-2014 to Agena Bioscience for nearly $32 million. With flat revenues and gross margins above 60%, the segment had been a concern for the company.

   Still struggling to gain stable financial footing, Sequenom announced plans to cut some 20% of its workforce in early 2016. It put its Research Triangle Park laboratory on the market (those operations will transition to San Diego, California) and began seeking strategic partners for its non-core assets. The company hoped the restructuring efforts would save it some $20 million annually. In mid-2016, Sequenom agreed to be acquired by lab services giant LabCorp.
