   Voith doesn't avoid heavy machinery. The German firm is a holding company for four independent divisions that manufacture and distribute machinery and factory-related products. Voith Paper makes machines used to produce graphic paper, packaging, and tissue. The turbo-power transmission division, Voith Turbo, produces industrial machinery and drive systems for commercial and rail vehicles. Voith Hydro, a joint venture with
   <company id="41843">
    Siemens
   </company>
   , provides turbines, generators, and maintenance services to the hydropower generation industry. Voith Industrial Services offers cleaning and maintenance services to industrial manufacturers.

        <p>
   Voith Paper brings in nearly half of the company's total sales and also produces coaters, finishers, and roll grinders for the paper industry. Voith's Turbo division is its second largest segment, bringing in nearly one-quarter of the machinery manufacturing company's total sales. Voith Hydro is active in R&amp;D for emissions-free power generation from the oceans. Voith Industrial Services caters to industrial manufacturing by providing facility support and cleaning services.

   Voith's revenues decreased by 7% in local currency in fiscal 2014 (September year end). Reasons for this shortfall included project delays at Voith Paper caused by customers as well as a decline in the market for raw materials, which had an impact on Voith Turbo's sales. Sales were also impacted by negative currency effects.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's net income declined by 53% due to lower revenues and higher income tax payables.
  </p>
        <p>
   In fiscal 2014 Voith's operating cash inflow decreased by €191.28 million from €317.08 million in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in net income and a change in working capital items.

   Voith extends its reach internationally through joint ventures and partnerships with other manufacturing companies.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2013 Voith Hydro enhanced its position in the Russian energy market by establishing a joint venture with RusHydro, one of the largest suppliers of hydropower in the world. The new venture, VolgaHydro LLC, is located in Moscow and focuses on extensive modernizations of old hydropower stations.

   Voith was founded by Johann Matthäus Voith in 1867 as a "paper technology" company. Originally named Maschinenfabrik Johann Matthäus Voith, the company received its first patent for a wood grinder in 1869. It soon added water turbines (1870), followed by turbine control systems and paper-rolling machines in 1879. It delivered its first complete paper machine in 1881.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1903 Voith produced what was then the world's most powerful twin turbines, for a power station at Niagara Falls. Five years later it built Germany's first pump storage plant (used in hydroelectric facilities). By 1917 Voith had produced 200 paper machines and 111 magazine grinders for the European market.
  </p>
        <p>
   During the 1920s Voith continued to develop innovative machines for the paper industry (wide newsprint machines and continuous grinders). It added gear drives in 1922 and began developing its Voith-Schneider-Propeller marine drive in 1926. It produced turbo couplings in 1929 and its first hydrodynamic drive for all-terrain vehicles in 1934.
  </p>
        <p>
   Voith's diversification efforts continued into the 1950s. It introduced DIWA automatic transmissions to the market in 1950 and created a hydrodynamic braking system in 1960. Voith expanded outside Germany as it initiated construction of a paper machine plant in Brazil (Voith S.A.) in 1965.
  </p>
        <p>
   Voith developed its Duoformer series of paper sheet formation systems in 1968 and added hydrostatic pumps to its portfolio in 1971. The company formed a joint venture with the US-based Allis-Chalmers Paper Machinery division in 1974, creating Voith-Allis. Three years later, Voith bought out its partner's share and renamed the Wisconsin-based company Voith Inc.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 1978 Voith delivered turbines and constructed the Itaipu Dam on the Parana River between Brazil and Paraguay. At the time it was the world's largest hydroelectric project. Voith introduced turbo transmissions for tippers and loading vehicles in 1980. It furthered its business ties with Allis-Chalmers by buying the company's hydro turbine unit in 1986. The following year Voith purchased
   <company id="14225">
    Farrel Corp.
   </company>
   , a maker of roll grinders for the North American paper and steel industry.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company launched its first paper machine for producing newsprint from 100% recycled paper in 1993. The next year Voith combined its paper machine business with the Switzerland-based
   <company id="91993">
    Sulzer Group
   </company>
   's paper machine unit -- the independent operation became Voith Sulzer Papiertecchnik. Voith became a holding company in 1995, and in 1997 the Voith Group was named J.M. Voith A.G. Also in 1997 Voith Hydro was granted a contract (along with Siemens and
   <company id="10634">
    GE
   </company>
   ) to supply turbines and generators to the Three Gorges hydroelectric power station project in China, the largest project of its kind in the world.
  </p>
        <p>
   Voith's turbo division (drive systems) complemented its drive-shaft product line by adding elastic couplings with the 1998 acquisition of Germany-based Küsel Antriebe. The following year, Voith bought the paper machine clothing, paper rolls, and industrial rolls division of the
   <company id="90363">
    Scapa Group
   </company>
   . Voith combined its hydropower technology business with that of Siemens in 2000 to form 65%-owned Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation. Also in 2000 Voith increased its share of Voith Sulzer Papiertechnik to 90%, and renamed the subsidiary Voith Paper.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2002 Voith proceeded to further integrate its business units, starting with DIW Industriewartung AG (54% interest), which it established as the basis of its Voith Industrial Services division.
  </p>
        <p>
   The Three Gorges power station began generating electricity in 2003. That year the company acquired Finland's Pikoteknik and made it part of Voith Paper. Voith Turbo acquired H+L Hydraulik of Germany in 2004.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2005 Voith took over the service division of
   <company id="102510">
    Dürr
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="120473">
    Premier Manufacturing Support Services
   </company>
   (The Premier Group), when that company underwent restructuring. The Premier Group was made part of the Industrial Services segment. That year Voith Siemens Hydro acquired Wavegen, a developer of wave energy systems.
  </p>
        <p>
   In a surprise move, the company in 2006 stood up against an
   <company id="12517">
    Adecco
   </company>
   takeover offer for
   <company id="106513">
    DIS
   </company>
   , a temporary staffing company in which Voith held a 30% share. Voith asserted that the offer undervalued the company and blocked a fair decision on the part of its top two executives.
