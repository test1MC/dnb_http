   <company id="14120">
    Microsoft
   </company>
   brand voice-over-IP (VoIP) telephone systems and administration software to small and midsized businesses and call centers. Its phone systems utilize both the Internet and public telephone networks to transmit voice signals.

  <p>
   AltiGen makes 50% of it revenue from hosted and support service, which increased 18% in 2015 from 2015. Software accounts for 28% of revenue, which also increased, up 26%, to 2015 from 2014. The company's hardware sales dropped 33% in 2015 to account for 22% of the company's sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   AltiGen's products are made of components by Infineon, PMC Sierra, Texas Instruments, Xilinx, and Zarlink. The company relies on four key suppliers -- AAEON Electronics, Advantech, Avnet, and BCM Communications -- for components. Two distributors -- Fiserv and Synnex -- together accounted for about 31% of AltiGen's revenues in fiscal 2010

  <p>
   After several years of declining revenue (it peaked at $18.9 million in 2008), AltiGen's sales bumped up 2% in 2015 to $9.8 million. The company's shift to hosted services and software resulted in higher revenue in those areas while the company's hardware revenue continued to drop.
  </p>
  <p>
   Higher revenue and reduced costs helped AltiGen post a profit of $644,000 in 2015, up from a loss of $890,000 in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations also increased rising to $785,000 in 2015 from $272,000 in 2014.

   AltiGen is attempting to make the transition from a hardware-based company to one that relies on delivering software-as-a-service to customers. The company offers its communications products through a cloud-based service. The 2015 increases in software and hosted services revenue show the transition is working, the company said. It is spending about a third of its revenue on research and developed to improve current products and develop new ones. In 2016 the company extended Microsoft's Skype for Business and Office 365 capabilities to its MaxACD multi-channel content center.
