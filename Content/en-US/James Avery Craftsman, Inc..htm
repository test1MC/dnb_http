   James Avery has crafted himself quite a successful enterprise. James Avery Craftsman is a top jewelry designer, manufacturer, and retailer in the US, mostly throughout the southern states. Its jewelry collection, numbering some 1,100 designs and 14,000 items made in sterling silver, 14-, and 18-karat yellow and white gold, and gemstones, is sold through about 200 independent retailers and more than 70 of its own stores mostly in Texas, but also in 10 other states. James Avery also sells its products through a catalog and via the Internet. The company got its start in 1954 when James Avery set up shop in a two-car garage with about $250 in capital. The company is still family owned and is run by Avery's sons.

   At a time when many jewelry manufacturers and retailers are still recovering from the downturn in the economy, James Avery is busy breaking ground. In 2014 the chain opened two new stores in Texas -- one in Frisco outside Dallas and another in Austin -- that feature an updated store design. In 2013 it opened a shop in Georgia, and a retail store and visitors' center at its headquarters in Kerrville, as well as its first store in Laredo.
