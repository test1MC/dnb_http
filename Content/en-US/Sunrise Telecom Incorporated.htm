   Sunrise Telecom was founded in 1991 by Robert Pfeiffer, Paul Ker-Chin Chang, and Paul Marshall. It grew through acquisitions to expand its offerings of cable testing, radio-frequency (RF), and wireless measurement products to reduce its reliance on sales of wireline products. Sales more than doubled from 1998 to 1999, and it listed on the NASDAQ in 2000.
