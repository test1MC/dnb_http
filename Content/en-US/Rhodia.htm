   Specialty chemicals company Rhodia (a subsidiary of
   <company id="47385">
    Solvay SA
   </company>
   ) makes performance materials, functional chemicals, and plastics for companies in the automotive, electronics, and personal care products industries. Rhodia's largest unit manufactures polyamide products (such as nylon) used in engineering plastics and high-strength fibers. Its Novecare segment makes surfactants and phosphorous derivatives used in oil and gas exploration, personal care products, and agrochemicals. Rhodia also makes acetate tow (cigarette filters), silicas, and rare earth products. It also makes, recovers, and reprocesses sulfuric acid for oil refiners.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Company Background.flsnp" />
        <p>
   The resulting company had a combined annual revenue of $17 billion and got about 45% of sales from emerging markets such as India, Brazil, and China. Solvay had been looking for a merger partner since selling its pharmaceutical business in 2009.
  </p>
        <p>
   By implementing a decentralized management in 2010 and marking growth as its strategic priority for the year, Rhodia was able to achieve record profitability that year. Its net sales were up 21% from the previous year because of strong demand across regions and segments. Strategic acquisitions, along with other investments that year, drove its growth in emerging countries. Rhodia was benefiting from better global economic conditions and more favorable pricing in 2011, making it attractive for acquisition by Solvay.

        <p>
   Rhodia was formed in 1998 as a post-merger spin-off of the combination of
   <company id="43931">
    Rhône-Poulenc
   </company>
   and
   <company id="41786">
    Hoechst
   </company>
   , which became French drug maker
   <company id="41833">
    Aventis
   </company>
   (and eventually
   <company id="59931">
    Sanofi-Aventis
   </company>
   ). Aventis acquired a 25% stake in Rhodia when it bought back $1 billion in Rhodia bonds, which were exchangeable for shares. In May 2003, Aventis completed a transaction with
   <company id="40792">
    Crédit Lyonnais
   </company>
   that gave the French banking company a 10% stake in Rhodia and left Sanofi-Aventis with about 15% of Rhodia.
   <company id="91357">
    DSM
   </company>
   made a bid to acquire the company in 2001 but was rejected by a group headed by then-chairman and CEO Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, who had the right to vote Aventis' shares.
  </p>
        <p>
   Tirouflet (in charge since the company's inception) had built Rhodia into the world's largest maker of phosphates through its acquisitions of
   <company id="93511">
    Albright &amp; Wilson
   </company>
   (2000) and other firms, but the economy withered, and Rhodia never saw its expected profits.
  </p>
        <p>
   Dismayed by what they viewed as unwise acquisitions and the derailment of the DSM offer, some investors called for Tirouflet's resignation at Rhodia's annual meeting in April 2003. Even though more than two-thirds of Rhodia stockholders voted against the resolution to oust Tirouflet, he ultimately succumbed to pressure (and the loss of Aventis' support for him) and resigned the following October. He was replaced by Jean-Pierre Clamadieu.
  </p>
        <p>
   While FTC and European Commission antitrust laws originally called for Aventis to sell its stake by 2004, the EC eventually ruled that Aventis could hold onto its part of Rhodia (so long as it divested its minority interest in
   <company id="91237">
    Wacker-Chemie
   </company>
   ). Sanofi Aventis eventually did sell its remaining stake in 2006.
  </p>
        <p>
   After spending much of the 1990s adding businesses, Rhodia spent much of the next decade divesting assets to reduce its heavy debt load and, naturally, become a more focused, tightly run organization. Key among its sales were its phenol, hydrochloric acid, and soda ash businesses in Europe to
   <company id="42844">
    Bain Capital
   </company>
   ; its food ingredients business to
   <company id="90954">
    Danisco
   </company>
   ; its specialty phosphates business when Bain Capital again went shopping at Rhodia's sidewalk sale (creating
   <company id="138222">
    Innophos
   </company>
   as a result); and its ISCEON refrigerant unit to
   <company id="10487">
    DuPont
   </company>
   .
  </p>
        <p>
   The shedding continued in 2006 and 2007 as Rhodia sold its loss-making pharmaceutical unit to Shasun Chemicals &amp; Drugs of India and its silicones business to China National BlueStar, a part of
   <company id="159556">
    ChemChina
   </company>
   . Clamadieu promised that last deal was the conclusion of the process, which began in 2003 when he took over as chief executive of the troubled company.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2010, Rhodia acquired Feixiang Chemicals, a China-based maker of amines and surfactants, for $489 million. It also acquired engineering plastics business PI Polymers of India in a move to expand its market share in that country. The deals boosted Rhodia's presence in Asia, its fastest growing market.
