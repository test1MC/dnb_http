   Outokumpu Oyj is out to make its mark but still wants to keep its products stainless. The company operates through its General Stainless and Specialty Stainless segments, the former producing stainless steel coil, wire, rod, and bar products, while the latter makes special products such as ferrochrome, tubes, and quarto plate. In addition, Outokumpu provides technology services associated with smelting and casting. The company's stainless steel business accounts for practically all of its sales; about three-quarters of those sales are to European customers. The government of Finland owns about a third of Outokumpu.

  <p>
   The company operates in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), the Americas, and in the Asia-Pacific (APAC). Finland generates 31% of its net sales, while Germany contributes 24%. Other major markets include Sweden (13%), North America (13%), and the UK (7%).

  <p>
   Outokumpu's growth strategy includes taking steps to improve and stabilize its profitability and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. To reach its goal, the company aims to improve its sales through developing high-volume products, specialty grade products, and expand its ferochrome production. It also plans to develop high efficiency levels in its production and operations, and expand its sales into high-growth markets, particularly those outside of Europe.

  <p>
   Outokumpu Oyj traces its origins back to a copper mine that began operating in Outokumpu, Finland, in 1914. The company took its name from the town where it was born -- Outokumpu translates as "strange hill" -- and built a small smelter there as well. The company struggled for several years against foreign interests that wanted to buy it. When Eero Makinen, a young mining engineer, joined the company in 1918, he advocated that the Finnish government assume ownership, which it did in 1924. In 1932 the company incorporated and took its present name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outokumpu grew rapidly in the 1920s and 1930s as Finland industrialized. In 1935 the company built the world's largest copper smelter in Imatra on Finland's eastern border. To avoid Soviet troops in WWII, Outokumpu completely dismantled the smelter and moved it to safety in western Finland.
  </p>
  <p>
   Firmly established as a copper producer, Outokumpu began production of cobalt, ferrochrome, nickel, and zinc in the 1950s and 1960s. Zinc became the company's second-most important product when it opened its Vihanti mine in 1954. Outokumpu also built a sulfur plant at its Kokkola complex -- located on Finland's west coast -- in 1962 (closed 1977). Outokumpu expanded geographically in the 1970s and the 1980s. With the purchase of the Nippert Company, an Ohio-based copper fabricator, Outokumpu entered the US market. During this time the Kokkola complex also began producing cobalt -- giving the company the distinction of being the only Western European producer of this strategic metal until the late 1980s.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the late 1980s the company set up its many business units as separate companies. Outokumpu restructured in the 1990s to streamline operations and focus on core businesses. Meanwhile, the Finnish government increased its holdings in the company in 1993 as it prepared to privatize the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   In efforts to increase efficiency and invigorate stagnant sales, Outokumpu replaced its five-member executive board with an eight-member executive committee and shed its intermediate managers. Also, the Finnish government announced that it planned to sell its entire stake in the company, although it hasn't to date.
  </p>
  <p>
   Outokumpu acquired Swedish stainless steel specialist Avesta Sheffield in a deal worth about $1.35 billion in 2001, forming a new company called AvestaPolarit. Outokumpu also agreed to acquire Norwegian zinc smelting and refining company Norzink for $180 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Outokumpu formed a technology alliance with Chilean copper giant Codelco and a 55%-owned joint venture with Lennox International that will make heat transfer products. The following year Outokumpu purchased ThyssenKrupp Nirosta's quarto plate business for an undisclosed price.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2005, wanting to concentrate on its stainless steel operations, Outokumpu sold its copper products group, now called
   <company id="111681">
    Luvata
   </company>
   , to private equity firm Nordic Capital for about $770 million. Outokumpu had formerly held a 10% global share of key markets for fabricated copper products (e.g., wire and cable, architectural products, automotive and appliance heat exchangers).
  </p>
  <p>
   The company acquired full ownership of Swedish stainless steel maker AvestaPolarit in the first half of the decade and has since invested $800 million to upgrade the production complex. The move furthered Outokumpu's designs on becoming the world's leading stainless steel producer.
