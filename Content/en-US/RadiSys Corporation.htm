   RadiSys has not turned a profit since 2005, although its loss of $27.6 million in 2014 was better than its $49.4 million loss in 2013. Revenue in the hardware/embedded segment fell 19% in 2014 as network deployments by its customers slowed during the year compared to 2013. The software division was off 10% on softness in the videoconferencing market and delays in LTE small cell buildouts. The lower net loss for 2014 from 2013 came as the company had lower operating cost and tax expenses.

   RadiSys go its start as Radix Microsystems (later shortened to RadiSys) in 1987 by Glenford Myers, a former manager at
   <company id="13787">
    Intel
   </company>
   , and Intel colleagues David Budde and Robert Patterson (all three have since left the company). Myers modeled RadiSys after Intel, measuring worker productivity and linking it to objectives, giving employees stock options, and -- like Intel's chairman, Andy Grove -- leading classes on his company's corporate culture. In 1988

   , the world's #1 maker of oscilloscopes, bought an embedded computer (for test and measurement equipment) from RadiSys and subsequently invested $1.5 million in the company.
