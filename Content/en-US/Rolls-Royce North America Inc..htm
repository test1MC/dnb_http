   Rolls-Royce, however,&#160;concentrates most of its efforts&#160;in the defense market, and, to this end, headquarters&#160;the president of&#160;its defense in the US. Although the company's engine and related technologies are used in&#160;military aircraft and vessels around the globe, the

Moreover, one-quarter of US military aircraft are powered by its engines. The company support repairs and overhauls of its engine portfolio at more than a dozen sites worldwide.

        <p>
   Rolls-Royce North America also taps commercial and naval marine markets, offering a slew of gas turbines and diesel engines for seafaring power requirements. Its lineup runs from&#160;propellers and tunnel thrusters to&#160;steering gear and stabilizers, water jets, bearings, and deck machinery.&#160;Rolls-Royce equipment has been installed on more than 30,000 vessels, including those of 70 navies.
  </p>
        <p>
   The president of Rolls-Royce's energy business is also based in the US. The energy portfolio includes industrial gas turbine compression and power generation packages for on-and-offshore projects as well as pipeline applications. Its Trent 60 is touted as the market's most efficient and powerful aero-derived gas turbine.
