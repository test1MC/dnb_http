   Rolls-Royce Holdings doesn't make cars so luxurious you'll cry (see
   <company id="134055">
    Motor Cars
   </company>
   ), but it sure can make an aircraft engine whine. One of the world's largest aircraft engine makers, Rolls-Royce, through its Civil and Defense Aerospace businesses, makes commercial and military engines for a broad customer base, including airlines, corporate and utility aircraft and helicopter operators, and armed forces around the world. Beyond aviation, its Energy unit supplies gas turbine power generation to the oil and gas industry, while its
   <company id="139279">
    Marine
   </company>
   segment makes propulsion systems that power 70 navies worldwide. Rolls-Royce has operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, with an emerging presence in the Middle East.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company operates two divisions: Aerospace, and Land &amp; Sea.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Aerospace division covers both civil and military aviation, for which it develops, manufactures, markets and sells engines and power systems. The division's engines are found in the aircraft such as the Airbus A380, and on the defense side of things, Rolls-Royce commands approximately one-quarter of the world's military engine manufacturing market share. Its portfolio covers all major sectors -- combat, helicopters, unmanned and tactical aircraft, training, and transport. The Land &amp; Sea division has three interests of power systems, marine propulsion, and nuclear power generation and propulsion. Its PWR2 nuclear propulsion system is found in the Royal Navy's Trident submarine fleet.

  <p>
   Headquartered in London, Rolls-Royce has operations in over 50 countries and customers in over 150 worldwide. Europe is the company's biggest market at around 35% of sales, followed by North America at 30% and Asia at 20%.

  </p>
  <p>
   After a few years of growth from 2011, sales have flattened, coming in at £13.7 billion in 2014 and 2015. Sales in Land &amp; Sea were marginally lower than prior year due to weakness in Marine sales. Net income nudged up £14 million in 2015 to £83 million due to a decrease in taxation and commercial and administrative costs. Cash flow from operations fell 16% to £1.1 billion due to changes in provisions.

  <p>
   The company undertook a restructuring initiative in 2014 and 2015 to enhance operational efficiency, which included the axing of 600 management jobs since mid-2015 and the consolidation of its Civil Aerospace repair and overhaul activities, allowing for the closure of sites in Brazil and the UK. It sold its Michell Bearings business in November 2015 for £12.6 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce expects to see an uptick in its overseas business following the sharp fall in value of the Pound Sterling subsequent to the EU referendum in mid-2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce is possibly weighing up an escalation of its nuclear activities after the UK government announced a £250 million competition to encourage development of small modular reactor (SMR) technologies, which have potential uses as part of a 7 gigawatt network of SMRs.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In mid-2016, Rolls-Royce announced the purchase of the remaining 53% of shares in Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP) for €720 million in order to strengthen its large engine growth program. ITP brings with it long-term aftermarket revenue, including the high volume Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines. The acquisition is expected to complete in 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, the company acquired R.O.V Technologies, which makes products that allow for the remote inspection and cleaning of boiling/pressurized water reactors, complementing Rolls-Royce's existing nuclear activities.

  <p>
   In 1906 automobile and aviation enthusiast Charles Rolls and engineer Henry Royce unveiled the Silver Ghost, an automobile that earned Rolls-Royce a reputation as maker of the best car in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year after Rolls' 1910 death in a biplane crash, Royce suffered a breakdown. From his home Royce continued to design Rolls-Royce engines such as the Eagle, its first aircraft engine, in 1914, and other engines used to power airplanes during WWI -- but management of the company fell to Claude Johnson, who remained chief executive until 1926.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the company returned primarily to making cars after WWI, its engines were used in several history-making flights and, in 1931, set world speed records for land, sea, and air. Rolls-Royce bought the Bentley Motor Company that year. In 1933 it introduced the Merlin engine, which powered the Spitfire, Hurricane, and Mustang fighters of WWII. Rolls-Royce began designing a jet engine in 1938, and over the years it pioneered the turboprop engine, turbofan, and vertical takeoff engine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Realizing that it had to break into the lucrative US airliner market to stay alive, Rolls-Royce bought its main British competitor, Bristol-Siddley Engines, in 1966. With Bristol-Siddley came its contract to build the engine for the Anglo-French Concorde in 1976 and a US presence.
  </p>
  <p>
   <company id="10903">
    Lockheed
   </company>
   ordered the company's RB211 engine for its TriStar in 1968, but Rolls-Royce underestimated the project's technical and financial challenges and entered bankruptcy in 1971. The British government stepped in and nationalized the aerospace division and sold the auto group. The RB211 entered service on the TriStar in 1972 and on the Boeing 747 in 1977.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce was reprivatized in 1987. In a diversification effort two years later, the company bought mining, marine, and power plant specialist Northern Engineering Industries. In the early 1990s the aerospace market was hurt by military spending cutbacks and a recession; the company cut more than 18,000 jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
   A joint venture with BMW launched the BR710 engine for Gulfstream and Canadair's long-range business jets in 1990. The company bought Allison Engine in 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce sold Parsons Power Generation Systems to Siemens in 1997. Also that year it won a contract to supply Trent 892 engines for Boeing 777 jets being built for American Airlines (a subsidiary of
   <company id="10021">
    AMR Corporation
   </company>
   ) in a deal worth $1 billion.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the British government approved a repayable investment of about $335 million in the company to develop a new model of Trent aircraft engines. Narrowing its focus, the company sold its power transmission and distribution business to Austria-based
   <company id="93836">
    VA Technologie
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce pumped up its gas and oil equipment business in 1999 by buying the rotating compression equipment unit of Cooper Cameron (now
   <company id="44237">
    Cameron International
   </company>
   ); it became one of the world leaders in marine propulsion by acquiring
   <l1>
    Vickers
   </l1>
   . The company then bought the aero and industrial engine repair service of First Aviation Services and took full control of its aircraft-engine joint venture with BMW; in return BMW received a 10% stake in Rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 subsidiary Rolls-Royce Energy Systems India Private was awarded its first order: producing a Bergen gas engine for Garden Silk Mills for powering a textile plant in India. That year Rolls-Royce won a contract to supply engines for Israel's
   <company id="57865">
    El Al
   </company>
   airline's Boeing 777s. Late in 2000 it was reported that the company would cut about 5,000 jobs over three years.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2001 Rolls-Royce sold most of its Vickers Turbine Components business. In October the company cut about 11% of its workforce in response to the worldwide crisis in the commercial jet business.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 the company announced that it had inked a 10-year, $2 billion deal to supply engines to Gulfstream Aerospace. That year Rolls-Royce sold its
   <company id="105178">
    Vickers Defence Systems
   </company>
   unit, which made tanks and armored vehicles, to
   <company id="93514">
    Alvis Plc
   </company>
   . In 2003 Sir Ralph Robins, who had been executive chairman for more than a decade, retired from his post.
  </p>
  <p>
   Early in 2004 Rolls-Royce and GE Aircraft Engines were picked to supply engines for Boeing's upcoming 787 Dreamliner. Rolls-Royce was also selected to supply engines for Airbus' upcoming behemoth A380.
  </p>
  <p>
   In late 2007 it scored one of its largest contracts, a $42 million project to provide steering gear and deck machinery for Chinese shipbuilder Sinopacific.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2008 it entered into a joint venture with
   <company id="10156">
    Goodrich Corporation
   </company>
   called Aero Engine Controls to produce engine controls for Rolls-Royce aircraft. It also partnered with France's
   <company id="104852">
    AREVA
   </company>
   to construct the first new nuclear reactors built in the UK in more than 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company focused on developing four advanced manufacturing research centers in the US, the UK, and Singapore. Rolls-Royce invested £300 million (more than $450 million) in its UK factories as part of its almost £2 billion (over $3 billion) capital replacement plan to be carried out over a period of 10 years. That year Rolls-Royce engines allowed the BAE Systems' Mantis UAV, and AgustaWestland's Lynx Wildcat helicopter to take flight.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rolls-Royce's nuclear market was strengthened in 2009 by its agreement with electric service provider
   <company id="133685">
    EDF Energy
   </company>
   (formerly known as London Electricity Group) to enter into a joint venture, with EDF Energy giving support to the UK facility. The following year the company introduced its STOVL (short take-off and vertical landing) Rolls-Royce LiftSystem.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bell of financial crisis knelled in 2008, causing the company to implement cost-cutting measures, which included headcount reductions of almost 10%. The company, in partnership with
   <company id="57976">
    GE Aviation
   </company>
   , continued development of the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and its Trent 1000 engine took its first flight in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Also in 2008 Rolls-Royce established its civil nuclear business to tap a growing global market.
