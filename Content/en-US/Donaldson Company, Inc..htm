   Grime fighter Donaldson is cleaning up the industrial world. The company makes filtration systems designed to remove contaminants from air and liquids. Donaldson's engine products business makes air intake and exhaust systems, liquid-filtration systems, and replacement parts; products are sold to manufacturers of construction, mining, and transportation equipment, as well as parts distributors and fleet operators. The company's industrial products include dust, fume, and mist collectors and air filtration systems used in industrial gas turbines, computer disk drives, and manufacturers' clean rooms. Donaldson operates in 44 countries worldwide and has 42 manufacturing plants.

  <p>
   The company has two reporting segments: Engine Products and Industrial Products. Products in the Engine Products segment consist of air filtration systems, exhaust, and emissions systems, liquid filtration systems including hydraulics, fuel, and lube, and replacement filters. In fiscal 2016 (July year end) Engine Products accounted for 63% of Donaldson's total sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Products in the Industrial Products segment (37%) consist of dust, fume, and mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, air filtration systems for gas turbines, PTFE membrane-based products, and specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including computer hard disk drives and semi-conductor manufacturing.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Donaldson has 19 distribution centers, 8 located in the Americas, 8 in the Asia/Pacific region, and 3 in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
  </p>
  <p>
   A global player, the company has generated an increasing amount of its revenues from outside the US in recent years, although the US accounted for 42% of the company's net sales in fiscal 2016. Europe accounted for 29%; Asia/Pacific, 20%.

  <p>
   The company's Engine Products segment sells to OEMs in the construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense, and truck markets. It also sells to dealer networks, private label accounts, large equipment fleet operators, and independent distributors. The Industrial Products segment sells to OEMs of gas-fired turbines, and to various industrial dealers, distributors, and directly to customers.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net sales of $2.2 billion decreased by 6% compared to fiscal 2015 due to decreased sales from the engine products segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Engine Products segment sales decreased driven by declines in all product groups and the impact of foreign currency translation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income declined by 8% to $190.8 million due to decreased sales and increased interest expense. Interest rose due to debt issued in April 2015 that was outstanding for all of fiscal 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fiscal 2016, net cash provided by the operating activities increased by 34% compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to change in inventories, and prepaid and other current assets.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company is pursuing a strategy of growth through the diversification of its products and technologies to limit the impact of any weakness in a product line, market, or geographic region. Pivotal to its growth plan, which includes both acquisitions and organic growth, are investments and improvement initiatives that target $3 billion in revenues.
  </p>
  <p>
   Donaldson has acquired a number of companies to build its global brand base with 30 major brands, including Duratek, Formix, PowerCore, Synteq, Tetratex, and Ultrafilter. It has also grown organically with investments in operations such as liquid filtration, where it upgraded capabilities that targeted hydraulic fluid systems in mobile equipment, manufacturing plants, and aerospace markets. The company is also investing in global R&amp;D and product development, and has completed new labs in growing markets such as China and India. In addition, it has expanded its manufacturing and distribution operations worldwide, including upgrading a Chinese campus.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015, Donaldson opened two new distribution centers in Bogota and Cartagena, Colombia, and a new manufacturing plant in Skarbimierz, Poland.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it opened the company's fourth distribution center in Latin America, in Lima, Peru, and new distribution center in Slovakia to support the Donaldson's customers across that region.

  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it acquired Engineered Products Company, a leading designer and manufacturer of indicators, gauges, switches and sensors for engine air filtration and liquid filtration systems. That year it also bought control og IFIL.USA, LLC, a manufacturer of pleated bag filters for industrial dust collection.

  <p>
   Frank Donaldson, a salesman for Bull Tractor, invented the first air filter for a combustion engine in 1915 after a tractor he had sold kept breaking down. Noticing a buildup of dirt in the intake manifold, he made a filter out of wire mesh and cloth. The tractor ran, but Donaldson lost his job: His boss did not appreciate his pointing out a defect in the company's products. Donaldson started his own company with his father and his brother Bob to make air filters for tractors. In 1941 the company won a contract to make air filters for US army tanks. Frank Donaldson died in 1945, and John Emblom became president. In 1951 Emblom and a group of senior managers tried to buy the company from the Donaldson family but were rebuffed. Emblom and his allies quit, and Frank Donaldson Jr. became president. The company went public in 1955.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under Frank Jr. the company expanded, introducing new products (including the first paper filter for the heavy-duty air-cleaner industry) and buying other companies. In 1974 Donaldson bought Torit, which expanded the company into industrial dust collection. Frank Jr. retired as CEO in 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1990s Donaldson continued to expand its product line. In 1998 the company increased its ownership in PT Panata Jaya Mandiri, an Indonesian joint venture, to 30%. The next year it bought AirMaze (industrial compressor filters) and opened a manufacturing facility in China.
  </p>
  <p>
   Donaldson acquired DCE (dust collection systems, UK) from Invensys in 2000. It then combined DCE with its Torit business to form Donaldson Dust Collection.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2002 Donaldson bought German-based ultrafilter international AG -- maker of compress air purification components. The next year the company expanded its hydraulic filters business through the acquisition of LHA Industrial.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2004 Donaldson formed an aerospace and defense business unit, merging the operations of its aircraft and defense groups. The company also sold a manufacturing plant located in Stow, Ohio, to Falls Filtration Technology. Later that year Bill Van Dyke stepped down as president and CEO of the company, retaining his position as chairman. SVP Bill Cook was appointed president and CEO to replace him. (Cook was named chairman the next year after Van Dyke retired.) Donaldson closed out 2004 with the acquisition of Canadian liquid filter manufacturer Triboguard Company.
  </p>
  <p>
   Donaldson added to its engine and industrial segment and its first fit-solutions and replacement filters businesses. Acquisitions included AirCel Corporation, a privately held manufacturer of dryers and purification equipment (2006); Aerospace Filtration Systems, from Westar Aerospace and Defense Group (2007); and
   <company id="129202">
    Western Filter Corp.
   </company>
   , a maker of liquid filtration systems and replacement filters (2008).
  </p>
  <p>
   Donaldson sold its Ultracool chiller business, based in Terrassa, Spain, to LAUDA, a German manufacturer of temperature control equipment, in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company announced the construction of a new filter manufacturing plant in Skarbimierz, Poland  (its third in the region) to serve the filtration needs of Donaldson's European and Russian customers.
  </p>
  <p>
   That year Donaldson agreed to sell Ultratroc Gmbh, a manufacturer of compressed airdryers (and part of Donaldson's Industrial Products segment) in Flensburg, Germany, to IJW Anlagenbau Gmbh.
