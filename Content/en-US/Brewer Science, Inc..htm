   Brewer Science focuses on product development in niche markets, and on rolling out new products.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it introduced the first aqueous, surfactant-free, ready-to-use semiconducting CNT inks for microelectronics and printed electronics applications.
  </p>
  <p>
   A year earlier, Brewer Science installed a scale-up reactor to increase production by ten-fold of its CNTRENE C100 family of electronics-grade CNT materials (used in chemical and biological sensors and nanotube-based nonvolatile random access memory device applications).
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2013 the company broke ground on a new facility at the Rolla National Airport which will be used to produce advanced materials for manufacturing next-generation smartphones, tablet computers, and other microelectronic devices. It also got the approval of a $1 million grant from the Economic Development Administration, a bureau of the
