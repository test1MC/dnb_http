   In 2014 Overhead Door introduced its Model 674 Security Grille, a new perforated grille constructed from lightweight aluminum panels (providing security while maximizing visibility, air flow and light infiltration) as an attractive security solution for interior spaces in retail facilities, airports, stadiums, multi-purpose buildings, and malls.

  <p>
   New products in 2013 included the Stormtite AP Model 627 an improved thermal efficiency and security door system; and (to meet demand from homeowners who want attractive garage doors that complement their homes' architecture) a V5 stamp that mimics the look and feel of wainscoting, a raised panel Ranch stamp on Overhead Door's Thermacore line, and decorative window inserts on its Traditional Steel Collection.

  <p>
   The company has a history of growing through acquisitions. In 2012 Overhead Door acquired Door Control, a supplier of automatic doors based in the US. In late 2011, it expanded its North American footprint through the $45 million purchase of Creative Door Services, a Western Canada-based provider of door products and related services to the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. It also picked up Automatic Door Enterprises that year.

  <p>
   Overhead Door was founded by C. G. Johnson, who invented the upward-lifting garage door in 1921 and the electric garage door opener in 1926.
