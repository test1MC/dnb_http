   Kaiser Aluminum may not be the biggest aluminum company on the block, but it holds its own in fabricating specialty aluminum products. It operates 11 fabricated product plants in the US and one in Canada. Kaiser manufactures rolled, extruded, and drawn aluminum products to serve customers in the aerospace, automotive, general engineering, and custom industrial markets. The company purchases primary aluminum ingot and recycled and scrap aluminum from third-party suppliers to make its fabricated products. Some of its facilities supply billet, log, and other aluminum materials to its other plants for use in production.

        <p>
   The company's main operations are conducted through its Fabricated Products segment. Its rolled, extruded, and drawn aluminum products are used in the aerospace and defense, automotive, consumer durables, electronics, electrical, and machinery and equipment markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Kaiser's aerospace and high-strength products include custom-made forms manufactured for the global aerospace and defense industries and include aluminum plate, sheet, extruded shapes, and tube. The unit also makes specialized rod and bar products.
  </p>
        <p>
   Its general engineering unit consists primarily of 6000-series alloy products, including rod, bar, tube, wire, sheet, plate, and extrusions. The products are used in many applications, including for protection of military vehicles, in the manufacturing process for LCD screens, and in vacuum chambers used to manufacture semiconductors. The unit's rods and bars are used in rivets, nails, screws, and bolts in machinery and equipment.
  </p>
        <p>
   Automotive extrusions are used in a variety of products, including bumpers, antilock braking systems, and drawn tubes for drive shafts. Other products include extruded and drawn aluminum products for a variety of industrial applications, including consumer durables, electronics, machinery and equipment, and trucks.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Kaiser sells directly to customers in the US, Canada, Europe, and China, and through independent sales agents in Asia, Mexico, and the Middle East. Its sales and marketing efforts are focused on the markets for aerospace and high-strength products, general engineering products, automotive extrusions, and other products.

        <p>
   Diversified metal services center
   <company id="42203">

   is the company's largest customer, accounting for 22% of sales in 2012, while its top five customers account for about 46%.

        <p>
   Benefiting from a stronger economy, Kaiser's revenues grew by almost 5% in 2012 thanks to a 4% increase in shipments. The shipment growth reflected a 17% rise in aerospace and high-strength products shipments thanks to higher commercial aerospace demand for plate and sheet products and 6% increase in general engineering products shipments as a result of higher demand in the general engineering end use market. These gains were offset by a 23% slump in the shipment of other products.
  </p>
        <p>
   In 2012 Kaiser reported net income of $85.8 million, 241% up in 2011 thanks to higher revenues and increased net sales and operating income.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
        <p>
   Kaiser has been pursuing a strategy of organic growth by increasing capacity and improving its product capabilities. For example, in 2011 it invested heavily in expanding its capacity and increasing its thickness capability for producing its aluminum heat treat plate for its aerospace extrusion products made in Spokane, Washington. The company also made a major investment at its Kalamazoo, Michigan, plant to improve the capabilities of its rod and bar operations and to provide more capacity for growth of its extrusion products.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company also includes the use of key acquisitions in its strategy for growth. Its latest purchases were the Florence, Alabama, plant and assets of
   <company id="115646">
    Nichols Wire
   </company>
   and a manufacturing plant in Chandler, Arizona, and assets of Alexco. The Alabama plant makes alloy wire products, nails, and aluminum rods, and the Arizona plant makes hard-alloy extrusions for the aerospace industry. In 2011 Kaiser began an expansion at its Arizona plant.
  </p>
        <p>
   Another part of Kaiser's strategy is to maintain long-standing customer relationships with blue chip companies through its major business segments. It has developed processes that provide continual quality improvements as well as the Kaiser Production System, which is designed to continually reduce its manufacturing costs. The system eliminates waste, promotes efficiency, and works to mitigate the impact of volatility in the price of its raw materials.
