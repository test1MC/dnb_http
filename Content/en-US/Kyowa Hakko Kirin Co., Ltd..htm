  <p>
   Net sales decreased 2% to ¥333.4 billion in fiscal 2014 as pharmaceuticals sales declined on reductions in National Health Insurance (NHI) reimbursement prices. The Bio-Chemicals division saw increased earnings that year, though, thanks to domestic sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as positive impact of foreign exchange rates.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income also fell in 2014, sinking 89% to ¥15.8 billion on decreased sales and increased expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses rose that year as the group consolidated Archimedes Pharma and spent more on research and development. Cash flow from operations fell 194% to ¥19.3 billion due to changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable.

   Kyowa Hakko Kirin believes in its strengths in biotechnology, which it intends to use in order to grow to a global specialty pharmaceutical firm. The company has categorized its business into four disease areas: nephrology, oncology, immunology and allergy, and central nervous system. One recently developed product, the therapeutic antibody drug KW-0761 (Poteligeo), is one example of the firm's sophisticated biotechnology capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also works in partnership with other pharmaceuticals. In 2015 it entered into a clinical trial collaboration with
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   to study mogamulizumab (an anti-CCR4 antibody) and Opdivo (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) as a combined treatment for tumors. Also that year, it entered an agreement with AstraZeneca for the exclusive rights to commercialize KHK4563 (benralizumab) in Japan and certain parts of Asia.
