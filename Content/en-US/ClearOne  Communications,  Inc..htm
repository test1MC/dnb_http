   ClearOne's revenue was flat while net income rose in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's revenue fell by about $1 million (0.2%) in 2015 to $57 million. A 22% sales fall in the unified communications business cut overall growth for the company as sales rose in audio conferencing and video products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise in net income, 21% higher to $6.8 million in 2015 from $5.6 million in 2014, came from lower costs related to sales and marketing and employees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations was $7.6 million for 2015, compared to $6.7 million in 2014.

   With a self-proclaimed 50% market share in the global professional audio conferencing market, ClearOne aims to maintain its position as a leader in professional audio conferencing products for large businesses. It would also like to diversify its offerings with more lower-cost and less complex products for small and medium businesses, like its INTERACT line for small businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company added to its portfolio of wireless microphone systems with the introduction of digital compressed versions, Dante standard compatible versions, and more frequency ranges which cater to international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   ClearOne moved to expand partnerships with large IT distributors in order to increase sales of unified communications audio and video products. It combines Spontania, cloud-based video conferencing product acquired in 2014, with the COLLABORATE product, an appliance-based media collaboration tool to generate revenue.

  <p>
   Gentner started the business in 1981 to make and sell an upgraded version of a telephone interface device he had developed while studying electrical engineering. Initially the company manufactured telephone patching products for the broadcast market. It went public in 1985 and in 1991 entered the audio-conferencing market as a supplier of acoustic echo cancelers and telephone equipment for teleconferencing. The next year Gentner Communications purchased the Audisk line of digital audio-storage systems from Macromedia (since acquired by Adobe), which are used by radio stations. It started its conference-call service in 1993, as well as a line of listening-assistance products, which are benefiting from strong demand thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Audisk acquisition proved unprofitable and was sold in 1994 as part of the company's restructuring, which also included increased investments in research and development and marketing.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company returned to profitability in 1995 and began marketing a portable audio-conferencing system designed to provide professional-quality multiline calling. In 1997 Gentner consolidated manufacturing, engineering, and other functions to improve efficiency and cut costs, and expanded its international marketing efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2001, Gentner changed its name to ClearOne Communications.
  </p>
  <p>
   ClearOne sold its line of broadcast telephone interface products in 2002 as part of its strategy to focus on conferencing. The company in 2004 sold its conferencing services division to Ptek Holdings for about $20 million. It sold its Canadian subsidiary OM Video, which provided audio-visual integration services, the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2009 the company bought Texas-based NetStreams, a provider of audio conferencing systems, for about $4 million in cash and debt. ClearOne said the addition of NetStreams complementary products and distribution lines will help it gain ground in the conferencing market.
