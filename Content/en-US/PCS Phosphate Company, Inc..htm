   Plants, cows, and chickens have got to eat too, you know. The products of PCS Phosphate Company are used as ingredients for fertilizers (both liquid and solid), livestock and poultry feed, and industrial applications. Almost two-thirds of its products are used in fertilizers. Its operations form the phosphate business line of global agrochemical giant
   <company id="51140">
    PotashCorp
   </company>
   , which also mines nitrates and potash. PotashCorp has a handful manufacturing facilities in the US. Its two largest facilities are in North Carolina (PCS Phosphate, aka PotashCorp Arurora) and Florida, situated alongside its phosphate rock mining operations, which allows PotashCorp to cut transportation and shipping costs significantly.

   The unit is also a member company of
   <company id="113504">
    Phosphate Chemicals Export Association Inc
   </company>
   . (PhosChem), which was established to promote US exports of phosphates. PhosChem exports its products to countries outside North America and the European Union.

   In 2012 PCS Phosphate teamed up with TroposÂ® Networks to deployed a Tropos wireless communications network at the company's Aurora, North Carolina phosphate mine. The network transports telemetry data from instrumentation on mining and processing equipment such as shovels, draglines, conveyors, and feeders.

  <p>
   That year, the company announced it would cut 150 full-time positions (15% of its workforce) in order to lower operating costs and stay competitive.
