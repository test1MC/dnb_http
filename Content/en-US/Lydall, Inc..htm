   Lydall's products help to beat the heat, nix the noise, and filter the rest. The company makes thermal and acoustical barriers, automotive heat shields, and insulation products that offer protection in extreme temperatures. Lydall's thermal and acoustical products are used by the appliance and automotive industries, and in industrial kilns and furnaces. The company rounds out its offerings with industrial and commercial air and liquid filtration products in addition to energy storage, close-out panels, and felt manufacturing services and products. Export sales represent about 35% of the company's annual net sales.

   The company has operations in Europe, Asia, and the US, which accounted for about 70% of its revenue in 2015.

  <p>
   Lydall's segments include Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Fibers (nearly 60% of sales) which produces noise and heat abatement products for automotive applications, and Performance Materials (12%) which encompasses its filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses. Its Industrial Filtration segment offers industrial non-woven felt media and filter bags.

   Lydall's products are primarily sold directly to customers through an internal sales force and external sales representatives and distributed via common carrier. The majority of products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and tier-one suppliers. Sales to

   accounted for almost 20% of net sales in 2015.

  <p>
   After revenues peaked at a record-setting $536 million in 2014, Lydall saw its revenues fall 2% to $525 million in 2015. The company's profits, however, more than doubled from $22 million in 2014 to $46 million in 2015 mainly due to a gain on sale of its Life Sciences Vital Fluids business and a decrease in selling, product development, and administrative expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
   The revenue dip for 2015 was fueled by lower sales from its Performance Materials segment and due to the divestiture of its Life Sciences Vital Fluids business. Performance Materials segment sales also decreased due to lower demand for air filtration products and thermal insulation products, particularly in Asia and North America. It also experienced lower demand for its water purification and life protection application products and for cryogenic insulation products serving the liquid natural gas market.

  <p>
   For its growth strategy, Lydall focuses on new product development, geographic expansion into Asia and Europe, acquisitions, and the application of Lean Six Sigma initiatives. A major focus for the company in 2014 is the integration of its acquired companies and the introduction of Lean Six Sigma principles to the acquired businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2014 the company acquired the industrial filtration business from Andrew Industries Limited for $83 million. The acquisition enhanced Lydall's already strong position in the filtration and engineered materials markets.
