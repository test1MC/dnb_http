   AB SKF is on a roll ... or at least its bearings are. One of the world's leading makers of roller and ball bearings, SKF produces a variety of bearings and units, as well as seals, mechatronics (electromechanical tools and systems), and lubrication systems, and related products and services. SKF's business is divided by customer segment into three divisions: Industrial (consisting of seven business units; catering to industrial OEMs), Automotive (OEMs and aftermarket), and Specialty Business (includes

   , among others). It operates in more than 130 countries worldwide and has around 15,000 distributor locations.

  <p>
   SKF's revenues and profits have fluctuated over the years. After declining in 2013, revenues increased in 2014 due to organic growth and favorable currency translations within the Automotive and Specialty Business segments. After declining in 2013, profits increased during 2014 primarily due to a decrease in other expenses related to a provision for an European Commission payment.

  <p>
   SKF looks to improve its manufacturing capacity and marketplace presence from acquisitions. In 2014 SKF acquired GLOi, a Swedish-based alignment technology products and services company, and Hofmann Engineering North America, a specialist engineering services company located in Ontario, Canada.

   In a sweeping move for the bearings industry, SKF the previous year obtained US-based

   Corporation in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.25 billion. Kaydon is a diversified industrial manufacturer with expertise in friction control products (bearings), velocity control products, and specialty products (including environmental services).

  <p>
   SKF began as the brainchild of Sven Wingquist, a maintenance engineer at the Swedish textile company Gamlestadens Fabriker. Displeased with imported bearings used in Gamlestadens Fabriker's factories, Wingquist (with resources allotted by Fabriker) founded Svenska Kullagerfabriken (SKF) in 1907 and produced bearings from his own workshop. In 1910 SKF had one factory in Sweden; the following year, the company established another in the UK.
  </p>
  <p>
   SKF reaped the financial benefits of being based in a neutral country during WWI, selling its products to both the Allied and Central powers. In 1914 subsidiaries were established in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Russia. Two years later SKF bought a steel works company in Sweden to supply the company with steel. Also in 1916 SKF opened a plant in the US. By 1918 the company had 12 factories and its sales force spanned 100 countries. An economic slump sagged the company's sales in the early 1920s. SKF's Volvo subsidiary entered the automobile manufacturing industry in 1926 and acted as SKF's testing unit until it was spun off in 1935.
  </p>
  <p>
   The onset of the Great Depression allowed SKF to purchase some of its German competitors. In 1929 SKF's stock began trading internationally, and the company purchased Swedish machine toolmaker Lidkopings Mekaniska Verkstad. In the thick of the Depression, SKF concentrated its efforts on R&amp;D, and in 1932 it patented two spherical rolling-bearing products.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company enjoyed a few prosperous years after the Depression, but WWII and harder times were lurking. During the war the Allies bombed SKF's Schweinfurt and Canstatt factories. The company's reconstruction efforts included building manufacturing plants in Spain, Canada, and the Netherlands, followed by expansion into Brazil and India. By 1950 the company boasted 18 factories with 65% of its workforce operating outside Sweden. In 1957 the company added a new ball and roller factory (one of its biggest buildings) to its ranks. SKF built a research center in the US in 1963. In 1969 astronaut Neil Armstrong took photos of the historic moon landing with a camera fitted with SKF bearings.
