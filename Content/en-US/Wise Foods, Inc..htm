   Wise was purchased by investment firm
   <company id="160710">
    Palladium Equity Partners
   </company>
   in 2000. Additionally, Wise received a boost through a late 2010 credit facility provided by
   <company id="110888">
    Ally Commercial Finance
   </company>
   and
   <company id="43517">
    Siemens Financial Services
   </company>
   . The deal involved a $48 million credit facility, a revolving credit line, and a term loan. The debt arrangements, which came on the heels of the economic downturn, allowed Wise to refinance existing debt while keeping an eye on growth.
