   MSA Safety develops, manufactures, and distributes protective equipment for workers in hazardous situations, from the military and homeland security to firefighting, construction, and mining, of course. MSA specializes in air-purifying respirators, gas detectors, and head protection gear, sold under the MSA Safety Works brand. Its thermal imaging cameras help first responders see through pitch and smoke. MSA aligns its activities with three geographic segments: North America (the largest in sales and operations), Europe, and international. Products are made worldwide by MSA or by third parties.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The North America segment, 50% of sales, markets most of its non-military products through distributors. Fire service products are sold through specially trained local and regional distributors. Safety Works serves the DIY and contractor segments. Canada, Mexico, and the US are included in this segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The international segment, 24% of sales, distributes through direct and indirect sales forces and focuses on the fire service market. Because a distribution network has not been fully developed in that segment, MSA staff markets products directly to end users. The segment maintains facilities in South America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. Manufacturing is centered in Australia, Brazil, China, and South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Europe segment, 26% of sales, also distributes through direct and indirect sales and focuses on the fire service market. The segment has facilities in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Morocco, Sweden, and the UK. Most products sold by both the international and European segments are obtained from third parties or made by the company in China, France, Germany, and the US.

  <p>
   After achieving record-setting revenue and profit milestones in 2012, MSA saw its revenues dip 6% to $1.11 billion and profits fall 3% to $88 million in 2013. (Note: the company restated its 2012 annual financials due to discontinued operations for that year.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The declines for 2013 were driven by a decrease in international segment sales primarily related to a weaker Australian dollar and Brazilian real. The erosion of profits for 2013 was driven by spike in research and development costs associated with product development.

  <p>
   As a more general strategy the company aligns its manufacturing footprint with demand from three core groups: the military, industrial end-users, distributors (

   ,
   <company id="11593">
    W.W. Grainger

   , and
   <company id="91612">
    Hagemeyer
   </company>
   ), and retailers and equipment rental outlets, such as

    United Rentals

   ,
   <company id="11470">
    The Home Depot
   </company>
   and
   <company id="40108">
    TrueValue
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   To focus more on industrial head protection, respiratory protective equipment, fall protection products, portable gas detection instruments and sensors, and fixed gas- and flame-detection systems, MSA sold its North America ballistic helmet business to Vermont-based Revision Military for an undisclosed amount in 2012. It also divested its South African personal protective equipment distribution business and its Zambian operations in 2013.
