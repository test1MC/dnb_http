   In order to continue its growth trajectory, the company is focusing on its portfolio of game content that attracts casino-goers and generates revenues for casinos. Its product development efforts emphasize networking technologies that can connect multiple games. These systems are used for progressive jackpots and to allow casinos to monitor gamblers for their popular player rewards programs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to its proprietary games, WMS Industries licenses well-known brands for use in its systems. Its
   <em>
    Monopoly
   </em>
   -branded machines, produced through an exclusive agreement with toy maker
   <company id="12007">
    Hasbro
   </company>
   , have proven to be among the company's most popular. Other licensed brands include
   <em>
    The Price is Right
   </em>
   ,
   <em>
    The Lord of the Rings
   </em>
   , and
   <em>
    The Wizard of Oz
   </em>
   . In 2011 it launched a
   <em>
    YAHTZEE
   </em>
   game.

  <p>
   In 2012, the company acquired Jadestone, a Sweden-based company that develops, publishes, and distributes online gaming content and entertainment for online gaming companies. The purchase will help augment WMS' content distribution capabilities for customers looking to expand their brand with online interactive offerings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also that year WMS acquired Phantom, an Iowa-based company that publishes and develops interactive casino and slot-based games for social, casual, and mobile gaming entertainment. The acquisition further expands the company's capabilities in online content development and distribution across the rapidly growing social, casual, and mobile channels.

  <p>
   WMS traces its roots to the Automatic Amusement Company, founded by Harry Williams in the 1930s. Williams produced his first game, called
   <i>
    Advance,
   </i>
   and soon followed it with industry innovations such as the tilt mechanism and, in 1933, electricity. In 1964 his company, Williams Electronics, was bought by jukebox maker Seeburg, which in turn was bought in the 1970s by Xcor, led by Chicago wheeler-dealer Louis Nicastro. Williams went public in 1974. After Seeburg went bankrupt in 1980, it spun off Williams, and Nicastro became CEO.
  </p>
  <p>
   Williams changed its name to WMS in 1987, and the next year it bought the amusement-game lines of rival Bally/Midway, enhancing its position as a world leader in arcade gaming. In 1990 WMS moved its headquarters from New York City to Chicago and diversified into hotel and casino management.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 WMS created a joint venture (Williams/Nintendo) to market games for Nintendo platforms and moved into the home video game market with the acquisition of Tradewest Inc. The following year it announced plans to divide into three publicly traded businesses -- hotels and casinos (WHG Resorts &amp; Casinos); arcade and video operations (
   <company id="52381">
    Midway Games
   </company>
   ); and casino gambling devices, lottery terminals, and pinball games (WMS Industries). In 1998 it spun off its 87% stake in Midway Games, which caused profits to take a hit. WMS's fiscal pain was eased somewhat by the successful debut of its
   <i>
    Monopoly
   </i>
   -themed slot machines in 1998. However, slumping pinball sales prompted the company to cease making pinball machines the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2000 the company announced the release of a series of machines based on popular board and word games such as
   <i>
    Scrabble, Pictionary,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Jumble.
   </i>
   Also that year its coin-operated video machines went the way of pinball machines when WMS discontinued their production. In 2001 president and COO Brian Gamache was named CEO. Nicastro stepped back to non-executive chairman. Also that year WMS began expanding outside North America, installing its Jackpot Party video slot machines in Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company overhauled its technology in 2002 to rectify defects in its gaming systems. That year it also launched three new game series (
   <i>
    Hollywood Squares, Survivor
   </i>
   , and
   <i>
    Pac-Man
   </i>
   ) and opened an office in Johannesburg, South Africa. In 2004 WMS launched new mechanical reel-spinning game devices, along with a new operating system and gaming platform, CPU-NXT.
  </p>
  <p>
   Continuing its international expansion, WMS acquired privately held Orion Gaming, a Netherlands-based manufacturer, in 2006 for approximately $30 million. Gamache became chairman in 2008. The company closed down the Netherlands facility in 2009, shifting production to other sites.   In 2010 it expanded in Australia, Mexico, and Singapore. The following year it launched Jackpotparty.com, a gaming casino website in the UK.
