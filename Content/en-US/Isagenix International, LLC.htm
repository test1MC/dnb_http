   A network marketing enterprise, Isagenix provides products and sales support services to an international network of associates, which in turn sell its products and recruit new associates. The company has successfully expanded its sales network over the years to include more than 500,000 home-based associates. Many of the company's associates are health care professionals who recommend Isagenix products to patients.

   Having a pipeline of new offerings to deliver to the growing anti-aging products market is key to the Isagenix's growth. Its Rejuvity Skincare System, for instance, helps people achieve restful sleep while supporting healthy brain function. In late 2015, the company introduced a new line of premium, organic slow-roasted coffee.

   The company opened the doors to a new state-of-the-art headquarters in the greater Phoenix area in early 2016. The 150,000-sq.-ft. facility includes an auditorium, development laboratories, a museum, and a cafeteria.

   Isagenix is also expanding geographically.
