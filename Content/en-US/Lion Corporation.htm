   Lion takes pride in its top ranking among Japanese toothpaste and toothbrush manufacturers. Brands include Clinica, Dentor, and Dent. Besides oral care products, the company makes and sells laundry detergent, bleach, cleaners, shampoo, deodorant, and beauty products in several Asian countries. Consumer products account for nearly 75% of sales, but Lion also operates food, chemical, and pharmaceutical divisions. The company has strengthened its competitiveness by introducing new products, such as a teeth-whitening toothpaste, medicated cleansing pads, and a men's deodorant. Its Lion Trading arm makes pet supplies. Lion, which was established in 1891, is looking beyond Japan for growth.

   While Japan is Tokyo-based Lion's main domain (representing more than 80% of sales), it also does business throughout Asia through subsidiaries and affiliates in South Korea, China, Thailand, and about a half a dozen other countries. The consumer products maker's global brands include TOP laundry detergent and Systema oral care products.

   Lion's Pharmaceutical Products arm makes analgesics, including its mainstay brand BUFFERIN A, as well as eye drops, and insecticides. The company's Industrial Products business makes and sells activators derived from oils and fats, electro-conductive carbon, detergents for industrial use, among other products.

  <p>
   Lion's sales increased 5% in 2013 versus 2012. A 30% uptick in international sales and 4% increase in industrial products, offset flat sales of consumer products at home. With the exception of fabric care products, which were flat, all of the company's consumer products categories (oral care, beauty care, living care, and pharmaceutical products) posted year over year declines. Sales of the company's Systems toothbrushes were strong in Thailand and China.

   Net income rose 44% over the same period.

  <p>
   Amid fierce price competition in the domestic toiletries industry, Lion is looking to high-value-added projects in its oral care, fabric care, and pharmaceutical products businesses to protect its margins and spur sales. The company is also engaging in aggressive marketing activity aimed at volume growth in functional food and other products and is working to expand its direct-to-consumer sales product business by introducing new hair care products targeted at mature women.
  </p>
  <p>
   To meet rising demand for its products throughout Asia, Lion is strengthening its production and supply systems beyond Japan. In 2012, it expanded its laundry detergent manufacturing facilities in Malaysia. In Thailand and China, during 2013-2014, Lion is scheduled to complete and begin production at a new plant for oral care products. Going forward, Lion's capital expenditures will be focused on Asia where it aims to claim the #1 spot in the oral care and laundry detergent markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lion is also entering new markets, including the Philippines. The company also has designs on Europe and the US market.
