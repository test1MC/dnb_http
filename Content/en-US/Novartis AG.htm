   Although it's based in neutral Switzerland, Novartis has been aggressive in attacking illnesses on multiple fronts, including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and consumer health. Its largest division, Pharmaceuticals, develops and manufactures prescription drugs for blood pressure, cancer, and other ailments. Subsidiary
   <company id="132760">
    Sandoz
   </company>
   produces generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Its
   <company id="89515">
    Alcon
   </company>
   division makes ophthalmic drugs, surgery systems, and contact lenses. Novartis has divested its vaccines and consumer health (Excedrin, Theraflu, and other products) divisions. Signaling the growing importance of its cancer operations, Novartis plans to separate its oncology and pharmaceuticals units.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The Pharmaceuticals division researches, develops, manufactures, distributes, and sells patented prescription medications in such categories as oncology, cardio-metabolic, immunology and dermatology, retina, respiratory, and neuroscience. In 2014 the division created a unit focusing on developing and commercializing cell and gene therapies. That year, the division accounted for more than 60% of total net sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis' blockbusters include high blood pressure treatment Diovan, leukemia drug Gleevec/Glivec, age-related macular degeneration drug Lucentis, and Zometa, an intravenous treatment for bone tumors caused by prostate, lung, and breast cancers. Other strong products include hormone balancing drug Sandostatin, Exelon for Alzheimer's disease, and Femara, which is used to treat postmenopausal women with early and advanced breast cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research has more than 6,000 scientists and physicians and focuses on discovering new drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's Sandoz and Alcon units each account for approximately 20% of sales. Sandoz is currently among the largest manufacturers of generic drugs in the world, while Alcon is a leader in cataract and vision correction surgical equipment.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Novartis has operations in 180 countries around the world, including sales, administrative, research, and manufacturing locations. The US is the company's largest geographic market, accounting for about one-third of revenues, followed by Japan, Germany, and France (each accounting for less than 10% of sales). Emerging markets represented 26% of net sales in 2014.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company utilizes more than 1,900 field representatives in the US and another 20,600 in the rest of the world; they sell its Pharmaceutical division's products to doctors, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance providers, and managed care organizations. In the US, some products are advertised on television and in print ads.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis' Alcon division serves physicians, distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, government agencies, and large retailers; its surgical products are sold directly to hospitals and surgical centers in the US, and through distributors in certain international markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sandoz sells its generics to wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals, and other health care outlets.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Novartis has seen fluctuating revenues over the past five years. Like most large drugmakers, it faces increasing pressure to keep its operations lean and develop new blockbusters in the face of patent expiration and rising levels of generic competition. Several of the company's former best sellers, including Famvir (antiviral), Lotrel (high blood pressure), and Trileptal (epilepsy treatment), are experiencing dwindling sales due to launches of generic versions in recent years. The company is especially hurting as top seller Diovan, which previously accounted for more than $6 billion in sales (or 20% of the firm's annual pharmaceutical revenues), lost patent protection in the US market in 2012 and in Europe in 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 revenue fell 9% to $53.6 billion as the Pharmaceuticals division declined; this was primarily as a result of the introduction of a generic version of Diovan in most markets, including the US, Europe, and Japan. The company's divestiture of its vaccines segment also led to decreased sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although revenue fell in 2014, net income rose 11% to $10.2 billion, largely due to sales of shares of LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme in Germany and its stake in
   <company id="105953">
    Idenix Pharmaceuticals
   </company>
   in the US. The higher net income led to an increase in cash flow from operations, which rose 5% to $13.9 billion.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   To ward off competitive pressures and support its prescription drug business, Novartis maintains a healthy drug pipeline with about 140 candidates in clinical development stages. Novartis relies upon a steady regimen of internal development, partnerships, and acquisitions to keep its pipeline up and running. R&amp;D programs are focused on core therapeutic areas including cardiology, metabolism, oncology, neurology, respiratory, ophthalmic, and infectious disease. The company is especially focused on increasing its development of biologic (protein and gene-based) drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also as part of its strategy to stay competitive, the company evaluates possible strategic acquisitions to expand its existing businesses, as well as possible divestitures, such as the recent sales of its consumer health and vaccine units. In early 2015 Novartis sold its animal health division to
   <company id="10509">
    Eli Lilly
   </company>
   for $5.4 billion. It also merged its over-the-counter business into a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health care business; it retained a 36.5% stake in the combined business.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though the Alcon and Sandoz units are smaller than the core pharmaceuticals business, Novartis maintains strong acquisition and internal research programs in those divisions as well. For instance, to further its goals in personalized medicine, Novartis is working to develop more sensitive molecular diagnostics that can be used to monitor patients and determine which medicines will most effectively treat their ailments. In 2014 Sandoz launched 28 new products in the US, including generic versions of Diovan, Focalin XR, and TOBI.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company also partners with other pharmaceutical firms to keep its portfolio robust. In 2014 it struck up a collaboration with
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   to evaluate three compounds related to Bristol-Myers Squibb's trial treatment for lung cancer. The following year, Novartis entered into a multi-year alliance with Aduro Biotech to discover and develop cancer immunotherapies. Further strengthening its immuno-oncology pipeline, Novartis then announced licensing agreements with Palobiofarma and
   <company id="15185">
    XOMA Corporation
   </company>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   After swapping its vaccine business in exchange for
   <company id="41781">
    GlaxoSmithKline
   </company>
   's (GSK's) oncology unit in 2015, Novartis has been increasingly focused on its cancer operations. In 2016 it announced a major restructuring: It plans to split its oncology and pharmaceutical businesses to create Novartis Oncology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The heads of the units will report directly to Novartis' CEO.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Mergers and Acquisitions.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In late 2016 Novartis bought Selexys Pharmaceuticals, a research lab specializing in sickle cell disease, in a deal valued at up to €665 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 the company purchased GSK's oncology unit. At the same time, it sold its vaccine business to GSK for about $7 billion and the two combined their consumer products. The deal brings Tafinlar and Mekinist, two recently approved skin cancer drugs, into the Novartis camp. Annual revenue will drop slightly but profits will rise as it picks up higher-margin products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Further boosting its oncology pipeline, Novartis agreed to buy Admune Therapeutics in 2015. Admune has a program in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis in 2014 acquired CoStim Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for $248 million. CoStim is a biotechnology firm focused on cancer immunotherapy; the acquisition adds its portfolio of late discovery stage immunotherapy programs including PD-1. Also that year, Alcon acquired WaveTec Vision, which developed the first commercialized intr-operative guidance system for cataract surgeries, for $350 million.

  <p>
   Johann Geigy began selling spices and natural dyes in Basel, Switzerland, in 1758. A century later the Geigy family began producing synthetic dyes. About that time Alexander Clavel also entered the synthetic dye trade in Basel, forming the Gesellschaft fur Chemische Industrie Basel (Ciba). Ciba was Switzerland's #1 chemical firm at century's end.
  </p>
  <p>
   After WWI, Ciba, Geigy, and Sandoz (a Basel synthetic dye maker founded in 1886) formed the Basel AG cartel to compete with German rival I.G. Farben. Basel used its profits to diversify into pharmaceuticals and other chemicals and to gain a foothold in the US. In 1929 Basel merged with its German and, later, French and British counterparts, but WWII shattered the so-called Quadrapartite Cartel in 1939, leaving only Basel AG intact.
  </p>
  <p>
   Basel scientist Paul Muller won a Nobel Prize in 1948 for inventing DDT. Basel AG voluntarily dissolved itself back into its component parts in 1951.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ciba, Geigy, and Sandoz continued to diversify. Finding new markets in agricultural chemicals, Geigy had passed Ciba in sales by 1967. That year Sandoz bought the Wander group of companies (dietetic products). Ciba and Geigy merged in 1970 and began a series of US acquisitions, including Funk Seeds in 1974. Sandoz bought Minneapolis-based Northrup, King &amp; Co. (1976) and Dutch seed company Zaadunie (1980).
  </p>
  <p>
   Ciba-Geigy and US biotech company
   <company id="12972">
    Chiron
   </company>
   started a joint venture in 1986 to produce and market genetically engineered vaccines (Ciba-Geigy acquired 50% of Chiron in 1994). Sandoz also bought shares in US biotechnology companies, including Genetic Therapy and SyStemix, in 1991. It bought Gerber (founded 1927) in 1994.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz rejoined to form Novartis in 1996. To win approval for the merger, Sandoz (whose Daniel Vasella became CEO of the new company) sold its corn herbicide and US animal health businesses. Novartis spun off its specialty chemicals unit in 1997 and bought Merck's insecticide and fungicide operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1998 the company merged its OTC health and nutrition businesses into a new consumer health division, and in the following year sold several units, including cracker maker Wasa, to focus the new division's operations. Chairman Alex Krauer, who had overseen the formation of Novartis, stepped down that year, leaving the post to Vasella.
  </p>
  <p>
   To boost its market share, CIBA Vision bought colored contact lens maker
   <company id="52789">
    Wesley Jessen VisionCare
   </company>
   in 2000. Novartis spun off its crop protection and seed units, merging them with AstraZeneca's Agrochemicals unit to create Syngenta.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis Ophthalmics split off from the CIBA Vision division to become a separate eye health care unit under the Pharmaceutical Division of Novartis in 2001. The firm's joint venture with
   <company id="42630">
    BioTransplant
   </company>
   successfully cloned genetically altered pigs whose organs would be more suitable for human transplants. Attempting to refine the company's focus on pharmaceuticals, Novartis made several acquisitions in 2002, including two animal vaccine companies, Grand Laboratories and Immtech Biologies, and generic manufacturer Lek Pharmaceuticals, while divesting its food and beverage division to
   <company id="90033">
    Associated British Foods
   </company>
   . The remaining assets, including sports nutrition, health, and weight loss products, were grouped under the Nutrition &amp; Santé banner and were sold to management in 2004.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis engineered one of the largest deals in European pharma in 2004, when it acquired the rights to a prospective inhaled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment from UK drug concerns
   <company id="135831">
    Arakis
   </company>
   and Vectura Group.
  </p>
  <p>
   Novartis' consumer health business got a Boost, literally, when it purchased
   <company id="104556">
    Mead Johnson's
   </company>
   adult nutrition business in 2004. The buy included brands such as Boost nutritional drinks, and feeding tube products Isocal and Ultracal. In a move to further bolster its consumer offerings, that same year the company purchased the US and Canadian consumer products division of
   <company id="10232">
    Bristol-Myers Squibb
   </company>
   , which brought headache remedy Excedrin, cold and flu treatment Comtrex, and Keri moisturizers into the company's consumer products stable.
  </p>
  <p>
   To bulk up Sandoz (which had refocused strictly on generic pharmaceuticals over the years), in 2004 Novartis bought a Canadian maker of generic injectable drugs and a Danish generics maker to increase market share in key regional markets. In 2005 the firm acquired Hexal AG, one of Germany's top generics makers, and a controlling stake in Hexal's sister firm
   <company id="105868">
    Eon Labs
   </company>
   , a US generics manufacturer.
  </p>
  <p>
   The constant appetite of its drug pipeline was briefly sated in mid-2006 when Novartis acquired
   <company id="133405">
    NeuTec Pharma
   </company>
   , a UK-based biopharmaceutical company with two drug candidates that target otherwise drug-resistant "superbugs." That year Novartis spent $5.1 billion to acquire struggling vaccine and biopharmaceuticals products maker
   <company id="12972">
    Chiron
   </company>
   , despite Chiron's board rebuffing an earlier offer. Novartis then created a Vaccine and Diagnostics division composed of its existing vaccine operations, and Chiron's diagnostics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Putting its focus entirely on health care, Novartis sold off the last of its non-health care businesses in 2007, when
   <company id="41815">
    Nestlé
   </company>
   purchased Novartis' medical nutrition business for $2.5 billion and its
   <company id="113369">
    Gerber
   </company>
   baby products business for $5.5 billion. Also in 2007 Novartis formed a new unit to focus on biologic drug development, which already made up 25% of its preclinical research pipeline.
