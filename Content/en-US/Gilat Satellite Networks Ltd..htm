   Gilat might have its head in the stars, but its business is grounded. The company provides satellite communication products and services based on very small aperture terminal (VSAT) technology. Communications service providers use VSAT systems made by its Gilat Network Systems (GNS) unit to enable their voice, data, and video services. Gilat's
   <company id="124876">
    Spacenet
   </company>
   subsidiary provides satellite and terrestrial network access to large commercial clients for Web-based applications, while its Connexstar unit focuses on connections that enable electronic transactions and other back office functions for utilities companies, telecom carriers, and governments. Residential Internet subscribers are served by Gilat's StarBand service.

  <p>
   A group of engineers who met while serving in the Israel Defense Forces founded Gilat Satellite Networks in 1987 to address the low end of the satellite communications market. The company's first product, shipped in 1989, was called the OneWay VSAT (very small aperture terminal) satellite system. The system, which was sold to paging service operators in the UK and stock exchanges in China, linked remote terminals and dishes to a central hub through a geostationary satellite.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also in 1989 General Electric (GE) agreed to develop VSAT technology with Gilat. Two years later, in the midst of the Persian Gulf War and after brutal negotiations, Gilat persuaded GE that it could reliably manufacture the new systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another break came after Yoel Gat, Gilat's president, tried to convince the CEO of drugstore chain Rite Aid to buy the company's new TwoWay VSAT technology. Impressed by Gat's tireless pitch, Rite Aid became Gilat's first major customer in the US when the drugstore chain agreed in 1992 to install TwoWay VSAT at 3,000 locations. Gilat sales broke $5 million that year. Global lottery operator GTECH also adopted the company's technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company went public in 1993. Also that year Gilat began offering satellite telephony products (DialAway and FaraWay) for use in rural areas and in regions with limited telecommunications infrastructure such as China and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1994 Gat became CEO and Gilat added US supermarket chain Winn-Dixie as a customer. The next year the company and Spacenet, GE's satellite access and integration services subsidiary, agreed to provide VSAT systems to car dealerships in Europe. Gilat also opened offices in China, France, Thailand, and the US. By 1996 Gilat was #2 in the two-way VSAT market (behind Hughes Network Systems) with sales reaching $75 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gilat picked up clients including Motorola and AT&amp;T in 1997 when it acquired US-based VSAT paging and data broadcast specialist Skydata. The buy also gave Gilat an inroad to Latin America. Gilat added services when it acquired Spacenet from GE in late 1998. The deal contributed to a loss for the year and gave GE a 30% stake in Gilat. The next year Spacenet signed deals with AccentHealth and PeopleSoft.
  </p>
  <p>
   In early 2000 Gilat and Microsoft formed satellite-based Internet service provider Gilat-to-Home in the US. Later that year Gilat-to-Home changed its name to StarBand Communications, picked up an investment from
   <company id="44500">
    EchoStar
   </company>
   (the #2 direct satellite broadcaster in the US), and went public. Also in 2000 Gilat acquired US-based network management and security software developer Deterministic Networks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gilat in 2001 cut about 20% of its workforce in response to falling profits. The next year, StarBand filed for Chapter 11. The ISP continues to operate but, as part of the bankruptcy restructuring, EchoStar agreed to give up its 30% stake in the venture.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the first half of 2003, two of Gilat's founders, its president and CEO, resigned. The exodus continued as the year progressed and other top executives jumped ship.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later that year, Gilat's
   <company id="102515">
    StarBand
   </company>
   business emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Gilat then began to combine the operations of StarBand with those of its Spacenet subsidiary.
