   Comtex Scientific was founded in 1980 as Academic Micropublishing, a company that planned to provide news clippings and publish electronic versions of scientific research papers. It went public the next year and changed its name to Comtex Scientific. By the mid-1980s Comtex was developing an online news distribution system. Investment firm Biotech Capital, the owner of the foundering
   <company id="47948">
    UPI
   </company>
   and of Financial News Network (FNN), made a significant investment in Comtex in 1986. Biotech changed its name to Infotechnology in 1987, but scandals involving its chairman, Earl Brian, erupted at the turn of the decade, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite its parent's troubles, Comtex continued to develop its online offerings under CEO Scott Dinsdale (who founded Data Broadcasting Corporation, later called
   <company id="42114">
    Interactive Data Corporation
   </company>
   ), and was delivering 15 newswires to
   <company id="43062">
    CompuServe
   </company>
   ,
   <company id="40671">
    Bloomberg
   </company>
   , and corporate clients like
   <company id="10103">
    AT&amp;T
   </company>
   and
   <company id="10796">
    IBM
   </company>
   . Eventually C. W. Gilluly took over Infotechnology (which later became AMASYS Corporation) and was named CEO of Comtex in 1992. In 1997 it added Japan's Kyodo News Service to its news provider roster, and Charles Terry was named CEO (he had become president in 1994).

   Comtex Scientific began providing newswire feeds to The Gale Group (now
   <company id="126150">
    Cengage Gale
   </company>
   ), PointCast,
   <company id="71408">
    The Motley Fool
   </company>
   , and others in 1998. Also that year the company agreed to distribute content from three
   <company id="44274">
    Associated Press
   </company>
   newswires: AP Online, WorldStream, and The Canadian Press. Comtex entered Africa in 1999 with an agreement to provide content to Metropolis, an operator of business-oriented vertical communities. It also signed an agreement with ON24 to distribute streaming audio and video feeds to its customers.

   In late 1999 the company changed its name to Comtex News Network. Comtex launched new Web application products News Solutions and Newsroom Direct the following year. Through an agreement with Europa Press News Agency, the company expanded its real-time Spanish content in 2002.

   The following year Stephen W. Ellis replaced Gilluly as chairman and CEO Charles Terry was replaced by Raymond Capece. However, Capece resigned several months later. Gilluly added back the chairman's title and also took on the role of interim CEO in 2004. Chip Brian was named permanent CEO in 2006.
