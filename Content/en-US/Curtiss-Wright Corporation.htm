   Curtiss-Wright makes a variety of flow control, metal treatment, and motion control products. Its Commercial/Industrial segment provides ducts and services supporting critical applications across the aerospace, automotive, and general industrial markets. The Defense segment provides embedded computing board level modules, integrated subsystems, turret aiming, and weapons handling systems to defense markets. The Power segment manufactures and services main coolant pumps, power-dense compact motors, generators, and secondary propulsion systems.
  </p>

  <p>
   Curtiss-Wright's operations are divided into three main segments: Commercial/Industrial (54% of net sales), Power (25%), and Defense (22%).
  </p>
  <p>
   Products made by Commercial/Industrial include electronic throttle control devices, transmission shifters, electro-mechanical actuation control components, and pressure relief management systems, while Defense makes computing board level modules, turret aiming and stabilization products, and weapons handling systems. The Power segment makes a wide range of hardware, pumps, pressure vessels, fastening systems, specialized containment doors, airlock hatches, spent fuel management products, and fluid sealing technologies for nuclear power plants and nuclear equipment manufacturers.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Curtiss-Wright's principal manufacturing facilities are located in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and internationally in Canada and the UK. The US accounts for almost 70% of its net sales.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The US government generates about 35% of the company's revenues each year. The company distributed its products through commercial sales and marketing channels.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Financial Performance.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Curtiss-Wright's revenues declined 2% from $2.24 billion in 2014 to $2.21 billion in 2015. The decline was fueled by lower sales from the Commercial/Industrial segment, partially offset by a spike in sales from its Power segment.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the general industrial market, lower valve sales serving the energy markets in 2015 were driven by the decline in the price of crude oil. Additionally, lower sales of its surface technologies services impacted the general industrial market, power generation market, and the commercial aerospace market.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's profits have fluctuated over the years; after declining in 2014, profits surged by 28% to peak at a record-setting $145 million in 2015. The surge was driven by a decreased loss on sale of businesses and decreased general and administrative expenses. In addition, after steadily rising for years, the company's cash flow from operations decreased by $169 million from 2014 to 2015.

  <p>
   The company's strategy includes developing new core products, such as electronic and sensor technologies for the embedded computing and electronic systems markets. One prime customer, the
   <company id="105717">
    US Department of Defense
   </company>
   , is working with a reduced budget, but Curtiss-Wright is confident about further business from the department as it continues to focus on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and communications. The
   <company id="150763">
    US Navy
   </company>
   in particular is continuing funding for programs served by Curtiss-Wright, such as Virginia class submarines, the DDG 51 class destroyer, and the Ohio Class SSBN submarine replacement program.
  </p>
  <p>
   Curtiss-Wright is also using divestitures to focus on its core operations. Throughout 2014, it sold its Benshaw business (within its Defense segment) to
   <company id="12280">
    Regal-Beloit
   </company>
   for almost $50 million. It also sold its 3D Rader, Vessels, and Upstream operations throughout the year.

  <p>
   Curtiss-Wright has been busy fortifying its segments and extending its customer base overseas through acquisitions. In 2015, it bought Bolt's Metallizing for $13 million. Bolt's Metallizing is a provider of thermal spray coatings for aerospace applications, including high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and plasma spray coating capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Curtiss-Wright boosted its commercial/industrial operations through the purchase of Component Coating and Repair Services Limited, a UK provider of ultra-smooth and corrosion resistant coatings and precision airfoil repair services for aerospace and industrial turbine applications, for $25 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Later in 2014, the company fortified its energy segment with the $8 million purchase of Nuclear Power Services, a supplier of products and services to the Canadian nuclear market. In early 2013 Curtiss-Wright picked up Ph√∂nix Holding GmbH, a designer and manufacturer of valves, valve systems, and related support services to the chemical, petrochemical, and power (both conventional and nuclear) markets, for $106 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Only a few months earlier, the company purchased
   <company id="46394">
    Williams Controls
   </company>
   , a maker of electronic throttle controls for commercial trucks, buses, and RVs, for $119 million. Williams Controls was later integrated with Curtiss-Wright's controls segment. The company previously added to this segment in late 2012 through the $135 million purchase of Cimarron Energy, a provider of energy production and processing equipment serving the US shale oil and gas market.
