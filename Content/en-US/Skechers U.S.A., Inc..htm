   Skechers' top executive Robert Greenberg knows how to land on his feet. The founder of 1980s icon
   <company id="10871">
    L.A. Gear
   </company>
   heads Skechers USA, which designs and sells more than 3,000 styles of lifestyle and athletic footwear, including oxfords, boots, sandals, sneakers, training shoes, and semi-dressy shoes. It caters to men, women, and children. In addition to its namesake products, the company offers fashion and street-focused footwear under the

   , Zoo York, and Mark Nason brands. Its shoes are sold through department and specialty stores in more than 160 countries, as well as some 390 company-owned concept and outlet stores and its website. Sketchers footwear is manufactured primarily by Chinese contractors.

   Skechers operates three business segments. Its Domestic Wholesale division, which made up nearly 40% of the company's total sales during 2015, distributes footwear through several channels, primarily via department stores and specialty stores, but also athletic specialty shoe stores, independent retailers, catalogs, and Internet retailers.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company's International Wholesale segment (35% of sales) generates business overseas in three ways: direct sales to department stores and specialty retail stores through subsidiaries and joint ventures, sales to foreign distributors of Skechers footwear to department stores and specialty retail stores, and royalties from licensees who make and distribute non-footwear items outside the US.
  </p>
        <p>
   Skechers also operates a Retail Stores segment (25% of sales) that comprises the brand's e-commerce site, a portfolio of almost 120 owned an operated concept stores, more than 150 factory outlet stores, and almost 120 warehouse outlets in the US. The company also has more than 80 concept stores, 40-plus factory outlet stores, and five factory warehouse outlet stores, operating globally. Skechers' fourth segment is its e-commerce operation, which generates the remainder of revenue.
  </p>
        <p>
   Through a global distribution network, Skechers sells its products through some 1,400 Skechers stores worldwide. The company has joint ventures to generate sales in India, including a 51% interest in Skechers South Asia Private Limited and a 49% stake in Skechers Retail India Private Limited.

   Skechers sells its shoes in more than 160 countries. About 60% of its total sales came from business in the US during 2015, while another 3% came from Canada. Skechers' International Wholesale unit serves Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Japan, the Benelux region, the UK, Brazil, Chile, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.

   Beyond its own stores, the company sells its brands through department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, boutiques, and internet retailers.

   Skechers promotes its brand through print, television, and outdoor campaigns targeted at both adults and children. Advertising activities include marathons and activity events for Skechers Performance division; animated kids' television campaigns featuring its own action heroes; donation events featuring its BOBS charitable footwear program; print, television, outdoor, and online campaigns that highlighted endorsees of Skechers Performance and Skechers lifestyle brands; and social media, visual merchandising, trade shows, and online product marketing efforts.

   The shoe maker has been ramping up its advertising spend in recent years, spending $188.1 million on advertising in 2015, up from $141.7 million and $118.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

        <p>
   Skechers' annual sales have nearly doubled since 2011 thanks to aggressive store expansion and higher demand stemming from a stronger US and global economy. Its profits have soared back from 2011 losses as well as it's kept a lid on operating costs.
  </p>
        <p>
   The shoe maker's sales jumped 32% to a record $3.1 billion during 2015. While all segments grew over the year, the company's Women's and Men's Go, Women's Active, Women's Sport, and Men's USA lines -- especially from its International Wholesale segment -- led the charge for sales growth. Also helping its top line, the company enjoyed higher average selling prices in its domestic market thanks to a strengthening economy, and higher prices overseas in Australia and New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE.
  </p>
        <p>
   Strong revenue growth in 2015 drove Skechers' net income up 67% to $232 million. The company's operating cash levels climbed 42% to $232 million for the year as its cash-based earnings rose.

        <p>
   Skechers continues to aggressively expand its retail store base to boost sales. In 2016, Skechers accelerated its plans to open 55 to 65 new stores during the year, up from the 20-new-store-openings goal it had established years ago. In 2015, the shoe maker opened more than 50 new stores, including 19 domestic warehouse outlet stores, and 16 international concept stores.
  </p>
        <p>
   The company is looking to grow its international business, particularly in Central Eastern Europe and Latin America. During 2015, Skechers set a goal to double its Central Eastern Europe (CEE) sales over the next three to five years, after transitioning its business away from its third-party distributors and moving it toward its newly-established, wholly-owned subsidiary, Skechers CEE kft. That year it did the same in Latin America in softening third-party distribution support and instead focusing on building its Skechers Latin America LLC subsidiary and targeting the four key markets of Peru, Panama, Colombia, and Costa Rica. In addition to growing business organically overseas, the footwear firm is leveraging its joint ventures in Asia, developing its businesses in Brazil and Chile, and boosting its presence in India and Mexico, as well as existing markets.
  </p>
        <p>
   Catering to its core customer, Skechers consistently peddles its products to style-conscious 12- to 24-year-olds with footwear that boasts playful colors and materials. Since its inception, the firm has extended its reach to younger and older audiences from 5 to 40 years old to give its products portfolio more traction and its brand a heightened awareness. Skechers steers clear of competing alongside high-dollar, technical performance footwear makers, such as
   <company id="14254">
    NIKE
   </company>
   and
   <company id="92632">
    adidas
   </company>
   , as its footwear is not targeted to hard-core athletes. To protect its brand, in 2014 Skechers filed suit against California-based retailer DB Shoe Company, LLC and
   <company id="47983">
    Fila U.S.A. Inc.
   </company>
   for allegedly selling footwear that infringes on its popular SKECHERS GO WALK footwear line.
