   A leading maker of cabin components for commercial, business jets and military aircraft, B/E Aerospace makes aircraft seats, coffeemakers, lighting, refrigeration equipment, galley structures, and emergency oxygen systems. B/E aftermarket operations represent about 40% of its revenue. Operating through two business segments (commercial aircraft, and business jet), B/E sells its products to most major airlines and aviation OEMs. The company also provides oil field equipment and services. In late 2016, B/E Aerospace agreed to be acquired by rival
   <company id="103693">
    Rockwell Collins
   </company>
   in a transaction valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt.

   B/E Aerospace has agreed to be acquired by rival
   <company id="103693">
    Rockwell Collins
   </company>
   in a deal valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. The combination will expand the range of products that Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and will extend its customer base internationally. Both companies should benefit from the deal in that both have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting, and other related systems.

  <p>
   B/E's commercial aircraft segment, which generates about 75% of net sales, offers seating products, interior systems, and engineering services for narrow and wide body aircraft. B/E makes aircraft seating for first and premium (including lie-flat seat beds) and economy classes; it also makes spares and replacement parts for aircraft seats. It offers galley equipment, including water boilers, liquid containers, and ovens.
  </p>
  <p>
   The segment also provides a wide array of interior system components, including LED cabin lighting, its branded Pulse Oxygen passenger oxygen system, and lower maintenance wastewater systems. In addition, B/E provides engineering, design, integration, installation, and certification services for commercial aircraft passenger cabin interiors, which allows installation of telecommunications and entertainment equipment, galley relocation, lavatories, overhead bins, and crew rest compartments.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   The company has 25 principal operating facilities located primarily in the US and throughout Europe. It generates 35% of its net sales in the US. Other major markets include the Asia-Pacific/Emerging Markets regions (40%) and Europe (25%).
  </p>

  <p>
   The company's commercial aircraft and business jet segments have a broad range of over 350 principal customers, including all of the world's major airlines, commercial aircraft, and business jet manufacturers. Approximately 64% of its total revenues were derived from airlines, aircraft leasing companies, maintenance, and repair and overhaul providers (MROs) in 2015.
   <company id="10221">
    Boeing
   </company>
   alone accounted for 10% of its consolidated revenues.

  <p>
   After its revenues plummeted to $2.6 billion in 2014, B/E saw its revenues climb 5% to $2.73 billion in 2015. Commercial aircraft segment sales spiked in 2015 as a result of higher volumes of buyer furnished equipment, including aftermarket products sold directly to its airline and leasing customers. The company was also helped by additional business jet segment revenue.
  </p>
  <p>
   B/E's profits skyrocketed by more than 170% from $104 million in 2014 to $286 million in 2015 mainly due to a major decrease in debt repayment costs. Its operating cash flow jumped from $251 million in 2014 to $311 million in 2015.

  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Strategy.flsnp" />
  <p>
   In a major reorganization, in late 2014 B/E's consumables management segment was spun off to subsidiary KLX Inc. The company made the move in order to focus solely on its commercial aircraft and business jet segments.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key to B/E's aircraft manufacturing strategy is its aftermarket revenue. The company exploits its large customer base for that purpose as airlines are more likely to enlist the original supplier for spare parts and retrofit and refurbishment programs.

  <p>
   Acquisitions play an important role in B/E's growth as it continues to push into the energy services market. The company in 2014 acquired the assets of the Marcellus group of companies (MGS), engaged in manufacturing and rental of equipment in the Marcellus/Utica shales, for $45 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 it also purchased LT Energy Services, an Eagle Ford basin provider of rental equipment, for a net purchase price of $103 million. A few months earlier, it acquired the assets of Wildcat Wireline, a provider of wireline services primarily in the Eagle Ford basin, and also in the Marcellus/Utica basin, for a net purchase price of approximately $153 million.
