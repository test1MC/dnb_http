   GS Yuasa gets a charge out of being one of the world's largest manufacturers of storage batteries, power supply systems, lighting equipment, and specialty other electrical equipment. Products include batteries for the automotive (car and motorcycle), industrial (motive and industrial power), and consumer (notebook computer, wireless phone) markets. The company is moving away from traditional automotive batteries in favor of fuel cells, power supplies, land rectifiers. GS Yuasa is also focused on selling its rechargeable lithium batteries for vehicles. The global manufacturer boasts more than 65 subsidiaries and 30-plus affiliates.

   Japan accounts for 52% of its net sales. Other major markets include Asia (27%), Europe and the US (collectively, 14%), and other regions (7%).

  <p>
   As demand for electric vehicles rises, GS Yuasa is experiencing significant growth from its growing lithium battery business. Revenues grew 27% from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to a 207% surge in sales of lithium-ion batteries for plug-in hybrid and hybrid passenger vehicles. Overseas operations also climbed 37% due to the converting of Thai equity-method affiliates into consolidated subsidiaries and the favorable impact of exchange rates.

  <p>
   To meet growing demand for electric vehicles, GS Yuasa is expanding sales of vehicle mounted lithium-ion batteries while putting priority on the development of new applications for industrial lithium-ion batteries. It has also improved its position in the global market, especially in Asia, through the establishment of GS Yuasa Technical Center Ltd. in Thailand to accelerate new product development and strengthen its technical support capabilities in the region.
