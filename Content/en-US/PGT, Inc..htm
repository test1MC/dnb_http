   Florida-based PGT rings up more than 95% of its sales in storm-prone areas of the US. Indeed, Florida is the company's largest market, representing the majority of its sales. Other markets include the southeastern, Gulf Coast, and coastal Mid-Atlantic regions of the US, as well as the Caribbean, Central America, and Canada.

  <p>
   The company distributes its  products through multiple channels, including about 1,200 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers, and enclosure contractors. The residential new construction and home repair and remodeling end markets, represented about 41% and 59% of its sales, respectively, during 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   PGT markets its products through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. It markets its products based on quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery utilizing its fleet of trucks and trailers.

  <p>
   PGT has achieved unprecedented growth over the years, with revenues peaking at a record-setting $390 million in 2015. The historic growth was due to a spike in the sale of impact-resistant window and door products in addition to non-impact window and door products. These product lines were helped by additional sales of WinGuard and Storefront products, coupled with additional sales from a previous acquisition.
  </p>
  <p>
   Net income surged by 44% to reach $24 million in 2015 mainly due to the steep rise in sales and profits to improvement in the housing market (both new home construction and remodels) and aggressive marketing of its WinGuard product line. Cash flow from operations has risen along with sales and profits, jumping 46% during 2015.

  <p>
   PGT is focused on its core market -- Florida -- where it's looking to gain market share through promotional activities. The company also has programs and partnerships with national accounts to increase sales. The firm is focused on growing in both the new construction and remodeling markets.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2015 it launched Vinyl WinGuard and EnergyVue, its new line of vinyl impact-resistant and non-impact energy saving windows. The company intends for the product line to replace various existing lines of vinyl impact-resistant and energy saving windows.
  </p>
  <p>
   PGT's prospects for growth rely in part on demand during adverse weather conditions and also on the enforcement of building codes that mandate the use of impact-resistant windows and doors. The company began to pioneer such products in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

  <p>
   In 2016 PGT purchased WinDoor, a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums, hotels, and custom residential homes. The deal increased its penetration into the commercial and high-end fenestration markets and added a line of thermally-broken products and new sliding and swing door product lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   In September 2014, PGT acquired CGI Windows &amp; Doors Holdings of Miami, a local rival, for $111 million. With $45 million in annual sales, CGI will continue manufacturing and selling its own brand of storm-resistant products and operate as a subsidiary of PGT. The purchase of CGI, which was the company's first major acquisition, strengthens PGT's product line and should help it compete against national suppliers. CGI is expected to add to earnings in 2015.
