   @K2M wants to help even those with spinal injuries climb any mountain. It makes lines of products for spinal surgery to correct deformities, remove tumors, and treat trauma as well as, to a lesser degree, for spinal fusions and minimally invasive procedures. Core products include screws, rods, plates, and other implants that use its proprietary MESA technology, which makes it easier for surgeons to insert devices without torsional force on the spine. Other K2M offerings include retractors, locks, and other instruments along with single-use items like sponges, putty, bone graft systems, and bone fillers. The company was formed in 2010 and went public in 2014.
  </p><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 IPO.flsnp" />
  <p>
   K2M earned $132.4 million in its IPO. It's using those proceeds to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes, including expanding its distribution network and moving to a new headquarters.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Operations.flsnp" />
  <p>
   K2M divides its business into degenerative (spinal fusions), complex spine (deformities, trauma, tumors), and minimally invasive. Though degenerative accounts for about 42% of revenue, the company is focusing on complex spinal surgery due to easier insurance approval and higher profits.
  </p>
  <p>
   K2M's implants, instruments, and disposables are produced by third-party manufacturers located mainly in the US. Its MESA products, which are low-profile screws used mostly to correct deformities, account for more than a third of revenue. Other key brands include Rail 4D rods, Deformity Cricket instruments, SERENGETI and RAVINE retractors, EVEREST screws, and tifix locks.

  <p>
   In addition to its home country of the US, the company sells its products in 28 other countries. International sales account for about 30% of revenue.

  <p>
   K2M employs its own large sales force in the US and select international markets including the UK, Austria, Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland. It relies on independent sales agencies and distributors in the rest of the world. It generally sells directly to hospitals where spine surgeons practices.

  <p>
   In 2013 K2M's revenue increased about 12% in the US and 30% overseas. New customers led growth in the US, offsetting a slight decrease in revenue from existing customers, while increased product usage by existing customers drove the growth in internationally sales. The company's net loss widened to $37.9 million as cost of revenue and operating expenses outstripped the modest revenue gains. Cash continued to flow out rather than in as K2M spent more on inventory and sales activities in the support of anticipated future sales.

  <p>
   To become profitable and remain there, K2M needs to continue its product R&amp;D and work on expanding its global distribution and sales operations. It has also said it would consider strategic purchases to expand its product line.

  <p>
   K2 is actually the name of the world's second highest mountain peak and the one with the second highest fatality-to-summit ratio. Most of K2M's are named for exotic or risky locales including Santorini, Caspian, Aleutian, Serengeti, Denali, and Everest.
