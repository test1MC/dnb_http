   Printpack caters to both consumer goods and industrial manufacturers demanding attractive, functional, less expensive packaging. It offers thermoformed structures to stand-up pouches, extruded films to nine-color rotogravure printing, and myriad wraps. The diversity of Printpack products and end uses mitigates the economic ups and downs associated with serving a limited market. The company also defines itself as an eco-leader in its industry.

   Like most companies in its field, Printpack grows by augmenting its manufacturing capacity. In early 2016, it announced it is spending more than $25 million to expand its rigid packaging operations in Newport News, Virginia. Along with the expansion, Printpack stated it is undertaking a recapitalization program at other facilities to expand its manufacturing capabilities by adding more advanced technology and equipment that will improve its graphics.
