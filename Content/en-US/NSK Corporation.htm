  <p>
   The company has become one of the world's leading bearing manufacturers. It has fostered a network of authorized distributors who work in tandem with NSK sales and engineering teams. The company has strategically located its distribution centers in the US to be in proximity to OEMs and industrial distribution markets, in order to meet customers' needs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Expanding its North American operations, in 2014 NSK Corporation opened a plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, to produce high-quality bearings for automakers and automotive parts manufacturers.

  <p>
   The company announced in early 2009 its bearing reconditioning program, which was borne out of the recessionary economy. Since bearings are used in just about every manufacturing and industrial application, expensive replacement can be circumvented, at least for a time, by utilizing NSK Corporation's reconditioning program. Bearing damage can occur because of the wrong lubrication, misalignment, excessive heat and vibration, and improper installation.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Think NSK" is the tagline for the new brand campaign NSK Corporation launched in October 2008. The campaign is designed to get consumers to connect with the product and the company, thus enlightening them to NSK's attributes in the motion control industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   NSK Corporation was formed in 1997 after NSK Ltd. acquired Hoover Ball and Bearing.
