   In 2013 Casio America, along with its parent company, launched a new digital signage business. Operating as Casio Signage, the unit aims to help retailers better compete within the aggressive retail industry by leveraging the signs to attract new and repeat customers. It's primarily focused on revolutionizing storefront advertising. To do so, it's offering storefront advertising tools and cloud services (to distribute digital coupons). The tools have the ability to produce realistic-looking characters that talk to customers passing by. It offers multilingual support and multifunctional options as part of its fully customizable system.

   Casio employs a strategy of frequently updating and launching offshoots of its popular watches and other consumer products to spur sales. To that end, in late 2012 the company created a limited edition EDIFICE men's watch -- the EQSA500RB-1A -- through a collaboration with Red Bull Racing. Casio also relaunched the Deco-G. The crystal-encrusted timepiece sells for about $200 and is available exclusively a

   . It's much more affordable than the original diamond-encrusted model launched in 2009. In 2011 the company rolled out a new PRIZM graphing calculator with a high-resolution color LCD display that creates pictures of graphs for math students.
