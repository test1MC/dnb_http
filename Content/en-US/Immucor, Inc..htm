   Immucor makes sure you can feel safe about getting a blood transfusion. The company develops, makes, and sells manual and automated analysis equipment used by blood banks, hospitals, and clinical laboratories to test blood prior to transfusions. Its traditional reagents are used to manually test samples for blood type, group matching, and foreign substance detection, while its Galileo, Galileo Echo, and Galileo NEO automated instrumentation systems use traditional and proprietary Capture reagents to perform multiple blood tests at one time. The company sells its products primarily in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. Founded in 1982, Immucor is owned by
   <company id="51545">
    TPG Capital
   </company>
   .

  <p>
   Immucor operates through two segments. Its larger segment, Transfusion, accounted for 85% of total revenue in 2014. The smaller Transplant &amp; Molecular segment accounted for the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firm's portfolio of molecular and antibody-based assays use ELISA and xMAP technology to evaluate compatibility between donors and recipients.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Geographic Reach.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Some two-thirds of Immucor's sales to unaffiliated customers originate in the US. Europe is the company's second largest market, accounting for about 20% of sales, with other countries, including Canada, representing the rest. Immucor has manufacturing and distribution facilities in the US, Canada, and Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
   The company's major international markets include the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), the Asia/Pacific region, and Mexico.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/XML text end.flsnp" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Master/Editorial/H2 Sales and Marketing.flsnp" />
  <p>
   Immucor's customers include blood donation centers, hospitals, and laboratories. The company distributes its products worldwide through direct affiliate offices and third-party distribution arrangements. In addition, Immucor offers several instrument procurement options, including direct sales and rentals. It has direct representation in the US, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, and the UK.
  </p>

  <p>
   Immucor's revenue has been growing for the past few years. It increased 12% to $388 million in fiscal 2014 (ended May), primarily on growth in the Transplant &amp; Molecular segment, which saw added sales from its newly acquired products from the LIFECODE distribution business. Transfusion revenues slipped that year on lower sales.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the overall growth in revenue, Immucor has seen declining net income since 2012. Net loss increased 365% to $182 million in 2014 due to increase in impairment losses on goodwill. At the end of fiscal 2014, the company's accumulated deficit was $271 million.
  </p>
  <p>
   Cash flow from operations rose 4% to $26 million on factors such as changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
  </p>

  <p>
   Immucor's strategy is to drive automation in the blood banking industry, through product innovations, international growth, and further development of its molecular diagnostics platform. (Molecular immunohematology is a developing field and the company believes its platform will become an increasingly strategic asset over time.) In 2014 the FDA approved Immucor's PreciseType HEA test, making it the first FDA-approved molecular immunohematology product on the market. The test provides clinicians and blood banks with detailed genetic matching information to reduce the risk of problems in blood transfusions.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the company still receives nearly 60% of its revenues from traditional reagent sales, it is focused on growth in its instrumentation and Capture reagent segments -- a strategy that has allowed Immucor to steadily increase its revenues and profits in recent years. Its Capture Workstation is a semi-automated instrumentation system marketed to smaller laboratories. Immucor believes that the automation of blood testing functions will improve blood bank and laboratory efficiencies, as well as patient safety. The company also seeks to establish a strong customer base and recurring revenues by installing its equipment and then supplying compatible reagents through long-term contracts.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2014 Immucor entered into a collaborative arrangement with Sirona Genomics for the commercialization of Sirona's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing sample preparation; the deal also gives Immucor an exclusive option to buy Sirona.
  </p>
  <p>
   To become more competitive, Immucor has consolidated its distribution operations and standardized its pricing mechanisms. The company uses direct distribution methods in its core markets of the US, Canada, Japan, and Western Europe, and it is also looking to broaden its internal sales organization.

  <p>
   In 2013 the company expanded its specialty diagnostic capabilities when it acquired transplantation diagnostics company LIFECODES from
   <company id="13907">
    Hologic
   </company>
   ; it also bought LIFECODE's product distribution business in the UK, Italy, and India.
  </p>
  <p>
   Immucor followed that purchase up with a complementary deal in 2014, when it bought Organ-i, which develops non-invasive tests to monitor and predict organ health for transplant recipients. Also that year, Immucor acquired Sentilus, which is focused on developing Femtoarrays for use in a variety of in vitro diagnostics areas.
